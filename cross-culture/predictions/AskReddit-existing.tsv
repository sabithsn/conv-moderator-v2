This is why Catholics believe in purgatory and Eastern Christians usually believe in some middle-ground for the deceased between Heaven and Hell. It's also why they believe that both faith *and* good works are necessary.   If someone died without ever having the opportunity to convert to Christianity, they wouldn't be damned because both Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe that one can't accidentally or unknowingly be evil enough to be damned. *However*, they also believe that all humans are capable of some degree of evil and whether they're Christian or not, they'll hurt others in their life.   Purgatory is where one's soul is purified and the, "wages" of their sin are paid. They believe that even the souls of believers will spend time in purgatory before Heaven and living a Christian life is merely the process of purifying oneself on Earth before you die. Catholics also believe in indulgences (not paying for them anymore though) as a means of helping the souls in purgatory get out sooner.   In a more practical sense, Christianity isn't just about getting into Heaven, but it's also a distinct system of ethics that Christians believe should regulate human behavior, Heaven or not.	NULL

I'm not American.  In the American political landscape I'd definately lean democratic, while in Norway, I'm pretty far over on the right wing.  I believe in a much smaller state.  The state should control and regulate natural infrastructure monopolies or natural resources.  Oil, Hydro, Telecoms, etc.  Sure, allow private sector companies too, but with hefty regulations to ensure state income, competition, and so forth.  The state should also own the roads, railways, main airports, main harbours, etc.  They should provide military, courts/justice, police, fire departments, health care and education.  And should regulate the commons.  Outside of the above, I believe the state should be kept as small as possible, keeping out of people and businesses lives, except for the court system when laws have been broken.  The state should ideally never overspend on 'popular' things, but keep a robust economy.	NULL

Many selfish reasons including:  -I find looking after myself to be exhausting enough as is, I don’t want to burn all my surplus energy chasing after a kid as well.   -I am really particular about staying neat and tidy.

And little kids are often sticky.   -I enjoy the freedom to basically do what I want, whenever I want, without being concerned for finding childcare or having to bring my kids along to things.   -And the big one… I have deep ethical concerns about global overpopulation, and in particular about the Earth’s ability to sustain all of us going forward. I don’t want to add another human to the problem.	NULL

We say may God help you but I don't think you should see is as "only God will help you and nothing else so come to Christianity". I think most people overreacting that religion is that and that.

 >So on a political level, yeah, atheism can bring people together as well.  But not really though. In the Bush era, atheism was often conflated with progressivism because the right's arguments against things like gay marriage and abortion were all religious.

At the end of the day people's politics is influenced by a lot of things and it seems whether people are atheist or not, there will be people who subscribe to conservative ideas.	NULL

I was tested clean last year and then 1 new partner, a girl I dated and I thought I could trust for 6 months and we recently broke up.  Got tested because was having issues peeing and got a big sore on the head of my penis like 2 weeks ago that never turned into a blister (just now drying out after 2 weeks) and some smaller red marks on my penis and scrotum but I blood tested positive for HSV1, negative for HSV2 a week ago.  Positive for Chlamydia as well and took antibiotic for that.    Virtual visit doctor told me don't worry too much about it (The HSV1 blood result).  I told him about the sores and he told me to get the sores swabbed like 4 days ago so I did that and that came back negative for both HSV1 and HSV2.  The doctor who swabbed me also immediately put me onto antivirals (400mg acyclovir) so I assumed I def had it after she looked at it while swabbing.   What is the likelihood that they were both false negatives?  Should I get retested in a few weeks?  I imagine I won't be able to swab test if there isn't any sores present but will blood work be more clear?  Thanks for any advice this has been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  I have a history of getting a rash on the shaft of my penis that doctors gave me cream for but never on the head.	NULL

Antimatter isn't "absence of matter". It's basically like matter, except it destroys matter on contact.  Right now, the human species does create incredibly small amounts of antimatter, albeit not for very long, as we lack the ability to reliably keep it out of contact with matter for long periods of time (our current limit is about 24 hours or so). However, antimatter is also the only substance known to humans that can be converted entirely into energy via annihilation with regular matter (the next most efficient power generation process, nuclear fusion, converts a substantially smaller fraction of it's mass into energy).  That said, I don't doubt for a moment that the first use of any significant quantity of antimatter will be a weapon, likely an antimatter warhead, as it essentially sidesteps the secondary hazards of nuclear weapons while offering much greater destructive power. I doubt it'll see wartime use, since the first nation who deploys such a weapon against another will likely face nuclear retaliation.	NULL

Course it isn't priced so I have to explain to them it isn't priced yet and I can't show it   \- resellers. Oh god.

I don't really get why this is any different from any other random shit that kids and teens go through when they're figuring out their identity. Like I went through a phase where I had people calling me a different name and I was trying on different identities just trying to figure out who I was as a person and that had nothing to do with gender identity.   Now that it's not social suicide to be a trans person in this country I don't get why it would be any different if you go through a phase where you think you might be a woman and are trying on that identity as opposed to when I thought that I was any other identity dictated by how I present myself to other people.   We can have a separate discussion about hormones and surgery and whatever that a kid might elect to get but if the extent of the issue is pronouns and clothes and makeup or something I don't see why it's any different then going through a phase where I dress in all black and identify with anarchist punk values and it's really important to me you refer to me as "Raven" or something or whatever other identity that you might try on as a kid. Cringey or whatever, sure. But nobody is asking about "who is compelling me to think that way" or thinking that I may have been indoctrinated by an adult to find it appropriate or cool or whatever.   Like the worst case scenario if they were pressured into it by someone else or a desire to be cool is that the kid later figures out that they don't actually identify with that gender and stops asking people to refer to them as such.

I normally like sweet ones, but tried a tart one in Minnesota 4ish years ago that was amazing. They called it First Kiss. It was like a honeycrisp in terms of texture and juiciness. But was delightfully tart, and less prone to bruising. It was available at the state fair, but the orchard we frequented was one that grew and sold it.   I'm not sure of it's still being grown, but it should be. It's the only tart apple I'd go out of my way to find.	NULL

Eh this is a bit more complex than that because the misogyny and damaging aspects that arise from sex work mostly come from the fact that it has been illegal for so long.

You want them to be Jews?  .  [slavery, yum.]  Timothy 6:1-2  Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed.  If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts.  Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them.   Ephesians 6:5  Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.  Exodus 21:20-21  "When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property."  Colossians 3:22 Slaves, obey your human masters in everything, not only when being watched, as currying favor, but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord.   1 Timothy 2:11-15 Women should listen and learn quietly and submissively.  I do not let women teach men or have authority over them. Let them listen quietly.  For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve.  And it was the woman, not Adam, who was deceived by Satan, and sin was the result.  But women will be saved through childbearing  and by continuing to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty.  1 Corinthians 14:33-35  As in all the churches of the holy ones, women should keep silent, for they are not allowed to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says.  But if they want to learn anything, they should ask their husbands at home.  [PATRIARCHY!!!]  Sirach 9:2 Give no woman power over you to trample upon your dignity.  Deuteronomy 22:28-29 If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her. [make the rape victim marry the rapist...]  Exodus 21:7 When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  Ecclesiastes 7 26 I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare. 27 “Look,” says the Teacher, “this is what I have discovered: “Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things 28 while I was still searching but not finding — I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.    1 Corinthians 14:34 - It is a shame for women to speak in the churches.  1 Timothy 2:12 - But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.  .  Love that Christ action.	NULL

We use to have this little secluded camping spot in NSW Australia that my uncles indigenous friend showed him back in the 60’s. It was dead quiet and we had been going there since we were kids. As of 10 years ago now can’t even get a spot anymore because it’s been mentioned in so many traveler books and shit like that. Tourist are scum bags who ignore the national park rules.

Probably not.   I divorced my husband 20 years ago, but he kept coming over for dinner a few times a week while the kids grew up. He was a poor husband, but a good father, so I was okay with it.   But now, the last of our kids have moved out, and he still is coming over for dinner. He is a nice enough person, I don't hate him, but he needs to move on. About every other week, we have a talk about him finding other people, other things to do, but he can't seem to break the habit.  He says he is lonely, but I do not always feel happy to see him. I don't think I would be able to handle having a new husband plus my old one.	NULL

Hard disagree.  Your emotions are yours. And yours alone.  You have no way of knowing how the other person is going to react. If you do, that's intentional.  What if what you just said offended me, or was hurtful? Can I demand an apology, internet stranger? You certainly did mean to offend me by calling me an insensitive dick. Doesn't that then make YOU an insensitive dick for doing exactly what you just said I do? Is it dickception all the way down?  Let's say that someone tells you that the way you chew gum triggers them because their stepdad beat them and always chewed gum like that.  Is that your fault? Do you apologize for how you chew gum? Is it now your job to soothe this person's past trauma? Is it now your job to police everyone around this person so that no trauma-inducing gum chewing occurs? Or is it their issue to work through?  Where do you draw the line? I dunno. I would (and have) err on the side of apologizing, while still understanding that this person has to eventually deal with their issues.	NULL

I was raised Catholic, but as I grew the more I learned in Sunday church school thing, and about history, the more became obvious to me, that humans made that shit up. I think the Bible has some nice messages, and it can be very contradictory.  Few examples: Noah's ark, the belief that Earth was at the center of the solar system, until Galileo proved them wrong, and they tried to kill the guy..  Meanwhile I believe the Bible to have been translated from older more mininful texts leaving behind or adjusting the content of the information to suite the new made up religion.  I believe that Sumerians started it all, and they knew about the solar system with sun in the center. Some people say I would be inclined to believe, and there is a lot to support the idea the Sumerians was a extraterrestrial race that looked like us but taller, the annunaki	NULL

Important note: it's okay if they don't feel the same way. Don't tie yourself up thinking it has to be this or that way. My explanation of how things went sounded douchey. A better explanation goes:  Met a chick through church and hit it off. A week into knowing each other, we met each other's friends. (Turns out one of her friends liked me and planted the thought inside this church girls mind that I was not worth her time and an asshole. This same girl messaged me on FB for a bit trying to meet up and stuff. These pieces of the puzzle came together a month before me and church girl broke up.)   I told church girl I liked her, she played the friendzone card and I just accepted it. So with no motivation to pursue church girl I stopped really wanting to hangout with her. But she'd call or text me throughout the day and setup plans for us. We had fun still I just would use church girl as a wingman. With her help I got alot of attention and closed the deal with better than expected results.  A week after I told church girl how I felt, she confronted me about how I didn't respect her feelings and she was hurt. We talked about it, and she told me she liked me too and wanted to see where things went. It well for a bit and abruptly ended when she started talking to her ex. So I ended the relationship and fucked her friend... okay I didn't fuck her friend but we did cease seeing each other.	NULL

You need to realize that some people claim to do things in the name of God but in reality they aren’t. Being a Christian myself it’s sad to admit that some Christians hate others and do stuff that the Bible tells them not to do. It’s either cuz they’re lying about being Christian (hopefully not) or they’re confused. Which is why I pray to God to help them and every Christian follow his Word better, for if we follow his Word like how he intended us too, then everyone in the world would see how great God’s love is, and then everyone would want to turn to God and confess and repent.

The Law of Entropy. If you've never studied physics, the general idea is that systems tend towards disorder. If you don't mind disorder, then of course it doesn't matter. (As somebody who appreciates order, I see too many of these people in the world). Entropy is a constant force, so if you want at least a general sense of order, then countering it requires constant vigilance. You have to exert energy at regular intervals (say, making your bed once a day), otherwise the system *will* gradually devolve into chaos. Everybody can make their own decision about how much order/disorder they are comfortable with, and how much energy they wish to expend in order to counter it. But the point of making your bed is preventing you from getting to the point where your sheets look messy and are twisted this way and that. Maybe some people don't mind. I do. And I appreciate keeping things neat. It satisfies my brain.	NULL

As an American stuck in the Midwest, country music is just awful. The worst. The shame of this country.  All of it from the last 20 years is just awful. No one strays from. No one sings about anything not related to Christianity, farming, drinking God awful cheap beer, or being country. The attire, the look, the southern and/or farmland accdnt. the style is carbon copy.  If you heard one singer you've heard em all. There's no difference in anything. You like it or not. I despise it.  Decent country died with Cash.	NULL

Consider this: beliefs are rooted in tradition and are in constant evolution. Furthermore they are contextualised. Every "tribe" has a different belief system and everyone thinks they are right. Why? Because. Mostly because of tradition. So if one is born in a certain continent chances are you'll adopt a certain belief system. Same goes for the era in which you're born. Who's right?  Or is it just like humans are made: we are completely ignorant to everything and we must make sense of things so theories rise.  Now, today we got a good method to question reality that it's better than tradition.	NULL

For whatever reason this view is really unpopular. It’s actually pretty compatible with atheism as God is largely undetectable, and there is no evidence for God other than the fact that anything exists at all in the first place. Like for example, the fact that God is everything and matter itself makes God also nowhere, and an absent force, as much as it is an active force, if that makes any sense.  If you’re actually curious to learn more, check out Ethics by Spinoza where he does a way better job of laying it out than I did in this blurb. He was excommunicated by the Jews for developing his views on the nature of God.	NULL

It’s unprovable. That’s the whole point of the thought experiment. Proofs require an assumption that you can draw and contradiction out of. If this was a simulation, what would you expect to see?

There isn’t and cannot be a proof of a simulation that that doesn’t ignore this principle.	NULL

When big changes are necessary, do them carefully.  But in the US, the word Conservative is often used for a much broader, much less coherent set of political positions.	NULL

I've been in two wars (I'm a civilian and was a child at the time). The first time the enemy's rockets weren't powerful enough to reach us, but the second time they were. Life continues almost normally, but then 2-5 times a day you hear blaring sirens and have to run to shelter. While I never saw a missile directly, I saw the contrails they made, and heard the booms as they were intercepted by anti-missile defense. We had shrapnel fall in our back yard. Thanks to technology, as well as being far from the center of the conflict, I was mostly safe. Even so, I will never forget that there is someone out there who woke up every morning, ate breakfast, and decided to dedicate his entire day to making sure it was my last. Most of you will, with all luck, never know what it means to be in a war-torn country. What it's like knowing those who've killed, and those who've been killed.

Thank you so much.  To answer your question, I was on the train on my way to work, when I suddenly fell unconscious for a couple of seconds. After the ambulance brought me to the hospital and they did their checks, they found something weird on my heart monitor. A specialist later laid a heart catheter and they incrementally increased my heart rate. At 200 bpm I went into ventricular fibrillation, basically proving the Brugada syndrome the specialist suspected.   That's the short version, I hope that answers it for you. It was rather traumatic experience I would like to add.  Sounds like you also suspect something? A check up at the doc is never a wrong thing, especially when you are approaching your 30s. Better find stuff earlier then too late I guess	NULL

I’m not doubting that? Many people convert to religions, but this doesn’t change the fact if you’re religious you’re near-certainly going to be the same religion that you were brought up in either due to family or broader community.    >but saying you believe there's no God because you were never taught about it   I’m saying *I* don’t believe in God because *I* wasn’t brought up being told it was true. When your starting point is that religion is untrue, most people don’t become religious. You did, fair enough, but you’re still working under the assumption that ‘God is real’ is the truth and therefore either the start point or end point, when to most non-religious people Christianity is as unlikely as Thor, Seth, or Ganesh.   Every religious person I know was raised religious, that does not mean every religious person is but it’s the trend. I went to a religious school, but didn’t see a single shred of evidence ever that god may potentially be real.   Honestly, what are the odds that any of us just happened to be born into the ‘true’ religion, at the right place and right time, when throughout history every culture has had their own different ideas of religion?  >is like saying that you vaccines don't work because you never met a doctor.

The hard one is to actually believe there is one. Because when you believe it, you also believe that there is heaven, hell, angels, demons, satan and all that jazz.

Bit different with the Beatles though I think.

Agreed.  I’m 6’3” and my first serious girlfriend in my 20s was 4’11”.

Its not really a conscious choice for me. I just genuinely don't believe in anything supernatural.

There's no reason to believe in a higher power because there's no evidence of one.  If you do some digging into the history of most ancient texts that claim the existence of a higher power you can easily see the patterns of the same stories written by humans rewritten over and over as the times change.  Check out Sumerian religious texts and you will see striking similarities between many of those stories and the ones found in the Bible.  This pattern makes it distinctly more likely that these stories were written by humans than an infallible all knowing God.  Further, even if one were to take any one of those stories at face value they are full of magic!  There hasn't been a single documented, verifiable, case of any magical occurrence ever in human existence.  The world and it's behaviors are clearly described by science that I can trivially verify myself without need for faith.  So just starting there all the magical bits are clearly false.  This makes it impossible for a rational person to believe any religious text that contains references to magic.  Lastly, and to me, most importantly.  If one were to ignore the above facts and just accept the words written in the Bible (or other religious text) as true.  They are rife with misogynistic, racist, and other toxic behaviors, and I refuse to support any of it because I don't believe in those values.	NULL
Be open with your partner about what you want and try to find someone who supports your dreams. Also finding the right person is worth the wait it is better to be alone than in a relationship that isn't a good fit.	NULL
Yeah honestly I feel like "don't ration your water" is the actual myth here. It should be "make sensible choices about your water".  For example William Bligh after the mutiny on the bounty, as well as the survivors of the Essex wreck, survived long nautical journeys,  and absolutely wouldn't have if they didn't ration their water.  Different situations require different approaches. Sure, don't die of dehydration, but don't drink three litres of water on the first day because some teacher in high school said not to ration your water.	NULL

>Sure , I don't know every answer. But I do feel acknowledging truth is important and very useful. Accepting reality will go a long way. God of the gaps is played out. I would imagine God encourages curiosity and exploration of concepts in searching for truth By itself, God is not a sufficient answer.  Maybe I could've been more clear.  You implied in your previous comment that it existence could be sufficient proof of a deity, right?  I suppose it could be, but I don't see the point in even offering an unfalsifiable god as an explanation.  Seriously, if the point of existing is truly to learn and grow and teach, then what reason is there to keep bring deities that can't be proven or disproven?  I can't find any use in that.  >I've never seen a believer that knows how to think just shrug off a mystery and be content with the answer 'God did it'. Ridiculous and arrogant to assume believers are simpletons with an imaginary 'sky daddy' instead of making a good faith effort to understand the esoteric meanings and interpretations of the written material.  I don't think all or even most theists think this way and I never said that I did.  I was responding directly to you, so if I've inadvertently misunderstood something in your previous comment, I apologize I guess.    Honestly I don't have the energy to look down on believers, because ultimately I don't think I know any more than they do.	NULL

Just because I’m not actively complaining about cramps does not mean that they don’t hurt a lot. I choose to not make a fuss and that is what I prefer, just sucks that a lot of men see it as “just cramps”. Not often but sometimes I get cramps that wipe me out, if I don’t sit down I will either puke or pass out. Happened once when I was helping my dad in the garage, he was rolling his eyes the whole time and being like “fine then just sit and I’ll do this myself.” When you feel crappy physically, someone piling on the guilt is just the cherry on top.  You should know, because a lot of women’s pms symptoms get downplayed and dismissed. But in general a good tip is that if anyone is telling you they are in pain then don’t be an ass about it.	NULL

Saving yourself for someone you truly love is underestimated.  We treat love and relationships as something cynical. As something that grows. As if you can "talk someone into". You perform all the right moves and voila.. Love happens.  We even mock Disney princesses gor falling in love immediately.  But thst is how love happens.  Love is magic, whether you like it or not. Love is instant.  You see someone walk into the room.  And BAM! That is it. You know you belong.  This is why so many people end up oppressed in non abusive relationships.  You are with someone that ticks all the right boxes. But in the end. They are your brother. Closer than a friend. But not your lover.  You find someone beautiful and you start having sex and do all the things people in love do and you convince yourself you are in love.

Yes that’s the right thing I think because before I even realized what she was doing I was normalizing her behavior. Then I realized that so many other parents don’t treat their kids like that. As long as you realize that it’s toxic you’re on the other side of everything and you can think clearly. I’m grateful for this experience because I know this kind of pain and understand it. But I do need therapy tho. So that’s something I need to work on. And I do think about reading parenting books and stuff because many of my classmates were so free and happy while I was a repressed, weak kid who only knew fear and If I do ever have kids I’ll make sure that that doesn’t happen to them.

I also recently managed to map almost every key from my keyboard (plus mouse actions) into an Xbox controller through JoyToKey so there's that. It's enough to write everyday text and even code, although it's just for fun, as it's slow. I just got too much free time I guess.	NULL

As far as Im concerned, 99% of believers do not truly believe. They are merely scared of death and so they throw on a facade of faith.  To determine if someone is a believer, look no further than their home life. AFAIK, they are to give what they have to help the less fortunate.   If they own literally anything that they do not need, then surely they do not believe. It is only a relationship of convenience. When they want to be heinous, suddenly god isn’t watching, when they are in front of peers, they are model christians.  I know this argument sounds stupid, but its literally their own rule.	NULL

He then decides he’ll have a Duke of Wellington because “that doesn’t sound as gay as the others” and it was in a ***biiiig maaanly*** glass.

Please provide any sort of reputable study that claims with confidence a 70% number.  You’re still not understanding how wildly oversimplified the point you’re trying to make is. You are neglecting the fact that there are also causes of bad diet outside of personal responsibility, and environmental toxins that invisibly contribute to all sorts of disorders and pathologies that get lumped in with that.  I agree diet is an incredible problem, but the reason your take is shit is that you are assuming socialized health care will cost MORE, when we spend shittons on privatized health care right now.  And I say we, because your taxes go to the government, the government provides corporate welfare to failing companies in the form of handouts and tax credits, based on bullshit trickle down voodoo economics and some idea of “job creation” that literally gets ignored.  These companies then turn around and do wht they want, frequently damaging the health of the people who live in these areas to do so.  We’re already paying for all this shit, you’re just blind to how the current system works and how it’s being dismantled. Go spend some time on r/noctor. Those people are the people who will be presented as “doctor” in ten years time.  US health care is in the middle of a race to the bottom that no-one gives a shit about. We hold financial ideologies ahead of actual medical goals and we’re suffering as a nation, top to bottom, over it.	NULL

That is simply inaccurate. I am not thinking that, and also Roosevelt wanted to go to war with Germany and was very happy to supply the British with arms against Germany. It wasn't a matter of mopping up. It was a matter of the lack of political ability to convince congress to declare war. America was largely isolationist in the run-up to World War II, and intervention in Europe was unpopular right up until Hitler declared war on us.  Also, this isn't a big game of Risk.

Well to answer the question, “If sex is more enjoyable, is it a form of mutilation?”  A man circumcised at birth couldn’t tell you the difference. So how are they to answer that?   In all the other circumcision threads everyone always pounces on the circumcised guys too, telling them cannot masturbate, or have xx% less “sensitivity”.   Maybe sex is more enjoyable for circumcised men? I’ve had multiple partners tell me they preferred my circumcised penis to the “water weenies” they’ve experienced. Fluffing my ego is pretty enjoyable, on top of the sex which has always been enjoyable.  Any actual scientific study on the subject shows that circumcision has benefits of less disease and cancers, with the initial risk of infection or anesthetic complications that are there regardless of elective surgery type. But those studies get attacked by people claiming there is a global foreskin illuminati conspiracy.   I didn’t have my sons circumcised, and ZERO percent of my decision making thought went into their “sensitivity level” or is this “mutilation”.	NULL

How I met your mother  Change my mind	NULL
4/5  I got my first puppy. I've always wanted one, but my family wasn't into pets. I lived with a roommate who had a dog and I became the default dog sitter. I'd literally tell her and her girlfriend to go out if they wanted and I'd watch their dog, because I enjoyed chilling with the dog and being so adored by her. Getting my own dog has blown that experience out of the water. I had to train him from birth. Even got a temporary live-in dog sitter to follow my training plan and make sure he wasn't anxious while I work from home. He's been my life since May of this year and has been my day-to-day family because I live far from my parents and siblings. I took my pup to visit, but not being around them can be isolating so he's taken the mantle of family member.  At 36, I finally live alone. I've lived with roommates regularly since I've been in college, be it partner or more frequently random people I met and became friends with. But when my last roommates had to move out of the apartment due to financial reasons, I got my first taste of real freedom. I moved close to my new job and have a two bedroom (an extra room for guests) and after the live-in dog sitter finally moved out due to her services no longer being needed, I can't see myself ever going back to living with roommates. Unless I meet a romantic partner, of course.  I have a decent paying job. I technically got it third quarter of last year as a contractor-to-hire, but this year I got the offer to join the company full time and have been given the leadership experience I've been wanting for nearly 5 years prior to that.  I have recently quit cigarettes. I haven't smoked a cigarette for two days. Yeah, that sounds like a temporary thing, but the way I got to not smoking is the real story. I used to smoke at least a pack of day. For the last few months, I've worked at lowering that number daily. I also bought plastic filters to lessen the amount of gunk (and nicotine) entering my system. What was 20 cigarettes a day went down to 15, then 10, then 5, and then 1 or 2. Now I just don't feel like smoking at all. The couldn't even finish the last cigarette I smoked.  The reason this year's not a 5 is because I have had particularly bad bouts of depression, especially before getting my puppy. Being several states away from my family, moving to a new city which negatively impacted what social life I had, and then having to take social distancing seriously to the point that it killed that remaining social life were things that made the depression that much worse. The world becoming post-apocalyptic didn't help, either. The depression led to some issues with work that have since been completely fixed (my boss has evaluated my changes which led to offering me a permanent position). I've also gained some weight due to the depression and have some things to still deal with in terms of essentially being a high-functioning alcoholic and a binge-eater. And I haven't had any romantic partners in nearly a year.  So I'm looking to work hard on the things in the last paragraph and make next year a 5/5.	NULL

Yeah, that's what I meant by "somewhat in your control" of course some other person could potentially be responsible for your life's end and that doesn't have to be the only reason to stay away from gore btw lol. As far as accidents and murder or whatever go those things sadly have to taken for what they are but their risk should not be overemphasized.  Sounds a lot simpler than it actually is but there should be no reason to fear things in your day to day life that happen fairly rarely and are entirely out of your control. That just goes back to acknowledging the risk and the privilege of being alive and healthy and making the most out of what you have.	NULL

When my husband's boss told him about a month before we were getting married that due to a clerical error he couldn't have the 3 weeks he booked off for our wedding 6 months beforehand (UK saved up all our annual leave for that), to "just reschedule the wedding. jenjudges won't mind."   1) we'd already cancelled the first wedding because of his family being controlling assholes.  2) I did bloody well mind.  3) fuck you!   So instead of 3 weeks annual leave, my husband went off sick with stress for 3 months on full pay *and* got a new job. There was a full investigation from the CEO about what happened. My husband had to meet with the CEO and the board of directors about why he was leaving, what they had offered him to stay (nothing), who authorized no offer to be made (the department director sat right over there), and were they given notice (a full 3  months as per my husband's initial contract).  The director of the department was fired and my husband's immediate manager was also fired. This wasn't a small company and is quite a large multinational ISP. My husband had made them millions and implemented a contract that should have cost them money in such a way it made them money. This obviously caught the CEOs attention and didn't want my husband to leave. He still did.	NULL

Not sure if I'm atheist or agnostic, but I spent 18 years of my life in the church (christian). Shitty things happening, contradictions in what was said and was expected, the source text being incredibly unreliable, and the realisation that my church was okay with people being abused. 3 people (vicar, another vicar [not sure why we had a second one tbh] and the head of the children's work) were aware of parental abuse going on, and didn't report anything. They got therapy for the parent, but never reported anything to the relevant child protective services or checked up on the kids.  It goes on, but that's a large part of it. If this group of people who aim to be good people are okay with child abuse, they're really not great people. Turns out that's a recurring theme throughout most of the organisations, if a lot of different witness accounts online are to be believed. There are absolutely good people who are christians, but there are too many who use it as a weapon for me to give them the benefit of the doubt any longer.  Also, never getting a straight answer (ironically) when I asked why they had an anti-LGBG marriage petition and nothing pro-LGBT marriage. Was never a discussion on it, or teaching, but an unspoken disapproval or hatred that I didn't spot until I was an adult. So I'm sure if there is a hell, I'll be seeing some familiar faces there.

Is AOC racist?  They didn't have a problem with a warehouse. They had a problem with a specific company and it's business practices plus subsidies that came from the government. Big difference.  >Many people just don’t want more people, more traffic, higher cost of living, etc., or even their culture to change.  You mean they don't want people who would love I  smaller units or cheaper properties right? It's not that they don't want more people they don't want THOSE people. I got to council meetings all the time and consistently see the same people show up to try and block development. Density doesn't lead to higher cost of living, housing scarcity does. Which blocking developments helps do to make housing scarce.  We live in a constantly changing global world, trying to fight against change is insane. The world constantly changes throughout history.

You do realize most wars involved religion,  right? People of faith absolutely do lots of violent things, especially when they believe God can just forgive them. And as an athiest I can't say violence is a desire of mine. Im kind to people because I care about them. I do nice things simply to make people feel happy. I don't need a promise of some grand reward to do nice things. Fact is, if you're only good in hopes of going to heaven then deep down you're not a good person. You'd be using kindness as a tool to serve your own needs. It's gross. And when you asked who is going to punish violence if God wont- human beings have had police and different people of authority for a long long time. We already are punishing bad people. This was a really weak counter argument you made. Be better.	NULL

The traditional Zoroastrian sky burial is more compete than just vultures. They had high towers where the bodies were left at an angle up top for vultures and other scavengers to feed on the flesh. Then the bones works remain on top with the idea being that larger bones works be taken by wolves or similar animals and then over time rain, especially more acidic rain in particular areas and at that height, would disintegrate the other bones over time and the angle would help wash the remains leftover into the ocean or rivers. The entire body is returned to different elements of nature in a cycle.	NULL

I worked at an Aeropostale in college. Older woman asked me to try on some clothes cause I was the same size as her grand son and apparently looked similar to him. She wanted to see how they looked and fit.   I asked my boss and they said to do it if I felt comfortable. I didn't have a reason not to so I put on the clothes and she went full mom on me. Lifting the shirt up to see the waist line, tugging on the waistband to check fit, and pulling at the fabric around the crotch... The whole nine yards.   I was very creeped out by the encroachment on my personal space as she said she just wanted to see how it looked. I changed back into my clothes and after asking if she was ready to check out I directed her to a co-worker and went to walk away. She grabbed my ass and smacked it as I turned around.   Last time I agreed to try something on for a customer, and I was asked more than once after the fact.	NULL

I dunno if comfort is the right word. I believe in Christianity, but it really fills me with fear more than anything else. Imagine something that is always watching you, with complete, inescapable power, who not only has the power to punish you in this life but also eternally in the next one. Being burned in a lake of fire, forever, because according to the church, I am a sinner who can't live according to the standards of the Bible. Doesn't that sound comforting?   And that's contributed to my drinking problem. Because if I'm going to burn in hell for all eternity, I'd like to be able to forget about it for a couple hours.	NULL

Like someone here said, the war was not so inevitable. The circumstances were this: Czar Nicholas II was a big supporter of panslavism and compromised to protect Serbia (Russia's fellow slav nation) from any threat. The biggest threat to Serbia was Austria-Hungary, and the best friend of Austria-Hungary was Russia. Meanwhile, Germany saw Russia as a big threat. Franz Ferdinand was killed by a serbian nationalist, Austria declared war on Serbia weeks later, Russia responded by declaring war on Austria, and then Germany declared war on Russia. Now, what triggered this conflict between the 4 countries can be traced to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand because of what I mentioned previously. So, if the Archduke was not killed, the tensions between Austria and Serbia would not rise more, Russia wouldn't feel force to declare war, and Germany would not need to assist its ally. Yes, there were still tensions in Europe, but the war was not as inevitable as many would think.	NULL

Scientifically, There is absolutely no reason to believe. Morally, It disgusts me how many people have committed atrocities in the name of their God.

Im not an atheist, not religious either. Much evidence has been given about the universe. How it is expanding, black holes that warp time. People usually think that the entire universe is about their species, but thats just all perspective. Actually, words by stephen hawking: The universe is so big, that the chance that we are alone, is very, very small. We don’t actually matter. Life out there probably exists. The universe has been going on for infinity and always will. Even when our planet gets absorbed by the sun, we are both long gone, and it doesn’t matter, because there will probably be a whole new planet that just begun life. Its all just random what happens. This, is why i don’t believe in a god	NULL

The Buddhist and Vedantic solved this paradox by releasing the assumption that there is separation, thus non-duality.     They analyze everything that constitute the Self and the Universe by the questions 'What exactly am I?', and 'What is the world?'     They find out that all that constitutes the Self and everything else are momentary perceptions of consciousness such visual, auditorial, kinetic, olfactory, gustorial perceptions. In other words, sensations of Consciousness.    The 2 analysis come together, simultaneously and are unified, reappearing in, and as, the One Consciousness; the duality of self and non-self vanishes.    As one awakens from the dream state and realizing that everything in the dream was just himself, including the dream scenes, the dream people and all objects.     Similarly, in the eastern tradition, a Buddha realizes that so-called real life is no different and is also another appearance in Consciousness and awaken as the One eternal Divine Consciousness.

It's not though. There is very little historical evidence for the existence of Jesus besides the Bible. The Romans were quite meticulous in their administration.

But baseball isn’t the only sport. And if you’re molested by a coach, that trauma might make you not want to play anymore (or to encourage others to play either.) So you might play a different sport.  Your original claim was based on the idea that you “enjoyed baseball.” If you were traumatized by a sexual assault from a baseball coach as a child, you likely won’t enjoy baseball as much afterwards. So why encourage others to play if you don’t enjoy it?  If you take issue with OP’s grandpa removing themselves from something they associated with sexual trauma, and think they should have “gotten over it” and given it another shot, I’m not sure what to tell you other than “no.”	NULL
I took my mom’s 300ZX out on Hwy9 at night. It’s an extremely windy road in Northern California near Santa Cruz.  My parents lived abroad while I was in college.

I never told my folks about it. They never noticed except that years later they remarked that the paint on that fender didn’t deteriorate like the rest of the car paint.  Oops.	NULL

I recently started taking a travel mug cup of tea on the school walk with my daughter.  We meet her friends and mostly, their mom's along the way (occasionally one of her friends dad's is doing the school run).   On Monday I can't find my normal cup so I take my partners Disney beauty and the beast cup.   As soon as she sees me she's in hysterics. She says I'm " just not like other men" and she doesn't know another dad like me...   I didn't get it at first. Now I think it's a little sad and her part but very funny that she has this perception of men/ dads that just isn't true.	NULL

Left: I think if we ever get gun control laws passed, they should not apply to rural areas. I think if you have combat experience you should be absolved of all gun control laws, provided you're found mentally fit.  More detail. Assume proper firearm training in all cases.  I think it's perfectly acceptable for you or your adolescent child to carry a firearm while in the wilderness. I do not think it's acceptable for anyone to carry a firearm into a Starbucks.   I think if you have a farm with your closest neighbor miles away and get an knock in the middle of the night, you should have a shotgun in your hands. I think answering your door with a shotgun in the city is insane.  I'm just coming off reading about a father shooting his own daughter as she presumably snuck into her own home. Unfortunately, I think too many people think that because they know how to operate a firearm, that means they know how to operate a firearm in a combat situation. People who have never dealt with the tunnel vision of that type of situation aren't always going to be making their best decisions.	NULL

While on vacation, I was goofing around with the boys and flipped the bird to my eldest son (9 at the time).  My 7 year old saw me and threatened to call the cops.  I said "go ahead".  He said he was going to to REALLY do it having dialed 9 and 1.  I stared him down and he dialed the last 1 then hung up quickly.  His moment made, the boys went downstairs to play video games.  About 10 minutes later there's a knock at the door.  It's the police.  "Did someone here dial 911?", I said 'hold on' and shouted down toward the basement.  "Thing 2!  There's someone here to see you!"  He came trudging up the stairs, all gangly like as 7 years olds are and went white as a ghost once he saw the cops.    "Did you call call 911", the very serious looking policeman says?    Thing 2 diligently nods "Yes".    "Why did you call 911?", the very serious policman says (I make sure I'm far across the room to not imply coercion of any kind).  Thing 2 says, "Because Dad flipped off my brother.", ready to hold his ground and take whatever comes like a man.  (Sniff... I was so proud).  I nodded and confirmed, "Yes, officer, it wasn't my finest fatherly moment but I DID flip off my eldest son."  The very serious policeman shared a glance with his partner and said, "Phone are not toys.  You need to dial 911 only for serious matter", clearly annoyed.  "Yes, sir", Thing 2 and I replied in unison.  The very serious policemen left, hotdogs were made and we endeavored to put this shameful day behind us.	NULL

Alright well this shows how little you actually know about firearms in the US. It's illegal to own automatic weapons without a very specific license so me "being happy with automatic assault rifles being carried around" isn't even on the table. And recreational shooting doesn't make up for mass shootings only a delusional person would even begin to think that. But yeah hey you're right man guns are literally only ever used for killing humans. That's it. Nothing else.

I had a friend when I was like, 12, who's parents were going camping, and told her she could invite a friend. She invited me. I was NOT an outdoors fan at all, but I wanted to spend time with my friend. So yeah, same as you, I was TERRIFIED of the bathrooms at the campground and couldn't bring myself to use them, so I just held it for like, 2 or 3 days. I only went to the bathroom when we had gone in to the little town near the campsite, and I was able to use the bathroom at one of the stores we went to. And when we went swimming at the big ass pool that the campsite had....my friend commented once on how she noticed I never went to the bathrooms. I just laughed her off.	NULL
No, because proving something existence is generally possible, while proving something inexistance is impossible by essence, the best we can do is "we know thay under theses circumstances X does not exist/happen"   The burden of proof always stays with the one claiming to add something to reality, you have to prove gravity is real for us to recognize it's the physical rule it is, otherwise it is just a phenomenon unexplained. But you can't prove that because it's gravity at locale scale, that there is not an other rule doing the same at bigger scale or underlying it in fact	NULL

Obviously not all of them are like this, same as athletes, but their only real end game is to entertain the masses. The NFL is just Keeping up with the Kardashians for a different audience.	NULL

Did you know they never bombed Nagasaki or Hiroshima before the atomic bombs specifically because they wanted to see the full effect of the atom bomb? Which makes you wonder how long they were planning on dropping those bombs. Also because the cities had never been bombed they had more people who were fleeing the smaller bombings. The bigger question was do you think it was worth it to bomb those two cities? It stopped the war faster for certain, but at this point Germany had been surrendered for 3 months and Italy had been surrendered for almost 2 years. Japan was alone against the Allies.

Not actually getting to know their partner and their partner’s feelings/dismissing their partner’s wishes in favor of their better ideas.    Had a guy repeatedly do something that crossed my boundaries even though I explicitly told him what I needed at the time within my boundaries.  He then continued on to trample my boundaries because he was “thinking of me, and only me.”  “I did this for you!” “I was thinking about you!”  Sure, maybe I came across your mind and you thought you were doing it for me, but what you actually were doing was disregarding what I actually needed and did what you thought I needed instead.  Selfish and dismissive is what that actually is.  It’s not love for me, that’s for god damn sure.	NULL

I'll give a few offerings, I genuinely don't think there's an end-all-be-all book.  Fiction: The complete collection of Conan the Barbarian novels. They were written before Lord of the Rings, has some understanding of real-world influences (since it's roughly based around the same time the Picts were relevant), and he's a varied character and certainly not two dimensional. If you like The Witcher, you'll find a lot of essence in this.  Non-Fiction: The Vikings 3rd edition by Else Roesdahl. I'd never recommend this as a "hurr hurr this is how REAL vikings behaved" but as a supplement to enjoying media. I've grown to enjoy the fictional films and shows on Norse culture because I don't use the book to refute the visuals and plot, but to appreciate how directors work with "palatability".	NULL

Quit drinking soda. Year 5 of no soda will begin tomorrow. I was pretty heavily addicted to sippin on a cold dr. Pepper…..Somewhere around 100+ ounces a day of the tasty DP. One New Year’s Eve I went out with some friends, and instead of drinking alcohol I drank a 2 liter of Dr Pepper to myself in just a couple hours. Nearly threw up and felt bloated for about three days. Laying on a couch next to some severely intoxicated friends, I said “I’m never drinking soda again” and they all said, in the most encouraging drunk talk Ive ever heard, that I should really stop. Here we are 5 years later.  (I do have to admit though, I have had one dr.

My father was an awful human-the “I provide food and shelter for the child I chose to have so you should worship me for it” type. That said…when I was 14 or so, the iPod Touch I’d had for years broke. Nobody’s fault, just got dropped, hit the floor at the wrong angle, and shattered. I was terrified he’d be mad, he was pretty uptight about stuff like electronics breaking. Knew there was no way I was getting a new one any time soon. To my complete surprise, a week later he gave me a new one. Great condition and way more storage space than the old one. I’m sure it got rubbed in my face a few times (“look how much I do for you, I got you that!”) but definitely a lot less than some other “gifts”. I used that thing for YEARS.

Well, maybe have a listen to some of their other stuff, particularly the later songs. The majority of pop songs by anyone will have repetition, if only the chorus because it’s part of what makes them catchy and memorable. If you want more depth, I suggest listening to Rubber Soul, Revolver or later albums. The song styles changed dramatically as they progressed, which is something else that was revolutionary in the music of the time (not suggesting other bands weren’t also stretching boundaries but The Beatles consistently sought out new possibilities in music and how they recorded).

Right wing here, here's a couple left wing opinions.  Mandate the COVID vaccine and any subsequent boosters. No religious exemptions, only strict medical exemptions.  Abortion is 100% unrestricted.  Ban coal use immediately, ban sale of ICE vehicles by 2025, all energy must come from renewables by 2030.  Tax the rich. 50% for people making $1 million or more.  &#x200B;  I'm right wing because:  Unrestricted firearm access, probably stopping at tanks and fighter jets. End most welfare benefits. More military and police funding. Build the wall, deport all illegal immigrants. School choice (public school left a horrible taste in my mouth). Massive import tariffs needed. Not into the whole nonbinary/changing genders community, I've had way too many negative interactions with those people.	NULL

Similar situation. I stopped gaming almost entirely between 2010-2018. Barely even touched the smash games that came out in between.   What finally allowed me to get back into it was figuring out how to play games with 0 expectations. I stopped expecting it to exceed my rose tinted memories. I went into breath of the wild with no knowledge of how it worked or really what the story was.   I don’t play as much as I used to, and for me I think that’s a good thing. Sure playing Halo 2 for 12 hours with friends was awesome as a teenager, but would I do it now? *Should* I do it now?   It’s more than just games, this feeling to me is emblematic of getting older.

My dad wanted to let me come to my own conclusions. He never promoted one way or the other. When I was very little, in early grade school, my friend wanted me to come to church functions with him.   Those people were some of the rudest, elitist assholes I had yet to meet. Worse or at least as bad as the racists I’d seen in the poor areas I was growing up in.   They taunted and insulted me, made me feel inferior for not being a follower and trying to ask questions out of curiosity, for wanting to actually learn and understand. I was not impressed.  Later on, closer to middle school, I met my current best broski and his mom is one of the few Christians I respect. She doesn’t push her beliefs, or use it to ostracize or hate on others. So I tried going to church with them a few times.   I remember learning about the Heavens Gate incident and about cults, and just the way everyone was “praying” reminded me of cult-like chanting. The more I learned about religion, the more my observations showed me that my first impression wasn’t misleading.	NULL

Wells Fargo.  In the early 00's or late 90s,  they bought a smaller bank where the college savings fund my parents set up for me was kept. After the merger, $3000 dollars of it suddenly didn't exist anymore and they wouldn't accept the statements from the old bank as valid and refused to do any kind of investigation on it.   My mom took my remaining 350$ to a new bank. Its the only time I remember her crying in front of other people besides at a funeral. She and my dad busted ass to get me that savings and then overnight it was gone.   Fuck Wells Fargo. I was too young to care/understand about the money, but they made my mom cry.	NULL

You should not use the words *reason* and *believe* in the same sentence belief and rationality do not intersect; they are like Euclidean parallel lines - maintaining their separation from here to infinity.  A belief is not a rational structure and is not subject to explanation. You have a belief; you do not have a reason for that belief.    You may have or be shown evidence supporting or contradicting your belief, but a belief does not respond to evidence. If challenged over your belief, you really have no defense; it is what it is and you have no control over it.  You needn't feel like you must defend your belief (your belief in the non-existence of God in this case).	NULL

" (John 18:36)   Jesus never got involved in politics, and strongly pushed back against his disciples that insisted he should be made king, so as he can rule over the lands commanding his gospel. He categorically refused all three of Satan's temptations, including the lands themselves to rule over. There's multiple examples in the Bible of Jesus showing that the Church and state are to be separate.	NULL

Yeah ikr. It's difficult to understand whether there is definite malicious intent in their actions or not. I remember he told me that everything he did in his life was extremely calculated. His energy turned toxic when I told him I'd run out of my heart pills. Couldn't afford to go see a dr to get a refill, he could have paid for my visit, he has paid for me to visit the dr before. I didn't ask outright and I am aware it's not his responsibility, but he wouldn't have put a dent in his account to have helped me. Anyway my novel here is meant to illustrate that I think ghosting in my case was malicious.	NULL
I had a woman come up to me in the grocery store and grab my arm. She asked me if I could pretend to be her boyfriend for a few minutes because a guy was following her around town. She said she was able to evade him for a minute, told me her name, and said "in the last store, I called my voicemail and made it look like I was calling my boyfriend. I'm single. He just won't stop following me. Help."  Before the guy came around the corner, I asked her story she faked to be more convincing. She was supposedly buying a cake for her sister's birthday. My friend in the bakery and I have a code for certain events that take place. We have one for this scenario, a time loop, being followed ourselves, etc.  I said our code word to them, and they let us hide in the big cooler room. The woman told me he has a gun. She knew because he was showing it off to a friend before. We sat in there for 10 minutes before being let out by the friend. The guy was still in the store. We faked ordering a cake after that just to be safe. We also walked out together. He followed.  At this point, now I'm terrified. As I'm loading groceries in my car, she's standing next to me. He walks up and asks me why she's with me. I told him it'd be weird going grocery shopping by myself and not invite my girlfriend. He looks at her and says "you were serious about having a boyfriend?" She agrees.  He walks away, gets in his car, and leaves. After his car is no longer visible, I look at her and say "I was 2 seconds away from shitting myself. Do you need an escort home or something as well?" She says she'd love one, but is willing to wait for me to finish shopping. We go back in together, finish my shopping, and I follow her home.  He's in her front yard talking to her sister now. At that point, we circled the block, parked at a local restaurant, and I called the police while she called her sister. The sister said he came by wanting to know if SHE was single. The guy is arrested for multiple reasons. I drive her home, help her unload her groceries with her sister, I got both of their numbers just in case they needed me again, and went home.  This story isn't the SCARIEST for me, but one that definitely had me on pins and needles. This was a year ago, but I sometimes relive the events in my head. Thank God my friend remembered our code.

I think one of the best things that Potter brought in was age, and that he'd been in multiple wars. As it showed many of them that there was a chance to go home. Most interactions between him and the rest had very calming effect on them. Giving Hawkeye and the rest a paternal figure that they could lean on.     As for the secret santa thing. That was one of the biggest differences between him and Burns. After finding out why Winchester understood and saw how sheltered he'd been having one of the best lines in the series, whereas Burns would not have given it to begin with, but if he had (for example to impress Houlihan) he'd have taken it back regardless.     Also Burns leaving did let Houlihan grow so much as a character, to the point where you could argue that her and Hawkeye were some of the best friends in the 4077th.	NULL

I'm agnostic but religion is a philosophy to me more than an actual religion, I see the people who wrote these books have created some extremely good quotes and there's a lot to be learned from them, theirs also some beautiful sentiments about seeing your loved ones again but in reality I think any specific human made religions are likely false. If their is a divine power lording over the universe we are probably very insignificant of all his (their, it probably doesn't have a sex) creations unless this god only lords over our galaxy, but I've had some conundrums in the past with paradoxes I created along with near-death experiences I had that made me confused on if an afterlife exists or not.   My issue with believing is from studying psychology including evolutionary psychology I know how likely civilizations are to of faked religions to try to find their purpose and control others, so my educated perspective has me very skeptical of anything man has touched.

You should go for a few sessions to just see if there is anything you need to address, personally I think everyone should have a therapist as a third-party who is *paid* to help you navigate emotional baggage rather than just dumping it on friends & family.

I've got a beautiful female friend. Red headed. Smart. Educated. Freckles for days. She's been single since I've known her (about four or so years). She won't say why she isn't dating but I suspect it's because she's waiting for an athletic, 6'4", six figure earning black man to sweep her off her feet. This girl could easily get dates and explore possibilities but her expectations are just completely unrealistic.  And just putting it out there...

What’s sexy to you is not likely sexy to your lady. Men tend to be visually turned on and women more emotionally. Take two things from this: 1. If we do something visually stimulating to you (a stripe tease or lingerie) it’s more for you than it is for us. Yes, it is possible that we feel sexy and such BUT the likelihood that the underlying motivation is we wanted to do something special for you, is very high.  2. You want to turn us on, exercise empathy and then act on it. Many times I’ve felt more attracted to my husband after he’s turned over the laundry and didn’t boast around the house about it or something more specific…when I’ve started my period he doesn’t talk about it at all but instead does stuff like turn on my heating pad when I’m in the shower before bed.

Nope. It's just that, for some fucking reason, some jazzshiting horsefuckers decided to polarise science and religion into two separate teams, therefore Earth being billions of years old and evolution being real means that there are peabrained atheists who think that it automatically makes the Bible not real, likewise there are peabrained theists who believe that if it isn't directly stated in the Bible then it must be false. After all, it's not like religion and science are mutually exclusive and one can coexist with the other.	NULL

I was just talking about this to a guy at work today.  I found a beanie in the mud a couple of years ago. Washed it out some and saw that it was a Carhartt. ~$20 hat right there. Warmer than anything else I have.  Then I got a Carhartt jacket for 25¢ at a yard sale. It was already worn some, obviously, but nothing major at all; scuffed up cuffs and no zip. And it made it easier for me to wear at work, where I run the risk of getting it… well… more worn.  Now all I need to find are some coveralls for $1… 😅	NULL

Im a water scout so we have a lot of boats and we also maintain these boats to stay in a good condition. So every winter we get the boats out of the water and we clean them and paint them again so that their wont be any leaks. One winter I guess around 4 years ago we had flipped one of the boats to clean and paint the side that is normally under water. This meant that there were a lot of shells and little oysters sticking to the surface which I tried to sweep of using a broom. I did this standing on the boat and when I was done I jumped of the boat holding the broom in my hand. But unfortunately  the broom hit the ground first and I kind of jumped on the broomstick which almost pierced me right through my chest. Luckily it didnt but I couldnt breath or shout for help for a good 5 minutes. I really thought I was going to die and thanked everyone in my life for the amazing times. And then someone finally found me and helped me through it all until I started to breath and talk again.   TLDR: jumping off a boat on to a broom almost piercing myself right through the chest.	NULL

It's worth noting that the two aren't mutually exclusive.  You can be agnostic *and* atheist at the same time, just like you can be agnostic and Christian.  To put it in simple terms, being agnostic just means that you don't know for sure, whereas being atheist means you don't believe...so an agnostic atheist doesn't believe in god but isn't totally sure.  I would be considered more of a gnostic atheist because I am certain that there is no god.  Can't speak for OP, though.	NULL

What's the point of having hundreds of nuclear heads, if you make it clear you are not going to use them?  How do you define "World"?  I don't think that would entail a large scale war like Ww1 and Ww2. It would be easier to invade other countries, control their resources and block trade with your enemy.  Add propaganda to the mix, and you get an extremely volatile social atmosphere. Enough to make government fall, by the hands of its own people.   In the countries at war, we would have lots of random shortages.   In the countries that got invaded, poverty would increase because most resources will be directed towards the invading power. So how would they react? They would be pissed off, but what can you do against American, Chinese or Russian capitalism?  Not so much. They could wipe out your country if they wanted to, just to make a step forward in their destabilization strategy.	NULL

Firat, let me say that I'm not 20/20. HOWEVER... I recently started taking oral taurine in the morning after I discovered that it seems to make me alert (I read that it was supposed to be calming, but not with me). After a week or so of doing this, off and on, I noticed that things were in slightly better focus--just crisper--about a half hour later. So I looked around a bit and discovered that there are actually prescription taurine eyedrops out there. Apparently, taurine is concentrated in the eye, and a deficiency can contribute to cataracts. I'm just a layman, but found this very interesting, since it seems like I just stumbled on to something that seems to help. I'm nearly 60, and in good health, btw.

I believe the concept is that a couple has been in a fight and, after it is resolved, have sex. It's mostly bullshit that people tell themselves, especially with ex's.

So, sometimes, people will break up and find themselves coming back to one another for physical affection.  Filling a void with sex instead of what that void is actually missing is a waste of time.

Honestly if you're asking the question, you're most of the way there.   What helped me understand it a bit more is to "think about thinking". Or some people call it meta thinking. When you're angry, or bored, or sad, or excited - take a second to ask yourself some questions. Why are you that way? Have you been sad/angry etc more, or less, recently? Why? If you act in a way that appears to hurt someone around you - Why did you act that way, and why do you think they reacted that way? Are you more excited/bored than people around you? Did your emotion lead you to a decision that, in hindsight, was particularly good or bad? In 30 years, do you think you'll look back on the current period of life and think it was good, bad, or you won't even remember it?   Try to ask yourself a few of these questions every now and then, and it'll get easier and become more of a habit. Hopefully it will help you become happier in the long term and make those around you happier because they are around you.	NULL

Theres the video of the Brazilian gangsters in a slum running into someone’s house and stabbing this bound guy, after this they start cutting him open through his chest cavity and stomping open his rib cage. They then cut ans rip out his beating heart before biting into infront of the camera while screaming their local gang. The screams of the guy while this is happening and the laughing of the people doing it was kind of fucked.  This would be tied with the one where the guy chainsaws of the other guys head but only does it a little bit and the sound of the gargling is horrific. The other guy who is about to meet the same fait is totally terrified. He then gets chainsawed but they go all the way through and you can see his brain stem come out.   South America is fucked.	NULL

My completely non-religious friend suddenly became disturbingly religious and sent me exactly 30 youtube videos about religion in a span of 2 days. At one point, I told her I wasn't interested and that she should learn to take no for an answer and she replied "I don't feel rejected, you're not rejecting me."  Before that conversation, she harbored anti-vaxxer views and was generally distrustful of science. She watched lots of conspiracy theories, and at one point, she may have joined an MLM.  Too bad, I hope she gets out of that rabbit hole because her imaginary God knows I've tried helping her.	NULL

Thx for the honest opening for discussion. I kind of was making a provocative statement but lowkey believe in it. I just think that if people don’t understand how there’s rap for every type of person and that when it’s brilliant, it’s as brilliant as some of the most highly revered art in”high” culture. People who don’t like it don’t understand the context of it, and/or haven’t delved deeply into it. It’s a culmination of hundreds of years of oppression into a form of expression that’s on par with any other genre. And with any genre there’s shit that sucks, but there’s a lot of shit that’s incredible.    I know that all sounds kind of heady and ethereal but maybe lmk what bands/artists you’re super into and I can recommend some rap I find just as aesthetically/intellectually/emotionally/etc. stimulating and discuss why.

Well it's a good question, with no good answer I'm aware of, maybe you can research that, see that's what science is about, a bunch of people trying to think of explanations (conjecture or hypothesis) for the things they see (observation), then trying to come up with ways to test their explanations (experiments) then they check each other's work (peer review) after enough of these explanations are gathered and tested over a specific topic we get a theory, which is just a system of explanations that have been individualy tested, verified and reviewed thousands of times by thousands of people.

One the most stupid TV myths. When a toddler or someone with dementia is suddenly gone and you can't find them in the immediate area, calling for help right away is a good idea. When your lid always comes home from school right away and is now two hours late it's ok to start calling around and if no one knows what's going on, call the emergency line.   A capable adult not answering their phone for half a day, not such a big issue. And if someone freaks out when their spouse can't be reached any time no matter what that could point towards some very unhealthy relationship dynamics.	NULL

I don’t believe in a god because of the way I see religion.   Anything and everything we couldn’t explain, we assumed it was done by some higher being. Creation of the universe? God did it. Where mankind came from? Oh god made us. Why the world has oceans? God flooded the planet.   The bible and other religious texts are stories made up to explain things we couldn’t at the time as stories are the best way we humans learn and share information in an interesting and engaging way.   This doesn’t mean I don’t support those who want to believe. I think religion plays a good part in people’s lives as it inspires them to become a better version of themselves. I, however, don’t get that from religion so I don’t feel the need to follow one	NULL

The insurance company is out money, and they will likely turn around and charge their customers more over time to make up for it. The money to pay for the stuff you stole is putting someone out somewhere - money doesn’t just pop into existence when needed to cover insurance claims. You’re also causing the owner to have to make the insurance claim in the first place, and they lose business because they no longer have the inventory you stole.	NULL

i agree, but that feeling passes, and your body adapts to burning fat instead of carbs which you have just eaten. however, please note that it can take a little while to transition from a carb burner to a fat burner.... moreso if you have never denied your body carbs because your biochemical pathways for utilising fat are probably not very strong (because you have never used them before), so ease into it. start with skipping breakfast, then breakfast and lunch, if you can do that your probably fasting 16hours a day. then skip a day.... proceed as you feel more comfortable with it. i think its my new superpower tbh	NULL

Pretty fuckin hard socialist/left wing here  The US Left are conservatives in different clothes...  True leftist politics are all but unrecognizable to most US citizens, and some would be thought to be actual right wing policy (such as firearms and personal freedoms)  I like guns, I enjoy owning them, shooting them, cleaning them, teaching others how to safely use, own, and clean them, and I conceal carry everywhere I go (so long as I'm going to a place legal to do so)  Corporate news media, while not so called "FaKe NeWs" per say, is a cancer in our society since it purposely puts forward  decisive content and advances extreme sides by giving them equal airplay to moderate sides this making the extreme side legitimate in the eyes of the public.  So, I dislike corporate media.	NULL

At my birthday party one year in college my friends were taking things too far about teasing me when I couldn’t chug a smirnoff ice, and I wound up throwing something down on the table (which hit the girl sitting next to me) followed by smacking our landline phone off the TV stand and into the wall, leaving a huge dent in the wall. I then stormed halfway to my room before turning around and playing it all off like I was just joking the whole time. Needless to say it was a little awkward and tense after that.  I don’t normally have anger issues, but I was fairly intoxicated and didn’t like being put on the spot and having twenty people laughing in my face.   A temporary lapse of judgement that haunts me to this day, and something they’ll probably always remember when thinking about me.	NULL

Had a badger attack my father at one of our Scottish cousins NYE wedding. My dad went outside for a piss and a badger jumped out of the trees and tried to break my dad's legs. At least I think it was a badger according to my dad's description. My aunt could hear roaring outside and my dad was staggering with blood spraying and his two legs about to seize from under him. My aunt cleaned him up and he continued to drink and party. Next day he was in agony and passed out his pain was so severe. The man had fractures in his legs and literally his shin bone had two major incisions like teeth mark in his shin. I'll never forget that NYE as long as I live. That's why I don't enjoy it.

its not hating women.  you need to get that out of your head completely.  Calling out shitty people is not hating every women unlike subs like FDS 2X Feminism and misandry fetish those clearly show hate yet nothing is done.  And i highly doubt that happen cause in most countries something like that is life in prison for men.  had you made any allegations you would of gotten checked in every way imaginable.  So to recap. That sub isnt hate for calling out individual people doing bad things to bad people and getting karma back.   i think you dont understand what hate really is.	NULL

I got a DUI in 2011 in the state of Kentucky while I was in the Army. I messed up, but dealt with the consequences, fulfilled my obligations  (license suspension and DUI classes) and paid my fines. I always had a PA license and moved back to PA a year later.  **SEVEN* years later, I’m renewing my PA license and I get a notification from PennDot that because I had a DUI in KY in 2011, my PA license would be suspended for 1 year and I’d have to pay a fine and take DUI classes.  I think it’s a clerical error and try to call Kentucky DOT for my records and proof that i completed the requirements.  I was told that my DUI was so old that it had been expunged and there is no record of it to provide to KY. Efforts to obtain records through the police or a lawyer were unsuccessful. PennDOT would not accept this answer.  $10,000 in attorney fees and 9 months of no driving later, the situation finally gets sorted out. It **WAS** a clerical error in both KY and PA and I didn’t have to go through any of that if someone had just done their job.	NULL

I do not consider them as allies, but as "opponents" to outwit as long as I can, and I am kind of alone. "Lonely me VS world" kinda thing.	NULL

One summer I was playing video games with my mates when I heard a meow it was feint as I had a headset on but I was sure I heard something. I assumed it to be an ambient sound it was a Halloween event in the game I was playing after all. I was in the middle of a comp match so couldn't really get up to search but I looked around my room and saw nothing. Just to add I was home alone and it was very late in the night around 1 in the morning.   My game was over so I went to the home page then went to the bathroom. As I was washing my hands I heard a very loud meow followed by a hiss. I looked about and saw a tiny bit of blood in my bath I thought little of it assumed it was just a new shower gel my housemate got.  I went back to my game and mid match my plant in my hall was knocked down that's when I got scared. I left mid match to search around my house (I was playing r6 siege so I was in the hunting mindset) I went into into the bathroom again terrified this time nothing was there when I turned around I saw a dark figure run into my room I did what every sane person dose and grabbed a 3 iron then went into my room.   I saw a box from under my bed get pushed out. Then a dark figure jumps out at me I slapped it over the face with my golf club (not hard because I was jumped at and barely could swing but enough to make it fall onto my bed) thank god my microphone was muted or my mates would have heard a very loud high pitched manly scream.   It was a fucking cat. I fed it and gave it a blanket then took it to the vet the next day it was alright thankfully and I adopted it. Her name is Ruby her nickname is scaredy cat	NULL

I am not sure why your mother got angry when you asked this perfectly reasonable question. The real answer is that we do not know.  On the other hand, I feel it is a shame to base your judgement on the reaction of one person. You could speak to some more open-minded followers of God and see what they say (yes, they do exist).  The thing I have a hard time understanding about Atheists is how they cannot accept that there is a creator. For example, let's take an app for a phone. This has been put together by a programmer/developer using code and specific methodologies. In this instance we can accept that the app was created by someone skilled or, in some cases, a genius. When we look at the world, we witness some incredible things. A spider spinning a web. Child-birth. A chameleon changing colours. Patterns in flowers. Our body's ability to recover itself from cuts and bruises. How can it be that things certainly more complicated than an app just came to be? From a big bang? Really?  Disclaimer: Here for a friendly debate - not here to preach or ridicule.	NULL
I'm the exact opposite (left but I support the death penalty).

Bro don’t be one of those people that say that it doesn’t matter and it’s not an excuse. If you are referring to people that don’t have said disorders yet still blame it on them(self diagnosed) you got a point. But people that do have it, struggle. A lot. I have ADHD and it’s not fun. Not being able to choose when you do homework sucks. I have to base it on when I take my pill. A pill that makes me lifeless. I lost a lot of friends after I started taking a pill. Because people found me boring and lifeless. They didn’t like talking to me. I found myself without many friends at all and those I had didn’t like talking to me. ADHD can tear your life apart.

Yeah, I’m a super lefty (aside from my 2nd amendment opinions, hey there answer to this thread) in a place (literally neighborhood, not just general region) where homeless issues are a big deal. Some people are all for “cool let them be” and others are all for “round them up!” and due to the actual real life execution of said solutions, I’m definitely somewhere towards the right of “go to jail.”   For clarity, my area is dealing with nomadic tent cities, where every time, resources for housing, sobriety, etc are offered, but the people who would rather stay high and without responsibility would rather move to the next tent city. The tent cities are public health hazards…feces, open bar drug use, a thriving theft market, harassment, etc…these things run rampant. Despite the offers of housing and help, those who wish to not live by any rules just move their tents to another block to endanger another group of people. And keep on stealing bikes, or anything else of value to continue to be able to pay for more meth/crack/heroin. I’ve literally watched groups of homeless people block the wind for another in their crew to light up a meth pipe. In broad daylight, on a major thoroughfare. Something has to give, and being soft on this issue isn’t fucking working.	NULL

Needs to not only be free, but automatically issued to every eligible voter without requiring them to lift a finger. There also needs to be a back-up system or database so that nobody is disenfranchised due to homelessness, temporarily displaced due to wildfires/domestic abuse/etc, recent victim of theft or fraud, or simply lost the card.   I don't trust that the federal or state governments can pull this off without disenfranchising some - and those who do get disenfranchised are the ones whose vote is literally their only way to participate. People on the margins don't donate money or time, attend town halls, or join advocacy/lobbying groups.   In the end, the cost is too high and the risk too great, to solve a problem that doesn't really exist. Ineligible voters casting votes/eligible voters casting more than one is virtually non-existent.

It's also heavily situational. By that I mean that things like how much sleep you've been getting in general and got the night before, how much you've been eating as undereating causes your autonomic nervous system to panic, as well as things like caffeine intake or level of exercise. I fully believe if I didn't have a 75% active job (other 25% is standing in place so still kinda active) and regularly consume caffeine I would be a tantrum monster.  I also recently noticed I was getting angry all the time (but not lashing out at anything except vidya) and it hit me that I'd let my diet slip and was probably only eating like 2,000-ish calories a day when I burn well over that through work alone. I started cramming more food in my mouth and got up to around 3,500 a day and suddenly my anger just never came back over the same stupid shit that had been pissing me off before.   I feel like diet is the most underappreciated aspect of mental health.	NULL

it doesnt really make sense scientifically, nor does it match my beliefs,, but i believe that if we do have a god its probably smthn cool or soemthing that'd make sense like conciousness or something, not some cruel man in the sky that'll send you to hell for ridiculous shit  it feels like the biblical version of god is to christians as santa is to children, just something to keep people "good" and in check, and even as a really little kid i had my doubts about christianity and god, i relaly hate how i was forced to learn something that i didnt believe in. i only ever believed in a god or prayed to that god when i thought my grandpa would die. but then i wondered if everyone worships this guy and he has this like, cult following pretty much, then why is he so cruel.   i think thats when i lost  all belief. my mom would always get angry atme when i'd doubt what she said about the bible, or a god, but she could never back herself up.  i wish people wouldn't blindly follow religions that they were taught at birth, and instead do their research, find a religion that they can really believe in, or maybe even become an atheist instead of blindly following what a book tells them without even thinking outside of the box, i think its why people can be so stupid sometimes  the earth and the universe is so fucking weird though?? like just think ab quantum mechanics . that shit is fucking weird. im  13 so i obviously dont have a very concrete understanding but its so weird, and the fact that all of that weird shit is the building blocks of the universe is just weirder, but it doesn't really seem odd because our perceptions of things have been regulated to what our daily life is   but dont look outside the box too much or else you'll be believing in some weird shit, but i cant really say much because i think the earth might genuinely be trying to kill us	NULL

I’ve been confused for a long time why the American people are so hell bent on voting. The overall concept is great “your voice matters.” But in the US, your voice doesn’t matter.  You vote to ‘influence’ politicians to then vote for your preferred policies/candidates (which they aren’t obligated to). For example George Bush lost the popular vote. The American people agreed the other person should be president, but Electoral college/politicians went with the candidate that pays lobbyists more (through wars for oil etc).  So my question is, why do you vote when your vote doesn’t affect the outcome? Wouldn’t you prefer reform and change rather than empty promises? Maybe a better question is - how can the American people have legitimate influence over their govt. instead of throwaway votes?  For reference, I’ve lived in the US all my life. This is a throwaway for the inevitable karma hate ill get from saying anything negative about “the freest country in the world.” I know not all US voting works this way, but the Electoral college and presidential vote does, so please keep replies related to when it does happen.

Jupiter is quite white. Like a creamy white. If it's orange, it may be Mars, but it's likely a star.  Binoculars can help, you surprisingly don't need massive telescopes to see planets. Binoculars aren't that sharp and are hard to hold steady, but they're cheaper and easy to borrow.	NULL

Especially when average pay hasn't inflated at the same rate. I'm not talking about minimum wage or anything like that, just the purchasing power of the average consumer.  You used to be able to realistically work your way through college - i.e. work summer jobs and have a part time job and NOT have to take out a loan that will shackle you for the rest of your life.  Same with houses, decades ago, the average American could work a normal blue-collar job (factory worker, boring office job, etc...) and actually afford a house, cars, wife, kids, and go on vacations. In today's day and age, that's not possible without a higher level job, usually required at least a Bachelor's degree... now you're crippled with that loan and stuck with ZERO way to save up for a down payment, let alone afford a mortgage payment...  It just sucks because even if you do literally the EXACT SAME job your parents did, you would be lucky to be able to survive on your own, let alone all the things mentioned above...	NULL

It never really made any sense, but the final nail in my religion coffin was when my great aunt died. She was in critical condition and I prayed like I was told to do and I said "If you want me to believe in you, don't take my aunt yet." She passed away later that night and I decided to end all of my beliefs right then and there.   Every single time someone told me "God has a plan for everyone." or "This is the path God chose for x," it's another reminder that God can't be real if he really planned for kids to get abused, or women to lose their extremely wanted babies, or letting millions of people suffer daily. People like to thank god when things are going right like he did anything to help you get to where you are. I could literally go on forever about how much I hate the Christian religion.	NULL

Yes and no. Win95 was supposed to be the new age of computer gaming. New games were advertised as being Windows 95 compatible, but it was still a giant pain in the ass and a lot of them still used some sort of DOS emulation or front-end to get things to work.   The whole driver situation was a nightmare too. Especially when "graphics cards" were introduced as a seperate entity. Nothing seemed to ever work without some amount of tweaking.

Please don't pet my support ostrich, sir.  Although this pissed me off today. I was walking my dog, a chocolate lab puppy who is pretty big now, but obviously doesn't have good self control, so when I walk her, if I see others coming in my pathway, I'll move, I'll hold the leash close to the collar, and I'll try stop and just pet the dog because she gets pretty anxious sometimes. Anyways today I'm walking her and a group of teens are walking like 5 abreast down the path. Frustrating but whatever, I take my dog and angle off so that I am well clear off them. I don't want my girl getting anxious and biting someone - it's not necessarily likely but I would rather be safe than sorry. Anyway this one girl, literally wearing those "thug life" meme glasses, breaks off from the group to come to my dog. I pick up pace,  angle out even more, but can't really escape because of a building. She is looking at me like she knows what she's doing and is basically saying fuck you at this point. I just rolled my eyes and just said "stupid kid" or "fucking child" or something, but what if my dog bit her? It just invites the potential law suits and maybe gets her put down and for what? Fucking pissed me off.	NULL

Worked with a lady in a grocers once, she was holding a new iPhone which was a piece of shit knock off. She had bought it on the street off a man who came up to her saying he needed to sell it because he had lost money gambling or something. She said she had ‘felt sorry for him’ so bought it, I think for £50? I hope not more than that. She was an absolute idiot, dumbest person I’ve ever met. I hadn’t met someone before then who literally looked like there was nothing going on up there.   Another story, I used to know someone from Tennessee who had about 10 guns. Once on video call when talking about guns and all the shooting that happen in America (I’m from uk) - my point was that it’s much easier to kill someone when you have a gun than without. He turns the camera on the guns and tries to prove (?) to me that they’re not dangerous by shouting at the gun laying there: ‘gun! Shoot!’ Like??? Yes I know the gun can’t shoot by itself, it’s the fact they’re so available in America to be accessed by anyone (like this mentally unstable man) and shot BY THEM that makes them so dangerous!!!

It feels good but probably not as good as you think.

Oral, however, is far nicer, especially if the giver is in tune with your likes and dislikes and has some talent at it.	NULL

I agree they have a lot of potential, but as an older broad, I feel I should add that psychedelics are not for everyone. I have personally witnessed someone basically go insane (paranoid schizophrenic), and someone who had a horrible trip and ended up killing themselves a few days later. Of course, there were other variables, but I definitely think the psychedelic exacerbated whatever was going on. In the case of the suicide, it was very strange. Guy seemed happy overall, though something must have been going on internally. While all suicides have a shock element, I was very, very caught off guard by his death. Whatever happened on that shroom trip seemed to have overwhelmed him    Anyways, They aren’t risk free	NULL

Same for me for the job. I would quit my jobs in black out rage and then immediately get a new one, confident I could do it this time. rinse and repeat for about 7 years.  And yes, I had to see their doctors twice and both times they were like "nah u fine"  My lawyer hired an independent doctor basically to get someone outside of my regular ones to agree with them that I had shit wrong with me. Only had one 2 hour meeting with her and when you go back and look over her report she pretty much said the same things. All my doctors filled out the paperwork consistently, that I had issues getting along with others, that I was prone to emotional outbursts, had issues with authority, and had physical ailments that left me in constant pain.  &#x200B;  The judge found that my physical issues were only "mild" (boy do I wish there was some kind of machine I could use to transfer my pain to other people) but in the award letter stated something along the lines of "upon reconsideration, ailments of claimant were more severe than originally thought"  &#x200B;  Honestly I do NOT understand why I wasn't awarded when I applied back in 2014 (after my fiance's suicide) because even that report, which was from one of their doctors cited the same exact issues as all my doctors. Doctors that I wasn't even seeing yet as of 2014. Everything was consistent!!!!  &#x200B;  I applied a 2nd time in 2018 after a suicide attempt but my family convinced me I was making it uip and I didn't go through with it. Finally Jan 2020 I couldnt take it anymore and was going to admit myself to the hospital but I didnt because of financial reasons, I quit and applied immediately. this time I stuck through. they denied me in May 2020 and then June 2020, got the lawyer Sept 2020. Saw the judge June 2021 and was awarded in Aug 2021.  &#x200B;  I don't think I could have done it though if my husband wasn't making decent money. he supported us, along with credit cards for all of 2020. but it was sadly very convenient that my car was almost destroyed in a hail storm and then we got those stimulus checks. Kept the insurance money for my car and used the stimulus checks to live off.  &#x200B;  My monthly benefits are not that amazing. They definitely couldn't support me if I were by myself unless I lived in income based housing or had roommates or lived with family. However, I do have a part time job that brings home $500 a month. And my husband of course works his butt off.	NULL

To me I think in this sense loving yourself means respecting your worth and acknowledging your value.  Not assuming things are your fault, that you deserve bad things, that people don’t like you or that you are probably the bad thing the bully says you are without really assessing that first.  That’s it for me.  I live my life not afraid to take care of myself how I feel I need to and being okay with giving what I can to a limit and then saying sorry I can’t.  And like the commenter before was saying about the ladies at work who see those good aspects and are drawn to them, what people see when they look at you is just as true and valid as how you see yourself.  You accomplish what you put out there even if you don’t feel the same inside. The outer you is still a real part of you as much as your inner self.  Kind of a vague concept but things don’t bother you as much when you respect worth and know your value.	NULL

Whenever you "draw" the outline of your playspace, you can see the grid (sometimes fainter than others) when you play games. This is in SteamVR, though, and I'm not sure if it translates to other headsets.

That’s a fair viewpoint. Many modern Christians do a horrible job at making the religion accessible in an ever-changing world. Personally I see ditches on both sides of the road for really any belief system and it’s that on one side you fall into making the belief so new and cool that it completely misses the point, and on the other hand you don’t adapt at all and it becomes incompatible and “old.” Thanks for taking the time to respond lol.

And you could eat something else to go with your plump rabbit. The problem is with eating only wild rabbits in extreme cold. They don't supply enough calories to stay warm and eating more of them won't improve the situation. Eat their bone marrow, their brains, that's where most of the fat is. The liver is the best source of micronutrients and sugar. The stomach contents might be worth a look if there's nothing toxic growing in the area. Sheer muscle isn't enough for a human to live on for a longer period of time.	NULL

I have never found, nor been presented with any evidence of God or a higher power. No religion has presented their case in a way that doesn't logically contradict itself at some point.

I met my husband on Tinder, and he’s the single greatest partner I’ve ever had. We’re currently expecting our first child. When I was using dating apps I had some bad luck, but I tried to approach it by asking myself, “Does this look like a real person that I could see myself with long term?” And by real I mean genuine/sincere. I met a couple guys who were clearly just looking for hookups, met a couple with no chemistry between us, made 1 truly excellent friend (we still keep in touch and hang out when we’re both in the area), and met a few really cool guys where we both recognized we weren’t quite right for each other. I would say just be honest with yourself about what you’re looking for, and don’t be afraid to pass on “cute/hot but not my type.”	NULL

I had a freind in middle school. Well call him R. R was very skinny and regularly biked to my house (across town from where he lived - so about 2 or 3 miles each way). We would mostly play games and talk. He came from a strict household, and looking back, from what he said, his father may have been abusive but idk. I was in middle school so I just kind of didn't mention that to anyone. It's not like I knew what to do with ingo like that.  We hang out daily for like 2 solid years. Then, poof. I see him 1 time in 9th grade and suddenly he's EXTREMELY obese. I hadn't seen him in more than a year at that point, and was shocking so, I asked him "what happened?" He gave me some medical sounding answer (I don't remember what exactly) and left.   I have not seen him since that day and it's been over a decade now. He has a Facebook post with a photo from that day (recognize the background) and says he's a mechanic in a neighboring town. No posts on his Facebook page though other than people wondering what happened to him, and no reply to those posts.   In all honesty I have no clue what happened to him.

I think the real bureaucratic nightmare is when you have 100s of communities all making their own different rules. There are real economics of scale to be had by making rules at the federal level. Of course you are right that the downfall is that the "size/shape" has to be a compromise and this will lead to inefficiencies. Which is more efficient depends on exactly what we are talking about. The military is probably a good example of something we want run at the federal level, ordinances about how you need to keep your lawn not so much.	NULL

However it went undiagnosed and unopposed for several months so I am *WRECKED* still.  GI health is not something people want to screw around with. The prep for colonoscopies, etc sucks, but I'd never recommend putting it off.	NULL
There’s a fine line between “you’re fine, stop acting up” and “no, this is bad, what the fuck” and I’ve been walking it for days now.  Yesterdat, I went to my room to sleep at 2am, fell asleep at 5:30am, woke up at 1:40pm today, and got up at 3pm. This has been a reoccurrence since work broke for the Christmas, around the 20th, so, it’s safe to say this isn’t healthy  It’s currently 3:39am as of now, listening to my Spotify playlist to stop myself from introspectivity.   I’d say, not great, I feel like there is help to be received, but A) can’t be arsed looking for it, B) there are things I don’t want to share.  How’s everyone else doing?	NULL

I think they're beautiful people, but I don't think they did right by my husband. He works hard and he has a good heart and seems like my in-laws never appreciate it his effort or fostered his creativity. Because he has a lot of great qualities, that seems to be a point of friction for them.    but I would like to note I very much dislike my mother-in-law hinting to aggressively about wanting grandchildren from me.  Like Miss lady, are you going to pay for all of these doctors appointments and etc?   and I also feel like my in-laws did not do enough to inspire family pride in my husband.  But I come from a very close-knit family, and I'm very proud of my family. And if it's on the rare occasion you find me bragging, it's normally about how awesome my family is. Yet my husband doesn't ever seem like he has one nice thing to say about his family, and that kind of breaks my heart.	NULL

I do think so. I met him about 8 years ago when he transferred to my place of work. He was married so we were only ever friends and stayed in touch even after he left. We have so much in common, from being born the same year to our love for geekish things and he's super easy to vibe with, all around super sweet guy. His wife left him last year and he took it pretty hard but has been improving. Several of my coworkers, a friend, and my Mom have mentioned we should date. He came over yesterday to hang out and watch movies and... some things happened. I'm not sure where it will lead but I'm here for it.	NULL
They call it the god of the gaps because as soon as something gets a reasonable scientific explanation, it's no longer attributed to "that's just how gods made it". That number of things is always going down, not up. Reason always prevails over the question-ending "gods did it", and after a few thousand years of "no it didn't, this is how that works, and it's pretty obvious", it's pretty obvious that "gods did it" is just a cop-out answer that isn't remotely true, and that it never has been.  If you're constantly bombarded with evidence that Santa Clause isn't real, eventually insisting that a man travels around the world putting presents into people's houses isn't childish fun, it's willful ignorance of reality.

I had a friend in primary school, his name was Gustavo. We basically played together during the recess everyday. He was a good person, but a bit reserved, while me and the other colleagues usually met during weekends, his family never allowed him. We all didn't know where he lived nor had his telephone number. In a certain year, he didn't come back to school and just vanished and we completely lost contact. Some colleagues said his family moved to another city, others just said he moved to a private school. I never saw him again and years late when social media became a thing I never found him in social media, which is very strange.	NULL

I did a couple essays and presentations in high school and college about it. I’m for it, for a few reasons.   There are a few cases (such as Kenneth McDuff) were the killer/criminal is supposed to get the death penalty but are given a second chance and use that chance to go out and murder again.  Although I’m more in favor of the older methods instead of todays “humane” methods of execution such as the lethal injection. There are multiple cases where the anesthetic doesn’t fully work before the paralyzing drug is injected, which gives the sensation of burning throughout the entire body. This leaves the condemned person in agony while the final injection takes place that stops the heart. Doesn’t seem very humane to me. I’m more in favor of firing squads or similar “lights out” methods.	NULL

Its very hard to believe in something that seriously has no basis. You aren’t supposed to just believe you have “faith”, how can you have faith in something you’ve never seen?

Also i don’t think the world would have gone the way it has if a god existed. Also you believe in your god(s), and dismiss any other gods that “exist.” How does that make sense that their god exists but ours doesnt? or vice versa.  Basically there’s literally no evidence of one existing, and there’s way too much stuff that just makes no sense.	NULL

Specifically by not looking for them. We both grew up in the same town and went to high school and college together and despite traveling in the same circles, never really met. We were at several parties together and can remember individual times of meeting each other, but just never really talked. We had some mutual friends who go married while I was out of the country but both him and my roommates were in the wedding. It was truly a dumpster fire of an event but it made my roommates realize that me and him would be perfect together. Unfortunately, he was going to school out of state and my only serious relationship had been a LDR so I wasn’t really interested in another.  After college he decided to spend a year overseas doing volunteer work and I dated a guy for a short while who really did a number on my self esteem. During this time I was coming to terms with my very conservative upbringing concerning sex and he was doing the same. Independently we both decided that if an opportunity arose to loose our virginity then we would take it, even if the person was a stranger but seemed safe.  He came back to town and met up with my roommates to catch up and they saw their opportunity to finally have us meet and it all came together. We talked for hours that first night, started cuddling on the couch during a movie and one thing lead to another and he ended up in my bed instead of the guest room. We tried to have something casual at first (he was doing another year of volunteering though this time in our country) and I still didn’t want a LDR. But 2 weeks before he left again we both realized that there was something really great about our connection and decided to give it a shot. Because he was 3,000 miles away our relationship which started out as physical because 100% about communication. We made a commitment to be open and honest with each other (I cannot stand people who play games and he had been jerked around by a girl the year prior) and we found that a lot of our view aligned as well as were we wanted our futures to go.   We have discussed many times how we’re each other’s best friends and we couldn’t imagine going through life without each other. We’ve been married 3 years now and we’re expecting our first child so we must be doing something right.	NULL

BSB/Nsync/Britney/Spice Girls/etc are really more Xennials than GenX.  That genre is very much made for teenagers; people who were teenagers in 1997-2000 were born 1979-1987.  If you want GenX music, you should go with what was popular in the early 90s: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, REM, B-52s, Lisa Loeb, New Kids on the Block, Madonna, Boyz 2 Men, All 4 One, Counting Crows, etc.  This would be high school for people born 1971-1980, which was peak Gen-X.  Note that the music has a very different feel which mimics the cultural difference between generations well.  Early 90s pop/alternative is angsty, angry, cynical, resigned, and generally pessimistic, usually featuring a lone singer against a usually-spare, sometimes hostile instrumental backdrop.  Late 90s pop is upbeat, shallow, optimistic, and filled with vocal harmony.	NULL

It certainly falsifies the basic, literal, interpretations but people who follow that style of belief aren't all that common (although, they might seem to be very common depending on what part of the world you're from, if you're in the American Bible Belt I think they are far more common than most other places. The entire universe being created roughly 6000-10000 years ago across 6 specific 24 hour periods with all the plants an animals popping up fully formed is definitely falsifiable.   On the other hand, the official word from the Catholic Church on the topic is "The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers" ie. Science is right but all it's doing is letting God reveal the mechanisms He used for creation, isn't that wonderful?  Claiming "science" as a reason for disbelief is a good reason to disregard some sects of some religions, it isn't a good reason do disregard all religion.

In maybe year 2, age 7, the kids in class all got a gingerbread cookie from the teachers and later would get another if we confessed something we had done during the week that wasn’t nice to our peers (and apologize I guess?). We were going one by one and when it was my turn I confidently said I hadn’t done anything bad and I got a cookie in my hand, but maybe two kids later snitched on me and told everyone about something bad I had done. Tbh I remembered it as not remembering it in the moment that I had done it. The teacher looked shocked and disappointed at me for lying, thought what she would do now when I already was snacking on the cookie. She said I wasn’t allowed to eat more of it and to put it in the middle of the table. I protested but eventually gave in. When the teacher later looked away, I took the rest of the cookie and probably ate it with a “wetening” technique so she wouldn’t hear it crack.	NULL

I'm sure I won't get much love for this but I disagree. I think all drugs should be freely available to use, purchase, manufacture, and distribute. (yes, that one too) If the government has any role it's to ensure those substances are clean and pure. Socialized medicine should also be available for those seeking treatment.  It's everyone's own choice to destroy their own life be it with drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, rage, or Faberge eggs. I have many friends and family members who have done this... some alive and some dead. This has not changed my opinion on this topic.  I also hold the unpopular opinion that the freedom of the individual is more important than the needs, wants, or cost to the many.	NULL

Quite a few, since I never listened to reason and made a lot of mistakes that I got to learn from:  • Stop wasting your time finding excuses for people that constantly display red flags (friends or partners alike).  •You cannot change the nature of people and changing yourself to please them won’t convince them to treat you better, if anything they will take you for granted even more.   •Don’t be afraid to cut ties with old friends if you grew so much apart that you no longer see eye to eye.  •Don’t just stay because you have a past with someone otherwise you’ll lose your opportunity at a better future.  • Lying almost always means there is something more that the other person is hiding than what you just found out. Lying is never a good sign.  • Learn to spot peer pressure and resist the urge to do as others do or tell you to do.  • If it makes you uncomfortable in ANY way, do what you have to do to leave that situation.  • Always trust your gut! If something triggers a fight or flight response trust it and leave that situation/person/relationships etc.  • If your grandparents are still alive, call them once in a while. They won’t be around for long and elderly people can be very alone and lonely so a phone call can brighten someone’s day.  And most importantly: be kind, especially to yourself.	NULL

This is so relatable! I've told my mom several times since I first told her 8-10 years ago that I don't believe in Christianity. Here is a text message I received from her just last week!  "Psalm 27: 4  One thing I ask of the Lord. This is what I seek. That I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever. To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and behold Him in His temple.  It’s only when we fix our eyes upon Jesus that we can value ourselves the way He values us."

I have often wished I could believe, I just can't. I'm more agnostic than atheist but I think that even if there is a 'higher power' it's so dang high that we're not even blips on its radar. I've never been able to wrap my head around why a loving god would rule using a system of guilt, threats and punishment. Like, biscuits taste nice but enjoying them means you suffer for all eternity and when good people die young / in horrible ways it's always because god loved them too much or it was part of a bigger plan. Umm... but why, though? No one has ever been able to explain in a way that clicked for me and suddenly made religion believable.	NULL

Ah let’s see what are some faves.

Not exactly cooking but you can make your own limoncello really easily and give it out as wedding favors or similar and everyone will be impressed.   Oh, curry!

I think that's certainly a part of it. Most of the superhero shows I watched showed men achieving amazing things - literally saving the world - and still struggling to get the only thing that really mattered... this kiss from the love interest. Even Superman struggled to get Louis Lane!  I also think there's just a terrible logic to it: women tend to be much more selective, so when one gets selected it feels like it really actually means something - about who you are as a person - your value.   There's that saying "man is the measure of all things" - but in truth: women are the ones who measure men, judge us, and decide if we're good enough for sex. The meaning of sex is, therefore, inexorably linked to this apparent process of evaluation.  I think growing older I have at least come to see how little sex REALLY means about ones actual self: so much of getting laid is just being in the right place at the right time - just being there as the planets align so that one "gets lucky" - it is based on circumstances and the circumstantial - the mood of the woman at the time, whether or not she likes your shirt, all kinds of arbitrary variables that have nothing to do with my essence as a being.

I used to be fervently alt-left but I think we'd fed too much into the 24/7 us versus them news cycle and we've started frothing at the mouth over everything little thing and I'm starting to just want out politics altogether because if it.   I think the Chinese tarrifs were a good idea in spirit and we're not the only country attacking Chinese exports. The Chinese manufacturing apparatus has gone off the rails to where the government is forcing middleschoolers to work in factories and we're feeding into it. Now with all the crazy big brother stuff theyre getting into disappearing Muslims and dissenters I think we should ban all Chinese imports, sanction china and heavily penalize corporations who do business with them. The funny thing is this is probably not even a left-right thing anymore, but when trump wanted to start shit with China it suddenly became one.   I hate Trump with as much as one can but it irked me that rather than nudging him in the right direction when he was spouting off like an idiot about tariffs, space force, transgenders, covid etc the left-wing called him a monster, baby etc and so he just leaned into it and made things so..so much worse.

Women calling their men batshit, which isnt what is happening here. Its a third party making that judgement.  Oh and people judging others? Welcome to the internet. Look in the mirror and guess what you’re doing right now.  I am assessing what happened based on what was spoken, and of course called her batshit. Yet you took personal offense as if you were the other party. Your actual implication is that he’s wrong for admitting the tiniest amount of guilt— which frankly is confirming his fear.  Frankly, you mirror the behavior if the woman he complains about in that sense, because admitting guilt, admitting weakness makes him unforgivable.  The facts are when someone behaves in the fashion the woman does as described by the man here, when they’re unable to discern right from wrong, when they lack empathy and self awareness , it means they’re batty. They’ve got mental disorders.   Do I want to be nice to these kinds of people? fuck no. They don’t deserve it.  Yes this is the internet and a public forum. Expect to be judged, especially when you are, in fact, displaying signs of being batty.	NULL

If you go extremely skeptical, you have to ask what you know is true beyond any doubt. The only answer you can come up with is consciousness. Everything you can possibly know is the result of consciousness.   So from that, you are left with two options. You are all there is to existence and everything and everybody else is just a creation of your consciousness, or you are one conscious being out of many.   The argument against the first is that you can't create something just by will alone. You can't imagine a cat in front of you and actually have that cat materialize, so that implies your consciousness is limited, which means you probably aren't all of existence.   Since we're still doing radical skepticism, you can say that there's such a thing as a physical reality that exists without consciousness, so what you are left with is that the universe itself is consciousness, which implies that your and my perspectives are just a small part of the primordial, universal consciousness.   That universal consciousness is what I identify as God. It isn't a being like you and me which can have emotions and desires, because it is all emotions and all desires. It's the collection of all possible conscious states, and our perspective is just a stream within the whole.   It's a form of panpsychic philosophy, so it's not quite a religion. At the same time it isn't a theology, because the totality of existence (the universe) isn't a deity no more than it is under a physicalist philosophy.	NULL

My parents didn’t put much effort into making me religious.  My mother has her own beliefs close to the christian faith but more esoteric   My father is atheist  My 8 y/o self didn’t understand the inconsistencies in the faith. Now that I grew older and learned more, I of course know more or less how stuff happened but it sparked a feeling of mistrust that still prevails to date.  I very much like history and religion is a big part of that. Having learned what the church has done in the past has also not helped in strengthening my faith  I must say though, that the current pope has brought me a bit closer to the church because he seems to be much more tolerant to, say gay people than his predecessors, which I think is quite a step towards the "treat others like you wish to be treated"	NULL

I was between the age of 10-13 and my mother and I went to another church with a group of other people from our church. Because of that I was paying more attention than usual. When it came time for tithes and offering, a man said “we’re trying to raise $500 today” (very ambitious since it was during a recession)   Plate gets passed around I throw my dollar in ready for the next part to happen so I can get back home and I notice that nothing is happening. The same guy who spoke earlier comes up and says “We’re $40 short of $500 we’re not continuing service until we get it!” And at that moment I knew church was a scam and my belief in god stopped.	NULL

You would be surprised, or not, by how much some teachers act like the kids themselves.	NULL
I still do, i never understood people claiming that jumping from 10-15 meters into water is same as jumping on concrete. Even if you do a belly flop you should still be fine from 10 or so meters, you're gonna be red and sore as all hell but you wont die not even close.   Hell the pools here have jumping platforms at 10 and 12 meters and kids are all doing fine after jumping. You'd need to either be rather heavy or jump from really damn high for water to feel like concrete and of course if you land on your back theres a chance you break your back, but if you jump on your back intentionally theres something wrong with you to begin with.   Imo the bigger problem with jumping from big heights is how deep, or shallow, the water is. Jumping from 15 meters makes you go through solid 3-4 meters of water, maybe even more depending on your build and weight. So if you're not sure how deep the water is just dont jump, make sure its deep enough to stop you safely before you hit the bottom. You can lower the amount of depth you get to when you jump by spreading your arms and hands as you hit the water, but its not safe if you're not used to it because it can break your arms or dislocate your shoulders if you dont know what to expect.

Another lefty from a very populated CA city who came to say this! I was in my neighborhood park when I witnessed humane society “officers” (?) ticket dog owners for having their dog off leash while playing fetch. I get it, dogs off leash can be a HUGE danger.  But meanwhile, we have homeless individuals literally shooting up in front the kids play structure, their encampments spread across the park, human feces and needles scattered about, public restrooms are no longer public restrooms—they are personal home offices to the reoccurring homeless individuals that reside at the park. Now why should that tax paying citizen get fined for playing fetch with his dog in a park, yet nothing is being done about the ongoing homeless issue in that same park???	NULL

This will likely get lost in the shuffle but oh well.   When I was about 10 my brother and I were playing in his room. For what ever reason, we decided to see if a piece of homemade fudge would stick to the ceiling. I toss it up there and sure enough it sticks. After a laugh we manage to get it down, all except a small spot about the size of a dime. We thought we were dead but nothing was ever said. Fast forward 25 or so years and while eating a family dinner my mom starts talking about a dark spot on the ceiling in that room that she has watched for decades, afraid that it was mold or a leak. I barely managed to swallow my food before I looked at my brother and we both cracked up. After about 10 minutes of roaring laughter I own up to it and tell her the story.

It’s weird to say but I think different vaginas feel different from the perspective of what I can feel. Sometimes I don’t feel anything and that’s not a knock it’s just not as pleasurable.  Condoms I feel have come a long way (no pun intended). They used to be big boner kills for me because I’m circumcised so I think I have different sensitivity experiences than somebody having sex uncircumcised.  The thinner condoms are amazing but it also adds an air of mental worry in sex because sometimes you feel like you’re not wearing anything at all and occasionally that’s because the condom broke and you should pull out and reorganize haha.  From good or bad, I mean especially with wetness. So taking aside uncontrollables like how a particular vagina is gone feel or whether I’ve got to wear a condom or not to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, au natural wet is great and feels like I’ve accomplished something but I’ve also met women who were into me but didn’t get super wet (idk enough about anatomy to know if that’s simply natural or on me). Either way that’s when a water-based lube comes in handy and makes sex feel slippery and safe and more enjoyable for both parties.  I’m 30 but I’ve long since given up the urge to fuck around. I enjoy watching porn but when I’m in a relationship I’m monogamous and value the relationship beyond the sex, so for me it has to been something beyond ejaculation.  Sex with a partner can be making love but other times it really just be a quickie so in that regard I just revert back to the above stuff.  All that being said, sex wakes up parts of my groin that don’t usually feel anything at all. Attraction to a woman has once even felt like electricity to me, like a jolt of horniness that turns on an animal in me that just wants to fuck.  I can’t explain pleasure to you at this moment, but think of when your legs really want to run. Or when your hands really want to punch. Or when your hips really want to swing and dance. Sex to me as a male feels like a natural urge to reproduce, but as I’ve grown in a time of society I up until now have felt activated in those moments to make my lover and I feel as good as can be, as happy as can be, and ideally to both cum. So sex sort of feels like an obligation in that regard, but it’s not a bad one by any means. Except when a woman says “harder” and I’ve already reached max “harder” capacity 😂	NULL

Its a Sin and Pose spring to mind, lots of great gay/trans characters, and although they're "gay shows" their homosexuality or transness is treated in the same way that heterosexuality in most other media - as in, its just there. Its not the defining trait of the character, its just the trait that got them into that particular situation. And unusually for gay shows they don't play into the writer's obvious coming-of-age-my-straight-crush-is-actually-gay fantasy that is utterly done to death.   Outside of gay shows:  Ian Gallagher from Shameless (though I've only seen the UK version), at least in the early seasons. The show as a whole went pretty downhill towards the end.   Eric from Sex Education. Initially he does come across as this cliché, I spent the first few episodes rolling my eyes but he quickly becomes fleshed out. Especially his relationship with Adam, which is a fantastically done gay character (masc, closeted and confused).  Willow from Buffy the Vampire slayer, though I've heard a few gripes from bi/lesbian women. It was still pretty massive for the time and her sexuality was just an aspect of her as a whole.   The leading males from Brokeback Mountain, the film that broke my soul for several days.   Controversial, but I actually like Mitchell and Cameron from Modern Family. They're right on the border of parody (as is the nature of the show) but I've known far too many gay men like that. And out of all I've listed, I'm actually (sadly) very like Mitchell.   Bill Potts from Dr. Who. Her seasons were awfully written as far as stories go, but I really liked her as a character.   On the really bad side:  Ace Ventura - Pet Detective. I watched that movie as a kid with my Dad, my god that was an awkward conversation. Looking back at it, its pretty horrific.   Boat Trip was just endless cringe with a couple of funny jokes. I don't remember any of the gay characters there existing beyond the purpose of being gay for comedic effect.   Jack Harkness, Dr Who. He was much better in Torchwood, but in Dr Who it just felt like his entire purpose was to make innuendo and provide queer shock value. He never felt like a person.   Kurt from Glee, at least the first few seasons. It never felt like he existed as anything beyond being a homosexual and reminding everyone about it.   Daffyd from Little Britain. Although the character is purposefully parody, and written and played by a gay man, there was nothing to the character but their homosexuality and was actually quite damaging at the time. It gave straights quips to bully gay people with.   Marty from Independence Day is straight (hah) example of token gay played for laughs. If he was cut from the movie nothing would change.   Gil from Fraiser. I don't think I even need to explain this one.   Sam from the Dynasty reboot. I just can't even find the words.   I'm sure there are more modern ones on the bad side but I've been specifically advised to avoid particular shows so I can't say for sure. My partner watches more "trashy" shows and tells me horror stories.	NULL

I was seeing this guy for a few months. I found out pretty late that he had 3 kids! Kids aren’t an issue to me, but holding that information back is and then here’s the kicker. The last time he came by the kids got brought up again (I’d ask how they are doing) I asked him when he goes to see them and spend time with them and he said I seen my son for 30mins today before I came here. He gave up spending time with his children to come hang out but would talk about being a good father. Then then! This man gone say to me (he’s adopted btw) he gifted his twin girls to his parents because they could never have kids and they should be grateful to him for giving them the opportunity to have these two girls from birth. I said I’m sorry what the fuck did you just say to me??? You GIFTED your children to your parents??? Gifted?? I was baffled and completely turned off and told him he was a trash bag for that. You didn’t gift them shit you dumped your twins on them! They didn’t have a choice who was gonna take care of them?? Not you. The mother wasn’t in the picture either gave her rights up. I literally can’t make this shit up.	NULL
Nah. They were best friends for YEARS. Everyone deserves an explanation of what happened, or at least a chance to ASK for an explanation. Making multiple accounts repeatedly would be excessive, but just doing what’s necessary to send ONE message saying “Hey, it’s X, can I ask what happened?” is reasonable. I can’t imagine not being able to simply ask a close friend why they never want to talk to me again.  You said it’s stalker behavior. Let’s see:  **Stalker** >a person who harasses or persecutes someone with unwanted and obsessive attention  Okay, so the first qualification is that it has to be harassment or persecution  **Harass** >1. subject to aggressive pressure or intimidation.  >2. make repeated small-scale attacks on  Okay, making one fake account to send a message isn’t “aggressive”, “intimidating”, or “repeated”  **Persecute** >1. subject (someone) to hostility and ill-treatment, especially because of their race or political or religious beliefs.  >2. harass or annoy (someone) persistently.  It isn’t “hostility”, “ill-treatment”, or “persistent” (if done once)  So the **stalker** definition says that **harassment** or **persecution**, both of which wouldn’t be the case here, also would have to be **unwanted** and **obsessive** attention. Well, the attention is likely unwanted, but I would hardly call it obsessive. I’ve made a fake facebook account in 5 minutes before, and I hardly think doing that to reach a close friend of many years counts as obsession. And even if it did, it’s still not harassment or persecution. Ergo, not only is this reasonable behavior, but it’s categorically not stalking.	NULL

To finish communion my Lutheran pastor met with each kid and their parents. In the room with my parents behind me, he went thru his shpeel and at the end asked "do you have any questions?" My dad chimed him and told me to ask the pastor what I asked my dad a few days before. "How do we know the Greek gods don't exist?" My pastor thought for a second, picked up a pencil, and said "praying to the Greek gods was like praying to this pencil..." I at 12 years old or so knew that was a terrible answer with no validity so I lost faith and realized there's no tangible proof besides here say for an ancient book about miracles and a guy in the sky all powerful but selfish enough to want us to worship only him despite our free will he chose to give us.

So this guy had posted something anti-Muslim stuff on Facebook, I commented politely explaining where he was mistaken.

I didn't know what simian meant at the time, so he explained it means ape-like, then continues laughing while I just kind of have a confused concerned look on my face.    Then he suddenly stops laughing gets a really angry look on his face, points at me, you can kind of tell he's trying to tense every muscle to puff himself up because he looks like he's about to shit himself.

Not a brand, per-se but I will stan for Kathy Griffin all day long. She is possibly the hardest working and most business savvy person in show business history and was railroaded, black listed and maligned for essentially telling the world the truth about Trump.    It’s okay if you don’t think she’s funny or don’t like her humour, but public opinion and making fun of her on shows like Family Guy is just a safe-zone of misogyny. After her blacklist she actually made more money than she ever did in her career (10s of millions in a year) by letting go her staff and agents and people who’d turned on her to manage her own career and get bookings and deals for herself.    This is a woman who has been through a fucking shit storm. Her brother was a pedophile who molested her, her parents were alcoholics and her siblings all eventually died of cancer (she developed lung cancer this year). She would hitchhike or get her mom to drive her to improv classes from 19 years old where she basically lived at home with no money and no job for years before she got a break. She developed an eating disorder, gained a bunch of weight and was frequently the butt of many jokes about her looks, causing her to get a significant amount of plastic surgery (nose job, lipo, etc.).   Her first husband stole all of her money and left her, forcing her to reinvent herself from the bring of bankruptcy and she was able to come back stronger than ever. She’s never drank, smoked or fine drugs and has been bullied by folks in the industry for 40 years, and she keeps on going.    She’s been a champion for the gays and POC since the beginning of her career in the 80s when most people wouldn’t even touch a gay person.    She is the celebrity who it is cool to hate, although she is intelligent, hardworking, socially conscious and an overall amazing friend and ally.    The reason people hate her is because of misogyny, and she’s an easy target.    Viva Kathy Griffin.	NULL

For someone on the fence, I'd ask what their reaction would be if you asked the doc to surgically remove part of a baby girl's vulva. They would rightly be disgusted at the thought, so why do it to boys?	NULL

In my case she had interest in writing while she was with me, all things goth and magic when she was with her other ex and tailoring cosplays when she tried to woo that other person (can't remember if they were a girl or non-binary).

There’s are wooded bike trail park near my house that I’m very familiar with.

I dodged it by maybe 2 inches. Later that day I was eating my lunch by the lake, everything very peaceful, there’s a rabbit a couple feet in front of me when a water moccasin slithers out of a rock at me at crazy speeds I freak out but don’t have time to move thankfully it decided that the it wanted the rabbit for lunch and not me, but that would have been death for me.

Agnostic, not atheist here  There is no proof of a higher power and if there is we are silly to attempt to understand it  Religion is used to explain things that can't otherwise be explained, we have 2 things left in like we can't fully explain. Death, which is the big one. And suffering, (questions like, why am I poor but he was born to billionaires and has anything he wants, or why did that car crash that killed my wife happen)  We die and that's the end, consciousness is a byproduct of survival. And the world is so big and has so many things happening it's impossible to predict.  I won't argue there is nothing, simply that we have zero data or understanding of anything outside of our perception	NULL

>"because it's God's plan".  This includes the suffering.  For me gay people were the reason I wondered if a religious god was real or not. If God didn't want people to be gay, why would he let them be born that way? Religious people say it's a choice, but they never say that being straight is a choice. Also, who would choose to be persecuted like that?  Then I discovered that some animals have homosexual tendencies as well. So you're telling me there are gay dolphins that would never burn in hell, but humans must suffer through a life of quiet desperation until death because desiring love and intimacy from the same gender is verboten?  This is all just to save their souls. Why would a merciful God make someone gay and then make them suffer severe loneliness and then persecution and promise eternal suffering if they dare act on their impulses? That seems cruel, like some sick joke.  Religions do more harm than good. The principles they teach can be learned from philosophies. Additionally, religions take the responsibility of saving humanity out of our hands and place it in some supernatural force that cannot deliver on its promises. This creates a mental prison and stops people from, say, eating the rich because they're supposed to be punished in the afterlife for their exploitation.  Fuck that shit. Get them now!

Too much of a sceptic. From what I can tell religion was an insanely effective tool for social cohesion. I see it like a virus that spread throughout populations far and wide and programmed people to have the same value system as well as respect and/or fear for a single authority. Then there's the whole omnipotence thing... like, really? It's like telling modern day people that the police have a camera feed from their eyeballs.  That all said, religion may well have been a necessary part of our development as a species. I see no reason to believe any of it is actually true, but that doesn't mean it was always a bad thing to have. But it's still, in my view, pretty much the same as telling kids about Santa to incentivize them to behave properly.	NULL

There is evidence that overall as a generation people tend to get more conservative. People start families and the conservative ideology is more family friendly.

People using “whom” incorrectly. If you don’t know how to use it properly, don’t use it at all.  I don’t know why it bothers me so much. In most other cases, except when safety is an issue, I believe that people should try things even if they fail because that’s how you learn.  But people use “whom” to mean “erudite way of saying ‘who’” and that’s *not accurate at all.*  There are also some people who understand that “whom” is an object pronoun, but they don’t know whether to use object or subject in certain cases. “To whom it may concern” is correct, but it’s because of “concern”, not “to”. So people will say “To whomever wrote this note…” and that’s not correct.  Just say “who”. If anyone judges you for not saying “whom”, send them my way, and I will fight them.  ^(which reminds me of the other r/askreddit thread I saw today, which was your response to a petite woman saying they could take you in a fight.

That's very true hey. I think most religions are built on it. In my case the fact that I surround myself with Christians probably plays a big part, so its defintely one-sided. Have rarely come across people from other religions, so tricky to learn. Pseudoscience always plays a part, regardless.

Went completely wrong, I will never forget the hate we got even from our friends there. These faces when they attacked us and desperately tried to find the flaws in logic. And now, 15 years later, almost everyone of them has left church.	NULL

Had this happen when working at a mall as a teen. After the incident the store started getting calls from the guy saying super creepy shit and asking about me. One night he called and told the manager he wanted to keep my head on his nightstand. Mall people talk to each other and we found out the same creeper was doing this to a girl in another store, too. Nobody was allowed to leave after closing without security escorting us as a group for a solid month. This was in the early 90’s and a lot easier to be anonymous. He finally showed up one night and was arrested but I was scared until I finally left for college in the fall.	NULL

>Do you have evidence that anything you have been doing in your life will pay off eventually?  No. What even is "paying off" for my life anyway? Why would I need evidence of "paying off" just to get on with my life?  >It was always faith that everything you do have sense and will lead you somewhere.  Lead me where? I don't have "faith" any of my actions will "lead" me somewhere. I can make plans and predictions about the future based on previous experiences and guesses and judgement. If I apply to that job, I might be happier because I'd have more time to do that thing I want, etc. That requires no "faith", it's a best guess, and it might turn out wrong.  >You never had an evidence that things will work for 100%.  Of course not, nothing is 100%. But a complete lack of evidence is completely different from, say, looking at a body of evidence and picking *the most likely* "true" thing.  And of course, being open to revise that opinion if better evidence emerges because of course, it's not 100% certain.  >Same with faith in God. You don't know if going to church and praying will pay off, you just have faith that there is something up there.  Ah, but here there's not *any* evidence. You don't know it will pay off, and can't know. Yes, there's still not a 100% certainly, but there's not even a 90% or 30% or 1% certainly based on availability evidence. Because there is literally no empirical evidence. It is 100% faith.  Ah! But like you said, even though there's literally no evidence, it could still be true and you're right - if it is, why not blindly believe as a good bet so you don't go to hell if, by some extraordinary means, it is!  Well, religious are exclusive. You will go to hell if you pick the "wrong" one, usually. Why pick Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism etc? They all have equally zero empirical evidence. They have similar punishments. Why choose one over the other?  And given there's a cost, in my valuable time, to pick any over none (I have things to do on Sunday etc), I think none is a much more logical choice.	NULL

I (guy, 17 at the time) was bragging to my cousin (girl, 12 at the time) about my new computer. At one point she started giving me quite an annoyed look so I got it I overdid it. So trying to defuse the situation I told her "F*ck me, right?" (in the sense I should go f myself), such talk wasn't unusual between us. Her look suddenly turned serious and then she said "Uhm, no." then she nodded towards the dining room where our families were and followed up "Not today." then grinned and blinked at me. Up to this day I don't know was she serious or just found her way to bring me into "WTF" mode.	NULL

The people who were responsible for introducing religion to me all failed. My parents stuck to the “do it because we say” rout and my childhood friends (all different religion than I was raised) just used it as a game of “our god is better than your god” and they were just echoing their parents. Fast forward to when I started dating and had to attend some church serves with various girlfriends of various denominations and all of the services were equally bigoted and rife with the undertones of control. I resent every ounce of organized religion and have concluded that if there is a higher power that lived by the rules of literally any of the teachings I’ve been exposed to, I want nothing to do with it and it’s “presence”.

I've had pistol training and I've taken OC spray to the face. If I were an attacker, I would MUCH rather my victim have OC spray. You can power through the pain for a bit (varies from person to person), but you're not going to be able to power through gunshot wounds in your chest.  And no, you're probably not going to take a gun from somebody who's willing to shoot you with it. Have you ever done gun disarming drills? They require the gunman to let you get into arm's reach, they rely on practice and muscle memory, and any good instructor will emphasize that this is a last-ditch effort that might get you shot anyway.

Last day of school I broke up with my gf and my best friend. Me and some other friends go for a sleepover and buy a ton of energy drinks bc at the time, it's super cool to drink alot of them.   Anyway, we drank 6 or 7 energy drinks each and barely slept. Next day we get some company over for a fire. One guy bring a bottle of whiskey  I was 15 at the time, and have had some beer here and there, but never really ever caught a buzz or anything. I also was completely unaware that energy drinks and alcohol don't mix  I have another energy drink in the evening and while everyones outside at the fire, I go back inside to use the bathroom and start drinking. I finished half of the bottle in about 5 minutes.  U can guess where this is going. They found me in my bedroom floor, unable to move or see, long story short, we rushed to the hospital and idk exactly what they did, but they said if I hadn't came, I would've died so yah lol  Don't drink energy drinks and alcohol together. I also have not been able to drink energy drinks again since then (over 3 years)	NULL
Multiple things led to me being an atheist. Was raised catholic and practised for 21 years. Stopped going to mass after reading another child molester priest story on the news here in Ireland. Just thought to myself there are bad people practising the religion, there can be good people not practising it. Met some interesting people throughout my 20’s who were atheists. Had a 10 year relationship with a protestant girl who I ended up marrying and have since had a child with. A bigger deal here in Northern Ireland than a lot of other places.  There is no way if there is a heaven this women isn’t on the vip list., even though she doesnt do the same chanting I have been brought up with. Have been presented with no evidence whatsoever of a God. Realised that it was all nursery rhymes and stories. I have never been more content with the thought that there is nothing after death. I am still the same morally good person.	NULL

Involve the police.  I have no idea why there's this attitude that children shouldn't be touched by the law, especially when school is involved.  When bullying involves physical violence, it's battery.  When it involves the fear of physical violence, it's assault.  When it's rape, *it's rape*.  Call the fucking police.  Do not let the school take the place of the police because their first priority is the stable education of children, *not* the safety of its members, which, while noble, can lead to things like *not prosecuting children for committing crimes*.  Ostensibly, that's what we have law enforcement officers for.	NULL

Untouchables is the best movie in which he's the star. I liked Dances with Wolves when it came out too, though I wonder if watching today I would feel the same. Can't say, I don't remember enough of the plot. I honestly enjoy Waterworld and The Postman and watch them whenever they come on a random cable at 2 PM on a Saturday, but wouldn't call them good movies. More just fun and I like the sets. The plots are preposterous and full of holes if you think too much, though.	NULL

While I completely agree with you, I have a question that I struggle with personally:  God created His rules to protect us from ourselves. While some rules, like don’t sleep around before marriage, make sense, and while some are just common sense (like don’t murder), there’s one that I struggle with. Why can’t people of the same gender be in love? The only difference is the gender. The body. How is God protecting me by forbidding me to marry the woman I love ?	NULL
I don't understand how I can deny my ancestors' gods and accept a foreign one (I'm Latino). How my brother-in-law live by a Bible that has been revised hundreds of times and interpretation differently by many priests.

How can so many people be racist against Jewish and brown people of any culture when Jesus is brown and Jewish? How are we created in God's image when we have evidence we evolved from homo-erecrus? How does space and modern science fit with the Bible? How can one decide that one is good or evil and why would God decide a humans fate if he is a divine being?	NULL

They are accountable to no one but their shareholders. They bleed governments of the taxes they need to function to increase their influence and power. This done by allowing lobbying and it is the center of all that will consume us and why nothing is done that does not directly benefit the very companies destroying existence for a profit.

It's impossible to parse an omnipotent being as being this fucking bad at putting some shit together.  I mean look around, it's a shitshow. Even if God was real and heaven was a place, it's fairly fucking obvious even his supporters don't know wtf to do to get there, the documentation sucks.  If there is a God, he didn't do a good job with all this Earth bullshit, and omnipotent superbeings don't do bad jobs on accident. So, it's either we're here to suffer and in that case, he can eat a fat dick, or we're here alone, an accident created by a pool of goo and then who the fuck cares.  Either way, I'm not going to be nice to assholes just to get to a place I don't even know exists, and I'm not going to pretend with people saying that's what they're doing yet doing the exact opposite.

Fair enough. Sometimes you use a word and all this baggage comes with it. “Supernatural” gets a bad rep just by the people and concepts generally associated with the term. At its core, it only means “outside of our scientific understanding” or, from Miriam Webster, “departing from what is usual or normal especially so as to appear to transcend the laws of nature”.

I miscarries a baby my husband and I truly wanted. Neither of us could take religion seriously after that. The true icing on the cake was being told I wasn't living/praying right or I wouldn't have depression. That's always a good one, to tell the depressed person that the reason they're depressed is that they're not good enough. I mean at that point we already know we're a walking disaster, thanks for pointing out that the God who's supposed to love everyone and forgive everyone does not include me in that list of everyone. And then make sure to remind me suicide is a selfish sin, but apparently so is taking the medication that actually balances my brain enough to lift me from the deepest pits of living Hell.  But please ask me again why I'm not head over heals with your judgmental, lying, vengeful diety.	NULL

If I had to guess it's probably due to how much actually ends up in it and how quickly you get it taken care of. I only got a little from a AA battery, and it took a few minutes before I felt it.   So story time:  I was working at a shop that would buy and sell used consoles. Couple brings in a Wii they want to sell, so I pop open the controllers to see if there's any batteries and/or noticeable corrosion. Yes to both. I hand it back and say we can't take the console as we required a good controller to buy it in at the time, and it was the only one we had. Few minutes later, my eye starts burning. I think it's just dry and irritated so I go wash it out in the bathroom, gets a little better then starts burning again. I wash it out again, same results. So I tell my boss I think I got acid in there from the controller, call my GF and asked her to take me to the ER.   Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to get there, and she has trouble comprehending me telling her to "drive straight and it will be on the right". So she gets in the car and I'm driving with one eye closed cuz it's burning that bad. Get to the ER, tell them what's going on, and get admitted. Nurse then leaves and comes back with a giant, thick, plastic contact with a hose and what looks to be an IV bag full of saline water. He hooks it up to the bag, reclines me, sticks it in my eye, and tells me to just lie there for a bit. Water just seeping outta my eye, soaking into my shirt and the pillow I'm laying on. Eventually they come back to check on me, see that and wrap the pillow in a blanket so it doesn't get as wet and hopefully keeps the water our from under my head, and walk away again.   Bag runs dry, few minutes pass and I'm just stuck there with my eye starting to get irritated again before they come back. Ask me how I'm doing, I tell the that it's irritated still, the take out the contact, swap out bags, and begin the process again.   Total of 2 bags of saline water and 2-3 hours later I'm discharged with still blurry, but functional eye and drive me and my GF home.   Thankfully it was all covered by workers comp as it was a work-related injury. Downside is it was my major introduction to the HR head as my (now old) boss didn't want to file the paperwork and handed it to me to turn in as I had just accepted a desk job with the company and I had no clue who to give it to.

We became best friends in high school and stayed in touch in college, thankfully only an hour away. Drove home every weekend to spend time together.   The best advice I can give is marrying your best friend. The person that becomes the first person you want to talk to when you start your day and the person you want to talk to until you fall asleep. The person you want to share all of your news about your day with and cherish memories together. The person that has your back through everything and no matter how bad things get, even between each other, that you can alway count on to be there and continue from where you end up.   Love is hard. Life is hard. So naturally, finding the love of your life is exceptionally hard. But it is possible, and it's always closer than you think.	NULL

If I choose to believe something I need some form of reason. For instance I believe black holes exist (even before we took a picture) because the math predicting them was also correct about a shitload of other stuff.  However believing in a higher power just doesn't make sense from a logical point of view (I can totally see the emotional advantage though, for instance in times of crisis). As far as I know in the entire history of the universe nothing has happened that can't be explained by something much simpler. I guess there's the big bang of which we can't really tell the origin and could be attributed to a higher power, but that's so far removed from what world religions believe that I guess I'm agnostic about that part.  Additionally if for instance the Christian god existed he'd surely have interacted with the world already, but he clearly doesn't.	NULL

When a Mormon hears arguments for the Muslim faith, or Hindu hears a Catholic explaining why their God is real, it's easy for them to see how paper-thin and flawed the claims of another religion are. The exact same reason the Janis or the Wiccan beliefs not compelling to you, that's how I feel. To me, it just all feels obviously made up, obviously false, and argued from flawed premises.   Moreover, when you look at the stories of people who founded a religion, like Mohamed, Joseph Smith, Jim Jones and others it's always the exact same thing. "I am God's chosen messenger, and that means you all have to do what I say and I get to sleep with all of your wives." Every single story we know of someone who founded a religious movement goes exactly that way, but yet the people in a religious movement founded that way always try to claim that their guy is different. Why should we believe you and not all the others? No one can ever give a good reason for that, because there isn't one. Religions were founded by con men who wanted power, and once they got it, they fucked everyone's wife (and usually underaged girls too). if that's what God is all about, then leave me out of it.	NULL

It's almost 5am and I'm awake for no real reason.  I'm in quarantine 'cause my roommate might have covid and he's waiting on a test to come back.  I'm tired enough that I might as well be drunk.  I don't wanna sleep but I feel like whether I'm awake or asleep I'm just wasting time when I could be productive but like usual I can't "motivate" myself to be productive because of what I assume is undiagnosed ADHD or something.  But whatever, things are fine, I just gotta actually sleep instead of ranting into a random askreddit thread at 5am.	NULL

Yep, I did. It might be that you were unable to process the information.

I guess I concider myself an agnostic-atheist. I am open to the possibility of god or some kind of afterlife, but not a single thing to ever exist has pointed me to it being true, let alone something worth believing in, so I just don't. also I guess I was raised non religious but on accident I guess? my mom is religious and tried to get me to be too but i don't think she ever forced anything upon me and wasnt a bible thumper so she weren't crazy either, and my dad is religious just not as much as my mom (I think) and just didnt give a single fuck about teaching it to me.

I agree up until the last part. You have to be extremely grounded and downright zen to not let other people affect your emotions. I dont even think it's something you should want necessarily. Letting people make you feel a certain way and making other feel a certain way is basically the essence of what we do when we talk to each other.  Sure talking about what we need to get at the supermarket isn't a very emotional conversation but my gf asking me to go because she is hungry and maybe us discussing if it's my turn is already emotional.  I think it's problematic to pathologise every human interaction. Sometimes we laverage emotions and try to convince people of our viewpoint and it's not gaslighting. The lines of where it becomes problematic are very blurry which is scary but thats life. Youll have to learn to assess every situation case by case	NULL
Get it done.  I've had mine for 16+ years and there is NO difference with before and afterwards.  Everything looks and performs the same.  The procedure took like 15 to 30 minutes.  Recovery was about a day or two.  I had it done on a Friday afternoon, by Sunday I was fine.  I was back at work for Monday morning like nothing ever happened.  I now have 3 monies and no kids.  This was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life, and my wife of 23+ years agrees.	NULL

I think its also important to consider that these kids are probably the first generation that we know of who are growing up with so few social constraints around gender as well as access to the information that challenges traditional norms.   It was easier before because kids were put in a "social box" laden with prescribed rules which gave a framework for growing up. For more and more kids, they don't have that anymore - and finding yourself when growing up is hard enough even when you're told, e.g. "what it means to be a man", I can't imagine what its like without those social crutches to help you along.

They've already attracted them! Why do you think there are so many snl compilations with weird ass titles like "SNL clips that keep my soul afloat while I make toast?"   They haven't attracted them with a lot of the clips aimed at gen-z, sure. But they definitely attracted them with pretty much every Kyle and Kyle+Beck sketch ever made. And with all the other really weird sketches. And with many of their hosting choices.   SNL did a great job getting popular on YouTube during 2013-2018, the peak time of YT sketch comedy (think Collegehumor, Studio C, new old Smosh), and survived when everyone else didn't. A lot of Gen Z only watches the videos on YouTube though and doesn't watch it live on TV.    Kate McKinnon is very much a gen z "household" name, and SNL is decently popular with gen z, although it is much more "niche" than it is with older generations.	NULL

If I was outlawed to upgrade my computer as I saw fit, I would be pretty mad about it, so who am I to deny someone else their hobby.

Like I could be all pressed against him, I still wanted to get closer. I still missed him somehow.

I'm 27 and happily single now and staying with my parents during my semester break. I started playing Mass Effect Legendary Edition and he keeps on making comments like "you should be playing with your second kid by now, not this video game".   I get it, my mum was 24 when she had me (quite late in my country for that time period), but I can't fucking imagine having a tiny creature be fully dependent on me to take care of it 24/7. Add in my depression and other health issues, and I'm just not ready. Doesn't stop him demanding a grandchild.  He's now moved on to commenting to my mum about how they should've had another kid. Which is a horrible thing to say to my mum, since he's the one who convinced my religious mum to have an abortion when she got pregnant after having me because they just couldn't afford to have another kid at that point (it was her decision in the end, and it was a good one, but it's still a shitty thing to bring up given the circumstances).

It's to give meaning to what is being told to make sure that the person you're telling can properly understand the information you're trying to convey. Because when you just read, let's say a book, or a text, anything like that, you lose 90% of the communication as opposed to when you're talking face to face with someone. So if you want your words to be understood and not taken a different way than you intend to, you should learn the difference between the words so you don't sound or write like you're still in middle school. For instance: There They're  Their  All sound exactly the same and when you read them outlook or in your head, they sound the same.   Like for instance, they're there for their money in your world would be there there for there money. Doesn't make too much sense does it?   There - locational, such as go over there and wait for me They're - they are, when describing people to others, such as They're getting really annoyed with your laziness Their - possessive, as in that's theirs.   Think of if at work you sent your boss an email where you had to use all 3 in the email and everytime you just used there. That would probably confuse and annoy your boss.	NULL

> I think women are just as attracted to men as men are to women.   I totally agree with the rest of your post, but I'm actually not sure this is true.  I believe the average man finds the average woman more attractive than the other way around, even after you get past the initial visual stage.  That is, if you were to take men and ask them to rate the attractiveness of a random selection of their female acquaintances (not just some pictures of randos), I suspect they would rate them a lot higher on average than women would rate their male acquaintances.  It's likely for the same reason you mentioned--women face greater consequences of sex, so they have an incentive to be more discriminating for the expected benefits to be worth the expected costs.

I have a theory that 2000 years ago people thought that their life was too boring so they came with idea to prank future generations that there was a guy that came from the outer world, had magic powers, then died and came back to life. The lack of communication between different parts of world helped them to make other nations believe in it. The things started to form up and people made a religion out of it. This theory can't be proven and there's almost no way it could be possible. But how can we know?  But actually I don't believe in God, because there's no proof :)	NULL

Back in high school I was in Journalism class, and the students in the class got admin privileges on their Accounts and a separate admin account which had a shared user name and password for everyone to access the journalism drive...  At my high school there were four network drives The "U" drive which was your personal, The "S" drive which was shared and the "A" drive which was the teacher drive and the "J" drive for journalism.... (The last two were hidden, "A" if you weren't a teacher and "J" if you weren't in the Journalism class  The "J" drive had a shortcut to the "A" drive to which I eagerly got into with the shared journalism credentials... I used that to get one of my school award templates, make a copy to my "U" drive and put my name on it and paste it back into the "A" drive with the other ones (it was just one giant folder of awards, separated by grade not teacher, which was dumb but it helped with my plan).  After that I knew that I was gonna use the shared credentials to install things on the computers, so I would install different things whether it was productive or video games, I remember installing Evolution Decompression and a different Warframe file extractor and using it to datamine... I had a burner account that was low on mastery rank and since it was on the school too, I was safe from getting my home IP logged in their servers for a block if it was ever detected....  Surprisingly no one found out about any of this until now....	NULL

At the donation of time and labor of contributors.   This is far different than what was posited, that there's nothing for free, just other people pay for things.   If a company like Microsoft or IBM controlled Linux today, you could probably put a price tag of $500 billion dollars on it, or maybe much much more.  But the  development cost for Linux, if every developer was paid a high salary for their development work in the field would be at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller then that. 5 billion at most.  No one paid for the difference between those numbers.  It was given for the betterment of people, and through that generosity, it became used and grew well beyond anyone's expectations.  No Linux developer paid $495 billion , but they did decide not to charge  money for their donation to society.  Another great example of getting things for free or libraries, yes they cost a little bit to run and the either buy books or receive books as donations, but the value that they provide to everyone far far outweighs their costs by a couple of orders of magnitude. And it's not like tax dollars are paying all of that value.	NULL

Hey I know that feeling man, just wrapped it up myself. Been in the office for 11 hours straight now, ha.  I've really enjoyed our discourse over the past day(s). I think you've hit the nail on the head with this  >I think it’s more of a miscommunication between us than anything else.  You've worded your viewpoints - and why you have them, elaborated, etc. - very well and I've learned from this exchange. You've definitely broadened my mind on this, and I feel we both have an intrinsic truth to this topic that can't easily - if at all - be changed.  At the heart of this  >When Americans say they are X ethnicity all they mean is that is where there ancestors are from.  Is what it's all about. We - most if not all - Europeans find Americans funny when they say they're Irish German whatever, because to us that doesn't make any sense and couple that with the fact that the person saying this can't speak a word of German and their closest actual German relative has been dead for 150 years, you just chalk it up to Americans being Americans.  But considering "American" isn't an ethnicity in and of itself (except for native American) I can completely see where you lot are coming from when talking about heritage.  Thanks for this man. I hope you make it to Amsterdam some day, when you do and you remember this little reddit discussion, don't hesitate to hollar at me. I'd gladly buy you a beer and tell you all about our history!  Have a good one and happy 2022 :-)	NULL

Well lets ask ourselves some very simple questions:  1. If a god would exist, why is there such things as evil in the world? 2. if there is evil in the world, why would god need somebody to represent him to destroy the evil things (aka the church and all of the believers) if he is literally allmighty? 3. if god is almighty and always „good“ why would he even create something „evil“? 4. can you even scientifically prove that there is a god? Have you ever heard, smelled, touched, seen or tasted god?	NULL

I grew up in the country and one fall there was a rumor that people had seen a cougar prowling in the area. One day after school I went out to our horse pasture to brush and water the horses, but they were acting very nervous and had eyes on the hay shed.  Then I start to hear this very low rumbling noise.  I grabbed a hatchet that we used to cut the bale twine, and slowly walked back towards the house thinking that at any moment a cougar was going to leap out at me from the shadows and I was going to have to fight for my life.  Turns out my uncle had brought some pigs over to slaughter for a luau and they were grunting in a trailer in the shed. Since the horses weren't use to pigs it was setting them off.	NULL

There are two main concepts that seal my opinion on this topic. The first is that god is either incompetent or uncaring. If you see all of the bad things in the world: natural disasters, plagues, the needless suffering, and awful unfair ways terrible people thrive; you can only come to two conclusions. Either god is unable to stop them, and thus incompetent, or god just doesn’t care. Either of those leaves me thinking that whoever god may be, they’re pointless to pray to or worship.  The second concept is the idea of the afterlife. Almost all theistic religions have an idea that “we go to good place, everyone else goes to bad place” in their core texts. Even if you lead an awful and horrible life killing and hurting others, you can still go to the good place when you die as long as you believe in the right guy at the end and feel regretful (which almost every person does on their deathbed). Vice versa, if a good person who spends their life helping others and always trying to do the right thing doesn’t believe, then they get some shade of eternal damnation and suffering.  If god is real, and if they are some perfect being, they wouldn’t be so petty and self-obsessed to the point of sending good people who just didn’t believe the right thing to hell while saving monsters that picked correctly. If religious people truly believed that anyone who doesn’t believe in their god is damned for eternity, they would be frantically trying to save every person they know and living as desperate missionaries. The fact that they don’t tells me that they know deep down it’s not true.  In summary: if god is real, too much bad happens in the world and thus god either can’t do anything about it or they don’t care; both tell me they aren’t worth worshiping. In addition, if god is real they wouldn’t be petty enough to send good and virtuous people to hell for not believing the right thing while sending monsters to heaven for picking the right choice.  If there is a Heaven, I’ll get in for being a good man and doing the best to help those around me and leading a positive life. If god sends me to hell with that, then he’s evil and undeserving of praise.	NULL

Used to have to do that as a kid. The ground would get saturated during Spring and or heavy rain. Field tile drain for the septic tank would fill and there was no place for the septic overflow to go. Fast forward 30+ years. Put in a new septic tank and ran pvc for the overflow from the tank about 300-400 feet to a little side creek. According to the installer (my neighbor) the overflow water is cleaner than city tap water so no environmental pollution. Now no more septic backups. Been about 20 years now.

After decades of not doing anything at all and fulfilling that dream, I would of course seek knowledge and perfect old crafts so it's not lost to the generations. But anyway after all that I would mess with people. To me, immortal means no sleep, so i'll choose a town, stalk everyone while staying out of sight, and help them in weird ways. Stella is going to college but declines bc she's poor? What's that? An anonymous hello kitty gift bag filled with money? Nice! Dexter is burning ants in his free time? Oh no, better fill his room with revenge ants! All of that, until the town starts noticing and then it's on to the next place. I'd probably also offer myself to government at some point just to catch murderers, rapists, ect. But only let a few individuals know about my immortality so I wouldn't have to explain. Also, I would be able to watch the next pglob of pitch fall. [Pitch Drop Livestream](https://livestream.com/uq/events/5369913)	NULL

Hmmmm where to start. .. I'm 55, disabled since birth (use a manual wheelchair) but I only bring this up to give context to what has happened in the past 2 years. I have always been employed (since 14) and single and self-supporting, I own my own home, have never had a personal care attendant and have owned a number of large (100 lbs +) dogs that i have fully cared for by myself.  I've worked for almost 30 years advising landlords of their tenants' rights in a series of jobs - all supervisory and mid-executive in level.   In Jan 2020, I started (for the first time ever) to have a number of wounds that just wouldn't heal - a pressure wound on my lower back, scrapes on my toes, etc and they just kept getting worse.  I ended up with gangrenous toes on both feet, pressure sores on my butt and thighs and a wound on my back that was 6 cm wide and 6 cm.s deep (that's approximately halfway above the knuckle of your index finger. )  I smelled of rotting flesh - like I had stapled a dead racoon to my ass, literally.     a wound care nurse visiting 3 times a week to change my bandages and a wound vac to help heal the crater on my back for 6 months.     At the same time, COVID was going on.  It tanked my industry and my business so I went through all of my savings.  I was able to get unemployment which kept the wolf from the door but that ended in September this year.   I owe 8K on my mortgage and have less than 10K to my name.     O and want to know the capper?  My mom died of COVID on Christmas Eve a week ago.  Do you know they do wakes via Zoom these days? The good news is I found a program from the Fed that will reimburse you up to 9K for funeral expenses for someone who has died of COVID so I can help make sure my sister will be made whole for paying for everything.    I am almost completely paralyzed by panic and I have no idea about how to be honest about it with the people in my life (sister exempted.)   But if you can't be honest with a bunch of good hearted strangers on Reddit,  then you're really in the shit.	NULL

The group in question has no reason to take an issue.  Yeah, but why would one change their opinion because a group of people find it wrong and insulting? Why would I care? I mean, conservatives find it wrong and insulting that liberals won't do as they say, and liberals find it wrong and insulting for not doing what *they* say.  Who is the decider of wrong and insulting? It makes no sense.  Like, what if me and 20 other people said they find it wrong and insulting that you post on reddit. Would you give a shit? Would you stop posting? I hope not.

I don't disagree with that.  But that's a far cry from your original statement which was a black and white statement that anyone whose firearm is stolen and used in a crime is culpable for the crime.  I complete agree that when a firearm is stolen, it should be investigated and determined whether there was any negligence on the part of the owner.  If there was (such as any laws requiring securing the firearm not being followed), then I'm not against them being held partially responsible for any crime committed with it.  Same for a bartender being held partially responsible when over-serving a patron and knowingly allowing them to drive away or if someone knowingly lends their car to a drunk person whom then kills someone.  What I DON'T agree with is automatically assigning blame to a firearm owner just because their firearm was stolen and subsequently used in a crime when the owner had it locked up in accordance with all laws and due diligence but was stolen anyway.  Say a licensed concealed carrier needs to visit a federal building or school (where it is illegal to carry even when licensed), that means they have three choices:  1) Carry anyway (breaking the law) and risk getting caught and suffering the legal ramifications of that 2) Lock their firearm in a lockbox in their vehicle 3) Leave their firearm locked up at home.  Under your proposal, options 2 and 3 would both now carry the risk that they could be blamed for a murder if their car is stolen or home is burglarized while they are out, even though they are following all laws.  You're basically making them choose between being a criminal outright (carrying where it's illegal so their firearm is always in their possession) or risk being considered a criminal by being a victim (firearm is stolen).  That does not sit right with me at all.	NULL

ADHD is basically a self regulation issue due to wonky brain chemicals. For example, youll commonly see people with ADHD who struggle with maintaining normal sleep schedules: either sleep way too long or too short, or stay up way too late. Another example is that people with ADHD either will forget to eat OR binge eat.   This regulation issue leads to procrastination, hyper focus, inability to maintain routines, etc. etc. Theres more to it, and theres a lot of overlap with ASD, but the core ADHD issue is fundamentally the physical inability to self regulate on a subconscious level.

When I was 20 there was a perfect road for my itty bitty sports car. Lots of small hills and extreme cornering. One night late after a bad date I decided to let my frustrations out. There was one hill that when you topped you needed to turn hard right to stay on the road at speed. Well, county was redoing the road at had stripped off the asphalt starting at the top of the hill. Hit loose dirt and and rock, and FLEW about 20ft, nose diving into a immense pile of loose dirt. Took me a few hours to dig the car out with my hands in moonlight, and another hour driving off road in cactus to get around the ditch that had been dug next to the road. So lucky to be alive.	NULL

Dw not an idiot. A copypasta is a short or not too long text usually within a very specific yet very generic context, that is as the name says copied and pasted multiple times. They range from funny, to cringe, to grotescque, to horror (and in this specific theme they are called creepypastas and have great fanbases around them + entire series of stories (like SCP or The Holders)  In this thread i was implying that the comment above mine was really similar to a copypasta and if it wasn't it really should become one.  How to "create" a copypasta? Copy the message, store it in a document somewhere, and use it whenever you think it's appropriate. When enough people do this it becomes a proper copypasta.	NULL

My school wasn't that bad (unless you count drug dealer as a 'profession' they taught us not to become).  Tbh, money was never really talked about or judged by the teachers. The kids on the other hand were a bit more snobbish on that regard. It was some little things though that always highlighted the differences - I was one of the "less well off but still reasonably well off" kids and it was things like being expected to provide your own costume for the school play you were in. When doing Grease, it was just assumed that the kids parents would be able to go out and buy black leather jackets for all the boys. I couldn't even find one to borrow - I borrowed a brown one from my uncle, it was the closest we could get. There was a school trip to British Honduras (from the UK) too at one point. I really wanted to go but my parents couldn't afford it - but most parents at the school wouldn't have batted an eyelid. Some did raise money, but I wouldn't have been able to raise nearly enough to be able to fund my way by myself. My parents were by no means poor, but some things were just a bit out of reach, or would at the very least have required more thought and planning than other parents would have needed to give.	NULL

Scientology(all religions, really, but especially cults like Scientology) works by locking their members into a cycle of isolation and indoctrination. They start by finding people that are vulnerable, and sell them on the church as a place of acceptance and love. Then they indoctrinate them in the dogma and tell them to spread the Word. This has the effect of alienating those the target's friends and family, who then attempt to bring them to their senses. The church, of course, tells them that those attempting to break them away from the dogma are sinners, or worse, agents of whatever evil force dogma says opposes the church. When the target is isolated from their former loved ones, they are pulled into the church and bombarded with adoration and further indoctrination, then sent back out with an even whackier message to spread, pushing them further and further out of the mainstream and sinking them deeper into the cult. Lather, rinse, repeat. A more sophisticated form of brainwashing.	NULL

Alright I have a good few ig. So I’ll try to make this short and quick. It’s kinda hard to make it short tho. So I’ve always had dreams that were bad. Now one day however I had a lucid dream. A dream I will not forget. So one night I fell to sleep. And this is my dream. I’m in bed I slowly sit up. Standing there behind my door is a disfigured girl. She looks kinda young ngl. She has these huge ass fucking eyes and a damn wide smiling. She was wearing this white dress. She had black hair. My ears can’t hear shit. Like I hear ringing and I’m rly cold. I’m shaking. She starts screaming. This horrible scream. ILL BE BACKKKK ILL BE BACK. Then she whispered “he’s so amazing. He’s so sorry tho” and then she turns her head to the side. Whispers someone weird ass shit. And I wake up shaking and the clock read 3:45. Now that was a few months ago and I’ve now went through so much shit with this weird ass girl. I’ve had many lucid dreams now. Creepy dreams relating to my life. My friends. And my bf. All in which sometimes she’s in the background. Or is still there.

Because if you raised a society of people where god or the concept of god was never talked about or rammed down people's throats since they're old enough to be conscious, nobody would be saying the BS they do now about being able to communicate with god and having their prayers answered etc or even talk about god. People only believe in it or even understand the concept because they're brain washed into doing so by adults that actually believe it themselves as young kids.  The shittiest people I know morally are the ones that try to push the christianity shit the hardest, because it's the only way they think they can elevate themselves about non believers that actually have morals.  Christians will say any insignificant thing that they usually have to stretch pretty hard to see is an answer to what they prayed for, but then never question what happens the other times where nothing happens.  Or why all the bad shit in the world happens to good people.  The whole concept of god is a crutch for weak minded, scared people or a cop out for ass holes that know they suck.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is really against the death penalty now, but when he was governor of California, he personally ordered two executions back to back, the only people to be executed by the state in 15 years.

Ya. Like, reincarnation seems cool. I don't believe it, but it's a much cooler concept than heaven. If I was to believe in an afterlife, I'd just believe in reincarnation. The only strings attached being that life has a karma system and the thing you reincarnate into is based off of how good you were. Seems like a much better system that gets the same job done as Christianity does, which is to make people behave for fear of what the afterlife might hold for thrm if they don't.	NULL

I'll be the asshole. Aside from stuff relating to ignorance of female biology most of the problems here are boundary issues which can apply to both sexes. (How narrowly it's focused on female biology / relationships is a little bothersome to me, but I digress.)  Imagine cleaning up after your partner and having never set that boundary that it isn't okay. Congratulations, your partner is now walking on eggshells while you yourself are unhappy.  These aren't somehow unique to someone with a p0n0s or a vag000. This is pretty much "Introduction to Relationships."   Most redditors are very young so they're learning this shit the hard way and haven't quite figured out that they both have to put in effort to maintain a healthy relationship and that sometimes "relationships just wont work out" and sometimes "you can't get a relationship to work."  If someone is afraid that their relationship are one of those but they wont put in the effort to really verify it then they should just break it off, they'll be happier single and that's true no matter what equipment they're packing between their legs.

Okay, this is different than what I imagined as "cool". What you describe here is something on a more professional, technical level. And honestly, I think it's very respectful--responsible, even!--to the firearm in question to know its technical details and to want to take care of it. Taking pride in your tools is great, too. Keeping yourself fed for a long time with a single shot is not just awesome, but also responsible, due to the decreased consumer consumption.  But there's a line for me.  What I'm getting at, where I draw those lines, are those that make owning firearms a defining part of their personality. Those who own simply for the aesthetics. Those that brandish them and flash them around in the open for no reason. Those who show them off while not showing an ounce of respect for the tool. Those that think owning a firearm makes them "cool".	NULL

In the words of Ouiser Bordeaux from Steel Magnolias “Men are the most horrible creatures. They will destroy your life”.    I am a gay man, happily married and I can tell you this is the absolute truth. If a man tells you he isn’t interested in something, he’s goading you to see your reaction. Men also have a habit of unconsciously (and consciously) playing psychological games with people because it pleases their ego. If a guy says he’s not into relationships, a lot of times he may have no reservations about being tied down, it’s because he is pushing his mate’s buttons to test them and see if they are down to prove him wrong; aka making you perform for them. It’s super fucked up, but I see it happen all the time.    Basically, if you like the guy but are afraid of telling him because he said he isn’t interested in relationships then just tell him anyway and see what happens. Either it works out for you, or the experience will be cringeworthy enough to kill the crush pretty quickly.	NULL

I had a dream I made ved and started walking to work everyday and I met this guy whose bike broke down and we ended up chatting and ir was like time was fluid. I experienced our friendship growing and evolving and then one day we were riding bikes on this long highway and we entered a tunnel and we hit a dead end and he started bawling furiously begging me to not leave. Telling me this was the happiest he'd ever been and truth be told I always have felt empty but I remember that moment of realization that I was dreaming but internally I felt more happiness looking and being with him then I ever had. I told him I wouldn't leave or didn't want to and he continued to beg and I felt myself evaporating. Like something was removing me. I never felt suck a sunken feeling before. He told me he was real and to never forget. But I was confused it felt more real then anything I'd ever experienced. I woke up heart broken for weeks and could never explain I still think about him regularly wondering that was my only chance to be happy.  It was somehow surreal and I could remember the smell of the damp concrete and the way he laughed. His eye color and days wrapped up in the fog of my own mind. His pleads ans telling me he was real spooked me. Because he was real to me and now wherever he is. I look for him everyday just in case and I hope wether in this life or another I find him again.

How old? I'm asking because most of the "best" men are married by a certain age and out of the dating pool. The guy's I knew in high school who were in shape and oh trans and presidents of their clubs and got top grades weren't still dating by 35. The guy's I knew in high school who had their shit together were all married before 30. It started around 26 and by 30, they were all married. The truth is, the older a woman gets, the quality of available men goes down as the most desirable partners get married.	NULL

When I was 16 and my sister 13 I was stuck babysitting my younger brother and her and her friend as they had a sleepover. They thought they’d be sneaky and steal my beer from the downstairs fridge while I was hanging out upstairs giving them space but knowing her I replaced it all with my aunts Non Alcoholic beer she leaves here in case she visits. For the rest of the night they ran around the house and yard talking about how drunk they were and how much shit I’d get in and generally acting like they drank a full bottle of vodka by themselves. My parents finally show up, start to get mad then shit themselves laughing once I show them one of the cans. To this day my sister and her friend still think they were drunk and she’s always confused why we laugh so hard when she brings it up.	NULL

> 4. Churches should be taxed like any other business  Churches aren't untaxed because they're churches.  They're untaxed because they're non-profits.  They're non-profits because they don't make profit.  How much cashflow a non-profit has is irrelevant.  It's also irrelevant how much various employees are paid. I think the head of Goodwill makes serious bank.  So, instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, perhaps it's a good idea to narrow down exactly which churches are the problem and what allows whatever activity you deem should be illegal.

Nah, rich idiots and paybabies get what they want in life early and either lack intelligence or did nothing to get what they want in life.

Some aspects of what is considered to be intelligence is bound to change over the years.  Sounds like correlating being a successful capitalist with being intelligent and there is no liable correlation between the two.	NULL

My parents not meeting my wife.  25 years ago when I was in my mid 20’s I was dating a girl who had a child from a previous marriage (married very young as the norm in her state - Utah) she was divorced when I met her.   I’m from the East coast and although my parents were incredibly liberal compared to hers they were still conservative. I was worried about how my parents would react especially my mum to find out my girlfriend had a child and was divorced. My parents were loving and fantastic people just traditional.   After 5 months of dating my girl I knew she was the one and I decided my parents needed to know who she was and meet her. (They already had an inkling I had someone but respected my privacy). My girlfriend was brilliant and she never pushed me to tell them and she understood why I was a bit hesitant unless I knew it was serious.   At 7 months after 2 months of knowing I wanted to marry this girl, I was still trying to build up the courage to tell my parents (I’m a massive over thinker and looking back I twisted myself up for no reason).   My parents were killed by a drunk driver a week later. It was the darkest time of my life, guilt and anger rushed through me. My girlfriend was there the whole time and loved me even when I didn’t treat her so well as I was grief stricken (not an excuse though). She helped me pack up the house, she helped me grieve and she is the reason I most likely didn’t kill myself.  We got married a few years later and my surviving family adore her. We went on to have 3 more children and every day it makes me sad their grandparents never got to meet them and their mother.  Christmas this year my mothers sister and I were talking in the kitchen and she said ‘your mum and dad would of been so proud of you. You have a beautiful family and you need to know that they wouldn’t of loved you any less for falling in love with a single mother, in fact your mother would of been proud’  I needed to hear that, but 25 years later and it still sucks knowing I didn’t have the courage back then	NULL

You are correct, our definition of god being a man who lives in the clouds looking over us and judging us is bs. However, an adjustment to the concept of "what" God is makes it much more palpable for a modern world. If you were to define the original point of infinity prior to the big bang as a "perfect number", then that could be construed as God. When the big bang occurred, and physics, time, space, matter, etc are all generated, they stem from that perfect number. Thus, God is "all encompassing." Since everything follows mathematical equations to the construct, everything can ultimately be solved. Thus, God is "all knowing." And finally, this would be the proof that we do not live in a world where anything truly random exists. Everything would be deterministic. The idea that we are individuals with true individual thought would be false. We are simply a mathematical product of the universe. And while I don't believe in the man in the sky theory at all, I could potentially believe in a physics/math based theory.   However, most people can't wrap their heads around something like this, as it's not comforting, so man in sky theory wins for the masses.	NULL

It’s the debate that will go on til the end of time. The generation before thinks the next generation’s music is garbage and so forth and so on. As someone born in 1997 who solely listens to late 50’s to late 80’s ish rock music I truly believe that your period of music was better overall and that’s without having any nostalgia bias because I wasn’t born yet. The 15% and 5% of today’s music may be the same percentage but it doesn’t hold the same weight in my opinion.   This might piss some people off but music is a hell of a lot easier to make nowadays and so much so that you don’t really have to put years of learning an instrument in or even to rent a proper recording studio to record. You can do almost everything on a computer with easy to use software. So basically what I’m saying is sure the numbers might look the same but I think the amount of talent it took back then compared to now makes this eras music by comparison not as good	NULL

I don't see it as a massive scam imo, hear me out.     Before, the CS6 Master suite would cost about 2,500$ and youll get updates only when it was the latest version. and if you wanted the latest and greatest you had to upgrade, which might have cost I dont know.. 1k?     Now you just pay a 52$ monthly subscription and get all you want, updates, support, a nice cloud storage, stock photos and neural filters.     In my opinion, it pays for itself (at least if you work with it) - if you're doing it as a hobby then its definitely a bad choice and there should be an option to buy one suite with limited updates so you dont have to spend on a monthly basis.

This question is shifting the burden of proof to atheists, when it should be with religious folk to begin with. What proof is there that any God exists or that any religion is true?   There is no proof, religion is entirely based on faith. Which is completely fine, I’m implore anyone to have faith if it brings them comfort and joy. But it is not on atheists to convince you why your god doesn’t exist, when there is zero proof that he does exist to begin with. iirc, this is called the burden of proof fallacy.	NULL

Been around since before social media.  The ease is part of the problem. There was a charm and cherish and element of organic discovery, in things we love that is now permenantly gone.  But there's also an increase in echo chambers puffing up people's worst tendencies and trains of thought.  And it's a small thing...but I'm really sad about the recent Spiderman movie. Aspects of that movie could have really inspired that childish awe and surprise...but now? We know and can crowd reseach too much.  People are constantly competing to out-know their fellow human being...To know it first and spoil it for everyone, now.  There never will be another piece of media that were all completely surprised anymore.  The "Luke I am your Father." moments are over, because of social media.	NULL

It's okay, sharks(not all) aren't actively looking to kill you unlike what you see in media. In the US there's an average of 14 shark attacks per year, it's really uncommon to be attacked by one. And I can say from personal experience that just because a shark is near you doesn't mean you're in danger.    I went on a vacation on the coast not too long ago and I had went snorkel/diving and I saw two sharks (idk the species) swimming around us. Only one came up to us and it was just curious. I promise they're more gentle than you think.    I believe the only shark to truly step lightly around are tiger/bull sharks. But I'm no marine biologist, I just am telling you what I've read and heard.    This doesn't mean go messing with sharks- but you can go paddle boarding :)	NULL

From my vague recall...the kid escaped, though his brain had been peeled open and Dahmer had been digging in there for a bit. The kid managed to find help via a police officer by running into the street but Dahmer discovered them, told some story about being the kid's guardian or some lie and, I believe, with Dahmer being a white man and the kid being a POC (young Laotian boy) the cop believed Dahmer and let Dahmer take the kid back. Where Dahmer finished consuming him.  Again, this is just vague recall so details are prob distorted and I can't quite stomach searching for all the correct details just right now.	NULL

I think the real question is, why would I believe in a god? The answer is because I've been culturally programmed to, but as modern humans we have the resources to examine the merits of the claim. If I do believe in god, which one? It's absurd to single out one god, and ask why you don't believe in him/it. Where was Yahweh before the first century AD? When did Buddah, Odin, Vishnu, or countless other gods show up? Why did each god only reveal themselves to certain cultures in a particular region? I think the answer is obvious, it's because they aren't real.	NULL

But you don't really own it, do you?  It's not ownership when all you own is a bit of text that's special in this one context.  Let's say you buy the Mona Lisa as a physical actual painting.  You can draw on it, you can tear it apart, you can put your signature on the back forever marking it as something that was once yours, you can take it from 1 place and put it to another. You *own* it and have the right to do whatever you please with it. If you want, you can take it somewhere and bury it in a nuclear bunker for 30 years so that noone can see the OG for this 30 years.   Buying the Mona Lisa as an NFT is getting a receipt that says "You own* the Mona Lisa! \*But it stays in the Louvre, you can't modify it in any way, can't even really see the original"  I'm pretty sure NFTs get you no actual rights to the art at hand. Again, you didn't buy the nice picture at the front of the NFT, what you have is a long bit of text that, in one particular application, will return a result of "You own [thing]", despite the fact that this is completely false.  There's no rights to the picture that you gain therefore you can't even count it as one of your posessions,you don't even get the original file (that part is because computers, I could go more in-depth regarding this too).   Like, really, do correct me if I'm wrong but that's what my understanding of NFTs is. Pictures are a cute forefront, but you only buy and receive a piece of text.	NULL

Well, I know what I’m talking about.  As a resident of one of the 19 U.S. states that still permit corporal punishment in schools, I can assure you that a number of schools in my county alone still utilize corporal punishment.  I was paddled every single day of my freshman year by a coach/history teacher who announced the first week of school that he would find a reason to do so.  Corporal punishment was practiced in 11% of U.S. school districts as of the 2013-14 school year, and disproportionately impacts poor and minority students (shockingly enough/s).  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5766273/  https://www.splcenter.org/20190611/striking-outlier-persistent-painful-and-problematic-practice-corporal-punishment-schools  Literally the first two google results, but don’t let the facts get in the way of your indignation.

Yeah, I have an Aunt who is extremely faithful, and who often is very loving, doting, and generous. But she’s also been openly intolerant, and has said very hurtful things, like a person can’t be a good person if they aren’t religious. She’s much better than she was thirty years ago, and she has many gay friends, but still has issues there that she generally keeps very quiet. We all have our flaws, but her intolerance is clearly rooted in her faith and the religious  values impressed on her growing up. She had far less room to question than I ever did. It was a very old school Catholic environment. When I learned about the Jesuits in middle school, I was told they were barely Catholics! I laugh about it, but it is just another example of intolerance, inflexibility, and obedience that I hate in religion. I have no interest in belief systems where that’s required, religious or otherwise.	NULL

Maybe this guy's friend's ancestors just had crappy nutrition/bad health when growing up? Both of those can diminish the amount a child grows.

I’m still employed and that’s an accomplishment for me! I’m chronically ill and sometimes have to call in due to my symptoms. My work has a strict absence policy with a point system and if I called out one more time I’d be fired. We have mandatory OT and mandatory Saturdays so it’s been absolutely draining to not call in. I met the one year mark at work and my FMLA claim just got approved so I won’t have to worry so much in the coming year about if I need to take a half day/full day here and there.   Oh, also, my continued sobriety was something I’m proud of myself for.	NULL

As a child I went to Sunday school, worship, and then I also went to a youth group house church, just trying to be a good kid.

My mum would take my computer's keyboard as punishment sometimes. So I learnt to edit the autoexec.bat file to give a menu that responded to mouse clicks or that booted up into Windows 3.1 so I could still do *something* when I was keyboard-less.  That was my first foray into coding (well scripting). QBasic came next. A few years later at school, our computers were really locked down in terms of what programs could run but there was a version of VisualBasic so I made a basic UI that gave me access to the whole file system and let me launch a browser without the parental features engaged.  Who knows, if my mum hadn't confiscated my keyboard, maybe I wouldn't have gone into academia and beyond, coding on a daily basis.	NULL
Instantly a story from a sound bowl meditation class I took popped up in my head. Sound pretentious? Reality and the concept of life and the teachings of yoga were lost on this woman. She said she had ALL the certifications and trained with *this* person in *this* country and blah blah. The teacher asked her if she used her knowledge to help and guide others who do not have access to high end retreats while not having to work AND have no kids. She said, "No I'm just working on finding myself and figuring out who I am." Well, you never will and here is why : helping others and hard times make for a more well rounded person. Traveling doesn't *really* satisfy your craving? It makes you happy but still unfulfilled because you didn't really work towards it. I will never forget how pompous and sad she was. I'll gladly break my back so we can all rise and for the ability to do so, I am humbled.	NULL

I'm not one, but it's definitely possible to be a "gnostic theist" or a "gnostic atheist."  - There are people who believe it would be impossible for the world to exist with a god, and the world does exist, so... - There are people who think that the existence of a god is logically impossible. If, by definition, gods are omnipotent, could they create a stone so large that they themselves couldn't lift it? It really depends on how each religion defines what a god is, but some may be impossible by definition.	NULL

I consider myself a conservative independent. I do support the idea of universal healthcare, better pay for workers, and cheaper college/trade schools. I also firmly believe that every able bodied adult needs to work and contribute to make those things possible. I don’t have any issue with people making more money if they are willing to work harder for it, but I don’t agree ceos should make millions per year while laying off workers to save money. I realize it will take some sort of legislation to get companies to pay workers fairly and keep inflation from swallowing all the extra pay they receive, but I am completely against big government because ultimately it’ll be owned and controlled by the elites. I always find myself at odds with the talking heads because they seem to constantly choose to be too far to the right or left. 🤷🏻‍♂️	NULL

I was watching some short lived series on TLC about much older women getting with young men (adults, but much younger than themselves). Anyway, one of the men was talking about how his fascination for older women began when he was a teenager (13) and the married neighbor lady started having sex with him. He was talking like it's completely normal and his girlfriend, this woman almost 30 years older than him, butt in and said that the previous woman had 'seduced him' and they'd had a real relationship at the time. She seemed pleased.   Funny, you spelled rape wrong. How do you hear that story and think that guy wasn't profoundly affected? He was a good looking guy and received plenty of attention apparently. But he wants a woman who is 65 to his 28?	NULL

I totally agree that 2.5 months is not long enough to call a solid relationship. And I've been completely crushed by someone I was with for a short time, too. My friends did not understand that I was in honest to God, genuine, soul rending pain. I took a long break after that.   You're also right that luck is a major factor. Of course, each person in the budding relationship is responsible for actions that may make it or break it, but if you're truly lucky, you'll find someone who is ultra compatible with you. Yeah, odds are against it but that is not unique to you. The same is true for everyone. It may be mathematically accurate to bet it won't happen but that doesn't mean it can't. Rose tinted optimism isn't always healthy either. Rather, remain open to the possibility, and actively keep watch for the possibility.  Consider four leaf clovers. Most people will never find one because they don't bother to look. They think, "They're so rare it's not worth my time to look. I have better things to do." Perhaps that's true. But I have found several four leaf clovers because I remained open to the possibility and took the time to look. In the end, it was just a clover with an extra leaf and it brightened my day nonetheless. How much greater is finding your life partner?   So maybe 2022 won't be the year. Odds are against it. But what if it is?   I wish you success!	NULL
"Results like these do not belong on the resume of a divine being" - George Carlin.   For me it is far more likely that religion is a story made up by people in power to control the masses then the existence of a God.

It's a problem of where do you draw the line?. There are forms of lobbying which it really doesn't make sense to ban, since it really is just paying people to hang out with politicians and advocate for a position. The problem is when it gets combined with campaign contributions. There is always the implied threat, if the politician doesn't please the lobbyist, the lobbyist's organization might not contribute to the politician. If the politician promises to take actions favorable to the organization, the organization will support the politician. As long as it's not explicitly tit for tat, where is the bribery? Of course, they'd be pretty dumb to explicitly state the arrangement, when it can all be implied.	NULL

Our inability to collectively observe reality and determine what is true and what is not. Not opinion based things, but actual facts.    Personally, I think this probably stems from the lack of trust in authority, and the conflating the idea of political authority with scientific authority (that is, experts in a field with superior understanding of that field), and from their just drawing sides and deciding we all get to choose our truth since no one can be trusted.  Even if I'm wrong though, the fact that we no longer seem to have a shared set of facts we can agree are true about the world around us is a huge problem, and prevents us from properly tackling important issues, whether that be protecting ourselves from disease or solving the issues contributing to climate change.	NULL

The smartass answer might be to say because I believe in reason.  We are all asking the same questions. To believe in something, is simply that. To believe you know the answer(s) to the impossible question(s). To be a non-believer, is to know that you don't.  Why do people believe? Tradition, education, love, fear, desperation, protection, comfort, manipulation, societal pressure? Take away your reason for believing and you may no longer need to believe that you know the answer.  Atheists are still asking the same questions, and we have plenty of theories but we accept that the unknowable, is.	NULL
I blame youuuuuu	NULL
>I suspect it could be an evolutionary advantage to believe in something of a higher power, giving a person more mental strength and fortitude thinking someone powerful is on your side. So to speak.  I agree. But I don't think the evolutionary advantage has to really even be that deep or mysterious of a thing.  Thinking takes up A LOT of energy, our oversized brains burns a fuck ton of precious calories.  It is very possible that having an 'easy answer' for unanswerable questions is a way for our brain to save calories.  For example- instead of spending hours trying to understand what makes lightening, or the aurora or rain your brain can just come to the 'quick' answer of "god makes it" and can then go back to sleep, or back to watching for game animals/threats.  But I absolutely agree with your mental strength hypothesis too.  This could make all the difference in a person's willingness to cross an 'uncrossable' mountain range to a better foraging area or unit warriors in battle that would otherwise flee.

It's not a theory, it's the [cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument), and it's been done to death, but I'll engage anyway.  >Everything that begins to exist has a cause.  Prove it.  >The universe began to exist.  Prove it.  >If the universe did not have a cause it can only mean   1. It created itself   2. It always existed.    And thats not possible.  Why not?  >Because things cannot exist and not exist at the same time.  First of all, prove it. Second, it could create itself \*or\* always have existed, exclusive.  >And everything must have a beginning because things cannot go back forever it's just illogical.  Space doesn't have a start or end point. It goes on infinitely in every direction. Why can't time? And time appears to be able to go forward forever, why not backward?  And how did God/god(s) begin to exist?  >If the rate of expansion had been slightly slower by one part in millions then gravity would have caused it to all collapse in a big crunch.        If the rate of expansion had been slightly faster by one part in millions then gravity couldn't pull any of the matter together to form planets, stars and gasses.  If either of those had happened, we wouldn't be having this discussion. For all we know, both of those did happen in trillions of other universes, and the people in them aren't talking about how they don't exist because they don't exist.

Maybe if you can prove negligence (such as the case of the parents in the case you are referring to).  But outside of negligence, where do we draw the line on putting blame on others?  Why would this be specific to just guns and not other property subsequently used in crimes?  Say someone's car is stolen and the joyriding thief hits and kills a pedestrian with it - do we hold the owner of the car partially accountable since they let their car get stolen and if it hadn't been, the pedestrian likely wouldn't have been hit?  Should a bartender that served a patron a few shots be held responsible when that person leaves and kills someone driving home since if the person wasn't served alcohol, the accident probably wouldn't have happened?  Say someone fails to properly maintain their home and their dryer catches fire due to a build up of lint and a firefighter dies fighting the fire, should the homeowner be held responsible for the fire fighter's death since the fire was caused by the owner's poor maintenance?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for hold people accountable if they are negligent with their firearms (or any property or duty for that matter), such as leaving a firearm unlocked and a child getting ahold of it or a straw purchase.  But I struggle to add blame to someone just because someone stole their property which was not negligently easy to acquire and then did something bad with it.  That's just a very slippery slope in my mind.  It's too easy to go from blaming the owner, to blaming the seller, to blaming the manufacturer.  Then why don't we blame bartenders, bars, and alcohol producers for drunk driving deaths, or car manufacturers for vehicle collisions deaths?  It starts getting into fuzzy arbitrary lines as to who's really to blame beyond the person directly responsible.	NULL

It just never made sense to me. As a kid I never really cared about it, and the only reason for me to pray before sleeping is because it was part of my “going to sleep ritual” (consisted in at least 4 times going to the bathroom, praying, preparing my bed, and taking my sweet time to turn off the lights, all of this in about 5 minutes). Once I just figured I could sleep without doing all of that, and by then we barely even went to church, so I figured that, I'm not praying, I'm not going to church, and I don't even care about it, do I even need a god? The answer was no, and here we are today. When I told this to my mother she straight up said ”sometimes I think you don't have feelings”, so that was a funny story to tell lmao.	NULL

Colleague took the call. A frantically wailing female caller and some traffic sounds were all that could be made out. Caller was not capable of providing any information about the emergency.  I searched the phone number in a vehicle driver's license database, and found a probable name and address as well as vehicles registered to that address and linked to that phone number. Sent police to home address linked to the phone. Unsurprisingly nothing was found.  Then I took a call about a reckless driver with hazard lights on. Got the description of the vehicle which matched a vehicle registered to my colleague's caller. It was seen traveling on a main road heading in the general direction towards the hospital on the route from the address I had found for my colleague's caller.  I aired an APB, alerting all police to be on the lookout for the vehicle and advised them that we suspected a medical emergency and that they may be on the way to the hospital. A police officer intercepted them and escorted them to the hospital.  They had left their 3yo child in the car when they carried in groceries and then forgot and left the child in the car. It was a hot day. The child did not make it.	NULL

The difference between the people who act masculine/feminine as opposed to the cultural norm and transgender people is that not-trans people do not feel any level of discomfort with they're gender assigned at birth.  As an add on, when I talk about these reactions I am talking about instinct. male and female have different instincts which make them inherently more likely to do certain things. That is why males are *more likely* to do dangerous things and females are *more likely* to stay safe.  If you have any questions please ask I am willing to answer anything that relates to this :)  When you move forward you should also try being nicer, when you are nice people are more likely to listen rather than getting defensive.

One of my worst experiences ever also involved a strip club and a bad coke deal. I never tell this story because it was extremely traumatic, but it’s definitely one of my top most terrifying experiences.   I was in Florida about 6 years ago with my ex-boyfriend to celebrate our birthdays which were just a few days apart. We are from the Pacific Northwest, and this was my first time in Florida. We had been out drinking all day, and ended up getting in a drunken fight. My ex is a terrible drunk. The fight ended with him storming off in the middle of the night and taking an Uber to a strip club nearby. Not knowing the area, he didn’t realize that the strip club was in a bad part of town.   Because he is an idiot, he had most of his money for our trip in his wallet. He was drunk and flashing $100 bills around at the club like a dumbass, which got him some unwanted attention. At some point, he found someone to buy coke from. My ex buys a bag, and the dealer says that he “doesn’t have change” (in a strip club 🙄). Dude convinces my ex that he should just come back to his house to buy more stuff.   They get in a car together and within a couple blocks, this dealer crashes his car into the back of a semi. My ex and the dealer get out of the car, and dude says they need to run. Cops are already pulling up. By some miracle, they evade the cops. But at this point, my ex doesn’t know they have just run deep into the hood. When they finally stop running, the dealer was really angry, screaming about his car getting totaled, and telling my ex it was his fault they crashed because my ex was “talking too much and distracted him from driving.”  While all of this is happening, I am back at our hotel alone and worried about my partner. He had called me to tell me that he was leaving the club with his “new friend.” I had begged him not to leave in this strangers car, but of course he didn’t listen. The dealer actually got on the phone with me and I asked him over and over to tell me his location so I could come get my partner. I will never forget him saying “don’t worry, I’ll get your boy home safe.” The tone of his voice sent me into an immediate panic. I knew my ex was in trouble.    So back to my ex. The next phone call I get is my him telling me about the car accident and that they were running from the cops. He said he was going to call an Uber back to the hotel. I was sick to my stomach and worried he was injured. He hung up the phone.   Just a few minutes later, I receive another call from my ex. This time my stomach dropped to the floor. I could hear him frantically running and repeating over and over that he was in trouble and he was “going to die.” I had never heard him sound so scared before and it sent me into even more of a panic.   I had no idea what had happened, but I ran to my rental car and began speeding around town trying to find him. Over the next 30 minutes I would receive multiple calls from my partner, and I was starting to understand that he was in serious trouble now. Apparently, after they crashed the car and ran from the cops straight into the hood, the dealer snuck up behind my ex and tackled him from behind. He took my ex’s wallet, which had all of our cash for our vacation in it, he also took back the bag of coke. My ex is skinny, but he is pretty strong. By some miracle he was able to get a few hits in. He was able start to run away, but the dude caught up and knocked him down again. My ex put all of his energy into a kick straight into this guys balls. That was truly the only reason he was able to stun dude long enough to run away. As he ran away, this dude yelled out “me and my boys are gonna find you and fucking kill you.”  So my ex is calling me while he is running, but he is so frantic he can’t tell me where he’s at. I’m racing around Palm Beach in the rental car trying to find him. My ex was hiding behind cars and houses now, as the dealer and his “friends” are circling the hood in cars with their lights off, trying to find him!  My ex finally made it to a gas station of some sort, where the attendant let him hide in the back. I was able to get directions from the attendant as well. I raced into the hood and barely even stopped the car as my bloodied and trembling boyfriend jumped in our car. There were people starting to approach the outside of the gas station when I pulled up, but it was unclear if they were with the dealer or not.   I truly believe my ex could have been killed that night. I think the plan from the start was to take him back to a house and rob him, but shit went awry when the dude unexpectedly crashed his car before they got there. It’s a miracle that his phone wasn’t stolen as well. If it had been taken, I would never have known he was in trouble or even where to find him. The entire time I was driving aimlessly around that unfamiliar city, knowing my partner was in danger, I truly thought he was going to die. I kept picturing myself calling his family and trying to explain what happened. I was the only one who could help him that night, and the stress of that was one of the worst experiences of my life.   That experience caused a lot of trauma for me. I would argue I struggled more with it long-term than my ex did. He would tell the story like it was a crazy night to brag about, but I was sick with anxiety for months afterwards. This is the first time I have ever written all this out, so if anyone actually read the whole thing, thank you for listening to my traumatic Florida experience!	NULL

I grew up in a Pentecostal church that was on the super extreme side of things. I’ve seen “demons” cast out of someone and the host threw up in the smallest trash can I’ve ever seen but it felt like home yeah it was wild but everyone was super close until my parents got divorced.  They made a whole lecture on the sins of divorce both morning and all night services. I was pulled up on stage because I wasn’t wearing the church appropriate clothing (wearing my baseball gear because my game ran late on a night service).  They gave my mom so much shit she finally gave up and stopped going and they told my sister and I that we’re a product of a sinful union and can not taint the flock. Soooo mad me a little angry towards religion, now my fiancé is a Christian and she grew up in a church like mine but without the purest background but she completely understands where I’m coming from and I understand why she needs it.

> If they are all art that sucks, while being all different genres, don’t those genres suck  You posited that IF (artist produces only bad art) AND (artist produces multiple different genres of art) THEN (all art genres artist has produced suck). And then you used that as a counterpoint by implying that (at least some of the genres don't suck) so therefore (artist must have produced decent art).  I'm attacking your premise by offering a counter example, which is all you need to invalidade a logic implication. I offered the example of myself where there will be a non null intersection of (genres don't suck) AND (artist sucks in all they have created).  I don't even know Kanye (nor care to), but I offer that not only is it possible to suck at all genres one tries, but it has happened several times in the course of recent history. And moreover, that has little to do with success.	NULL

We're told that God can do anything, he loves everyone, etc. But the very same people telling us that are the same ones that treat everyone who doesn't believe the exact same way as them like scum. They can't even get along with other branches of the same religion. A Roman catholic can't be with a protestant, a methodist can't be with a Baptist (throwing out names of sects, not making actual claims to the doctrine), they all believe in the same God, the same savior, the same apostles, but because they pray a little different then they're just as bad as non-believers. Forced to be a cultish Baptist growing up, I couldn't stand the idea of being a part of that shit once I started thinking for myself. When I say cultish, I am referring to how that church believed that a baby that dies before being saved goes to hell. I get the whole "born sinners" shtick, but how the fuck can anyone actually think a baby deserves hell? Couple all of that with seeing how many people have been slaughtered because "God wills it", especially when Jesus told everyone to stop being murderous dickheads, I can't in good conscience be a part of that.

People would gank mobs, steal camps, train you with intentions to make you die in an effort to reach the top cap before anyone else.   Every now and then I go back awhile after a new expansion launches for the nostalgia, usually the hardcore guys will already be at the end content and out of the way.	NULL

I'd been having problems with my neck, from an old whiplash injury. Physiotherapy helped, but there was something going on that x-rays couldn't see.  It took a while to persuade my doctor to order an MRI. He referred me to a spinal clinic to go over the results. I went to my appointment, hoping I wouldn't need surgery.  [A photo of my MRI](https://i.imgur.com/SYWwz1B.jpg).  So I had a herniated disc that was compressing my spinal cord. I got placed on an urgent list for surgery, and had a cervical disc replacement shortly thereafter. I was terrified I wasn't going to wake up, or I would wake up paralyzed. The surgery was a success, there is some permanent nerve damage, but I have full use of my hands and legs.	NULL

An orchestra's violin section should sound like two powerful violins in an ideal world. All the bowing should be exactly the same and the tonal quality be the same.  That's why when you have programs that play musical scores the program doesn't make it sound like 12 different violins, just two violins that are able to cut through and play at equal volume as the brass section in the mix. In reality you can't have just two violins on stage because they won't be able to carry through the theaters or over the percussion and brass very well so you need more bodies for the volume and epicness, but "two really powerful violins" is the goal of performing orchestral pieces.	NULL

Fuck you, you've made me waste so much time lol (sorry, imperial system)  So the average coat of paint is about 4 mils. Mils are thousandths of an inch. That means 1 inch every 250 years!   The average doorframe is 36 inches wide.   As a slim guy, I'd have to pick a room to be locked in at the 3,625 year mark.  Suppose this was a magical trap, survival scenario, so food get's magically stocked,  water/electricity/air will keep flowing, and you wont age.    The obvious room choice is the largest room in the house, and you would move the fridge there in the first few years.   Air, or lack there of, can be the first thing to kill you. If air can flow through this magical paint, or windows only trap you, then it's no biggie for now.   If you need vents... well then I'd start suffocating in 2000 years.  Say air isnt an issue.   Then the biggest initial issue waste.   Ya gotta shit and ya gotta throw away crap.   If the terrain is destructible(minus the paint), then your first job should be to make a rudimentary sewer way from the biggest room.   You can probably remodel the ground vents or something.  The next issue is whether or not water counts as "magically restocked food", and whether is spawns in a movable object (ie fridge).   If so then we good on that.   If not... with some jerry rigging and leaving the kitchen faucet on at the 560 year mark, I can probably have water in my living room till year 13,750.  All that's left is to get some extension cords, wheel the fridge into the living room, and browse Reddit for 22,000 years till the paint encases me.	NULL

The horn is an underrated instrument in popular music.

If an atheist believes in these theories as strongly as a religious person believes in God, you're right. And that may be the case for an alarming number of people because how sure something is in science is not something all people understand.  But when you look at how actual scientists present them I'm sure they'll say "we don't know, it could be this, it could be that. Hopefully we'll find an answer" whereas a theologist would wholeheartedly assert that his theory is correct.  And as long as the theories about the origins of the universe are presented to motivate awe in what we don't understand yet or show the frontier of science, I'm all for it. Who knows, maybe we'll at least be able to discard some of these theories in our lifetime.	NULL

Same goes for vomiting. A couple of times back when I was a seriously heavy drinker (I'm a sober alcoholic), I got VICIOUS hangovers that lasted for days. I would be so sick that I could barely move without vomiting, but also desperately thirsty, so I would keep downing water, which would inevitably come right back up. Once the vomiting finally let up, all the water in the world wouldn't rehydrate me because I'd lost so much of my salts and electrolytes. I had to take copious amounts of Dioralyte to replenish them. On the worst occasion, I ended up in the hospital and had to have rehydration salts and saline via IV. The standard thing they use for that kind of situation is called a banana bag (because the fluid is yellow) or rally pack.  That was the incident that kind of brought home to me how bad my drinking had gotten and set me on the path towards sobriety.	NULL

To say there is any one reason is wholly incorrect. It's been a whole bunch of smaller reasons. Like just all sorts of inconsistencies between the bible and real life. Or taking a step back and realizing that all the praying is basically just brainwashing (same with the pledge of allegiance everyday, that's kind of super weird). Even if there was a god that created the entire universe and humanity we're such an insignificant part of it that there seems to be very little reason for us to be in gods image. And even if we are then so what? It's also that I saw there are hundreds or thousands of religions and there's no real reason that anyone of them is "the right one". I also have no idea what the point of faith is. Like for a being that can create something like humans what good does our faith do them? Do they get God Points or something out of it? There's nothing we would be able to provide them that they couldn't just make themselves so to any kind of god with a personality our faith wouldn't mean anything besides boosting their ego. I often feel that religious people (at least christians) tend to do "good" deeds not because they themselves want to do good, but because they want to get into heaven. It really made me question whether or not that difference actually makes them good. That isn't to say that some religious people don't selflessly give. My own mother is that way. There's a whole lot more than that, but this is a decent start at explaining why I don't care whether or not there's a god.	NULL

Here are three very similar ones which were all told to me by an insane relative.  1.  The Loch Ness Monster exists but it’s not in Loch Ness. It, in fact, washed up on the shores of Japan but the Japanese government covered it up because knowledge of existing dinosaurs would cause a mass panic (for some reason).  2. Pterodactyls still exist and footage of one was taken in Montana in the 00s and uploaded to YouTube but the government had the footage removed and scrubbed from the Internet because they have a vested interest in keeping people immersed in the paradigm that dinosaurs don’t exist anymore.   3.  A National Geographic affiliated archaeology team in India discovered fossilized evidence of giants dating back to biblical times. Although they published their findings, the Indian government made them retract it because it provided evidence of the real historical battle between David and Goliath and the government wants to actively suppress any information that indicates that the Bible is an accurately written history of world events.  All three of these examples are evidence that governments around the world (or maybe just one big shadow government) are actively colluding to suppress scientific and archaeological evidence that the bible is an accurate and complete history of the world.  These governments suppress the fact that not only did humans and dinosaurs live alongside each other in the past but also that dinosaurs never went extinct in the first place. In fact, extinction isn’t possible because that would mean that a part of gods creation was flawed and that would be logically impossible.  These governments sustain these lies because it gives them some kind of control over the populace’s minds. Other mind control practices include water fluoridation and chemtrails of course.	NULL

Why don't you believe in Zeus, or Allah, or Brahman? You need reasons to believe in God, not reasons not to.  I'm yet to see any evidence for god's existence, many rely on self fulfilling prophecy type observations. For example, humans are very complex and many things had to go right for us to exist, but if those things *hadn't* gone right we wouldn't be here to ponder our own existence, we wouldn't be asking the question. It's like rolling a dice until you get a 6 and only questioning *why* you got a 6 when it happens, you're ignoring all the times you didn't.  Similarly, how do you know it's *your God* that did these things. How do you know it wasn't Gaia or Allah?   How do you justify the rest of the belief system? Let's say we find empirical proof that God exists, how do we know that he wants us to eat Fish on Fridays and be good to our neighbor?  What about the beliefs that have changed over time, for example the Christian Bible explicitly forbids eating shellfish, but many Christians ignore it today. Christianity and Islam forbid homosexuality, but many Christians and Muslims ignore that part.   How did so many people get different ideas about God? A Christian and a Muslim both believe *a God* exist but their views differ wildly on what form of worship is most appropriate. Even within Christianity Catholics and Protestants have different views on how best to worship God and what he wants. How do we know we're not meant to pray towards Mecca 4 times a day?	NULL

I just started working for a small 10 person business located in an office building complex that housed a few other companies and about 500 employees. The owner owned a lot of car dealerships nearby so i always thought he did his weekly ‘stop in and say hi’ visits just to check in… he was super chill so it fit.  One day everyone but the admin and myself were at lunch… so i ran to get us something and saw the owner parking. Thought i would be helpful and save him the hassle so waved him down and told him ‘no one is in the building were all at lunch’…. He looked confused and I feared that he thought i was ratting people out… so i told my direct manager later about it….  Turns out the owner also owned the whole complex and the other businesses. Oh and his personal office was a two min walk from mine…  So ya i think of that prob once a month when walking to my parked car lol	NULL

Yeah, it's important that that's said in the first place, too. It kind of read as if he tried to explain his silence *afterward* which could very well come off as him just trying to cover his ass (whether or not that's what's happening). It's hard to do in the heat of the moment, but it's important to communicate your thoughts so the other isn't filling the silence with assumptions.	NULL
It’s not that late lol	NULL
 Basically for me if I’m sitting there and I feel like you are trying to brainwash me, I’m out.  Church is like being in a timeshare sales meeting or a mlm “opportunity”, or watching an infomercial, if you have to convince me in 50 different ways and repeat all the great things over and over, there’s no way I am buying what you are selling.  I can remember reading something when I was very young about mind control and group thinking.  It talked about how people have a pension for groupings of 3. And if you wanted to convince someone of something you needed to repeat the idea three times.  I found myself sitting in church realizing that’s what all the preachers and ministers did.  It made me extremely uncomfortable, to the point of not wanting anything to do with organized religion.  If your god is so great why do you have to sell them like a dirty used car salesman?   Add to that the hypocrisy of the “godly people” who go out and sin like hell but have the mental safety net of asking for forgiveness and being absolved of all their shit, all the while pointing their fingers at you for your sins.   The fact that Christians use a book that was part oral tradition for hundreds of years then written down and translated to a million different languages and they want to say it is the literal word of god….. wtf, a simple game of telephone fucks up a single sentence in a group of 5 people, how is gods true word surviving hundreds of years of oral storytelling and multiple language translations without becoming altered in some way?  The self centered nature of religion itself, oh, we are the “chosen people” and our interpretation and way of worshiping our diety is the only way.  When clearly the differences between most religions comes down to rules for living that were tailored to the time period and geographical region from which it came.   The thought that someone is always watching and has some master plan for me is just plain creepy to me…. I don’t like being watched, it gives me no sense of security, it’s just fucking weird.  The thought of a utopia afterlife is weird as shit as well, like you all just hang out in this lovely place and do what? Stare at one another all day long? And then there’s the conundrum of where are you at when you go to heaven? I mean I would want to be like mid to late 20s…. I felt great, had fun, looked good and I’m sure someone like my grandma would feel the same way, you always envision yourself as being in the peak of your life, but I would not want my 20-something version of my grandma in my version of heaven.  In my version of heaven I have my 80something year old grandma who made angel food cake and fudge, not some 20 year old wild lady…. On the same note What about the four children of mine that ended in miscarriage?  even if each of them was a full fledged baby waiting for me that I could hold and love I think the grief and loss of my time on earth with them would be overwhelming….. also would I be raising them? I mean how do you raise a whole other set of children in this magical land where everyone lives for eternity and doesn’t age?  and how do you introduce and catch up your living children to your deceased children who were never a part of the world?   I could go on and on about why I don’t believe, but it comes down to the fact that, like other people, I have been given no reason to actually believe.  Nothing I have seen so far makes me want to jump on that bandwagon.	NULL

My mother forced me to the curch every sunday morning (plus all the other festivities) and It was really annyoing wasting  my youth time following the Priest and some scart looking old ladies, so I really hated the concept of religion till I was 14/15 but then I started to not care about because I cannot see the reason why I should 'waste' my time speaking ti a God that does not listen to me (I belived in it when I was a child, despite hating the mass, and prayed for a lot of thing that never happend). Moreover growing up I created my own moral system where some concept were stolen from the Christian values because I aknowledge that there are some good thing in it but the concept of god and religion became more and more superflous so I decided to not care.

It is the adoption of a theory of "common language".

I don't. If the writing is objectively bad and the characters mere ciphers, then I can't enjoy the book. But then I usually read classics or contemporary literary fiction where the emphasis is mostly on language and characterization over plot, so a badly written literary fiction novel strikes me as worse than badly written genre fiction, where there's no implicit agreement that the writing must be good.

>If the machines needed to keep humans in a permanent sleep state through the use of simulation pods  Oh yeah, this is a fairly well known intervention by the studio. When the Wachowskis originally presented the script to Warner Bros, the premise is that the machines couldn't capture human ingenuity in their attempts to make AI. Humans kept surprising them. So the machines figured out a way to use human brains directly as AI—it, actually, just "I"—processors.  The studio felt that audiences would get lost on this point, so the execs insisted that this be dumbed down and the humans be used as batteries instead.  This is clearly stupid though, and makes no sense, and robs the narrative of a vital thread about what rights one has to control one's own mind and purpose it. It also doesn't explain why the machines would need to jack into brains at all in the first place…a comatose human serves the same purpose of their body is just being used to generate heat. And we are terrible batteries. The whole premise of the movie just becomes nonsense. And Neo's ability to evade and take over the environment makes him look superhuman instead of just the first example of what kept happening to the machines in all their attempts leading up to that point—humans keep outsmarting them because natural intelligence is somehow better than artificial.  Later, the revelation that the first movie takes place in the sixth attempt to build the matrix lands as a momentous development. Without this key plot point, though, it doesn't. The architect is just rambling nonsense for six minutes without this context.  So instead of being the original story, and Neo only being special because he's first as opposed to unique among humans, he now becomes this Jesus figure, and those whole Christian narrative better projected into the movies. "Neo" is a reference to the new testament. "Trinity" is a reference to the Christian godhead, father, son, and holy ghost (Morpheus, who is the passage between the two worlds). Cypher was Judas, Nebuchadnezzar is involved somehow, etc.  When Neo sacrifices himself at the end of the first movie, the lighting effect happens to fade to a cross. At the time, people interpreted that as an "obvious" reference to the crucifixion when in fact it was just a coincidence.  The Wachowskis recently confirmed that, far from being a Jesus allegory, the movies are actually an allusion to the double life led by trans people before they come out, about as orthogonal to Christianity as it gets. Switch was supposed to be male in the Matrix, female outside it, but that also got killed by the studio as "too confusing."  This isn't too say the Matrix doesn't reference Christianity at all, it does, but not more than other religions (the Oracle from ancient Greece, there is no spoon and the martial arts being to Zen Buddhism, Zion is obviously referencing Judaism, Mjolnir the Norse canon, etc) as well as other sources that have nothing to do with religion like Through the Looking Glass (follow the white rabbit, red pill / blue pill followed by literally going through a looking glass.  Anyway, all of this is to say that with the story as originally intended, everything I say above still holds. And if you watch the Animatrix, you'll see further that the Neo as Jesus narrative falls apart for another reason, as does the humans-as-batteries take: Humans aren't the good guys in the story, we are the bad guys. It turns out we kinda forced the machines to capture us…they wanted peace but we wouldn't stop nuking them.	NULL

Things like leg sweeps, hip throws, round kicks… super duper useless if the person you’re fighting actually wants to hurt you. If you can’t shoot them, then stab them. If you can’t stab them then get away from them. If you can’t get away be prepared for pain and sacrifice cause you’re going to have to give them something and it’s going to hurt.	NULL

My problem with this argument is that the very definition of a representative democracy means that you can tell whether people are satisfied with their representation by whether or not they vote for the same candidate again. If the Dems fail to represent the left, then the left has no _more_ reason to vote for them than they do to vote for a Republican, and if the Republicans weren’t representing the right, then the right would have no _more_ reason to vote for them than to vote for a Democrat. But _that isn’t what we see in practice,_ which means that a sufficiently-large and (dare I say) representative fraction of the left feels that the Dems _do_ represent them, and a similarly large fraction of the right must feel well-represented by the GOP.

It's not the scariest compared to a lot of people's here, but I thought it would be neat to share.  So to start this off, I was at a small get together at a friend's place; we all hung out in the basement. The group of us consisted of my friend, his brother, his cousin, my brother, and myself. Our parents were also good friends so they were present, but in another room.  It was getting incredibly late and my mother was really drunk so we had to call a taxi cab, however, I thought it would be nice to walk home alone in the dark at 3 AM in the part of my city where gang violence, often racially motivated (I'm indigenous), happens to be particularly common, not to mention this was also about a week away from Halloween so people were setting of fireworks left and right.  My mother was hesitant at first and she sent me on my way, so I put on my clothes, popped my Walkman into my jacket (yes, I still use those rickety old pieces of junk), and made my way outside.   Only a few cars drive by on my way home, but it's still pretty nerve racking since the road leading to my house has a pretty high speed limit, not to mention how sharply the road curves to one side, so normally every time a car passes (even before this incident occurred) I usually flinch in fear that it might swerve off the road and hit me.  Eventually, at the halfway point I notice another group of three people on the other side of the road walking and chatting, probably coming back from a party, or going to one, but I don't think much of it and I carry one.  Moments later, a black car with scratches and dents and black tinted windows comes by and starts slowing down next to me. I don't think much of it, expecting them to turn into a nearby apartment complex, but instead they ride slowly next to me, and I start shitting my pants. I look over to see the window rolling down and four men inside of the car in all black, and the driver has his hand out the window.  This is where it really hit me, looking in his hand I saw what I'm almost certain was a handgun of some sorts. I'm still not one hundred percent sure to this day since it was dark out and the streetlights were conveniently a really deep yellow hue so it was pretty difficult to see, even when directly under the light.    Now, I have really long hair and I happened to be wearing a toque at the time, so I'm not sure if they thought I was a woman and tried to get a good look or something, but as soon as I looked at them I heard them laugh and they sped up and rode off. And because I didn't want to get involved any further, I put my head down, in fear, and stared at the ground as I continued walking, just wanting to get home at this point.  Then, out of no where three bangs, loud, and almost like a gunshot, go off right in front of me and I stop in fear, thinking I was being shot at, but then I look up and see the car speeding away from the group on the other side of the road. Fireballs, yes, actual fireballs flying around, across the road, into the air, all over the place.  Turns out, they'd set off multiple massive fireworks and tried throwing them at the group (thankfully they all missed). At this point I was just done, and started jogging back to my place which was thankfully just up the road, but also unfortunately in the direction they drove in. I didn't encounter them again and got home safety.  Needless to say, I don't walk home alone in the middle of the night anymore, especially since multiple other shootings have occurred around my home's vicinity (a few blocks away or so). Looking back on it I can't really blame my mom for letting me go out, it's not like she was capable of making rational decisions by herself seeing that she was heavily intoxicated at the time.	NULL

I have thought about this a lot, because of all the porn with familial stuff.   My working theory is that our brain basically works like an algorithm, programmed with data points from things we see, hears, experience in the world.   Because most peoples sexuality hits them like a truck in their early teens while they are still living at home, an unconscious association is programmed.

And besides all of that i also just don't trust the logistics of it. The Bible isn't the word of God, it's someone claiming their word is the word of God. Fine, God's word is infallible, but man is not. Corruption and deceit didn't just start existing in the 1980's.  "But the Bible HAS to be the word of God. Look how old it is." Yeah and how many times have people rewritten, and reinterpreted it, rewritten it again, edited out the things they didn't agree with,  reinterpreted it again from some older version, added things they swore were in there before, then scraped and re-translated from tales that were passed down for several centuries entirely by spoken word? Also I'm pretty sure the Epic of Gilgamesh is older than the Bible, does that not mean some tale about a Sumerian gigachad and his monster boyfriend are more valid than Jeezus?	NULL

Most architecture in the region was made of adobe brick, or were mobile temporary shelters made of hide and cloth, so... no?  Your comment is wrong.  Beyond being inaccurate, it's also just kind of shitty.  Many of those people *were killed by* the incursion of colonial America, and it's kind of cruel to imply that their housing choice somehow made them worthy of death.  Passing value judgement on someone's tech tree shouldn't give you a right to kill them and occupy their homeland.  Also, it's equally weird to me that you seem to look down on the local people for their housing situation, but *not* look down on the expedition for the cutting edge medical technology that had them *eating mercury pills*.  Between the two, I think I'd rather live in a tent and not have my bones be an archeological hazard, thanks!	NULL

. Thanks to their unique ability to worm into DNA, viruses can be used to inject genes into cells, which can reverse some genetic diseases. For example, some viruses have been able to cure hemophilia, a blood disorder that prevents clotting.  Viruses have also helped illuminate how the human mind works, using a technique called optogenetics. It involves the use of viruses that have been genetically modified with light-sensitive cell receptors lifted from green algae.  When injected into the brain, these viruses are able to modify the DNA of specific neurons, allowing them to be switched on or off by flashing those brain cells with blue light. By observing what happens when these switches are thrown, neuroscientists have developed new theories on how things like depression and addiction become ingrained in the brain.	NULL

First off, most religions put humanity on some kind of special pedestal, like we are in some way not animals, which is just very egocentric.  Secondly, if there is a god, he is doing a very lousy job. So, we should hate him, not love him.  Thirdly, the universe is way too awesome to be one "person's" design.  And lastly, believing in a higher power and afterlife, instead of realizing there is no specific point to all of this misery, is the easy way out.	NULL

I am left wing and do not think sperm banks should exist.    My reasons are:  1. We are bordering on an overpopulation problem.  If you aren't in a situation where you can have kids, go adopt one.   2. The children usually aren't allowed to know who their father is.  That is so wrong.    If you really want to bare a child with your body.find sperm from a man you know and write a contract where if your child has any questions or are curious then they can ask their biological father.    My Aunt is a lesbien and had my 2 cousins via sperm donor.  She said "I think what I did should be illegal.  I think it should be illegal to willingly choose for your child that they cannot know their biological father."    My cousins are some of my favorite people in the world and we are close.  I know for sure my one cousin hates that he can't ever know his father.  He has the word Vader (Dutch for Father, we have a Dutch/Frysan last name) tattooed on his back as not having a dad hurts him and shaped him so much.  I don't know if my other cousin cares as much..?  He is gay so maybe it affected his perspective with men less as he got male companionship in the form of loving relationships so the hole is partially filled perhaps?   (Like a lot of people, he was born gay so I am in no way saying not having a dad made him gay, that's not what I mean at all).    FYI I am bisexual myself and my opposition to this has nothing at all to do with her being in a lesbien relationship.	NULL

I'd say that Caligula had a very unsafe and fearful youth. That probably did not help creating a stable person. So it seems the power (which he got quite suddenly at a very young age) went a bit to his head. But indeed, he wasn't as much a complete madman as he is made out to be. Most stories of him being a sexual pervert are probably not true. He was very cruel towards the Senate, indeed, but not a complete serial killer. The story of him letting his army collect shells on the beach and shoot arrows in the sea might be misinterpreted too. Probably the arrows were meant as some kind of symbolic thing, while the shell collecting might either have been a figure of speech (as in, that they actually captured the canoes of local pirates) or a punishment for his men not obeying him.  Nero is a similar problem. He clearly was unsuited to be emperor, was very cruel to and distrusting. But he was more like a Roman Justin Bieber than a Roman Jack the Ripper. He got too much power at age 16 and therefore didn't know how to behave. The ordinary people loved him, however. And the story of him setting fire to Rome was even doubted by Tacitus, who wasn't fond of Nero at all.	NULL

About a year ago decided to go for a run for the first time on my new street. It was a pretty countryside road and the sunset was perfect. I had lived there for a couple months without running yet so i was excited to see what was there. Well I get about 2 blocks away from my apartment and there's a guy in the road. He pulled over and it seemed like he was looking for something in the grass. No red flags. I was completely taken by the scenery that I barely noticed him. He was pretty skinny and had stringy long hair and tattoos all over. Still no red flags. And a giant foot long blade in a sheath on his belt loop. Still no red flags. He doesn't seem to notice me until  I'm crossing his path and I actually scared him. He jumped and felt for his knife. I just kept jogging like "oh sorry dude" well I keep jogging and the road is not long so on my way back all these people are stepping out of their big fancy houses with guns in hand. Some people are on the phone outside their front door. By the time I'm making my second pass (where the guy was) I hear police sirens and people are now in small groups outside in their lawns. I decide to kind of jog up to one of them and ask whT the fuss was. The lady told me that early in The morning before the sun came up there was a car accident and the people involved were arrested for drug possesion and intoxication when a lady in the neigborhood called the police and this guy was the boyfriend who had come to try to find out who called the police on them. Not sure what could have happened but glad I didn't find out. He seemed a little hostile or maybe just confused but I don't think they got him.	NULL

Highly recommend Orient Mako II/Ray II or Kamasu/Kanno if you want a sapphire crystal. Orient and Seiko are the same company and you can get a used Mako II on r/watchexchange for like 80 bucks.

too many disagreements between Christian denominations, they can’t agree what the book says.  old testament God is cruel imo, the men of the new testament set up all sorts of sexist rules, it’s just clear to me that a being of ultimate goodness by todays standards is not there  nobody gets hurt when they blaspheme, miracles do not happen, and once you’ve seen through one of the major world religions you’re not gonna pick up another one.  i did dabble with the occult, and never, not once, have i ever witnessed anything supernatural.  it’s just a fruitless effort, and it’s frustrating to see someone dedicate their life to something you KNOW isn’t real, force their kids to do it too… it’s like one of those Harry Potter obsessed moms but imagine if instead of it being fun the kids could only read Harry Potter had to speak in quotes from it and HAD to dress like they were from Hogwarts and were forbidden from marrying muggles… all the while she has convinced her kids that Death Eaters are after them and that she communicates regularly via telepathy with Dumbledore, who tells them what to do. it’s literally the same, i know who wrote Harry Potter, i know it’s just fiction… no i don’t want to discuss which Hogwarts House i belong to please leave me alone 😭	NULL

Might be a generational thing, but can’t take care of basic things like cooking and cleaning and looking after the space they live in. Lived with too many guys in college who had no idea how to look after themselves or the space they lived in. It makes me think about my dad who can’t cook or clean that well either and it’s because my mom always did those things for him, and nowadays in his retirement years he just gets angry or defensive about it instead of trying to learn. It’s sad to see some of the new generation of men who lack the general and basic skills to live on their own in this sense or at least share a space with others. Of course I’ve lived with female housemates as well who can’t do these things but from my experiences and the experiences of my friends in college and the workforce living with housemates, it is the male housemates who struggle the most with these things. It wouldn’t be as much of a maturity thing if they were willing to learn how to do these things but often if these issues are brought up by the housemates they immediately get angry, defensive, or passive aggressive. It might be due to the same expectation that their mom, and then eventually their wife, will do these things for them but of course that’s not always the case. To be clear I’m not saying all men in their early 20’s to 40’s are like this, but god damn if I haven’t seen many a guy’s place and been given a disheartening look into their basic habits and behaviors behind closed doors.

As far as documentation goes i'm talking about things like varied creation myths across the globe from different times, especially among small tribes they can be very tailored to that culture (someone came up with it mostly independently), things like cave paintings depicting sun deities... yes there is lots of evidence religion is something that people naturally have a tendency towards.  It's clearly not a viral movement emanating from one place.  It crops up just about every place we see any record of history.  And also, sure, many people are happy to live life without much real curiosity, but even the dullest child has wondered where they came from, why they are here at least once.

I'm centre left, but I quite like having a Monarchy (UK). There are many problems with it and some of the people who make up the royal family, and they certainly shouldn't have privileged protection from the law. But our monarchy is almost 1,000 years old. It's a tradition and institution that defines our nation, and the lives of our forebears.   To abolish it because of today's societal standards has not only been tried before, but feels like we'd lose something irreplaceable. In a world where so much happens, so much changes day to day, having something constant, something enduring, is rather refreshing.	NULL

I think it’s bad news, and I genuinely don’t see the benefit of it at all. If killing a murderer could bring your loved one back to life, then it would be a different story, but the vast majority of victim’s families either feel no better at all, or worse after watching another human be put to death.   The bottom line for me is that I would never kill somebody, and therefore never suggest that anyone else do so or demand that it be done to serve some weird and perverted sense of justice.   I’ve always felt that way by instinct, but it’s been listening to dozens of firsthand accounts of watching executions that made it absolutely concrete for me. Like… it’s all a very abstract thought until you literally think about sitting down and looking through a window to watch somebody get strapped down to a table and killed. It’s just wrong, wrong, wrong across the board.   Furthermore, I believe that for the majority of people… sitting in jail for your entire life is a worse punishment. The punishment of the death penalty is knowing that you’re going to die… once you’re gone you are no longer being punished and have nothing to worry about. I would argue that the person in the cell next door who is going to spend 50 years sitting in a cage staring at a wall has got it just as bad or worse.   And from a very basic high school debate point of view, I understand that it costs a lot more money to run a death penalty case all the way through the legal system than it does to keep somebody alive in jail for their whole life.   The fact that such an insanely high proportion of “pro-life” people support the death penalty is a whole other can of worms.	NULL

I understand that vaginal lips means labia. I never said that it didn't. I took the question to be about leotard slippage and not literally about lips falling out. I assumed the OP was using crass language for comedic effect and not literally wondering if the lips fall out while everything else stays put, as that is nonsensical. I think it takes a degree of malicious literalism to read the question the way you have.  And as for these things you've said about proper fit and underwear (none of which have to do with anatomy), those things answer the question that was in my mind. If you've really done gymnastics and knew that, that would have been cool to hear about. I googled it and also apparently there's some kind of adhesive gymnasts use. That's cool to know. I wouldn't have learned about that if I didn't see this question. Just because an answer is obvious to you because of your personal experience, doesn't mean someone is dumb for being curious about it.	NULL

I don't have spare bucks to throw around if I get sick to see a doc, I've gotta either go to work or not eat a meal, and nobody should have to make that choice. My opinion is, the very small percentage of people that would abuse such a system are outweighed by the good of a truly single payer (tax funded only) system that would benefit people like me that cannot at all afford any extra expenses.

Insisting on being treated like a princess/queen no matter what. Being entitled is not cute.

Queen Victoria, although maybe closer to 10-15 years later. She would’ve put a stop to WW1 since many of the belligerents were ruled by 19 of her nephews and grandchildren.

Tldr: Relieved the good old days, now everything is shitty.  You know when people say "the good ol' days, when there was nothing to worry about, no responsibilities, no work, no bills, no stress, just pure happiness and enjoyment with the bois". I actually got to "relieve" those days. When the pandemic started, schools started going online. And since I'm from a third world country, the "system" (of anything really, not just schools) that already nearly doesn't work on first World countries, is even worse here. Because of it I basicly got two whole school years for free! No studying, didn't have to do almost anything (besides going to school at the end of 2021).   After the lockdown started, I began talking to this girl. Even tho it was a long distance relationship, things went away better than anyone would have thought. It lasted for 8 months, and those were the best of my life. It was like I was on drugs. Just happiness and joy all the time. She made me so happy. I know this is clumsy but she was the first person to make me feel actual love. I've had crushes on the past but she was something I had never felt.   During that time there were so many new things. I can not master the words to describe how many new things there were during that time. So many new, amazing, great, astonishingly fun games, so many new memories with them. And my best friend, who accompanied me during all of them, just made everything even better! Fall guys, warzone, dark souls 3, rocket league, minecraft, horizon zero down, fortnite, subnautica, sekiro, need for speed, final fantasy, Tom Clancy's the division 2, remnant, we were here, hollow knight, the last of us part 2, shadow of the colossus, journey, titanfall 2. All of them in the span of those two years. (Yes I just listed all of that for no reason :>) So many new musics, so many new artists, movies. The entire mcu. Even if I tried I wouldn't be able to list everything new and amazing that happened ever since the pandemic started. And then we broke up and after that everything started crumbling down. I've gone back to a time of pure happiness, a stress-free time where I knew nothing but excitement and amazing new memories and feelings. Sadly I've gone back to earth and, I don't even know what I feel anymore. It's like everything and everyone is gone. And it's just this pitch black void. Just me. Alone. I miss my friend. I miss being happy. Truly happy.  The worst of living these great times is that they are only great bcs you didn't searched for them. They just popped into your life and without you even realizing it, they are gone. Even if played countless new games, listened to every music available or talked to someone else, things wouldn't be the same.   Thanks for listening to mt ted talk, have a great day :>	NULL

Calling the big bang an explosion is... A decided oversimplification. While the source of the singularity that was the origin of the known universe is unknown, the sheer scale of it makes calling it an explosion kind of silly.  Anyway, it certainly didn't create anything at first. Galaxies didn't spin off the big bang, or stars, or any stellar bodies.  It was an expansion of superheated plasma, and it took hundreds of thousands of years to start cooling off. That's when the cosmic background radiation first originated, and from there we can more or less map the earliest formation of hydrogen clouds that clustered into stars, and then created the heavier materials in the element tables. It's a long, long progression that took more time that people can really comprehend... Me included.   There were so many steps between 'bang' and having rocky planets with water that life could take shape on... Certainly more than I could outline in a Reddit post.	NULL

Most people only believe in what they believe in because of where they were born. If your belief system comes down to an accident of geography, it’s probably not a very good belief system. Most Christians would be worshipping Allah if they were born in Saudi Arabia and they would be just as confident they were right. Now you can use an incredibly flawed logical system and get the right answer, it’s just not particularly likely.   I don’t completely rule out the possibility of god though. I think the fine tuning argument is problematic. Unless we can prove multiverse theory to be true, and the laws of physics can operate different in different worlds, I have to give some incredibly small chance to the possibility of a creator.	NULL

>If you spend enough time on atheist subs I think you’ll find that you’re a minority on this issue.  Not in my experience. Most atheists view on life is 'live and let live' - I've no problem with anyone's beliefs as long as they're not expecting to influence my life based on them. For some atheists they have had to break out of some pretty abusive situations and are pretty pissed off about it so I'm not going to judge them either.  > You’re right. People do that.  As the saying goes: good people do good things. Bad people do bad things. But for good people to do bad things, that takes religion.  I'll add to that that religion can also make bad people do good things too. But the point is that it changes behaviours.  > If God is timeless then he doesn’t need to be created  This is just wordplay though - just defining God as something doesn't make it true. You might as well say God is real because you've defined him as being real. Can you actually explain how anything could ever be 'timeless'?  > “Because God” is the start of an acceptable answer because it at least makes some reasonable attempt to explain the origin of the universe as opposed to giving up and not making any claim whatsoever about what cannot be absolutely proven.  I fundamentally disagree. "Because God" is the start of closing your brain off to the possible and deciding that you'll use a pre-determined off-the-peg answer rather than remain curious.   Is it better to recognise that there are some things that we just cannot know given current understanding, or is it better to invent answers to fill those gaps?	NULL

Just because there isn't an answer to why the universe was created doesn't mean I need to believe an answer that isn't supported by evidence.   There isn't evidence that God created the universe or that God exists so right now the best answer is I don't know how the universe was created.   People have a tendency to explain things they don't understand, even if the explanation is false.	NULL
I grew up Christian and found the explanations wanting, so I became neo pagan as it offered better explanations. Then I realised that all the stuff that I had to convince me of a higher power didn't really pan out.  I basically reasoned god out of my life and haven't seen anything to change that. I still find religions and peoples beliefs fascinating though.  If I wanted to describe my out look on life I would call it closer to Tao or Zen	NULL

Want to hear the hard truth?  You're going to suck at talking to people for a while.  But the more you do it, the better you get at it.  Social skills are a skill.  It's the same as playing an instrument, learning a language, or any other skill.  You get better by doing.

Clearly your internal bias doesn't allow you to understand what he is saying.  He never said that he would evict someone if they were LGBT or that it would be something he'd consider. He said that the government should not be able to restrict someone's right to evict someone for whatever reason they want.  Those are two very different things.  That's like saying that I support women's rights to abortions, while also thinking that abortions are awful and wouldn't encourage anyone to get one. I'm not "pro-abortion", I'm anti-abortion and pro-choice.  The man from the op is showcasing a Libertarian perspective. The landlord should be able to expel any tenant they want at any time if they choose to. They don't need a reason to do so and shouldn't be blocked from doing so simply because their tenant is a "perfect tenant".  Plenty of people support other people's rights even when it's not something they personally agree with. The second amendment is an another obvious one.	NULL

Hell and Heaven. I grew up in a very religious (Christian) house, the kind that prayed every day, never missed a day of church, and read the Bible cover to cover numerous times. I’d say I was a pretty good (by the book) Christian until my later teens when normal teen stuff had me guiltily “repenting” every day for all the ways I was falling short.  In college I found myself hanging onto theism by a thread, under the overwhelming weight of evidence that told me there was no God. That thread was the fear of the 0.001% chance of the  afterlife I’d been raised on.  It was ultimately the strength of the same convictions that kept me trying to follow the “law” of the Christian bible to the letter that ultimately put the nail in the coffin for me.  I went on a journey to learn about the worlds religions to better understand my own, but as my horizons broadened and I learned much more about the many beautiful religious traditions of the world, I also had to come face to face with the realization that billions of people - many of them doing far more than me to improve the lives of others - were, by my upbringing, still going to live out eternity in some kind of eternal torment.  That’s when I knew that even if that sliver of a chance of the afterlife was true, I wouldn’t want to gain admission to a heavenly place run by such a vile creature.  And suddenly (it really felt sudden) it was like my faith disappeared and I felt completely free. 20+ years and I haven’t looked back.	NULL
Because i think the bible was very realistic.	NULL
Not an atheist, but I'm a very scientific minded person myself. I'm pretty loosely christian mostly because that's how I was raised.  It makes about as much sense to me that an omnipotent 4th dimensional being made the universe, as it does that the universe just poofed into existence. I'm hedging my bets I suppose. There's no upside in believing in nothing, believing in god gets you an afterlife for better or worse. Intelligent design just makes more sense to me. Not here to debate, just figured I'd give my point of view since I'm skirting both schools of thought.	NULL

I think left wing and right wing are a false dichotomy. There are verbal apologists on each extreme and the media makes us believe they are making inroads into the centrist swing voters who actually decide who gets into power.   My most right wing opinion?  People need motivation to work and giving poor people money doesn’t change anything because they will simply unwittingly give it to rich people.   Most left wing opinion?  No public service or utility should be in the hands of a corporation. Capitalism thrives when there is healthy competition and customers have choices. Healthcare, utilities, infrastructure, etc.. either have to exist as monopolies where without competition there is no motivation to innovate or perform efficiently nor to lower prices or improve products or services. With competition.. you have duplicate or triplicate infrastructure whos costs have to be amortized—plus the all important profit.  You need a public watchdog or regulator to ensure minimum standards are being met. So why not make the whole thing a government operation?  Inefficiency is offset by the lack of a need to attract investors or make a profit.. and the cost to society is offset by workers making good wages and pensions.  Really.. in my ideal utopian society.. we’d guarantee everyone a basic standard of living.. but actively encourage people to take risks and strive for more.	NULL

No no, I read what you wrote several times over. I tried to use the exact same format. I guess I should have said \*while being ABLE to own a whites only bar\*. I am also not offended in the least.  Your idea was -- if I understand -- that you can selectively refuse service to a certain identity while simultaneously supporting the claim that they have the same rights as everyone else. I imagine you said this because your right to refuse service is separate from their rights as people. But I put the above parallel for you to see if it actually works in a context where it has already been tried. I am eager to hear how I misunderstood you. Please logic away.	NULL

I hate this too. Assuming that *an apology = guilty for doing something wrong* is a huge sign of emotional immaturity. I tried to be "the bigger man" for awhile and apologize first- just for having a disagreement- and that backfired like an uncontrolled California burn on a windy day.   An apology is wanting to reconcile misunderstandings, and that requires putting egos aside and relating to one another. Both parties must hold space for the other and actually be heard. Not everyone deserves an apology, one person might be hurt in their ego, and the other might be hurt from being lied to. Some people will always assume an apology is proof that they were right, which IMO only reinforces their shittiness.   Also- not everyone deserve forgiveness. "forgiveness is for yourself" holds true. Forgiving someone doesn't mean that what they did was ok, or even that they be allowed in your life again. Forgiveness really has nothing to do with the other person and so few people really understand that.	NULL

Atheists do accept there could be an alternative. To a greater or lesser degree we're all agnostics in the true sense of the word. We just ask for evidence. The best evidence we have so far for the origin of the universe is derived from science and rationality, but we don't argue infallibility. Current scientific paradigms could well be wrong. We could be living in a simulation. There might even be a God. Who knows? But folks smarter than you or I will keep looking for those answers.

My two favourite shows sadly can’t be added because I guess After 60 years for one and 20 for the other they had to have a few bad apples this would be Doctor Who (pretty much everything with Tegan - I HATED THAT WOMAN but also the Peladon serials purely because of Alpha Centuri) and Sleep No More (Peter Capaldi series 9) brilliant premise, loved the found footage style hated sleep boogey monsters)  The X Files - although with the latter I think this is more a case of personal opinion than bad episodes because I can’t think of an episode that is actually bad. Just ones I didn’t like.   But to answer the actual question: Veronica Mars was the first to come to mind.   Heartbreaking episodes.  Traumatic episodes but never a “bad one”.

Simple logic. I actually was a believer and came to terms that there was no existence of God in my 30's. When I actually acknowledged that I did not believe, I felt this huge weight come off me. I felt like my entire worldview changed and then life, love, friendships, relationships all became very important pieces to me. I started appreciating everything differently. I looked at the world in finite. Wonderous to even being existing in the first place. We get one shot and it's beautiful to feel it, understand it, and connect with the mortality of it all. I see things very much differently than that of my counterparts. This told me that there was no higher power or God. God comes with fear, hate, guilt, insecurity, fretting, etc. It's actually a mental health disorder that is destroying humans and our planet. Believers don't care about the here and now, they only worry about the later and heaven and hell, etc. They believe God is spiteful and hurts people who aren't believers in order to get them to believe. It is a mental disorder. It was good to feel cleared from it and I live very securely and happily without religion or God. It's a nice place to be. I'm enjoying the riches of it all without a God.

That’s a very respectable take  But I think it’s because people think of it like “why give them publicity now when they’re dead” which, I can see why people would think that because their songs and albums suddenly boom, at a time when you’ll never hear anything like that ever again	NULL
He was an alcoholic that had conversations with himself in a language that only he could understand.  I think his sense of self preservation only helped him in acquiring more beer.  Now that I’m an adult I feel really sorry for him. He’s probably long dead now. I wonder where he went wrong?	NULL

Simped on a girl for a year at high school. She knew I liked her and would use that to her advantage - making me buy her stuff, clothes, food, accessories etc. She would string me along by letting me either see part of her, or touch part of her.  For example, I was simping for several months, basically a dog who jumped at her every whim, she would promise to let me touch her, but it would always be the wrong time. Then one day I was going to tell her I was done with the promises when she let me touch her breast over her clothes for 5 seconds. She told me she'd let me touch it again if I was a good boy.  After another few months, a similar situation, I went out shopping with her, she wanted me to buy her some new clothes (she new I got paid from my part-time job on Friday). We were outside the mall and I told her I wanted to save some of my money, she took me aside and screamed at me, telling me I was too stupid and ugly and was lucky a hot girl like her was spending her weekend with me, and the least I could do was buy her a new pair of jeans. I was frazzled and was about to walk off before she opened her top and exposed her breasts to me. I was back to being a subservient little simp.  This was the cringiest time of my like as I was super-nerdy and underconfident.  Fast forward a few years. I was a lot better, I had a small business, I was in higher education and was overall feeling great about myself. Met the same girl at a party and she ended up giving me amazing head.	NULL

I feel like season 2 does a pretty good of balancing this. You get an episode like hunting palimens that focuses on a lot of magic things while including some major character development for some characters. Then you also get an episode like hooty helps which is the episode that Luz and Amity get together but also the episode where two characters get magic abilities in a way and we learn a lot about the demons on the island and Eda’s curse	NULL
I mean, if we had to do the death penalty it would be the best way.	NULL

Super interested to hear you explain what about Rush is "awful". Musicianship, production, showmanship, songwriting . . . I can't think of a single metric you can use to say Rush sucks, without losing all credibility.

I don’t know how you know my ethnicity or why you are using it to invalidate my opinions?   Kanyes music is about Kanye, and Kanye has imperfections. He is a misogynist and devoid of empathy a lot of the time but that makes his music even more interesting. His point of view is raw, he isn’t trying to hide anything, his music is as eccentric as his personality and people like that.  Politics don’t decide the quality of music and it certainly shouldn’t influence people’s opinions of it when purely speaking about artistic merit. I don’t really give two shits what he says it’s just that I like his stuff so I listen to it and occasionally compliment it when the time is right  because I do think it’s good.	NULL

I recall one kids in particular I was jealous of for being close friends with one of my friends so I picked on him because I felt my friendship was threatened and that my buddy might like him more than me.

Humans, apes, elephant, giraffe, panda, etc. are K-selection species, i.e. low morbidity but more effort/expensive.  Most of what we know has to be taught by person to person, which takes a while (and it keeps developing *rapidly* until \~21 or so, though still develops afterword, just more slowly)  On the other hand, sparrows, rabbits, voles, etc. are r-selective species, that don't need very long to develop, and have a low cost, but with higher morbidity.

That covid is not real. What happened was all the government's of the world got together and agreed to start forming a world wide communist government. To do this they decided to start saying a new virus was spreading. They told drs to say people who had a common cold actually had covid. Then when people would die or other causes they would say it was actually from covid. Hence why more older people were dying, they died of other conditions but the blame was pit and covid.  Then to start the controlling on the mass populations they enforced lockdowns to control where people went send what they could do.  Then the vaccine was introduced and this was another tactic to control the population. Get the vaccine or you can't do this etc.  Not to mention that the vaccine wasn't even fully tested and it's actually super dangerous, a good way of harming everyone.  Soon everyone who took the vaccine will either die early or become infertile, leaving the government with more control over the survivors.   On the same note the person I know who believes this also thinks the government is blocking other drugs/medicine that would work against covid, as it would stop people getting the vaccine and giving them less control. Does that mean they believe there's a cure for covid? But I thought covid wasn't real?  Hard to argue with people like this.	NULL
The right has given up the self righteous quest for “traditional family values.” They know it’s a losing issue. Most right wingers will tell you they LOVE the gays. I think they are being facetious.   They will follow up by making snide statements on more marginalized groups like trans folk. Most of them have a fairytale fear of someone using the wrong bathroom. What’s ridiculous is that if someone wants to commit a crime in the bathroom it’s not like there’s police at every stall checking sexual organs. A dude can walk right into a woman’s bathroom and do whatever they want. And vice versa.  TL;DR: Loving the gays is not really a controversial take anymore.	NULL

Just to humorously channel my ex's pedantry for a moment: I'm not entirely sure this would be categorized as a "non-sequitur". It's more of a misunderstanding about the starting point of the discussion that left us coming from different directions to get to the same middle.  In my experience, "Romans were pale white" is a very common contemporary belief (in my country), and it is not a super unheard of topic of discussion, so more than once I've had this conversation with people where the starting point was "Ancient Romans were mostly non-white" and the response was either "That's interesting/what are the sources/more info" or very blatant racism at the thought of having "white history" challenged. I apologize for the error in judgment, it is a very charged topic where I live and I am used to equating it with extreme racism.	NULL

Me personally? We could start with better funding of the ATF and better enforce laws to prevent straw purchasing. Also create a workable system for universal background checking. Make it so selling a gun to any non-family member requires a background check and it’s illegal to do so otherwise. This would decrease (it can never fully prevent) the amount of guns obtain by “bad guys” and everyone can maintain the beloved second amendment right (incorporated by the 14th amendment and subject to restrictions where there is a compelling government interest). But even my overly simple idea would still be construed as an affront to the long held (ie 11 year) constitutional right to own a gun.	NULL

You *can* believe in the higher power, but you don't *have to*.  Seriously, take a second and actually come up with answers to my Giant Turtle questions.  Actually do it.  Then apply those answers to why one might not believe in a higher power.    How is it that not believing in a thing is "one step further"?  You have to realize that this question, this "how did you become an athiest?", is a very American one.  I'm American myself, but I've lived overseas for most of the past 20 years.  I have very rarely run into anything like this line of reasoning anywhere outside of the US, and when I did, it was usually my fellow Americans asking.  I'm sure you'll get it in other fundamentalist religious countries, just not the ones I've lived in.    We aren't born believing in a higher power, we're taught.  If you were not taught, you would not necessarily believe it.  It's a geographical exercise, more than anything else.	NULL

I was raised in a Christian family and I used to be religious when I was a kid. My faith made me extremely paranoid about *everything*. I had nightmares of hell and the devil constantly and I was afraid everything I said or did would cause me to go to hell when I died.    Later into my childhood at about 9 or 10 (and I was medicated for my anxiety and depression, which in my case was very much needed), I started to really question my faith. Eventually, I just stopped believing altogether.   God and Christianity brought me nothing but grief. Don't get me wrong, it's great for a lot of people and some people do actual good with it, but it's not for me.	NULL

Kids are often taught its either a terrible offense or hear it thru their parents daily. Either way, they’re not supposed to curse. At the end of the day they’re going to do what they are told not to. I always did what my parents told me I wasn’t allowed to do and ended up abusing it. I wouldn’t say that means teaching them to express it, because it is offensive to some.

i myself count myself as mature for my age, but in a room full of people of all ages, i would be the most immature person there. but i am much more mature than most of my past classmates. one surefire sign is too many sex jokes, except if someone is drunk. in example, moaning, innuendos, 69 jokes, and just being plain gross in general. thats one thing i have picked up from my past experience from my ex classmates. also one more thing. picking on others for having a very specific thing. i dont think i have to explain this.

In all my life iv been to many houses of worship of MANY different religions and sat though their lessons and teachings at behest of many friends or coworkers.

Living with my girlfriend in college (we're married now). We had a studio apartment 2 blocks from the university. She was away at class and I was home. Decided to masturbate to some bukkake porn. I'm doing the deed then all of a sudden I hear the door rattle. I panic and pull up my shorts and turn the monitor off. She walks in and I play it cool. Before I can stop her she gets on the computer and tells me she forgot to print a paper. Then, "why is the monitor off." Before I could think of something to say she hits the power button then lone and behold the screen is of a woman with runny mascara and dicks jizzing on her face. The look she gave me was priceless. She x'd out and printed her paper and scornfully told me we'd be talking about that later.	NULL

This is a harmful social behavior. Humans are inherently wired neurologically to want others to accept them. I could hardly blame someone for going to great lengths to be a part of something. You've got to remember, some people are more adept than others at socialization. Our modern society must just be so hyper close with contact at our fingertips (in our smartphones that is) that we literally are able to get annoyed by socialization. And I'm not talking about introversion. Introverts still desire socialization, they just are intolerant of large groups and long lasting interactions.	NULL

i cheated on two boyfriends in high school, and honestly i’m kinda glad i did. those relationships would never have worked out anyway. and tho it seems like an obvious lesson, from doing it and confessing it i learned how absolutely awful it feels. i really got first hand experience on all the reasons why it’s a really terrible decision to make. my current boyfriend is such a wonderful guy and doesn’t deserve anything that deceptive, no matter how things go between us. i can be totally confident now that no matter how bad things get, i would never choose to do that again. so i think young people can learn from their mistakes, but adults should know better.

More generally - I dislike any metal vocals that can't be performed live. An inhaled whisper that's only audible on a 5000-dollar microphone in a 100% sound-isolated recording booth? Not metal.

We were told ahead of time for our Major or Sgt to get votes on what movie, if they had to rent it or if someone had it, what snacks, drinks but mainly to approve the rating of the movie.  One day I came up with an elaborate plan. You see our high school had a printing press with scans. It was a special class to help with college credits or help you get into the printing press trade school.   I knew which period the Press teacher went to his big ass closet and took a nap bc it was his free period. I know this bc I was his teachers asst during honors computer class.  I skipped my class to go there, to accomplish this I used the excuse that he needed my help. This wasn't unusual as I've legitimately had to before.   I had the National Lampoons Senior Trip movie. I cut the vhs box to lay it flat, scanned it into the computer, and printed out a whole new box (that had to be assembled) but with a new rating of PG13. Then bided my time.  When the day came, our Major asked about the movie, I said my movie "Senior Trip", Major asked "What rating?" and I told him, the box says PG13, everybody agreed.  Day of, I show him the vhs box, he nods and put the movie in.  Walks out to go to his office. My classmates are looking at me. They know this movie. They know it's not PG13.   Of course my luck ran out and Sarge walked in during the end of the hotel scene with the dildo display. I explained immediately to him that it's only that scene for humor nothing more. There's no sex or nudity.  He gave me two hours of PT the following Monday. Apparently never told Major bc I didn't get reprimanded or demoted.  Not too much of a secret except for how I did it. My classmates I'm still in contact with from jrotc still call me Dags bc of that.   Always asking how I pulled it off.	NULL
Left wing:  PC culture is in fact getting way out of hand.

I was coasting down a hill on my bicycle when I was 15. I took my right foot off the pedal and gently touched it against the side of the front tire to hear the buzzing sound the little rubber tabs made when they slapped against the sole of the shoe. Then I hit a bump or something and my toe slipped in between the wheel spokes.   In a half second, the wheel carried my foot up into the forks of the bike, breaking my toe and sending me over the handlebars. Flipping over and tumbling, I hit the ground on my left side at about 20 mph, going back-shoulder-head. Road rash on my back, dislocated shoulder, and concussion (no helmet).	NULL

You need gas chambers to call it genocide? Even suppression of language is considered genocide.  Genocide is genocide, doesn’t have to match the degree the Nazis did it at. Palestinian children are murdered by the Israeli government. That definitely qualifies as genocide. Killing the children of a people.  Saying Israel treats Palestinians poorly is a gross understatement. What did palestinians do to deserve being pushed out of their homes, and have their children and family members killed? Innocent people die for Israeli colonialism. Isn’t what the Europeans did to the native Americans genocide as well?	NULL

This was mine. We should be going the way of Portugal and decriminalizing.

Christianity is literally a religion where you can commit any sin, ask for forgiveness, and be accepted into heaven. Most Christians are not Constantine thinking about how to be better, as evidenced by... I mean I hate to make it political, but have you seen literally any religious conservative party in the world?  Religion is not the only valid source of morality. In fact, one could argue that morality for fear of God's wrath is not morality -  it's self interest. No one becomes an atheist because they don't want to listen to God. People become atheist because they don't believe. Many would love to believe, but it feels too much like a lie.	NULL

I know people optimistically think that being a cheater is an on-off switch, so if you cheated once, you just flip that switch to off and then you're never a cheater again.  The problem is not that the person cheated, it's that *they have the switch at all*. I do not have that switch. I just don't. The very notion of cheating or being cheated on causes a deep physical revulsion in my body. I literally get sick to my stomach thinking about it. There is not a body on this planet that I find attractive enough to cheat on my wife.   So to me, the challenge is not that a person can change. I believe anyone can make a mistake and resolve in themselves not to make that mistake again. But it's a matter of having the capacity to make that mistake in the first place. I do not have that capacity. I believe many if not most people do not have that capacity. But if you do, if you have ever cheated on a significant other, then you have the switch, and you might spend the rest of your life with that switch in the off position, but *you have the switch* to begin with, and I can never be 100% sure it will never be switched on again.

Generally speaking, just treat them like you would a person. Have respect for them, but keep firm boundaries in case they're less-than-friendly. Don't toy with them, and be careful of anything pretending to be something that it's not.	NULL

I literally just went in today after being suspended for threats (I never made any threats), we were supposed to have a follow up before letting me return to work, I wanted to record the conversation, but they refused consent so I told them I don’t feel comfortable having this conversation then, and then they told me to go home.

Oh they absolutely do I would never argue that,but I think it's just the nature of creativeness,all those musicians stood on the shoulders of blues and jazz music from the 30s 40s and 50s and those guys mostly stood on the shoulders of church music and old slave singing. It is although more noticable with hiphop because of obvious reasons but I just see it as a result of technological improvements that allowed for it.	NULL

For me personally, the normalization of LGBTQ or other minority characters, isn’t that I just want straight passing hot dudes in a role, but that I want those characters to do normal people things, like “yeah I’m going grocery shopping” or “hey I’m doing a normal task” and not just being the clever best friend of the main character who is constantly fabulous and always has something perfectly timed and snarky to say.   What I mean is that the fabulous gay characters are also just normal people doing normal things.	NULL

Same after my Uncle. We were just sitting in the back yard and the sun was shining golden ray's on us. At that moment I knew he should be here and that this was a dream and then he just hugged me while I cried in his arms. Truly felt like the goodbye I was never able to have. It's been 4 years this August and I've had a could dreams since and I know I'm dreaming everytime and they truly feel like little visits. No talking just "being" and a very calm feeling.

Not religious in the least, but to play Devil's Advocate for a second; Wouldn't the God's plan explanation for babies dying be that its a catalyst for something else. Maybe that kid dying pushes someone else down a different path that ultimately does something else that affects something else that...Yada, Yada, yada.   Seemingly, needless and cruel absolutely, but someone with *true* faith would understand that it was necessary and therefore not needless or cruel at all.  I feel like anyone who wIulf get twisted about having that thrown in there face was already questioning there faith to begin with and are more sub conciously angry that you're forcing them to question it further.

Change the pump, climb the ladder changed my life. 8 pumps just the tip 1 balls deep super slow, 7 pumps just the tip 2 balls deep a little faster and so on all the way to 1 pump just the tip 8 deep then climb back down. Just go up and down till you can hit your stride. And when you get to the 8 deep push hold some pressure her lower abdomin. If you get past that first ladder you'll be in good shape for a little longer haul. And it's always ok to just take it out and give her some attention while you regroup but just pick up right where you left off on the ladder.	NULL

Left wing, supposedly. Here are my most right wing opinions:  1. Trans athletes shouldn't compete against Cis athletes, and not everyone by law has to use their pronouns. 2. Multiculturalism, at least the 21st century idea of it based on cultural relativism, doesn't work. Once differences between cultures encompass ideas of right and wrong, that's the point they cannot ever be bridged, and social instability results. 3. Mass immigration and a social welfare state don't go together because of resource expenditure and loss of bargaining power of native workers. 4. Cancel Culture is a distraction from the real issues facing the working class.	NULL

Where are all these broken records you are seeing? I did a quick search and only found stuff about Lia Thomas? One person at one school?

And then internationally, trans people have been able to compete in the Olympics for years now and we only got our first trans woman competitor this year - who finished dead last in her category. There are so many trans competitors out there and their success, if anything, is underrepresented by their makeup in these competitions.	NULL

I suppose I should be grateful for that. I don't have much of a family but they are mostly pretty decently educated.   It is always so sad to hear of young women who are not educated at all about their reproductive system. It seems like such a simple thing that we as a society should be making sure people know from a relatively young age. We teach about how the rest of the body works but not something that will later become an important aspect of life, it's so strange.  Also I just wanted to say that I really like the way you write :) Thank you for your perspective, it has been actually pretty insightful for me.	NULL

I worked at a restaurant and the manager used a bell to let the cashier know when to run out someone’s food. It wasn’t a terrible idea, but he was so lazy.

This. I had a coworker that would constancy tell people about how she was focusing on growing her business. She was part time so at first people thoight she had an actual business. But we all avoided asking her for details because no one really cared.  Cut to a new hire asking her about it... She sells Arbonne. And since that new hire bought from her, now she thinks that our workplace (a hospital) is where she should be focusing on selling and recruiting.  Currently she isn't speaking to anyone in our department because no one wants to buy her overpriced garbage. She is also gossiping with other areas and elling them how we are all broke and in debt.  Straight up middle school nonsense. I havent seen her for awhile but I hear she was in trouble for trying to sell her crap to patients.	NULL

I said this to other comments in this thread but one of the basics laws of physics tells us that matter cannot create itself; another one says that everything has a beginning.

As an immigrant in America who knows a bunch of fighter/display pilots, I can confirm there's more to it. It works like this: the shoddy second rate singer with the emotive ability of a thimble (let's use Whitney Houston as an example) is tasked with the timing of the song to meet the flyover immediately after. They're told that if they miss by more than 5 seconds, a 500lb mk. bomb will be pickled directly onto the stage. This is why they end up with 50,000 vowels per line. It's persuasive. I'm not even kidding. Not at all. I used to watch the SuperBowel just in the hopes of hiccups or *something, anything* that might add some colour to proceedings.	NULL

Some say the root of all wisdom is knowing that you don’t really know anything at all.  This resonates with me, so anytime anyone claims to know of something as wild as an afterlife, i see that as denial.  Willful ignorance.  Even knowing that we’re going to die isn’t necessarily a certainty.  Maybe this is all a dream, or a simulation or whatever, i dont fuckin know.    But yeah, if someones looking to a god for comfort, that’s out of fear.  Acting out of fear is my personal definition of sin, or missing the mark.  I don’t think we’re here just to be comfortable.  Suffering is a thing, it’s abundant.  In my experience, it’s one of my greatest teachers.  It’s like manure, fertilizer to grow the flowers of wisdom.  Or, everything is just completely random and some things just suck because of statistical probability.  Idk man	NULL

Nah. As someone who studied fashion 20 years ago, Balenciaga is and always will be an iconic brand. The problem is the youth influence on the creative director today.

I’m not arguing god exists, but none of your arguments make logical sense. Saying no to something may not be visibly different from “not answering” but it is not empirical proof that the belief in god hearing prayers is false. Working “mysteriously” is not empirically identical to not existing, even if it happens to look “visibly” the same to you. Etc. Again, I’m not arguing for any god’s (or gods’) existence, but your arguments here are weak and illogical, as they amount to you claiming something doesn’t exist simply because it is not easily apparent.

Leftist is a distinct and absolute range of points on the political spectrum.  It’s your socialist, your social democrats (maybe, if you’re being generous your third way liberals), and your syndicalists (I’m likely missing a few).   The right is “mainstream points not on the left”.  It’s a more flexible set of policies. Plus, conservatism is a relative ideology that varies from place to place a lot more than leftism does.  Plus, classical liberalism (and a few other liberal threads) are usually considered right wing, but are only really “conservative” (in an ideological sense) within the US and UK (where they have a strong history).

Man, there is a Extravagant steak place in my area. It’s very well known. I mean it’s huge. Like a lot of land. Old place from the 60’s. Cigar level, extensive wine cellar. A mega pavilion a lake and so on. Anyway, the head sommelier and manager of the wine department became my friend. He confined to me one night that when he started so many years ago. He got the job and just mad up lies that sounded convincing. Then later he would go look up the answer by book. He just kept doing that for like 15 years and he turned himself into a very knowledgeable guy. Side night, my first night at work there. I brought into the deep parts of the cellar. Told to carry a bottle of wine two levels up. Immediately as I walked away. They told me it was carrying the bottle wrong. And told me to be careful. It was a 10,000 dollar bottle that was already bought and was paid to be stored there for some years. I was so scared. Like who would trust someone to do that on their first day??	NULL
Yeah im sorry to say that guys with a footfetish would not date you with ugly feet.  Feet to a footfetish guy is like the pussy or face, its a COMPLETE deal breaker.

Oh yes, of course using it in a professional capacity, especially as your (or one of your) main tool(s) it is imperative that you keep as up to date as possible, as you will be exchanging files and documents with your peers. And like I said, for some, a rent/constantly updating option is best! Clearly that’s the mentality behind them offering this package.   However my situation, along with many others I’m sure, is that the capacity in which I use PS is not stable enough to warrant that kind of commitment. If I don’t make any money from the project I’ve used PS for over the course of a year, then I’ve run out of funds to be able to spend on it, and therefore cannot rent it for use in the next project as I no longer can afford it. So no new project, no funds for PS, no project, etc.  In this case, it’s better to be able to save up and purchase it outright so that I can rely on it in the future, regardless of my financial situation. Just like my computer is an investment so that I know I can use it in order to make money, regardless of my situation.   So all of a sudden they have isolated all of us that have not got the stability to be able to throw money at it every month, and therefore cuts us out of its business model entirely.   You’re right, an alternative package with the same power as PS is definitely my best option at this stage. It’s just very difficult to find something up to that standard as Adobe also enjoy cornering the market.   I will continue to look for CS5 or 6 copies for sale, and until then I’ll try using some of the alternatives suggested here. Hopefully something matches the features and quality we need without being so money-hungry.	NULL

In America, we live in a two-party system, the Democrats and the Republicans. We have primary elections before the general election where the parties elect their nominees for the general election. So in the 2020 primary elections, Democrats nominated Biden to run for President in the General Election, and Republicans nominated Trump to run for President in the General Election.  It's unrealistic to imagine no republican runs. There will be a Republican nominee for the general election, just like there will be a Democratic nominee for the general election regardless of whether Biden chooses to run for President again or not.

The beginning had to start somewhere, the energy we have in our universe had to have some beginning. No one can say what that is at this point.

He was at least a man that catapulted a movement and helped create something far greater than Himself. So I believe in His power, without knowing for sure the extent of who He is/was.	NULL

Something I haven’t seen you mention is that a realtor will basically advertise your house for you. When a person wants house with “xyz features”, they’ll know that they have this or that house that has those features and try to get it sold.

 The movie industry is in a state of change. With television and the internet stealing audience attention, the movie industry is finding it harder and harder to make money. They're slowly starting to embrace streaming services, but they're trying to hold on to their old business model for as long as they can. It won't work. The movie industry is going to have to completely change the way it does business, but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon. People are still going to the movie theater and buying DVDs for as long as they can, even though that model is on its way out. I think that a lot of people don't want to see the old way of doing things die. I myself am sentimentally attached to it. However, I also know that it's foolish to cling to the past when the future is clearly better and more efficient.	NULL
For me, I love cooking, and I'm really good at it, but I also find it stressful when cooking for other people. I also find it's really anti-social because of how much I stress myself.

Well, I was baptised as a Catholic, for context. I would describe myself as agnostic. In other words, I’m not sure. My reasoning for *not* believing in God is all of the bad shit that happens that he could *literally prevent*. As Epicurus observed:  “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.  Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.  Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”  As well as that, I don’t feel that I can trust the so-called “men of God”: the priests, bishops and clergy in general. As I mentioned before, I was baptised Catholic. We’ve all seen the shit the Catholic Church does. Throughout history, it has probably been the single biggest reason for slow medical and technological development. There was the abuse scandal a good few years ago. To this day, the Church still hoards its wealth, and has made itself into the “den of thieves” that Christ himself would have condemned.   Any organised religion, in my view, has been turned from a way to understand the world into a method to control populations. It’s a way to tell people what they can and can’t do, who they can and can’t love, what they can and can’t say. Look at Shari’ah Law in some Muslim countries. In Saudi Arabia, homosexuality can still carry the death penalty. Religion has halted progress across the world, no matter from whence it comes or what it preaches: I, for one, do not want to be a part of halting progress	NULL

That thought process fundamentally misunderstands what theism(or at least traditional monotheism) asserts about the cosmological role of a god, and the philosophical subject that theism or atheism is debated within.  A god is suggested as an explanation for contingent phenomena, not as a superfluous thing that also happens to exist in addition to an atheistic system.   Saying there is a god is like saying a table is held up by its legs. Talking about a flying spaghetti monster is talking about something that exist on or adjacent to that table and is completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand about what is, or is not, holding up the table.

That was specific to his apostles in their mission. Not to mention you can’t just pray someone’s free will away. This world exists for the good and the bad. You literally can’t know happiness without misery. You can’t have faith without trials or reason to doubt or struggle. You couldn’t even comprehend what it was like to touch things before you came to this earth and got a body. Your struggles and problems in hindsight will be blessings. In simple terms, you’re looking at a droplet of water and trying to understand what the ocean is like without getting into it. You don’t need to explore the whole ocean to understand it either, but you sure as hell won’t get anywhere just looking at a droplet.	NULL

When I was in the 5th grade my basketball ball team practiced in the gym at night.  There were two water fountains and I had the bright idea to turn it on and off with my foot.

I’m also in CA but in a conservative pocket where lots of upper middle class/wealthy boomers live. They are tired of the homelessness issues but their only solution is just ship them off to somewhere they don’t have to look at them. Not much compassion.

As a Christian myself I fully agree with you. This behaviour happens because with the rest of the indoctrination people are told that they are better in some way because of it. They then see others as inferior. Or I'm some cases they're jealous that atheists don't have as restrictive rules to follow.  Both of those I've mentioned go against the teachings of the commandments and Jesus' words. But many "Christaians" today find very skewed ways to practise it.	NULL
Off topic but here is my prediction.   I firmly believe that ‘94 will repeat itself. The current president of Rwanda is Tutsi and he absolutely hates the Hutus (for good reason). They are now marginalized and will fight back again.   The Tutsi’s got preferential treatment by the colonizers because they had more European features and thus considered more civilized and hence closer to whites. The Hutus on the other hand were more Bantu looking. The best jobs went to the former, more money was spent on their education, better housing, medical care etc.   The first 2 presidents of Rwanda were Hutu. How the eff was that going to work in country were the Hutus were treated as third class citizens after the Belgians and Tutsis.   And it’s replaying itself right now.	NULL

I graduated from high school a year early and then I went to a community college immediately after. I was still 17 when I just started at that community college. I also didn't look my age. I looked younger by about 2 years because people would constantly tell me that I looked about 15 lol. I ended up taking a math class that one of my high school math teachers happened to be teaching. She was around her mid-thirties and was always friendly with me, even during high school but as the semester went on she was becoming a little too friendly.   Being young, naive, and awkward I didn't really notice how inappropriate she was actually being. In private she would make inappropriate jokes about how she wanted to celebrate with me when I finally turned 18 and when I did turn 18 she would make jokes about how I was a man now and legal and that kind of thing. She would even start touching me. She wasn't like touching my crotch or like my butt but she was always putting her hand on my shoulder or hand and even one time on my back. It never went any further than that but now when I think back at it, it was definitely creepy. It makes me rethink all our interactions during high school.	NULL

No it isn’t. In the absence of definitive information it is impossible to draw a meaningful conclusion. Agnosticism is the logical and scientific position. You could argue that atheism is the best model of understanding currently available, you could strongly doubt that there might be an emergence of information that would change your understanding, but to deny the possibility is dogmatic in the same way as theism. Neither position can be tested, proven, or disproven, so they are arguably meaningless.	NULL

Shorthand: God is good  Bit more in depth: mind bogglingly merciful. I mean can any of us really wrap our heads around the concept of what Christ gave up to take on the punishment for human sin?

Distaste of religious ceremonies.  My aunt had a funeral 2 months back, and it was held partially at a church. They were speaking more about Jesus and his sacrifices that everyone already knows and barely spoke about her. At the end, they even asked for FUCKING DONATIONS. Even the ones who carried the coffin were more sensible and talked about her more in 3 minutes than a church in 30 minutes.	NULL
Kinda a funny story. My family started out as Catholic, but I never really paid attention in church thanks to ADHD, so I didn't even know who Christ and God were, which naturally annoyed my parents getting them to start Sunday school. When I did finally understand what religion was, I started to question things even naively saying that "ooh the miracles are magic" like I understood what was going on. After more than a few sessions and a few talks with a priest, I stopped questioning and genuinely started to believe. what only felt like a couple of months later my parents came out as atheists me being a dumb kid and being more than happy not to waste a Sunday on Church I kinda just went with it. Making a good year or two years of work to make me Catholic go to waste.	NULL

I stopped believing when I was around 5 years old. Every time people talked about religion to me (at this point in my life it was only Hinduism and Christianity), it either didn’t take dinosaurs into account or was just plain silly. Stuff like “god can do anything” to which my 5 year old brain asked “can he turn himself into an ant?”. Combine that with just how boring it all was when the stuff it didn’t talk about was really really cool and I couldn’t say that I believed in any god. I sometimes think that if our school had taught dinosaurs and had some better descriptions then it would have taken me way longer to stop believing	NULL

I was on a plane several years ago, and kept hearing what I thought must be someone playing sterotypical country music, with a heavy faux accent behind me, just *a capella*. This was interspersed with a conversation with a one young man speaking in a very bland/neutral mid-Atlantic accent. Near the end of the flight, i hear that same young man explain that he’s a country singer who is set to do a show right after he lands, so was warming up.  It really put it into perspective for me how manufactured the whole thing is. This dude, sitting there wearing typical 20-something A&F gear (it was cool then) was rapidly code-switching between his newscaster non-accent and textbook Nashville “accent from nowhere”, singing about horses and stuff.   I mean, i guess it goes for any genre - look at golf aficionado and Minnesota historian Alice Cooper - it just seems especially gross for country music where it seems wrapped up in an identity.

Apologies for formatting. I'm on mobile.  I work as a journalist for a small-town paper. In our office we have a scanner that alerts us if the RCMP or fire department is being deployed. So the thing goes off, we tap into radio chatter and theres a trailer fire just south of town. So I grab my camera and head out.  Our fire department is notoriously slow so I made if there before they even got to the station to load up the truck. I take some pictures, all is well, pack up and leave just before the fire department arrives. Get into the office and start going through the pics. That's when I realized there was a HUGE propane tank beside the trailer that was on fire. It was about 30ft from me. It was full. Thankfully it never exploded, but if it did I'd be incredibly alive'nt.	NULL

Religion tends to only make sense if you're raised with it, because you were essentially brainwashed as a child the entire time. I guess adults can "find" it, but personally I label them mentally handicapped if that happens. Not to be cringe or a fedora-tipper, but I've never found religion to make sense, even as a child growing up around religious people.  The one simple truth that the world works in an awful way, and "God" lets it happen because "he never said it would be easy" (words from my religious mother and aunt) is detestable to me.  My mother seems to think everything is "His" plan, so I presented an absolutely dreadful scenario to her on day: a man and woman that have tried to have a baby, but have been unsuccessful with multiple miscarriages and even a still-birth, finally have a child. They're impossibly elated, the happiest they've ever been in their entire lives, only for that child to die of SIDS within 2 months of life; why would this happen? How is this "His plan"? Her response was just crying, shaking her head, and saying "It just is."  I despise religion and religious people. They by far have been the worst type of people I've interacted with in my entire life.	NULL

In truth there's probably a lot more reasons than just the one your friend suggests. I like to add one, that might very well be bashed, but here goes. As complicated as human nature and personality can be, I feel that most of us can agree that a cellphone is something most of us have nearby at all times. Also I feel like it will be safe to assume that most of us use it vividly. Sex sells, common saying that has been used a great deal, but it's still true. I don't take a freudian perspective and say that that's the only thing which counts. So long story short, maybe some of these ladies are not taking a picture with a clear train of thought that this is supposed to be a sensual indulging picture, but are merely mimicking.  ^this is just one possibility between the 100 that comes to the top of my head, most more flattering than a simple mimicking.

Went to a work dinner this past fall and making conversation with coworkers. I mention some recent news report about teaching "both sides" of the Holocaust and then, not one but two, of my coworkers go on a rant about how the Holocaust was U.S. propaganda with conflated numbers and the Nazis "did not plan to kill so many Jews."   As the conversation continued, my one coworker drops sexist, homophobic, and racist dog whistles, but what really got me was his response to this:  Me: "Well, humans are animals after all."  Coworker: "Ehh, I have some differing opinions on that."  Like, I understand how a person can be influenced by their upbringing and news media to hold the ultra-conservative views against minority groups, but to outright disagree with basic scientific facts such as humans being animals utterly baffled me.

When I was in 2nd grade, living with my grandmother, we got weekly report cards. I always got in trouble for talking in class. If I didn't get a perfect score my grandmother would spank me with a switch.    We lived in the country and Friday was burn the trash day. So I started putting my report cards in the burn bin so there was no evidence of my chatty personality.    The school started calling to say that I hadn't returned my signed report cards. My grandmother would ask me if I had gotten one and I would tell her no, they didn't give me one Granny. The school didn't press the first couple times but eventually they started to add that the teacher was positive she had given me one and that I had to return it.   I was terrified of getting a spanking, the anxiety of having to pick out my own switch and the ensuing red bottom was too much, so I dug in my heels and promised to my grandmother that they hadn't given me one.   I'm not sure what transpired on the schools side of the phone call but my granny got very loud and asked if they were calling her grandson a fucking liar and proceeded to berate them for accusing me of lying and she would come down to the school if she had to.   I kept burning the report cards and don't remember any more phone calls after that.   Sorry granny, I was a lying POS but you had a hell of an arm.	NULL

this is so specific I’m surprised I have a story for this.   When I was in elementary school, our cafeteria had a “salad bar” with all kinds of condiments and fruits and veggies.

Needless to say the salad bar didn’t last very long, but in its short time I did a dare where I ate ten jalapeños at once, and another where I had to ingest as many salt packets as possible. I don’t remember exactly how many I ate, but I do remember it was a lot. So much that it made me incredibly sick and I had to go home for the day.	NULL

Was on a family vacation in Cuba during HS and while on this vacation my parents who really have an interest in the old, classic cars. I want to clearly say that most of these cars didn't at time, have any seatbelts. We wanted to see the local markets and culture so we found a guide who would show us around during the day. The day was great, when we headed back I started to get tired so I look to my right and see my mother and younger brother both passed out.   Fast forward a couple hours, as I'm waking up I look up and start to feel the car shift drastically shift. My father screamed "HEY!" My eyes erupted from how loud he screamed, grabbed the steering wheel and pulled us back into the lane.   Turns out while everyone in my family was asleep, our driver fell asleep at the wheel, drifted into oncoming traffic, over a bridge. The only reason why we survived was my dad was also on the brink of sleeping while the driver was falling asleep but caught on quick and in my eyes prevented a very catastrophic event.	NULL

As a teen, I was a firmly convinced atheist. My world view has always been based on my understanding of the laws of physics, and it was at a highschool physics level at the time. This level of understanding of physics pretty much implied determinacy for me at the time. After all, the current position and velocity of every particle in the universe to infinite accuracy determines all their future interactions, and thus all changes to their velocities, and thus all their future velocities and positions. As such, I rejected the idea of some non-physical higher entity having any mechanism through which it would be able to manipulate our universe. And what would be the point of a God with zero power over our world?  This world view got turned entirely upside-down when I learned about quantum mechanics, and particularly the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This principle dictates that any particle is in fact not at any position or traveling at any velocity to infinite accuracy - it is actually a delocalised wave. The position and velocity of a particle are not only immeasurable to accuracies beyond a fundamental bound - they actually don't exist to such accuracies. This is exactly a falsification of the one fundamental assumption, the one premise I based my entire world view on without even realising I could question it. And so, my world view crumbled. I no longer thought I could disprove the existence of mechanisms through which external entities like free will or divine intervention could manipulate our universe.  Now, I still don't believe in the existence of one or more gods, but I no longer believe in their non-existence either. I just don't know anymore, and have accepted that I never will. And I still base my world view on my understanding of the laws of physics, though I'm now more aware of that understanding being wildly incomplete.	NULL

>the earliest pieces of written New Testament that were found are from the beginning of the 2nd century, and the first full manuscript is from the 4th century  To be fair, this is pretty standard for the majority of ancient works. The earliest manuscripts of Julius Caesar's *Bellum Gallicum* are actually from the ninth century for example.  I was listening to a Great Courses lecture by Bart Ehrman (an atheist Biblical scholar) and he did say that with the amount of manuscripts we have of the New Testament we are in a better position to deduce the most likely reading of the original texts compared to other works, although he stressed this doesn't mean the events in the text actually happened.

No reason to. It is like if i say harry potter (a character based on a fictional piece of literature) is real.. and ask you why you dont believe in it?!  You believe in folk lore, stories and myth. You tell me why you believe in it. The burden of proof is on you.   Earlier humans were weak and dumb and at mercy of nature. So they made up stories of powerful beings in sky who they needed to be in good terms with. Then someone started building stories about him. Then more and more people followed. Associating safety with his belief and demise with his rage. Then people came in with religion trying to moral police and control and teach people the whats (what is this world whats this whats that) hows (how to live) and whys (why universe is the way it is) which they themselves didnt understand.  We dont need them any more. We dont need stories. We are strong and confident enough to be ok with uncertainty about the rest of mysteries of universe.  Why do people believe in god? And how much of it is just conditioning from parents and care takers and society? Do you think dogs believe in gods? What about birds? What about bacterias?   If you managed to erase the idea of god and religion (and the conditioning) from the entire world telepathically using some magic. (You dont even need to remove the physical estates and  documentation like temples mosque churches holy books etc. ) Do you think people will accept the idea of god (again) on their own while they already had science to question it?	NULL
I look at my life and the people around me and wonder how can there be a god if they let the things that happen, happen. How can so many bad things go on in the world, and I still believe that there is someone who could easily stop all that bad, yet chooses not to. When I was still religious, some of the people at the church I went to said anyone who believes in science are fools, and that all the scientist trying to figure out how the universe work are fools.  It also always felt weird how people would pray before eating, or thank God for things, when as far as I know he did nothing. It rubbed me raw that people thanked God for the food they ate, not the farmer who made the food, or the company that packaged it, or the trucker who delivered it. It rubbed me raw that people would thank God after surgeries or other life saving medical treatments, instead of the doctors who operated on them, or the pharmacies that made their medicine.	NULL
“It is what it is”	NULL
The world has too many coincidences and too much chaos to believe that there is one.   We, (humans) are capable of free-thought and coming up with colossal ideals that would not be possible without our own cunning and improvisation.  That and The Big Bang and Darwin's Theory of Evolution just seem to be the most consistent of the stories of how the universe was created or how the human race came to be. The similarity of humans to our fellow primates to me are too much to ignore. Not just the fact that we have posable thumbs and have similar body structures; but also how our societies are structured.   In short, while I have a bit of respect on a philisophical level for some of the teachings the Abrahamic faiths in particular have brought on the world; I still consider myself an athiest because while correlation does not equal causation, there are probably too many correlations to ignore.

I’m actually the person that disappeared (though it was for a short time). My mentally ill mother essentially kidnapped my brother and I during the summer before my freshman year of high school. No phones, no computer, went to live in a homeless shelter on the opposite side of the county for three months (she believed my dad was stalking us and we “had to get away” - not true). Given all the crazy shit she put us through, I honestly didn’t think that much of it - it was just another weird thing in my life and I got through it the best I could. Then, when my mom couldn’t keep us hidden anymore, I suddenly reappeared into my old life. I remember being pretty nonchalant about it, but my best friend broke down sobbing shortly thereafter because she had no idea what had happened to me or whether she’d ever see me again. That was the first time I fully acknowledged how absolutely nuts the situation was.  Happy to say that this year is the 25th anniversary of our best friendship, still going strong!	NULL

Well I guess in some ways justice is a mental construct - in some cultures cannibalism is totally fine for example. I think our progress is a result of our cooperation though, not some objective set of rules. As we grow as a species we change our concepts of right and wrong, and I think it’s been for the better - slavery used to be just. Justice is a social agreement, where we come to an understanding of what we consider acceptable, and usually the idea of justice is that if you hurt someone there are consequences, which is a pretty universal concept among humans, or at least between those who claim to be from the same group. Even as we are now there is no absolute of justice present in the human race, nor am I sure there has ever been.	NULL

I was like 8 at the time and I asked the teacher why she thought that. I got the paddle for "questioning her authority as a believer in God". They also did not believe in the theory of evolution.

>Atheism just means “without faith”.   That is one definition of atheism; not the only one.    >A lack of belief does not translate to “contrary belief”  No, but it can, and often does.  I find the whole "atheism is just a lack of belief in god(s)" thing a bit reductionist.    I lack a belief in god, but I also believe (actively) that god does not exist.  I don't claim those beliefs to be knowledge though, so I am by definition an agnostic atheist.   Even if I agreed with everything you said though, that doesn't negate the concept of gnostic and agnostic being qualifiers for theism and atheism just because the "beliefs" (or lack thereof) aren't apples to apples comparisons.  Regardless of if it's an absence of an affirmative belief or the presence of a negative one, the distinction lies in the claim of knowledge vs. belief.	NULL

When I was about 12 or 13 years old, my mother rummaged through my belongings including my cellphone. I was, at that time, beginning to explore my sexuality and preferences with my current partner of 7 years. We had spoken to each other in a not so appropriate manner the night prior and my mother saw EVERYTHING. She proceeded to call me a “camwhore” and “slut”. Those words have bored their way into my skin for YEARS now. When I finally addressed the situation, she apologized and said she had no recollection of calling me those names. Common case of “the axe forgets but the tree remembers.” We’ve slowly built our relationship back and now I can say in hindsight, I know that she was trying desperately to shelter me from losing my innocence and purity. Not a good way to go about it, however.	NULL
Well, I do have depression, but also ADHD and “slight” memory loss, so I can’t really remember why I have depression, but it’s still here, and I’m still here, so it’ll work itself out. At least, that’s what I tell myself	NULL

Back in 2011 my boyfriend at the time cheated on me. I broke up with him and started dating his best friend.

Not that scary but it's surreal to me and kind of funny.  I used to drive a company truck from construction sites to dig sites etc. I also was experimenting with microdosing magic mushrooms.   Anyways I made a wrong turn one day and drove onto a large, empty student driver training course which was basically a grid system of intersections and train crossing signs for railroads that didn't exist. It was all fenced in with a looming treeline that hid the one entry and exit road. I adhered to the "traffic laws" like a rat in a maze before eventually finding my way out again but I felt so out of place like a bomb was about to drop on me.	NULL

Was looking for the comment. I always get a bit annoyed at the edgy atheist stereotype like we're somehow the aggressors. I'm not in that phase anymore of trying to disprove theists, I understand now that some people have good reasons for believing and it's best not to challenge their beliefs when it isn't harming anyone, but I also don't blame myself for being that way before. In the VAST majority of cases, whenever I would reveal my religious beliefs (or rather, lack thereof), the immediate response was looking like me like I was weird and saying "Why?". Obviously when people treat atheists like that and try to constantly question them and prove their god exists, we're gonna become defensive and develop counterarguments. "Edgy atheists" is just a term theists came up with to shit on atheists who do the exact same thing back to them, and I'd say it's a pretty offensive stereotype.	NULL

Is it? Isn’t there evidence that religion or any other spiritual beliefs has been around for way longer than modern society? Like a religious “instinct”. I’d say that belief in some supernatural force is a consequence of the human mind, as well as the lack of knowledge, which is the majority of the time humans have been around.	NULL

This isn't much of a horror story but my dad told me that a few times some kid would come into the shop where my dad worked and if I remember correctly he would either buy toy weapons from the shop or ask my dad to open the box's up and he would always talk strangely and from What my dad talk me he would say something along the lines of 'stay away from the fields' so when me and my mum would walk home from school I would always look to the side and always look at the field near to where my mum lives. I always found those story's weird	NULL

Well, when I was an infant, doctors mutilated my genitals due to the influence of a popular religious cult that believes that a human sacrifice is the greatest thing to have ever happened. They also have these sick rituals where they symbolically consume human flesh and blood. They even greet one another using a symbol that represents capital punishment. Twisted stuff, I don't know who put them in charge of removing wizard hats from CHILDREN, yet here we are.       As you might imagine, having my funsticks turtle neck sweater removed from me to satisfy the whims of an ancient death cult while I was a child is something that I never fully recovered from.  Why? If you found my foreskin, I don't want it back. Worst jerky ever.	NULL
