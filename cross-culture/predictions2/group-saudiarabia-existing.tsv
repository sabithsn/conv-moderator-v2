I have read a lot of the comments and I will just give my opinion. This request of her sounds like "how much you love me?" but why not to put it as "how much are you willing to let me go (husband)?" This is clearly a negotiation and as such think of your BATNA (middle ground), the top you are willing to go and start the negotiation <<on the lowest reasonable offer>> start haggling from there. Besides you have traditions on one side but the country's law on the other so a prenup agreement is a must here. Don't let anything to chances or verbal, everything in writing. Remember that nobody remembers ten years from now and less if is the losing party.  Also know that you "have the pan by the handle". What is she bringing to the negotiation? Social relationships beneficial to you, access to more capital, other nationality otherwise you cannot access? Sit down, think, strategize and haggle smoothly and being willing to leave makes your position strongger than showing you are not willing to let her go.	NULL
The answer is yes	NULL

This is honestly too much to ask for. I thought you were joking at the beginning or trolling but apparently you're not. Mehr is her right but as per the Sunnah it is always recommended to ask for something that would not overburden the man. Usually the amount the girl asks for would tell us a lot about her personality and how she views marriage. I personally would run away if i was in your situation to be honest. But you know best!  This is your life and your choice. If you think of her as a true gem and she was religious and has a great personality then go for it and try to at least negotiate with her father about it.	NULL

DUI doesn’t have a nationality nor a religious association. People are people. It isn’t right for a police officer, while in uniform, to make random comments like that.  What does “worst” mean in the DUI context anyway? DUI is just plain bad, period. There is no ranking of good DUI and bad DUI and Australian DUI and Saudi DUI.  And statistically speaking, I just can’t believe that Saudis make up the worst (if this is a thing) DUI drivers in whole of Australia.	NULL

It’s cultural shock 1000%. Many Saudi mans have 0% interaction with the opposite sex, they don’t know how to talk or interact with women. And about the drinking as you all know alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia and if you find it, it will be really expensive. So most people who drink think they have a chance when they go outside the Country to drink and drink a lot.   I’m generalizing here and I know some don’t fit here, but that the reason for most of people.	NULL

American born and raised here who lived in Saudi in the past.   As a former medical student we had a lot of GCC students come through one of our programs and they were split in the categories you described plus the cafe type. They are r he ones who hang out exclusively at malls and cafes usually with other GCC guys. Also I’ve almost never heard or seen Saudi women in clubs, partying, getting drunk, etc.  There would be American guys that would try their luck sometimes but a few minutes there and they’d usually leave due to going absolutely nowhere. Now I’m not saying it doesn’t happen, I’m sure the presence of other GCC men was enough to have them stay away from those places or activities but it also seemed like they were genuinely not interested at all.  Many of them continued to wear the hijab (though not all). Also they were probably some of the most fabulously dressed.

My experience as well. Remember before I became a Muslim and went to the nightlife of London. The biggest spenders on alcohol and girls were Saudi and Emirati students/tourists. At first it was confusing due to the notion that Arabs are Muslims (most Arab immigrants in the UK tend to at least not drink alcohol openly). A friend even had an Emirati girlfriend and when her mother visited they went to a restaurant buying a bottle of champagne for 8000 pounds. I was like “what the f*ck that’s just disgusting”.	NULL

I'll be completely honest with you, but from what you are saying it sounds like they are trying to turn you down by asking for difficult demands, or it could actually be what they want. First, the 20K($) dowry is not so surprising it's really about the circumstances and such, like:  \-She might be from a rich and prominent family so its what they expect (She could be related to the royal family)  \- She probably set this price according to what her father expects (he might be trying to scare you away)  \- She might think this is what you can afford  Also , the dowry price is changeable you can negotiate with them (but TBH it sounds like they are looking down on you and don't expect you to actually marry her). The dowry price could be set by the father to scare you away or see if you truly are committed. Jewelery usually means a necklace, bracelet, and ring, but considering the expensive dowry you can just get a simpler set (gold is preferred, since its considered an investment). About the 5 acres of land and five bedrooms, keep in mind whatever they demand has to be in the contract so I doubt they would put something that ridiculous in the contract (it is considered shameful). She probably means she wants to have a house and not live-in with your parents or something but again that depends. The wedding cost is traditionally covered by the groom's family with help from bride's family. If you are serious about her you can try to make some tweaks to make things more agreeable. I advise her to ask her what's going because this is not the norm (especially the 5 bedroom stuff).	NULL

>Show me the clear cut evidence as to how you determined music and free mixing are forbidden by Allah (the two issues that the OP in this thread rather deterministically claimed are Haram).  I have done so in another comment but I guess you're the lazy one now eh?  >Both issues are open to interpretation and not explicitly forbidden in the Quran.  The Sunnah is also a primary source in Islam from which rulings are derived.  >Regarding music, there are contradictory Hadith on the matter from Sahih Bukhari  There is no contradiction except the one in your head. The first hadith forbids music generally, and the second one is the hadith from which we can derive an exception to the general rule (the scholars have said the daff is permissible in certain cases).  There are many ahadith in which a general rule is established, whereupon exceptions are made and expanded upon in other hadith. This principle is well known but I wouldn't expect you to know that of course.   Sahih al-Bukhari 5590  Narrated Abu 'Amir or Abu Malik Al-Ash'ari:  that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) saying, "From among my followers there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk, the drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments, as lawful. And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection."    Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, came to my house when two girls were beside me singing songs of Bu’ath. The Prophet laid down and turned his face to the other side. Then, Abu Bakr came in and spoke to me harshly, saying, “Musical instruments of Satan near the Prophet?” The Prophet turned his face toward him and he said, “Leave them alone.” When Abu Bakr became inattentive, I signaled to the girls and they left. It was the day of Eid and the Abyssinians were playing with shields and spears. Either I asked the Prophet or he asked me whether I would like to watch and I said yes. Then the Prophet made me stand behind him while my cheek was touching his cheek and the Prophet was saying, “Carry on, O tribe of Arfidah.” I became tired and the Prophet asked me, “Are you satisfied?” I said yes, so I left.  Source: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 949, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 892 Grade: Muttafaqun Alayhi (authenticity agreed upon) according to Al-Bukhari and Muslim     >and I am not of the opinion that we should claim as forbidden something that Allah has not explicitly forbidden.

Runny nose and congestion: Antihistamines like loratadine taken once daily before sleep can help Nasal drops from sodium chloride to xylometazoline also helps   If by any means you start having chest tightness, persistent constant cough, shortness of breath. You should head to the closest tataman clinic and ask them for pulmicort.   Otherwise water and rest!	NULL

Unless you've done school from the same school, you won't be compared to them.  You need your school transcripts and extra-curricular certificates if any.

Depending on your schools curriculum, universities have their classification and grading system.   Try going through universities and their application process.  You also have consultancies and agencies who do all that for you for a fee.	NULL
Westerners in Saudi for business, generally the Saudis in KSA tend to be more reticent to consume alcohol from my observation. I did observe in the states many of those from the GCC tend to really overdo it, with other drugs other than alcohol too. That said, the biggest shock I have had here is how many people use cocaine, especially the wealthier families. That said I tend to work with Westernised Saudis but still, even women discuss drug use which in a workplace in the West even is not common.	NULL

Depending on which type of games you like to play. You’ll find Arabs in every single game genre 100%. There are normal popular Saudi games like CoD, FIFA, and rocket league.

There are also obscure games like D&D that have a very small group of players.   So just like I said, depends on the games you’d like to play.	NULL

If your schools followed a Saudi curriculum then yes.  If your school followed an international curriculum then you'll be compared to that curriculum.  Your country of origin will be Saudi but your school's curriculum is what matters. Incase they run into a curriculum that's new for them, they ask for their respective ministry of education and/or foreign affairs to equate it to some other curriculum so that they can make sense of it.  But I think enough Saudi students have gone to the u.s. so have an equivalency.  So its just better if you try sending respective universities an email and they will be able to give you clearer answer.  Also most of the universities have a self-evaluation on their websites for you to figure your own standing as a potential applicant.	NULL

There is an 'Id for every nation and this is our 'Id."  Exactly the hadith I shared. It shows that on 'Id certain instruments are allowed.  >Narrated Abu Musa: That the Prophet said to him' "O Abu Musa! You have been given one of the musical wind-instruments of the family of David .' (Book #61, Hadith #568)  These references aren't complete, whose book is this in, and what is the full hadith? From what you've given me all that is mentioned is that abu Musa (R.A) has been given a flute, and doesn't mention it's permissibility. If you are using Dawud's (A.S) family as proof, then that isn't valid as the sharee'ah at the time was different, just like in previous sharee'ahs drinking alcohol was permitted.   This answer is complete bogus. The ahadith of Sahih al Bukhari have been vigorously researched upon and authenticated and the scholars have universally agreed upon the book's trustworthiness. To even imply otherwise is shameful and would have you laughed out of any reputable scholarly circle.  >Meanwhile the scholarly dispute on the matter is well captured here. https://www.virtualmosque.com/islam-studies/sciences-of-quran-and-hadith/regarding-the-permissibility-of-music/   https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5000/is-music-haram  Here is an actual scholarly answer on the matter.

Since you didnt specify your gender, I'm going to assume you are asking males.   Personally, cold approaches would stress and I will immediately think "why is this lady interested in me, is she gonna scam me, am i gonna wake up in a bathtub missing a kidney" so I don't recommend it. I'm also not gonna be on a good mood all the time, so sometimes it's instant rejection regardless of how you approach.   What I prefer is smooth transition over a shared interest. For example, if I'm attending a pottery class, we can start there and talk about pottery, art and go along the subjects until we decide to exchange contact infos.   Also, dont be "I like you" within a week, that's too early. Be prepared to find actual reason for liking me and also specify them. The "I dont know, i just do" would get a doubtful look from my side. It works between teenagers, but we are much older than that now.   Online is alright too, but again, no long distance relationships, they are -mostly- doomed to fail, and it wont work with me.   With online, again, start with common interests and let things go smoothly without pusbing them.   What I prefer personally is through workshops and social events where the common interest is established, we have something to talk about already.	NULL

I could be totally wrong but I think Safeway and tamimi have something going on. Their logos and branding seem oddly alike.  As for the car wash, there is an old one that was turned into a manual one. They hand wash and you drive through for the rinse only. Looks dilapidated as can be.	NULL

Erm so who’s gonna tell him 😅	NULL
In my opinion, it wasn't logical.  It was put to halt the operations of picking up and dropping off passengers from and to other cities which was illegal and unregulated. It is legal for saudis but they didnt want non-saudis to do the same. Also it wasn't just pick up, any vehicle that has more than 5 seats, so they could also halt unregistered businesses.   I assure you, everyone with a brain went like "lol whoever made that decision is lazy". Our country is known for laziest of decisions. Instead of educating generations about driving, let's just install saher everywhere to punish the poor.	NULL

Five stars Double standard.	NULL
Speaking of Saher - I really don’t want to come off being condescending but, honestly dude? all the Saudis I know never had any sort of traffic tickets here in the states. Maybe this is a product of being educated and also know the serious consequences if you broke the rules.   Btw These are people who born and raised in Saudi. Bottom line no methods are 100% perfect, in part because no one is 100 think the same.	NULL

Before u go too far down that hill. You don’t seem to agree that we have much of bigger of problems in SA then USA when it comes to driving. I believe things should be approached differently as function of the problems. This is not me saying saher is 100 perfect.	NULL
The reason for Banning is that many expats start using it commercially wither to carry goods or people  but I think it is allowed now	NULL
You mean "than" the US. I do agree here is way worse, but suddenly placing saher in hidden areas to just punish those who speed with money is the laziest idea to control the accidents. They just wanted to make the likelihood of statical accidents less in certain areas. Reckless driving is still going wild along with every driving and road safety violations out there.  Road safety should be included in first grade curriculum up until they graduate from high school. A points system should be implemented rather than a "pay to speed" type of punishment. Those who reach a certain number of points get their licence automatically suspended and must attend classes on road safety and complete few tests.   I can think of lots of smart ways to help minimize reckless driviny and actually implement road safety awareness in the society.   Saher is the laziest idea, only punish the poor, and it's idea aiming to profit.	NULL

Allow me to share my experience.  I’m what people call a “pretty” boy. Also I’m a foreigner who was born and raised here in ksa. And I’ve experienced and seen HORRIBLE things. Stuff that has traumatized me, stuff that made me wanna leave this country forever but I couldn’t, stuff that made me despise saudis.   Boy on boy sexual harassment is super common here. It’s worse if you are a non Saudi. It’s truly disgusting and fucked up. I pray that it doesn’t happen to anyone. I got used to groping and all cuz it was the lowest form of harassment.   Throughout my life I’ve had shit experiences with saudis and it was mostly in the form of harassment. I’d frequently ask, why did I have to look like this ?. So, to all those who read this and have experienced similar stuff. Please know you are not alone and it’s NOT your fault. I never had anyone to talk to but please talk to someone. Just cuz you are a man doesn’t mean you can’t express emotions.  Lastly, I don’t hate saudis just cuz I’ve had shit experiences with some. In fact I have more good memories with Saudis than bad. But the bad experiences is what affects you the most. Most of my friends are saudis and I really like ksa and look forward to staying here specially cuz of the direction the country is moving.  Everything I said above was about male saudis. With female saudis I’ve only had pleasant experiences, they are kind and fun to talk to, and what surprised me the most is how almost all of em know some level of English. I’ve always been treated with respect with no form of racism (I guess the “pretty” boy factor also plays a role here). I’m so happy with how the kingdom is supporting women and they truly deserve it.  That’s all.	NULL

Maybe off topic but, what about relationships from work? These days it seems much easier for Saudi men and women to get to really know (and possibly become interested in) one another. That is probably the easy part. But I have a feeling that taking this relationship to the next level -while having both man and woman stay in the same job (specifically in the same department or the same team)- could lead to some serious awkwardness at work (and perhaps outside of work too).  I feel it would be interesting to at least talk about this or similar experience.	NULL

نصائح من ١٠ سنوات قراءة  ١-أول كتاب سيعلق في الذاكرة وممكن يحدد مسألة الاستمرار من عدمه، فاختر الكتاب بدقة. ٢-إقرأ الكتاب بلغته الأم وابتعد عن المترجم قدر الإمكان. ٣-لابد من ورد يومي ولو ٥ صفحات ولا يستهان بهذا القدر، والحذر الحذر من قراءة صفحات كثيرة في أول المشوار. يقول الشاعر: اليوم علمٌ و غدا مثلُهُ، من نُخَب العلم التي تُلتَقَط                    يُحصّلُ المرءُ بها حكمةً، و إنّما السّيلُ اجتماعُ النّقَط  ٤-الابتعاد قدر الإمكان عن الروايات، لإن الغالب أنها خيال ولا تزيد علما ولا تنقصه، لكن إذا كان ولابد فالأفضل أن تكون بين الكتاب والكتاب على شكل فاصل يريح على النفس.	other

As a non-Saudi, and someone who has lived in this glorious Kingdom for a little over 6yrs, I am fascinated with the continued developments, leadership vision, the involvement of Saudi nationals to not remain somewhat dependent on expat workers to drive the workforce requirements.   This country, and particularly the Saudi, made me feel instantly more welcome and at hone even more than my own country (UK) makes me feel. On top, the country and special people afforded me the opportunity to get involved with some of the largest projects ever commissioned.   To all my Saudi male and female friends who may read this - your country is watching you, the world is watching you, you are part of a global game-changing future vision and one that has already started to become a reality.

You could talk to IGEC, they are a consultation agency, to see if there is any good university still accepting applications now, or you could wait to apply next year.  US schools are quite expensive, you will be needing a scholarship, good for you, your SAT score can get any scholarship you want, but again, to apply for scholarships you waited too long, my best advice right now is for you to wait a year, and apply next year, sorry, but time wasn't on your side.

first i would like to appreciate you sincere response and taking the time to replay back. such a great active member in the community. i guess your refer to the warm approach where you interact with individuals within certain activity or boundary where you share same interest. i totally agree with you in this regard. however, cold approach does work sometimes though because i have entirely different past experiance, its true that you get instant rejection depand on how you approaches the lady either by throwing old school pickup lines or try to flex with your six-back. ladies would obviously know these tricks so you cant play them. but before approach check for signs of approval from her side then go for it. some guys are more expert in this criteria where i have less knowledge. still it works though. online dating is kind of supplement in addition to your real life game. hope for more responses  thanks again	NULL

I live in the UK but came to Saudi for the first time last month. I heard so much hype about al baik and was sure it’d be overrated because how good could a fried chicken be compared to others? Well I tried it and honestly I think it’s the best fried chicken place I’ve ever been to. Beats any places here in the UK and I wish we had them over here. You might not appreciate it as much if you’re a local but as an outsider, trust me when I tell you it’s definitely special compared to other places.	NULL
Khadija was the rich catholic daughter of a merchant. She was the one mandated by the Catholic Church/Vatican to find a leading figure to convert the sons of Ismael who didn’t accept the Trinity as the Nicea Council defined it. I’m sorry if I strike a nerve but Islam is just a creation of the equally/more evil Catholic Church and is a way for these elites to have a tighter control of Jerusalem. If you can/want, we can discuss it more. I’m a former muslim and my whole family is muslim, I’m not just some USA neckbeard shitting on something he has no clue about. God bless you brother !	NULL

King Fahd established a Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs directed by senior family members and technocrats in 1994. The council was planned to function as an ombudsman of Islamic activity concerning educational, economic, and foreign policy matters.  He took steps to support the conservative Saudi religious establishment, including spending millions of dollars on religious education   He is credited for having introduced the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia in 1992.  he reformed the educational structure of the country, investing more on education.  his reign saw the saddam invasion of Kuwait, seeing how his army was worthless, he reformed the army.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  he did a lot of good things, except for the religious police	NULL

Not exactly.  If the father can’t find a valid reason to net let his daughter get married, then a judge can consent to her marriage. Idk the process, but it can happen.

It's a great decision. Jeddah or Riyadh is where you'd wanna go for more money and opportunity. You'd need to get sponsored before being able to work, so if that's set up, then you actually have the opportunity. You'll also see more of a progressive outlook on things in the cities as you would anywhere else in the more developed areas.  More savings and spending options, people are nice to foreigners and don't apply the same cultural expectations to you, which would be less of a deal since you're a guy. As prices are going up, salaries aren't following very well. Who you know makes all the difference. It's a land of opportunity and overall, I'm glad I'm here instead of the US.	NULL

This is a highly intricate topic and the survey does nothing but to stigmatise individuals with ADHD-OCD-Depression etc which are extremely common forms of mental health issues, then they are lumped with schizophrenia and bipolar which are serious mental challenges individuals would face.   I am extremely surprised that the professor has allowed the wording of this survey to go through, it serves nothing but to isolate these individuals and painting them with a wide brush of اضطرابات عقلية. Which honestly is as insensitive as using the word معاق جسديا to describe those with physical disabilities.  Every single one of us will face a form of depression, or have a quirk about how they do their way, the test as presented will not cause us to talk more about them, but to hide them and try to shame them as “psychologically lesser”.   This survey speaks to the general state of psychology in Saudi and why it is extremely hard to find a good psychologist.	NULL

well, you tried.	NULL
The difference I found is a lot of places over here tend to only have the the spice and flavour in the coating, whereas Albaiks chicken can be had without the breadcrumb coating and is still very flavourful.

While we were debating the intricacies of flavour i went ahead and ordered through hungerstation a broasted meal about an hour ago. Have pictures but do not know how to upload in comments. I can tell you from last minute tasting the meal was at most mediocre. Note, I am from the east coast (Alkhobar) so to me Albaik is exotic as it was not even available a couple of years ago so i have no bias. But Happyland  broasted in my town is lightyears ahead. So again it is strange that people flock to Albaik!	NULL

Fair enough, it’s not going to be for everyone. I’ve not tasted the other place you mentioned and maybe they are better, but I’ve not had better than al baik personally.  I’m not saying it’s the best in the world, just the best I’ve had from the few countries I’ve had similar food at the places I’ve tried. Another thing is al baik weren’t even doing broast when I was there, it was only their burgers, sandwiches and shrimp available. So for all I know the broast isn’t great but it’s not something I typically order from anywhere to be honest, so I wouldn’t have got it either way. With how busy they are aswell, it wouldn’t surprise me if the quality of items aren’t quite up to scratch sometimes.	NULL
Well surely you must know what changed if there’s a difference? I’ll never know, but I’d be interested to know if there was a difference.	NULL

**[Mirage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage)**     >A mirage is a naturally-occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays bend via refraction to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the French (se) mirer, from the Latin mirari, meaning "to look at, to wonder at". Mirages can be categorized as "inferior" (meaning lower), "superior" (meaning higher) and "Fata Morgana", one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly-changing mirage.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	NULL

I agree. The only point I take issue with is that these lower paid workers are entering Saudi on Government issued work visas. Reduce the amount of laborer visas and pay the Saudis a living wage.

I accidentally witnessed an execution in Jeddah, near the Bedouin market. I was about 11 years old and had lost our family friend, whom traveled with me down there to the markets. I was alone for about 30 minutes, and I saw what I thought was a soccer game. I recognized it from school, because we played soccer with all the international kids.  I ran towards the crowd but then I quickly realized that it wasn't soccer. A man came out with his face covered and a giant sword, and quickly sliced off a man's head. When the head rolled on the floor everyone cheered, and they even picked it up and kicked it around like a soccer ball. I will never forget it.	NULL

Lmao you're really delusional. Many saudi companies don't pay wages for months, especially those working in construction fields even engineers. Recently a neighbour of mine died in Saudi and the company he was working hasn't paid him salary in 8 months. The company suddenly had the money to release after his death so they don't get fucked by the police and government. I have heard numerous cases where saudi companies don't pay wages for months.

I guess it depends on what exactly your intentions for moving are. Both are nice places, but the obvious comparison is that Medina is much smaller than Jeddah. Jeddah is a large coastal city, with great fish markets and huge shopping and Medina is in historical and in the middle of the desert. The job market in Jeddah will definitely be much better. One thing to consider is that Jeddah is near Mecca, so it is very strict and religious influenced, compared to cities like Riyadh, which in my experience was more tolerant of other religions.      I went to international school in Jeddah in 1991, and it was a very good school with kids from all over the world. I am unsure what education you seek, but I am sure there is something suitable. I know most rich Arab families send their kids to American schools.     I am unsure about healthcare but I remember getting vaccinated in Jeddah for meningitis. It was a very nice hospital, but again, I was like 11.  I think Jeddah would be a great place over Medina. I think Medina would get boring after a while, but Jeddah is a lively city. I would also suggest visiting Taif and exploring the mountains there. Be careful of the baboons!	NULL

Actually, the construction of the tower was put on hold beacuse the funding to it stopped as a result of the government's anti-corruption thing they did back in 2018.

Well, you are obviously within your right to decide how you live your life. Dating before marriage is a fairly new concept in Saudi, and does not agree with the Saudi traditions. whether we like that or not, It still remains a fact in this day and age.     Both ways have their pros and cons, and I personally don't believe one will give you a better chance at a successful marriage than other.     I should note that an arranged marriage does not mean that you are going to marry a complete stranger, that is simply not true, as you and your match will have a lot of time to get to know each other, and you both can agree on how long this will take before deciding to actually get married. On average I'd say that takes around 6 months to a year.       About the marriage from different culture, it shouldn't be a problem to marry from a different culture. However, some families and tribes either do not allow intercultural marriages, or demand a higher mahar and overall cost.      Lastly, what you see in the public places and social media does not tell the entire story. The people I meet through work for example are very different in their beliefs and conduct from what I read on social media.	NULL

I'd approach this with an understanding that whoever i meet and decide on settling down with is going to change after marriage. Everything changes after marriage. You ease into things and are more relaxed. So try not being too analytical of things and keep a margin for error.  I completely agree with your points. It's always better to get to know someone and see if there is a possibility of an emotional connection because looks eventually fade away.  Try to find someone whose demons play well with yours.  Best of luck!  P.S. one of the best things about getting married is; you get to make dark jokes about marriage and married life.	NULL

Thank you for opening up such a discussion, And I think it’s great that you think of marriage that way, an important project bc most ppl don’t prioritize it and leave it to chance. Second from your expression ( feminine but not a feminist) I can gaze that the relationship dynamic which your comfortable with is the one where you are the main bread winner and you take the lead in the relationship which is ok, but I don’t think you have a good perception about what Saudi girls are like. I know girls how would love to be in such a relationship where the male will take the lead. You problem is accessibility, saudi girls are not approachable as other cultures. Not bc they are not friendly but in social context, you can’t just walk to a girl in the street for example. I would suggest going to social event a lot and be open to get to know new ppl.  Good luck in your pursuit!	NULL

He would tell the muttajeen "You tell her to cover her face, she wont listen to me!!". They never knew how to respond to it.

I'm 31M. Married for 10+ years. I understand what you are going thru. It's a very difficult decision, and the stigma of being a divorcee (M/F) is kinda of annoying. So I understand your concerns of not wanting to nose dive into this and create a big mess. Me and my wife are not a match made in heaven, we have our differences and our own opinions on different subjects. But mutual respect is present in the relationship and we understand where our opinions are coming from. As long as the core values of what you both believe in align, I think it's good enough. Things changed from when we first got married, we both changed as we grew older together. Our stand on many subjects differed. As someone else here said don't be analytical about it. Keep a margin of error. Things will change and keep changing as you grow older. Don't judge the majority based on the vocal minority on social media. Focus on the core values that you hold and would like you future partner to share same values. Good luck and I wish you a bright future.	NULL

As far as I heard from close friends who are also young, they struggle to find jobs in Jeddah and looking for jobs in Riyadh or Khobar. Jeddah is an amazing city to live in not gonna lie (Riyadh based). As far as healthcare all jobs provide health insurance but depends how good is it. Overall checkups at large hospitals will not go over 200riyal (my copay is 10% so 20 riyals there). Schooling on the other hand also depends on your job. You can continue your schooling here but might cost you a bit. If you are a STEM major look at KAUST for a possible scholarship. Great place. Good luck	NULL

Point taken. Rent, transportation, food, utilities, marriage, etc. 3k isn’t a living wage for most adults. Doubling it might make it worthwhile if you’re not living alone and can share the bills.

You are right, islam came to change what was wrong. The prohibition of burrying babies is clear. But marriage to someone considered an adult is not wrong, not now and not then.

Expat here.  Born and raised here and been living in the eastern province.  About racism - yes you will face it. Not everywhere but you definitely will, specially if you don’t speak Arabic. I myself have faced a lot of racism but I guess that was because I was living in a shitty neighborhood.  And yes you will most likely be blamed if you ever do get in trouble with a Saudi. That’s just how it is, sad Ik. But I’m assuming you know Arabic and you can try to defend yourself. Probably won’t work.  I myself am moving out of the country cuz of “Saudization”. I suggest you look into it cuz some sectors are now 100% for saudis. I’ve nothing against saudization, heck if I was a Saudi it’s the best thing ever. But I do think it’s kinda not right to kick off ppl who played a huge role in building the kingdom. Personally Ik a lot of well qualified non saudis who will be an asset to the kingdom but aren’t getting jobs cuz of saudization.   Also Ik you said your American. But TRUST me if you don’t look American you won’t be treated American. You are an Arab here.   I still love it here despite all the bad experiences I’ve had. Cuz I cant judge an entire country based on the few dickheads I’ve met lol.  Lemme know if you need any more info. Happy to help.	NULL

Well for a family of 5(dad's coverd) u pay 20,000.ಠ_ಠ It's not even tired up to ur income, meaning some earning 6k per month will have his 30% of his salary taken and let me tell u can barely survive on 4k. Existence tax is known officially as dependence fees but unofficial people tend to call it the existence tax since u pay a tax with absolutely no benifit at ALL, LIKE none, no free education or free health care or anything at all noting....ಠ_ಠ  It 400 riyal per depend and it's add up quickly if u have a family here. But seeing ur coming America i don't think it will even impact u. So don't worries at all, also I think u can negotiate to employer to cover it for ur family, the company is required to cover employee's dependence fees but not the employee's family.	NULL

Also the fee is not for family of 5..... It like is a fee that u have to cover for any family member that u have under u. Like ur married and ur wife is a expat as well still u have to pay the fee. The fees is for expat's family and it's 400 riyal per person.	NULL

Depends upon ur salary, ur coming from America so it's certain that they will have to pay western wages to attract u here but for brown people they don't need to pay high wages for us the salaries are nearly 4time less then western, if ur earning 100k here it's certain a brown who working in the same field as u with the same hours as u in the same company as u will be making at min 15k to 20k hence its is only  expensive to the poor and the middle class rather then the rich.but it's important to take into consideration as well.  also take ur children's education as well, it costs arround 20 to 10k per child if u want them to be educated in American circulam.

If you get married to a Saudi woman your children get free residency, healthcare and education rights tied to their mother. Not a citizenship. Maybe they’ll get citizenship if hell freezes over.

I was just discussing this with my dad this evening while we were on a drive. MBS' reforms are steps in the right direction, but there is SO MUCH more yet to be done if Saudi wants to stand a chance towards economic sustainability in the long run. Take a page from Canada's book in terms of attracting talent and driving growth. Unless Saudi opens up a points based immigration system, I don't see the reforms serving their intended purpose. Projects will turn out like KAEC, promising on paper but real world application is nil due to the lack of incentives for people and business to move in.	NULL

oh ok thanks i'll look into this  wow things changed so much . when i was there in makkah 6 week ago prayers were limited, it got to point where i had couple days left in makkah but was not able to go inside masjid   umrah seemed like there was unlimited passes	NULL
Really? I had almost all booked on Eatmarna in Makkah 2 weeks ago with no problem. Day I left I heard umrah was going to be restricted to 1 umrah per 10 days.	NULL
yes i used eatmarna too, went in end of november   before i went i had heard mixed things, like that if i book 5 for example, and then one or two prayer bookings had passed, then i'll get to book one or two more at that point, so i just booked as much as i could as it was available, & toward the end to my surprise i was just not able to book at all even tho it was showing available.   maybe bc there was vacation days going on for saudis that week?   well inshaAllah i got another amazing opportunity to go again next week so thats good to hear	NULL
Aight. I work there. You have asked a lot of questions and I’ll try my best cuz I’m a Saudi who lived as an expat elsewhere for 10 years.   In four months, we will move our offices to the tallest tower in Riyadh, which we own not lease. It’s prestigious. It has the same capital as Aramco and only a 1000 employees (as opposed to 65000). The country’s new direction is investing the oil money into diversified portfolio.   Yes Saudi is hella white washed. Fuck dat shit. I don’t like it. But the recruiters are telling you the truth. It’s a very palpable melting pot. It’s still conservative country in total but now you have outlets/options for alternative lifestyles.   We have a few expats. Perhaps a bit over 10% but this is my personal guesstimate. Europeans, Americans, Asians etc…  Also I have yet to write a single email in Arabic in my job and I am comfortably a bilingual. I have Saudi coworkers who use Arab-English and EVERYONE speaks it in the job. But outside you will find people enough English speakers but not everyone.   I had a job offer from Big4 in SWE and turned it down for PIF. Granted I love my family and my dad needed me to be there for him.   Also Oxbridge is the funniest word I learned today😂😭😂😂😂	NULL
Sounds very inconsistent. Only time I had issues booking prayers was when I booked umrah first and then tried to book prayers. I got an error something like "maximum permits exceeded" but when I had 5 prayers booked and then booked umrah after it was all good. Good luck with another visit. You're indeed very lucky MASHAllah :)	NULL

Racism. There’s no way around it. These people refuse to take a look in the mirror and acknowledge that their country is the biggest abuser of human rights in modern history. The atrocities they committed against Iraqis and afghani are well documented, yet they refuse to acknowledge them. It baffles me.   As for Meltzer, he’s a “pro-wrestling journalist” who has no credibility because he makes shit up as he goes. He’s been very vocal against the Saudi-wwe relationship. He lies constantly just to make Saudi look bad. When the plane carrying wwe wrestlers out of Saudi after a show had mechanical issues, he said the wrestlers were held captives, which the wrestlers themselves denied. Now, I don’t know if Meltzer is a complete racist or he’s just being very anti-WWE. But one can assume from his unfounded statements against Saudi that he’s a fucking racist bigot bastard.   Keep in mind, >!the pro-wrestling community is a bunch of left leaning fatties in their 30s with low testosterone levels. Most of them still live in their parents’ basement. On top of that, their whole identity and existence is to bash wwe creative and collect wrestling funko dolls. Some of them are married to ugly pigs, the rest have orgasms to female wrestlers posters.!< What I am try to say is, their opinion of Saudi doesn’t really matter.	NULL

If you are sending it through a courier service (like FedEx, DHL, UPS...etc), then it shouldn't be a problem. But if you're sending it through Saudi Post or regular postal service, then you should get the National Address. That's the address registered to the receiver. Saudi Post also has a service called EMS which is similar to courier, that should be fine too. Bottom line, if it's tracked, it should be OK with the address where it contains the house number and street name. Again, I'd contact the receiver and make sure.	NULL

Of course when the WWE has Shows in China or Russia, these same commenters wouldn't say a damn thing about 'human rights' and would gladly spend their money.  The comparisons to the Nazis are eerily reminiscent to when GW Bush claimed that Iraq was part of the "Axis of Evil" prior to the war.   To me, it seems like the democrats and liberals want to rally the American people against what they perceive as the True Enemy: Saudi Arabia and the GCC in order to boost their waning popularity in the US.

I remember watching Spacetoon. I started watching during the 2005 "reboot" at approximately 2010, and I was amazed at all those shows I could watch. When the actual reboot came in during 2013, I was amazed at that new style and the new shows, and confused because of the removal of 3 out of the 10 planets. I just snapped when علوم came back a few months later (thank Allah you weren't even close to me that day, or else your eardrums might have exploded), I forgot what they put that day as it was 8 years ago. And then during 2017, another example of me going through hype was when أفلام came back, the second I heard those lyrics, you know it was time to to to the other room, as I just realized what planet I was seeing five seconds later. I heard that تاريخ is making a comeback, I'm not sure if it already did because I don't have Spacetoon on my TV no more. I'm waiting for the day I can finally watch قناة شباب المستقبل again...	NULL

I really don't know what a "jewish" person looks like other than the typical stereotypes you see in movies and other films. so the average saudi prob won't know.

Try toale your profile 100% based on bayts metrics. Then login every couple of days and apply to positions. There's a button to refresh the date of your resume. Once you do that frequently it will show employers that your CV is up to date and you are actively applying for positions. Because most employers I've worked with really are interested in people who can join immediately so a person actively applying can join quicker than others who need to give a long notice period. Also don't show that you're unemployed currently even if you are. I found that employers are hesitant to hire someone who hasn't been working for a while. If you're a fresher put your dad's company as a place you're currently working/training/intern at. Ask your dad about work culture and commonly used terminology that's used in the field so that you can use it for when you arrive at an interview. I know it might not be as ethical but we're competing against wasta and nepotistic culture here so I say fight fire with fire. Do what you gotta do to survive.	NULL
Well I didn't want to go in to politics but being that you are so curious..  Oh there are many issues being a Zionist today.  It has always been a sad truth.  For me being a Zionist has nothing to do with Arabs or nations.  History has taught my people we have no where safe, so we need to create safety ourselves. So being a democraty, only when we feel safe amongst Palestinians, we would let go of the nation and accept one israstine for all.  Right now, and for the past 100 years in the Levant, it has been the opposite.  So no it's not wrong, but history and humanity are a bitch.	NULL

Well, I can speak of the location since the headquarter is beside where I currently work (all within Digital City). Beside the traffic, the location is great, new restaurants and cafes opening lately. Regarding PIF, it is highly reputed in the kingdom and hard to get accepted there.  Mostly government agencies are becoming powerful. PIF invested in many successful businesses and they own 64% of Saudi Telecom Company, not to mention their 26 billion stake in Lucid Motors. We’re very welcoming to foreigners, most of the population speak English and understand the western culture so you’ll fit easily. And the semi-westernized society is true, it is happening right now we are witnessing it.	NULL
Forced saudization of industries have led to squeezed economy and so the opportunities for Saudis as well. Moreover, instead of embracing expat and assimilating then into economy, they are treated as disposables, however this is has long term effect, where the brightest of them leave for Western countries, leaving only a pool of mediocre work force of both Saudis abd expats behind. Saudi just have to ponder why the West is accepting these well educated people and what would they get out of them. If only Saudi can harvest this talent pool, they can have a smart economy that would be competitive, once the oil revenue dwindle or else it could be a scary situation.	NULL
I been there before.	NULL
For expats it is actually 2.5k but can be broken down as saying, 500 for rent and 100 for electricity with a base pay of 1.9k, so as long as your total compensation equals 2.5k there is no problem, but yeah if they are getting 1.5k then no way in hell is their total compensation package hitting 2.5k, for Saudis it is 4k, with around 10% getting taken for Social insurance and retirement, so your take home becomes 3.5-3.6k, for Saudis it is enforced as Saudis have options but for foreigners not so much, their residency is tied to employment so without a job they are out of the country.

Ever heard of whatabouism?  Well...  6mil out of 1.2bil is 0.5% genocide 6mil out of 14mil is almost half population, so forgive me if I don't see them as the same.  Of course they are not.. Have you heard of the final solution? Germany actually made technical and logistical plans to destroy an ethnicity, and they actually went through with it.  British colonialism was violent and destructive like south American colonialism and Australian, Israel is not the same.  We did not colonize for economics or geopolitics, we colonized to create, and we wanted everyone to be a part.  Do you know of the other communities living and cooperating with IL? There are many, you only think about Palestinians but what about Druze, Beduins, Sameritans, Christians and so on?  >seen as hero by the British people,  Our luck is that Hitler was crazy enough to attack everyone, if it was just internal, no one would come to help us, just like no one is helping Uighurs.  >richest in the world to the poorest  If in 3 generations you did not better your situation, that's culturally on you and not the British, they left you alone, that's what you wanted. Now it's time for you to create your nation, it is not easy at all. If you are on reddit I assume you are one of the more "better off" Indians so the blame is very much on you.. as a strong citizen, make something great for the glory of you country, that's what we do in IL and in 3 generations it made Israel a wonder to behold.  >do u think the british have right to india???? can the later genration have right to claim india??  The British of course do not have any right to India, they where foreign colonizers.  I anyway have a genetic test and all my ancestors are Levantine, from 100,000 years ago up until the last genetic ancestor that lived 6,000 years ago. And then my family has been Jewish for about 3,500 years. Always praying towards Jerusalem so it is my homeland.

Yep, at least what I’ve seen on Haraj.com. The thing is like someone else has mentioned there’s a shortage in supply so prices will naturally go up.

> Dude ... I'm a nuclear medicine tech, I scan lungs (and other organs) for a living.  No offence but doctors and medtechs are not (usually) scientists. Is there some specific issue you have with the sources I provided? Do you disagree with how the data is being interpreted? In the Twitter thread that I linked to especially, most of the data is available to read.  > Some of the information you provided are false.  Which information specifically, and how is it wrong?  > 50% for whom? which age group? which ethnicity? (apparently that makes a difference) > it's not a clear cut answer.  Because it takes a long time to gather information on the long-term impacts of any illness, and because vaccines have only been available for children for a couple of months at most, the data on vaccine efficacy against long-COVID is mostly about adults. But why would we simply assume that children are less vulnerable than adults? Especially since [there are actually loads of kids with long-COVID symptoms](https://twitter.com/jneill/status/1479066859270025219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1479067776866213888%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nakedcapitalism.com%2F2022%2F01%2Flinks-1-8-2022.html) and, at least pre-vaccination, kids with documented cases of COVID have [more than 50% higher long-term morbidity](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.21265133v1.full?s=08) than kids who haven't contracted it. Given that vaccines don't seem to give great protection against long-COVID symptoms in adults, why would we assume that it's different for kids?  > Give this a read for more info about vaccines: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32623-4/fulltext?rss=yes&utm\_source=nl\_landingpage&utm\_medium=web&utm\_campaign=covid\_bytes\_daily\_newsletter  I'm not actually sure why you linked to this.

well if you are looking for a self defense type of boxing then there are certain clubs where they teach different types of martial arts. Like for us in Al Hasa, we have the "NADAL FATH" where they teach football, martial arts etc. So enquire if there are any similar ones in your region.	NULL
Why is stc shit? And you don’t need zain to reply, go to their shop and pick the package you want, and mobily isn’t that bad but not as good as stc, tried all 3 and i can say that, zain is really good if its covered around your area, stc have really good support and like zain, mobily is not so good i would say from my experience customer service is slow and they don’t actually help that much, they take too long to send someone to check on the box( sometimes a wire would shorten) and their coverage is good but their wifi is bad, this whole thing i wrote is from experience, so if someone has anything different they would like to add then go ahead.

Do you honestly think the ministers and graduates of SA wouldn't take a lesson from Libya, Venezuela, and Brazil? when those nations lied about their stats, not even a year later it was found out that they lied, most corporations and foreign investors pulled back their investments which led to their economic collapse.  logically your argument wouldn't make any sense since the people who are running the Saudi economy literally have Phds in economics whilst you are just typing from behind a screen in your home.  > its what the government is doing to fix this issue and evidence of it and how its taking affect and how they are dealing with covid and the unemployment rate.  you can see from the Riyadh season and tourism industry, [260K jobs were opened by the tourism industry here in SA](https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2020/06/29/Saudi-Arabia-s-tourism-sector-will-provide-260-000-jobs-by-2023-1-mln-by-2030), [Jobs opened by SAMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian_Military_Industries), jobs opened for NEOM, [with 30K jobs opened with contra](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1551656/business-economy)cts, and many others opened by the state itself, and so on and so forth.  hey, I get where you are coming from, you are afraid that your country is lying about its stats, you are afraid that your country is currently failing economically, and I would say you aren't the only one, these expansive being projects really put someone's mind at doubt, but as someone who've had doubts before like you, I researched about it, and all of the projections are leading to a better place, anyway, don't hesitate to ask anything else, I will be able to answer you inshallah, just know that the people who are running this country arent idiots, they are not Erdogan, they graduated, researched, and spend years searching for a good future for this country, know that you are in capable hands.

There is some quota system set in place by the Saudi government and other Islamic countries, in which a set number of pilgrims are granted for every country, and it's set relative to the size of a said country. Deciding who is going is the responsibility of the other countries, so for example, Egypt has a raffle system to determine who will go for Hajj. For anyone who lives in the KSA, a Hajj permit is granted once every Five years, and a citizen or an expat can see his/her Hajj status in Absher.	NULL

I don't get how a phd in economics stops someone from lying and trying to save face. i don't get how a phd in economics allows trillions of riyals to go only in tourism projects like neom and qiddiya. Because if these projects get fully built and the money is spent on them then the projects failing could and probably would bankrupt the country. Not to mention show investors that this country is not a suitable investment. And lets not forget all of this is supposed to be here by 2030 or at least useable.   And i know the "financial" heads don't call the shots and they would have wanted to do something else or disagreed on some projects but it just proves the point that they are not always in control. and if they are not in total control i would never trust any figure.   &#x200B;  I would never want anything bad to happen to the country and i only wish for it to thrive, but sometimes you do doubt what goes around.

There are restrictions but not one in lifetime (every 5+ years) and they give a very high priority to first timers, elders, terminally ill, and/or disabled.

And who exactly Should be isolated in this situation?   I talked about the situation in the kingdom and how the government treats covid now. You brought kids and their education here. and honestly making this whole just bullshit situation that "kids can't learn from online school" is honestly stupid. Sure in person is better but honestly studying and learning all comes down to the person himself. Parents should look after their kids and their studying. And if they are teenagers then there shouldn't be a problem with them comprehending the subjects through online classes and they can ask the teachers when they don't understand something or go to youtube to look for a video on it. I went through online school for my last year for high school and other than math which i already don't like. I learned everything just fine. And the same in college before i dropped out.

Exactly right. Each country is different. OP is likely from a western country where, yes, there are less Muslims and you can go every year. In most Muslim majority countries, no, you cannot go every year.   You also have to take into account that the vast majority of Muslims unfortunately cannot afford to go for hajj, even once in their life. So the limit would be futile unless you started paying for people who cannot afford it.   Also don’t forget that despite equality of Ihram,  Hajj is segmented by class, and you have X number of rooms in the clock tower that need to be filled by “rich” people, and if you limit the “rich” people that come often, then the clock tower will be empty.

I know this is a late answer that will get buried, but I must point out that it is particularly hard for expats to learn Arabic even though they live in Saudi Arabia. There are a few places offering courses but they are incredibly overpriced, have limited options and frequently have teachers that are not qualified to teach the language effectively.  To me it is so surprising that this is the case since we are in the heart of the Arab world.  So to summarize, a decent Arabic language institute for non-native speakers.	NULL

Sure, then you’ll have to store data of billions of people.

>It’s 7th century, when Arabia is made up of rival, feuding tribes, disunited and forever at each other’s throats. Emperor Kisra (Kingsley) has a fearsome reputation for being utterly ruthless. But when the Arabian Princess Hind (Hart) refuses to become the emperor’s concubine, the stage is set for an epic confrontation. It is a battle that, by its conclusion, will have changed the region forever and echo throughout history. Escaping with her father, King Numan (Massoud) into the vast and unforgiving desert, Hind is pursued by Kisra’s seasoned mercenary Jalabzeen and his bloodthirsty troops.	NULL

i mean an iqama is literally the only paper you need to be here, without an iqama, you would get deported indefinitely, but the 6000 for the iqama isn't for the ex-pat to pay, it is for his/her employer, this is to discourage the employment of non-saudis, so unless an expat is highly skilled and his employer is willing to pay for his iqama, they would most likely be fired, paid their compensations, then leaving the country.

Right there but the employer will pay only for the employee. The dependants on expatriate? Of course expatriate would bear the cost of their iqama and living. That would be hard on so many people who are earning hand to mouth already.	NULL
i mean the current unemployment rate for expats is 1.8, meaning that almost everyone is employed, which would mean their employer would pay for them, but the 1.8 percent that arent employed, may Allah help them.	NULL
May Allah help everyone amen.  I totally am getting your point but i am talking about the dependants of expats. The employer obviously isn't bearing the cost of dependents of employees. That too is hard for them with in inreasing fee of iqama	NULL

You didn't ask them while getting the shot? Wherever my family has gone to get the vaccine, we've (and everyone else there too) always confirmed which vaccine there is.  Anyways, since you've gotten all three, which one gave you the most and least severe side effects?	NULL
"This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice." That's the first thing I read.	NULL
I got 2 Pfizer and haven't gotten the booster yet.	NULL
I don't think they give the vaccine you ask for. They give what's available. At least that's what I have experienced.	NULL
Well yeah, sometimes they have more than one type available	NULL
Like I said in another thread, I got the appointment by sheer luck that's why I just took whichever vaccine was available there.  All of them gave me severe pain in my arm but this booster shot has given me a mild fever. The least severe might have been Pfizer.	NULL
yeah and I love these especially the second one is beautifully made, my great-grandfather dreamed of going to Mecca so nothing stopped him, it took him three months to arrive there, he stayed there for one month and decided to come back to Kosovo (he also visited Jerusalem and bought some cooper plates with the David star on them), and sadly I’m moving somewhere else and I can’t take them with me and I can’t  trust them to anyone, so I’m either going to sell them somehow to someone who actually values them or just bury them somewhere.

The situation of the travel restriction is very weird. There is nothing official online, believe I searched all of them. However, there are some tweets and Saudia airlines website says that turkey is restricted. Also, There is no direct flights from saudi arabia and turkey. So I really dont know.	NULL
It aint saying anything wrong, it just says that having natural immunity is more effective than the immunity gained by the vaccine, which is a common knowledge for anyone who ever read a biology book. The thing is that having something from the vaccines to fight against is better than having nothing on a hope to survive and have a stronger natural immunity	NULL

You want to be married to someone, but take into account of whether that someone wants to marry you. Compatibility is essential and not easily found.

I just want to say, thank you for explaining how it works, a lot of people say “I know, I work there” and don’t explain because racist idiots should do their own research rather than get all the facts for free (no effort involved), but the fact that you took your time to explain this means that you both care about your field and its reputation as well as relationships between expats and Saudis in the community.

I thought he let it go. The next day the police called me and told me I escaped. I ended up paying 2k even though I have insurance and the accident was his fault.

I recommend you look at the comment that talked about applying to reputable colleges only. Because I went to college in the U.S for computer science and when I compare myself to my colleagues in Riyadh they're doing as good if not better especially in Software Engineering. Look at the programs carefully since most universities here im the U.S don't even teach software engineering. I know it is commom to think the quality of education in the U.S is higher but it really depends on what institution you go to and many Saudi institutions have improved lately.	NULL

Not sure what he did, but if you feel it's warranted, I'd suggest you contact the company and lodge a complaint. If he was bold enough to do it with you, it's fair to assume it's because he may have done this in the past. If you used Uber, click on your profile and you'll find the "Help" icon under your personal uber rating. Scroll to the bottom and you'll find the "Call Support" option.                                 If it was Careem, click on your profile page, it should bring up your past rides and should have the option of "Get help with this ride" in Green.                                FWIW if you receive any messages or calls from their number, make sure to document and screenshot these, without providing them any responses. Let them talk themselves into a corner they can't back out of.  Sorry about the experience, I know what it's like to feel unsafe and having other people know where you live or work.

As a woman, I would agree with the above comment. Assuming you find the RIGHT girl and are sure about her, it would be better to get married young and grow together as a couple. The older you get the more life experience you will have and the higher your standards will be. I wasn’t able to get married until after I got my master’s degree and if I could change anything it would be to get married earlier. My husband also has the same idea, and says the longer he put it off the more difficult it was for him to find someone with the specifications he was looking for.  I’m not sure how religious you are but if you are worried about taking on the responsibility of marriage if you are not financially ready, I would suggest looking into the Quran verses and hadeeth that talk about how Nikah actually increases your sustenance. Perhaps that might give you some clarity.  But again, just make sure you are choosing the right person and not marrying the first person that comes along just for the sake of getting married.	NULL

Advice from a loving brother: Getting a scholarship the way you are planning to do is really hard and almost impossible. It was made like this since the former minister of education took place in office and the situation is still the same today.   I’m telling you this because I am studying abroad and personally know many Saudis that did the same and been trying to get a scholarship for years, none of them got it. I also know a couple of employees at the Saudi Cultural Mission. They all advise against this. Unless you have a guaranteed scholarship from the ministry, don’t go abroad. There’s a big chance that you will waste your time and money and come back with nothing if you cannot afford the full tuition from your pocket.  If you can get into one of the top universities in Saudi Arabia, I advise you to do so before it’s too late. KAU can accept you for orientation year if 5 years haven’t passed since you graduated high school. Quality of education is good and there A LOT of majors to choose from. You just need high grades, which should be easy for you if you have this passion.	NULL

I think you need a friend more than a wife. Marriage is a huge fucking responsibility, I don't think you need that at 22, you still young, don't put that wight on your back. Go make/find friends, it's gonna be hard at first but it will be worth it.  I know how being lonely makes you feel you think having a wife will give a life-long best friend, but that shit ain't true, a friend is what you need at your age, a wife will stress you out, I don't meant it like "wife is bad, women are bad", it nice to get married but it's best when you're old enough to put up with the responsibilities that come with it.   So take my advice, try to look for friends that are interested in the same things that interest you, for example if you are interested in football, you should attend football matches, or if you love anime talk with people in anime forums and so on. Don't feel down about not finding a friend you just keep trying and you will find someone inshallah.  Ps. don't look for a gf no matter what you do, don't, that comes with unnecessary responsibilities too.	NULL

1- is part of you wanting to get married to do with not transgressing the bonds of your religion? 2- if you have a good amount of money saved, why not try to do business ( don't be afraid). 3- the good of you (a Saudi) studying abroad is that it'll broaden your mentality.  4- if I was the father of the girl,  I'd let her know getting engaged or married to someone that will be away for semesters at a time will be difficult.  There's a possibility he will cheat while away (22 years old, you ain't started living yet) . Are you ( the daughter) ready to deal with that if its thrown at you? 5- life isn't perfect,  if you're making good money at Aramco and NEED to get married , it would be better to stay and try and save some more.

It was not important for parents to teach their kids about road safety, nor the government ever did any proper road safety awareness campaigns, and when they started, it was mostly too late. It's the easiest thing to get the license and the punishments are only monetary.   We have a really big problem in the upbringing when it comes to respecting others rights and safety. No parent used to bring it up or care about it. Only recent parents started doing so, so hopefully it gets better and better.   We need harsher punishments that's not something that you can simply payoff. Endangering others should land you in jail for few months, or have your license suspended and car confiscated ALONG with education and proper focused campaigns that start from first grade til they graduate.

i havent met anyone in that certian case and i dont think they would chose this country's option after being massive deals from the top companies of the world. but insallah i will know it after 6 years.   but for graduating from a Saudi university its the same. graduate as an engineer and u still get 3k while ur saudi counterpart get 7 to 8k	NULL

The 800 riyal is nearly 33% of the total expense for my family of 4 back home. This is including their medical and eduction housing etc.   Same family cost me 4000 riyals, excluding the expat fee here in Saudi. Guess where the 1600 saved goes? That's right straight back to my home country	NULL

2400 SR (nearly 99%) is only £471.00 GBP, which is slightly less then my rent for my house. The expat fee for me personally wouldn’t be an issue simply because in the KSA, I would get paid about 200% (3 times more) at least then what I do right now here in the UK. Plus on top of that, there’s a high possibility that I would get free housing or a housing allowance to cover all my housing costs within Saudi via the company that I’d work for. If not then I definitely get this in the UAE (it sure if they have expat fee though) as I am open to moving and living/working in either KSA or UAE in the future.  Even if they made the expat fee £300.00 a month so 1,500 SR. IMO it would still be very manageable.  I don’t think you understand how expensive it is to live and work in the UK compared to working within KSA as a white British male. Once you tally up everything.	NULL

[https://www.arabnews.com/node/997041/saudi-arabia](https://www.arabnews.com/node/997041/saudi-arabia)  1.1 million expat children enrolled in public schools with no tuition.  and a few years ago, when the idonesian maid got sick, we took her to a public hospital and she was treated for free.  but who am I to say those things, you are an expat, you know about it more than I do, though unless you are 100% sure, pls don't spread misinformation.	NULL
with a huge number of ex-pats working, a portion of their monthly salaries gets transacted to their families abroad.  let us say for the sake of argument, each ex-pat sends 100 riyals per month to their families (of course the number is much higher than this), 100\*10,000,000\*12= 12billion riyals being transacted out of the country annually, this is a big case, that is why the reduction of the number of ex-pats is necessary.  but people usually come to the conclusion that "SA doesn't want expats, so who will work their jobs", this is a wrong statement, SA is still reliant on Expats, just with the big number of unemployed nationals (11% for Saudi males and 21% for Saudi females), a reduction in the number of ex-pats is necessary for the rotation of revenue in the country and not outside of it.  does that mean I am a supporter of the drastic measures taken here? no, but for the overall picture for Saudi Arabia, it needs to do this, I know it is harsh, very harsh, but this is the fastest way, but this way's downside is that it is harsh.

I definitely agree with you, 22 is a very young age to get married at. There is a lot of growth to happen at that age. He should just date and not marry.  The others who are saying that it's not a young age, I think their only life goal is to get married so that's why they're rushing to it. 0-18 years old was spent in schools, 18-22 is spent in colleges(if not then it's spent on experiencing life with less responsibilities) 22-26 is where you should enjoy life as much as you could before walking into huge responsibilities.  Getting married at young age makes you look like you're just desperate and have nothing going for you	NULL
But I do think that being in a place surrounded by sin and it being so easy to commit sin counts for something, ya know? Like life is so much harder in the US, more difficult to keep the faith when surrounded by disbelief. So if you're able to keep your faith, even when surrounded by kufar, then I think there is more blessing in it. It is more of a test, the mountain is steeper and the reward greater. If you're surrounded by Islam life is easier, harder to commit haram, less temptation, obv there is benefit but less tests and difficulty. My teacher used to say tie a dog to a lamppost and it will fast. Doesn't make it a believer. For me it's so hard to be Muslim in a redneck country... just some additional thoughts.	NULL

Yes I do believe they should be granted citizenship. However, your last question is confusing because Saudi Arabia does not deny foreigners to “live” in the country.

Dont get married until you are settled in. My opinion is to wait until you graduate and land a job in saudi honestly.  If your main worry is that you dont want to be alone, thats not a good reason to get married. Its a lot of responsibility.  Keep in mind that whoever you get married to would have to spend a lot of time away from her family, which she is probably not used to, so it will be difficult on her and on you.   Honestly just go to university, get your degree and land a job, then think about marriage.	NULL

Culturally the Arabic coffee is the special one in Saudi. The tea is red tea and you can add mint to it.	NULL
We mostly drink black tea and it’s pretty much part of Saudis daily routine (I rarely drink it). My family for example drink tea in the evening of EVERY SINGLE DAY. There’s not a single Saudi wedding I’ve ever been without being served a tea. Many like it flavored with some local fresh (or dried) mint leaves or basil (habaq). My favorite tea is the one that is sold by street vendors and cooked over charcoal in the winter 🤤🫖.	NULL
I am very curious about the tea from the street vendors that you describe!  Thank you for the comment!	NULL
You are welcome, just wanna add an important note. Unlike coffee, tea in Saudi Arabia is regarded as a simple authentic traditional drink and fancy tea houses or complicated recipes kinda ruin the experience (but they are an available option here).	NULL
Why do you say that those ruin the experience?	NULL

I meant the experience of having a traditional Saudi tea. Tea is much cheaper than coffee which makes it affordable to every social class as an everyday drink. Therefore, it’s not common that Saudis gather in a fancy place to enjoy some fine specialty tea (many regard “specialty tea” and “tea houses” as silly concepts in Saudi Arabia), but we do it for coffee. Tea here is linked more to simplicity and affordability.	NULL

The point I was trying to get across is that both men and women should get married as soon as they are able to and not delay marriage for education. However, that’s not saying that you can’t get married and study at the same time. There are A LOT of men and women who got married while in the middle of their education or continued with grad school after marriage (either together or separately). I also know a couple of families where the parents continued their education after having their children. In my case, I simply did not get married because I was not able to find a suitable match until I started working.  I don’t think you will be infringing on the woman’s rights at all. At the end of the day it all depends on the woman and her family and what she is willing to accept. If she is righteous and logical though, I don’t think that will be an issue because she will understand that the more qualified you are the better able you will be to provide for the family and might in fact encourage it. I know many couples like this. I think the better question to ask is whether you think you will be able to balance your responsibilities.  Also, why do you assume she would get bored? She can also work on doing something for herself in the meantime and even after having children (again, IF she can balance her responsibilities). You can encourage her to do so as well. Whether that’s getting a degree or just taking classes on something she’s interested in, running a business from home, picking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, volunteering at a women’s group, increasing her knowledge in the deen, spend time with her family, etc. There are SO many possibilities for things to do to feel accomplished so I really don’t understand when women say they are bored at home.   Again, it all depends on who you are marrying. My advice would be to communicate with the person you are considering very transparently to make sure you understand each other and avoid surprises after marriage. Don’t withhold important information because you are worried you will be rejected. I’ve seen a lot of people make this mistake and then suffer after marriage because their partner’s expectations doesn’t match the reality. If you want to study, make it clear. If you’re planning to move countries, make it clear. Make sure you understand each others’ values and are on the same page about your goals. And also make it clear what you are willing to compromise on or not willing to compromise. I can’t stress this enough, but try to get to know the other person and understand how she thinks as well as you can before marriage.  Just to add, I do think postgraduate education is more important for a man than a woman. I do think all women should insist on getting a bachelor’s at least, but beyond that, I don’t think women should make it a priority to get a master’s or PhD. Reason 1 is that a man and woman’s roles within marriage are different. For you as a man, being more qualified can help you fulfill your role of providing better. For the woman, having a masters and PhD isn’t going to help much with running a household and instilling good values in the kids. Reason 2: women generally look for men who are superior to them (taller, stronger, makes more money, etc). For men, that’s not what they look for in a woman. They generally look at things like how attractive she is, how she will be as a mother, etc. So for you as a man, your interest in getting a masters is actually a good thing, it will definitely improve your marriage prospects.  So if you can, strive for marriage and continue your education at the same time.   Hope this helps and sorry for rambling so much, I do get very passionate about this topic when I see what’s happening with marriage in our society right now and how the youth are struggling.  Hope you are able to find the right woman and have barakah in your future together in shaa Allah.	NULL

Losing weight means strict diet first and foremost. Start calculating your calories intake and make sure not to exceed 2400 Calories a day, along with selecting what to consume. Stay away or lower your carbs intake, from bread and rise, fries and all the other carbs if possible.   Through the gym, take it slow, 15 to 20 minutes on the treadmill, even if you felt you could do more, dont, but try to keep it constant. On weight machines, follow instructions, start with the lightest weights even if you felt you could left more, you need to be constant.  If you're messed up your diet or missed a gym day, dont beat yourself too hard or punish your body for it. Go back to track smoothly like nothing happened, but do try to be constant.	NULL

I honestly don't know. Maybe people with more knowledge can answer this.  In my anectodal evidence, My family was 4 members here in 2019, with 2 earning and spending.

Another is, my company was 9 people in 2019. Its 2 people in 2022. With my departure, they have slowly started transferring my responsibilities to the Dubai team. With the rise of remote work and pre-established market its not that hard.   Its the same stuff all over again with expatriates.

Free medical care, free education (including university), their acceptance rate in universities is the same as Saudis, the Saudi privilege in universities are not counted against them.

I haven't gone through the same exact thing but I've gone through depression. They say depression and sadness are the same feeling but the causes of them are a different story.

Well because the State of Israel follows the zionist ideology. Zionism: is an ideology and nationalist movement that espouses the establishment of, and support for a homeland for the Jewish people. Their goal is to establish a nation solely for the jewish people, which there are many islamic nations.

Mate you should’ve done some research before you posted this. Being a jew is not just a religion, it’s an ethnic group. Of course if you are part of an ethnic group you can get citizenship from the country of which the ethnicity is part of. Israel is an ethno-state, meaning jews get citizenship. You are only ever a jew if you were born a jew.   Try converting to judaism and tell Israel you now want to get citizenship, haha that would be very funny. Islam is for everyone, regardless if you are Chinese, Arab, Russian or Spanish.	NULL
There is no superiority. We mistreat all non-Saudi Arabs equally.  But regardless. Saudi Arabia is not founded on Islam. It might have Islamist roots. But just like Sudan or turkey that doesn't mean it's pan-Islamic. Today Saudi Arabia is just a country that it's only dedicated to the natives and residents of the land.   You can dislike it. You can complain about it. But it's not going to change. It's going to continue to drift into nationalism. I don't mind giving favoritism to Muslims or allowing people to become citizens. But the days where a complete foreigner and Saudi get treated equally just because they're both Muslims are long gone.	NULL

This makes me think your trolling.	NULL
I thought expats get paid loads? Or is that only white western expats?	NULL
Saudi isn't a caliphate. It's a monarchy and specifically a Gulf monarchy, meaning only families that are considered by government native enough can gain citizenship. For example, people in Iraq who come from a Najdi background and have proof of it immigrated to Saudi in the 80s and gained citizenship.	NULL
So basically 1.5 billion Muslims have a right to Saudi citizenship?  Does it sound remotely sane?	NULL

Wow a country that favors it’s citizens more than foreigners, that hasn’t been seen before ever. From your comments it seems you think SA belongs to all Muslims instead of It’s people. It’s just like any other place, if you bring no value to the country no one will take you in. It’s so insanely pretentious how you think you have a right just to live there “just because”. SA owes Ummrah and Hajj to Muslims and it helps millions of foreigners every year come into the country to do them.	NULL

Hajj being there = all Muslims should be able to get citizenship? I don’t know how you’re drawing these connections but it doesn’t make sense. The history of the formation of Israel is the reasoning behind their laws. Saying it’s transferable just because you can draw a faint comparison that there are holy sites in each country is not enough reasoning to justify your argument. Plus, ignoring all historical and cultural logic, it’s completely unscalable. There are 15M Jews AND Jews have the highest average income of any religious group. It’s almost as if it’s even a strategic approach for Israel to have such a policy to increase there population for economic reasons. Imagine opening the flood gates to almost 2 billion Muslims, most of them low income. KSA already donates unmeasurable amounts of money to Muslim nations, and it is their responsibility to upkeep their citizens livelihoods first.	NULL
I dont think saudi has enough resources to accomodate 1.9 billion muslims in which majority wishes to live in saudi, saudi youth already having problems here finding a job, every muslim country rn have problems of their own, no one is relaxing	NULL

No offence bro, but how old are you? First you say the “gulf states are basically cousins that separated to form their own countries” and now you are saying North Africa + Levant and Iraq are Arabs?   You should have paid more attention in history class. North Africa and Sudan didn’t speak a word of Arabic before the spread of Islam during 7th century Umayyad Caliphate. Do you think their ethnicity changed to Arab when they were taught how to speak Arabic by the spread of Islam? In that case, Spain would be Arab too because they once also spoke Arabic.   You also had no clue about the Sykes Picot agreement between the British and the French, it was they who drew the borders of the Middle East today, not the gulf states who “decided to separate”.   Not to offend you or anything, but please at least learn about your own history and the Middle Eastern history whilst you are at it.

I had this problem with my first job, I couldn’t stand to work 1 week and resigned. I hated the work, I counted the seconds so that i can go home, and to be honest I didn’t know why until now i had that feeling with this specific job, that was a turning point in my life, i had to change somethings in my life so that I don’t face the same problem again.  So I can’t tell you to do the same since probably you dont have the struggles i have, such as speechBlock/stuttering and social anxiety, considering all this I decided that my mental health was more important than the job, i’m still unemployed but I believe that i will get my chance.  But I encourage you to stay strong, give it some time and i hope it will pass.	NULL
Way to generalize everyone in this sub	NULL
One thing I learnt is that a good job will not make you happy, sure it takes away potentital problems in the future, but as humans we only enjoy the journey to the top or wherever we want to go, but once we get there happiness is short-lived, so we shouldn't base our happiness on achievements.  I did feel the same way as you though when I came back to Saudi after spending a few years in my home country, also feel the same every now and then. Obviously the best thing to do is speak to a therapist. But what worked for me (I consulted a therapist as well), was journaling, mindful meditation and more than anything going to the gym, it gave me something else to enjoy, something else to work towards.  Hope this helps you in some way atleast :)	NULL
I thought about DM'ing you but I'll post it here for the general benefit.   Tbh I'm actually very happy to learn that Saudi Arabia interests you solely for religious reasons. Keep your intentions pure and ask Allah for ease and doors will, God-willing, open for you. *And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out.* [at-Talâq:2]  I am in no way an expert on the matter but here is me applying a little good-intentioned reasoning:  It feels much easier to get citizenship of some countries because those countries benefit from having more citizens. A good percentage of your income goes to the government as taxes. In fact, from what I've heard, if you're an American citizen you have to file taxes no matter where you reside in the world. Saudi Arabia doesn't collect high taxes from its citizens despite providing them with benefits like free health-care, interest free housing loans, unemployment allowances, education and other facilities.   Maybe not all but a good portion of the negative stories of expats in Saudi Arabia are of those that didn't exactly have a very legal status. At the very best they were in a gray area. If you're dealing with people that are already involved in something illegal or borderline illegal, you're likely to get mistreated.  Isn't knowing the language of a land a prerequisite to reside there? Aren't people who apply to immigrate to English speaking countries required to submit their IELTS/TOEFL scores before even immigrating there? Aren't they required to go through an interview in English before their applications are considered? It is Saudi Arabia where you don't need to know a single word of Arabic to obtain a work permit. It is Saudi Arabia where you will find people that have spent more than 40 years doing pretty well without knowing almost any Arabic. It is Saudi Arabia where you will find road signs in Urdu/Hindi (they're probably not common but I've seen them with my own eyes in Riyadh). It is Saudi Arabia where at the airport you'll hear public announcements in multiple languages. It is Saudi Arabia where in the Holy Mosques you'll see signs in a dozen languages.   No land is perfect. No people are perfect. But your Muslim brothers here aren't wholly as bad as some people will have you believe.   You can DM me for further information.	NULL

What is the point of talking history with someone who doesn’t understand history, to make matters worse, it’s his own history that he doesn’t understand. Seriously, how old are you?  The reason I didn’t include the Levant states and Iraq, is because these borders in the Middle East have been drawn by the British and the French, and they’ve drawn it rather poorly (on purpose but that’s a whole other topic). There are portions of Southern Iraq, Syria and Jordan that are Arab as well, hence why I isolated North Africa for argument’s sake.

Here's the problem:  Judaism is a faith.  Jewish is also an ethnicity.    Israel is an ethno-state built for those who are of Jewish ethnic descent, not for practicing Judaism. This js why black jews who immigrate have a tough time, they have the religion but not the ethnicity.  It's also racist in the sense that Polish/Slavic and white passing practicers of Judaism can get in easier than the blacks despite both only having a tenuous ethnic link at best.   Saudi Arabia can also be defined as an ethno-state as it is predominantly peninsular Arabs that are citizens, or those who resided in the Arabian peninsula during the foundation of the Kingdom. You can get citizenship if you prove your descent from the tribes here both by tribal elder recognition and other official documents.  As part of the reform, new immigration policies for skilled work are coming, so stay tuned for that.   Kind reminder that Saudi Arabia isn't just the two holy mosques, and despite our pride in serving them, we're not responsible for all nearly 2 billion muslims.	NULL

Nope. The prophet himself prohibited writing it during his lifetime. For fear of conmen and mythos hijacking the religion.   Hadith os a collection of oral history and tradition written centuries after his death.    The appearance of dajjal contradicts the promise in the Qur'an, that Muhammad pbuh is the last prophet, messenger, or instrument of god.   The word Mursalīn in Qur'an was used to describe anything sent by god, whether mercy, punishment, or a message, and Muhammad was the last of it. The origins of the Dajjal story come actually from Jewish tradition and not Muslim.	NULL
Converts to Judaism are considered as Jewish as any other. While it is true Judaism is an ethnoreligion, genetics doesn't play much of an actual role in Jewishness, genealogy is what's more important. If a patrilineal Jew wants to be considered Jewish under Jewish law, they are entitled to expedited conversions as long as they were raised with Jewish culture to a degree.   Converts are just as Jewish as any other Jew, the only disagreements that come is whether a conversion from one denomination is valid.   The Orthodoxy does not consider conversions from Reform or Conservative schools of Judaism to be valid conversions. However, the state of Israel has allowed that any converts to any recognized denomination to Judaism can come to Israel. Patrilineals can also come to Israel.  The thought process behind it is, if you're Jewish enough to be murdered for it, you're Jewish enough find sanctuary in Israel.	NULL

Dude the USA is a great place. You go there and become American. They don’t ask you where you’re from every 5 minutes.

I love both places but I’ll be honest I feel more comfortable in California. I’m just used to it more but Jeddah is great too.   Unfortunately, Arabs are not great to each other and treat non Arabs even worse. Don’t hate on the US trust me there’s a whole lot of other places that are much worse. You will make more money in the US as a doctor and have access to the best and most cutting edge medical advances where you can further your career.   It’s better that you build your future in the US and visit Saudi every few months for umrah and visiting the Prophet’s (PBUH) mosque.

>asked him about his comparison to Israel for wanting all muslims to immigrate here, how would Islam spread around the world.  I agree with that.  And i apologize for misrepresinting what you meant.

Bro are you just giving me a sugarcoated answer? Can a Chinese man who converted let’s say, three years ago. Actually get an Israeli passport? If so, perhaps you have such an example?   As far as I know, actual Semites from Ethiopia aren’t seen as jews, get forcibly sterilised and aren’t given citizenship. So how can someone who isn’t a semite nor a Jew get the Israeli passport?   “Converts are just as Jewish as any other Jews” Realistically, how many number of Jews agree with you on this? Maybe 200?   What you are telling me is hardly a reflection of reality.	NULL
Agreed. It's inhumane that someone could grow up and live in Saudi for all their life is considered an outsider.	NULL

Tenuous? It's not tenuous at all. There is significant evidence that Ashkenazi Jews are semitic and genetically speaking are more genetically Israelite than other Jewish groups, but there are groups that are more Israelite than Ashkenazim as well. I know it suits some sort of racist fucked up narrative to separate azhkenazim from Jewishness, I hear it a lot, but there is little evidence to back this nonsense.   This has nothing to do with race, but rather the burden of proof. Ethiopian Jews are not a singular unified group, but rather several distinct ones. One of these groups were Jewish but converted to Christianity centuries ago. They're the ones that are currently having problems with going to Israel. If you cannot prove that you are Jewish, you are not going to be able to make Aliyah. This is most often proven with documentation. These could be conversion documents, bar mitzvah certificates, marriage certificates, circumcision documents, etc.	NULL
I wasn't talking about Ashkenazis, I am aware of them and their history as a group, and how they ended up as the European and central asian diaspora branch via the Khazars.	NULL
You are the one coming with a lack of knowledge. Any convert to Judaism can make Aliyah as long as it's from a recognized denomination.   There is no forced sterilization of Ethiopians, that is such an insane conspiracy that had little backing to it. Birth control was given to Ethiopian women who needed it, and it had bad effects. Pfizer was the manufacturer of the birth control and the Israeli government sued them for it. Nobody was permanently sterilized. Why would Israel go through the trouble to bring thousands of Jews to Israel just to sterilize them?   What are you talking about? There are tons of Ethiopians in Israel who have citizenship. The Ethiopians who don't get granted citizenship is because they are a Jewish group who converted to Christianity a long time ago. Claiming Israeli citizenship through Aliyah requires evidence. This means documentation.  How many Jews agree with me? It doesn't even matter. It could be 99% or it could be 1%. Jewish law is VERY clear on conversions and what they mean.   Maybe instead of acting like you know what you're talking about when you're not even a Jew, you do some actually research. Not some idiot's opinion, but actually read Jewish law on conversion.	NULL
We have no relation to the Khazars. Only the nobility converted to Judaism and their practice wasn't serious enough to pass it on for very long. They died out entirely.   Ashkenazi Jews existed before the Khazars conversion. Ashkenaz refers to a place, this being around the Rhineland and then later Eastern Europe.	NULL
Didn't mean to imply lineage, I meant via that route. Because in my reading about the Khazars which was a long time ago, it was mentioned to be very likely that Ashkenazi migration to and through the area is what led to the Khazar conversion.	NULL
So there is a lot of unrest. I guess the schism between the حظر and بدو is still a thing especially in  private sector…	NULL

I see, thank you and good luck.	NULL
So first you tell me converts to Jews are just as Jewish and every Jew can get citizenship and now you’re telling me that the Ethiopian Jews aren’t getting citizenship because they were (forcibly) converted to Christianity, even though they have reverted back to Jewish practises. And yet, they aren’t recognised by the ISRAELI GOVERNMENT as Jews. And so cannot come to Israel. You see the problem?   Does this make any sense to you?   Btw how are you telling me I’m not a Jew? Maybe I’m not by religious beliefs, actually most definitely not. However, I’m still more of a semite than you ever will be. There is a good chance my ancestors were Jews, but alhamdulilah we are Muslims now.   Ever heard of the phrase “Yemeni Jews are the most Jewish of Jews”?	NULL
You are obviously trolling. People are trying to give you constructive ideas and be honest. Ranting online about it doesn’t help. Sorry but it is what it is. You’re either born with it or not. Good luck to you though.	NULL
Evidence of Jewishness requires documentation when you make Aliyah. All Jews are entitled to make Aliyah. If they no longer have this documentation then they cannot come. These people would need to legally convert to Judaism and have proper documentation in order to do that.   Other African groups who claimed Jewish decent but with no evidence are in the same position. There are rabbis currently in Uganda making conversions so they can come to Israel.   Those who make the effort are being let in and given citizenship. This isn't an issue.   You're probably not a Jew and you having a Jew somewhere in your lineage doesn't mean much. You have no evidence of being Jewish, no documentation of it, so your point is completely meaningless.   >However, I’m still more of a semite than you ever will be.  Ok? Good for you? Jewish law doesn't care about that? Do you think you're somehow superior to others just for being a semite?   >Ever heard of the phrase “Yemeni Jews are the most Jewish of Jews”?  They're in the middle as far as Jewish ancestry goes. This is a claim, and it isn't even really true. Although, their pronunciation of Hebrew is more like that of Tiberian than any other group. I don't make Jewishness into a competition, and it's even more bizarre for non Jews to act as if they have a stake in it.   Not all Yemenis are Jewish in decent. Pretty much all Yemeni Jews left for Israel.  Anyways, maybe do something about your slavery problem before you go around falsely claiming Jews are a bunch of racists.	NULL

For me, the most feeling that brings me depression is the feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness. These feelings make me feel hopeless then depressed.   The most thing that helped me with that is finding new meaning in my life. What do I really want to be? Why I’m I doing what am I doing? It was not easy for me to answer these questions but I eventually did. I want to be a person who can take care of his family. This is my duty in life. And how can I be that person? By doing what that person will do in his daily life. Like exercising, waking up early, sleeping early, being nice to others, getting work done, or trying to. Each day I do these things, I become closer to the person I want to be or sustain myself as that person. Everything I do every day I relate it to my duty so it doesn’t feel meaningless.  This way of thinking helped me a lot in depression. I’m still not the perfect person I want to be. I still slip here and there, but I’m sure that I will stay on track to fulfill my duty.  I advise you to go to therapy to get a professional help and I hope you good luck with that.	NULL
Look I'm not sure but we Saudis do care about our blood line so i think that's the only reason.

So Ethiopian Jews just need to convert to Judaism to be allowed to come to Israel? Hahahaha what a huge insult to black Jews. I still remember that Ethiopian Jew in uniform getting beat up by two Jewish cops. What a sad reality for black Jews. Can’t even get citizenship, and the few that do, get treated as second class citizens.   I’m indeed most definitely not a Jew, and I thank God for that.   Being a semite doesn’t make me superior either, contrary to many Jews who believe they are God’s chosen people and therefore superior.   There are indeed very few Yemenite Jews between the period where they were carried to Israel and today. Because, thank God, the vast majority converted to Islam over 1400 years ago. Including my ancestors.   Also, where did I say Jews are racist? Why are you putting words in my mouth?

They taught me to be generous,  honest, considerate,  consistent, humble, hard working,  and brave. My father taught me to forgive but not forget. To be strong but not harsh. To always support my family . To give charity to poor people. To help the weak and destroy the unjust.

I'm proud to be telling who ever reads this comment that the suffering your going through isn't going to last, look at as a lesson you will learn. Set your goals and go for them like I did to mine.

I am happy and I hope you're happy too. If not, don't worry,  you'll find your happiness eventually.  I don't know really why I'm writing this much, maybe just to tell there's always hope.  Maybe there's someone who needed to be told that things will be OK. Whatever reason it is, make sure you always put your health and happiness first. Cheers my fellow Saudis .	NULL
It is normal if it’s because of the new changes, the job, stress and anxiety that comes with it.. But, no matter what’s the reason or cause of this feeling.. don’t accept it, don’t let it settle and try to bury it..  Trust me that doesn’t work at all and one day you’ll fall even deeper and you won’t be able to do anything about it   So.. my advice is, don’t let it get worse.. sit down with yourself and think of what’s really causing this? If you can’t figure it out it’s okay too just work on yourself and enjoy the little things.. read or check out videos of people with similar experiences and if thinking about it make you feel worse, don’t.. Cause if you do and you keep doing it, it becomes a bigger problem and a part of your life and thoughts and worsens your mental health.   Remember that your not alone.. There’s always a light and a solution for every person. Your job is to figure it out.   Reach out to a therapist if you feel like you tried everything and it didn’t work.. Don’t take antidepressants or anxiety medicine unless you’re sure it is the problem and don’t start with a strong type of medicine especially if it’s addictive like benzodiazapines. And please don’t try smoking and experiementing with drugs cause that’s just a temporary solution that f*cks up your life for good.   Hope this helped and remember that only you can really fix this in the end.. So stick to god, pray for better days and take it one step at a time.   Don’t forget to enjoy the little things!	NULL
Inshallah you would be able to live in saudi arabia, but I’m not really getting your point, we can’t allow every muslim who wants to  immigrate here to live here that’s just not  feasible	NULL
What does that have to do with it?  The prophet and the caliphs __*expanded* the state__ to include more regions and thereby more people, they weren’t mindlessly bringing millions of people over into Makkah and Madinah from halfway across the globe…	NULL
Sorry I had too much albaik	NULL
I’m not sure who’s dumber, Rahaf or the idiots in that comment section who say that women need to be guided by men so they don’t become like this as if it’s not men paying for that content.	NULL
Israel has only been a country since the late 1900s. Saudi Arabia has been established much longer, and not based on religion as much as the tribal families that lived in the region. There’s multiple countries with majority Muslim population, why do you feel entitled to go to Saudi just because you’re Muslim? That’s like someone saying they can move to Vatican City because they’re Catholic, or to Rome because they’re pagan. It’s also completely normal to learn a countries language when you immigrate there. You have to at least be willing to learn.   I’m confused as to why you think you deserve a Saudi citizenship simply because you’re Muslim. That sounds very entitled and definitely invalidating of the fact that SA is it’s own place with its own culture.	NULL
Are you Muslim?	NULL
والله حاله يبي يعيش بالسعودية عشانها بلد الاسلام و حاطنا منافقين و عنصريين و لا هي عاجبته الحكومة و مع الحوثي و يشبهنا ب اسرائيل و الاباما. ياخي الاستحقاق عند العالم ذا عجيب قسم بالله	NULL
I think people are focusing on your first half of the question more but not your true questioning in becoming a Saudi citizen.	NULL
I don’t get your angle and I’m not trying to have some useless arguments simply putting out a position I see as full of nifaq	NULL
Interesting. And what blood line is stronger than beloved Prophet ﷺ? And what are the fates of his parents and uncle again? So much for blood line.	NULL
Oh my thank you for welcoming me for Hajj!	NULL
Yeah that’s what I thought. I like laws that keep Muslims cute and loving 🥺.  Speaking of useless arguments, your whole position in this post is useless and unattached to the reality.	NULL
I’m not arguing anything like that. Moreso the nationalistic and tbh munafiq naturalization laws seem completely against the deen. And is Saudi under secular or shariah law again?	NULL

That was the final statement keep rereading it tell you get it. You have shown your bigotry and hatred to Saudis and a longer discussion isn’t going to change anything.	NULL
Mostly all of Saudi     Away from big cities   Near Zulfi   Qassim region  Hail region  I have experience star gazing in those areas and it's amazing  You can see the milky way clearly   Enjoy it 😍	NULL
Quick question what is more important deen or nationality?	NULL
Sounds like a scam	NULL
There is not an islamic country that follows shariah 100%, i do believe the citizenship laws should change but saying they are completely against the deen that’s a bit of strech	NULL
Saudi Arabia is pretty much an empty land. In your way driving from one city to another will give you what you are looking for. Or you can go to the edge of the world (in Riyadh). There are groups who organized trips to there for good prices.	NULL
Not trying to be funny, but as you are a american you can buy a 5 year business visa which no other country was granted. Stay as much as you want.	NULL
Between Riyadh and Sharqiyyah is Judah, Judah is fun and has plateaus to stargaze from a higher ekevation. Go to the north of the central region and you find Sudair, Tumair, Majma'aah, and go north far enough and you hit Ha'il, which all good places to stargaze. I saw the 2012 Leonid meteor shower in Sudair.  The south also has high elevation and lots of places to stargaze from. I am not knowledgeable enough on it to recommend an area.    If you dont care about elevation and want something relatively close, and have a reliable 4x4 vehicle, there's the area between Uqayr port in Al Ahsaa and the Salwa area on the border with Qatar. You may need a permission from Border Guard to camp or chill by the seaside.	NULL
😂 love seeing a saudi comment. Brother this is the way people outside think.	NULL
“Taxes going to all sorts of evil” 😶  Dude who inspired u to think like that?? R u paki or Indian, cuz they have some very weird Sheikhs teaching all sorts of nonsense in that part of the world and all in the name of Islam … Plz have a broader mindset about how the world and people (human beings) work…	NULL

What did her Patents say to her fleeing the Country?	NULL
Interesting. So you just renew about every 5 years? What happens say when I die regarding with children or wife?	NULL
All i can say is, i can see your intentions as pure and you want good. The way you see it as a westerner with some what high standard of living and you think its straight forward to gain a citizenship its just not like that. Saudi arabia is the richest muslim country in the world, imagine if they said we are giving away free citizenship to everybody ? What would happen? .   I have lived in saudi and these arguments always comes from people from europe/US they have alot of passion and love but do not know the reality of the situation in saudi. The mentality is just way different for you to even think about gaining citizenship, if you only knew ! Then comparing jews moving to israel to muslims moving to saudi just think about what you wrote carefully.	NULL
They renew theirs 😂	NULL
I hope you get over this terrible state very soon. But I have to say there is misconception that getting a degree and have a decent job is the most important thing in life, but it is not.    Try to do things that are meaningful outside of your job. For women, they are more social and emotional, try to spend more time with family/friends.     And it can also be a sign to get married if you are not yet. Islam emphasize on importance of marriage, it could the thing that is missing.	NULL
With all due respect brother this question doesn't make any sense. How can you expect Saudi to give the right to the 1.5 billion Muslims to get Saudi citizenship? And why should Saudi even give that right? Saudi is not the Muslim caliphate.	NULL
Because what Israel is doing is called an occupation!	NULL
Go to a therapist as soon as you can, trust me I've been there and therapy helped me alot. If you can vent to a friend that's good too.	NULL
Lmao NGL as a South Asian muslim I would never go to Saudi other than for Haj or Umrah. It is important to me only because of the Hejaz. Idk maybe my family should make Haj before start  normalising with Isr@el like their friend UAE. To all my fellow South Asian muslims,they aren't what you think they are(also add extreme racism towards others,idk who their stupid scholars think they are before calling others slaves and second class muslims,when in reality if Saudi doesn't have money they are nothing more than dessert roming bedouins,idk where this pride comes from), they won't do shit for any of us for the islamic cause,their only cause is money. They sold their brothers in Palestine and Yemen,you think they'll care about us and our problems? Just make your religious visit and come back,if you want to make money, Canada is a much better option(they give you PR). If you're making hijra there,I'm sorry my friend you're making a huge mistake(they probably won't even let you stay without a job). You should rather move to Houston or Illinois,their you can practice better by living among muslim communities. PS: You can downvote me to hell,even ban me but by Allah this is the truth and will remain so, banning me won't help.	NULL
Entitled and ungrateful, I think its not better for him to stay where he is, he should be deported to the shithole his parents came out of.	NULL
Oh man you should see the hate DM I’m getting from so called Muslims sad state of affairs   Maybe open up a free clinic In sha Allah in Malaysia or something	NULL
Ah here is the typical racism towards South Asians when you are literally nothing but bedouins who happen to be in control of oil. Anyways don't expect anything other than racism from Arab bruzzers. Lmao,South Asian muslims are stupid like hell, you'll treat them like shit but they'll still think about ummah and all.	NULL
You misunderstand akhi ofc not saying let billions in. But isn’t it sad it’s easier to say become a citizen in Israel as a Muslim than Saudi!?	NULL
Land of the prophet ﷺ could easily due multiple Ummrah and Hajj safety from Dajjal but yeah won’t happen for me likely we’ll see	NULL
This. Someone please tell us stupid South Asian muslims that nobody gives a shit to ummah(Arabs laugh at us). We should work only for our interests like the Arabs only work for their money.Forget this ummah,there is no ummah.	NULL
I see also was an honest question btw again sad how non Arabs are instantly demonized it seems	NULL
I can see it for you iam q pharmacist in Riyadh.	NULL
I’m thinking carefully. Are you saying Jews have more a right to Israel than at least productive skilled Muslims to live in Saudi to get closer to the holy cities and sunnah? What a sad state of affairs	NULL
Finally a truth speaking guy.	NULL
But thankfully my company pays the family fees so it a big relief.It is bit hard reaching till then end of the month especially when you have to pay house rent.But somehow its managable.	NULL

You are not thinking carefully my friend. Do not compare jews to muslims, just not the same thing. Skilled muslims can come to saudi no one is stopping them. Is your thread to attack saudi indirectly or you honestly want to move there ? Having second thoughts.	NULL
Well then, you should be worried too, because the prophet said (pbuh) “avoid envy, envy devour good deeds like fire “   Not much of good deeds left my brother! Those rich guys building mosques, schools and hospitals earning perpetual hasanat while you spreading your envy across Reddit !! Tick toc	NULL
I do want to move In Sha allah but kind of messed up even if skilled and devout and assimilated still likely may stay a second class citizen or I mean not even a citizen	NULL
But they’re not “from” Iraq… they were just there for a while…	NULL
You have a good point! Though I will say I’m not directing any envy to any particular person	NULL
I’m not an expert but I did tried meditation when I was depressed the most and it helped me a bit maybe it can help you too. I used an app called Headspace.  Good luck	NULL
I really love the current laws that prevent people like you from coming and joining in, you are really not the type of person that is needed for a successful future of Saudi Arabia.  For your next post, it would benefit you a lot to do some research on the matter, not only the religious side, but all other sides and perspectives other than religion.  Good luck in the land of the infidels LMAO, I don't really understand why living in un-islamic country makes you view yourself lower than those living in Islamic countries, you really need to fix that about your mentality.	NULL
Alhamdulillah I get you brother. It would be better if you did charity in war torn countries like Syria and Yemen which these people are destroying. Malaysia is a good country, mashaallah.	NULL
Saudi isn't a Muslim homeland. There is no Muslim homeland.  But Jews consider their homeland to be occupied Palestine, thus they assume the right to move there and gain citizenship.	NULL
Why are u mentioning the prophet this n that, don't talk bout him negatively again bruh, what's wrong w u	NULL
So you’re saying Jews have more right to settle and. naturalize in Israel/Palestine than Muslims (I’ll add skilled and educated here) to do the same in Saudi the home of Makkah and Medinah.   Got it	NULL
On the authority of Abu Hamzah Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) - the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) - that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said :  "None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself."

Please don’t do any violence man. You’ll regret it. It’s not always a litteral fight. Just advising them is enough. You make me worried even though you live hours away.

I never directly called anyone that   Simple honest question would you say your loyalty is more for deen or KSA	NULL
Yes, in MOH this happens ALOT. Really shows how ignorant you are. I know two oncologists , both got their degrees from UK but one is pakistani and one is British. The British gets paid 2x just for being British. This type of discrimination is extremely rampant in MOH, not sure about other sectors but i can only guess	NULL
What!? You gaslighting?	NULL
Wait so you live in the USA, aren't you loyal to your country?	NULL
Do Saudis explore career opportunities in Dubai or Abu Dhabi ?	NULL
You can really tell the difference once you experience both, i have lived in saudi as a Pakistani and as a Canadian and the difference is insane especially the way police and MOH treats you. Saudis have no right to talk here , its like a white person telling a POC that their struggle isn’t real 🤷	NULL
Because there is no sense of security, you can get kicked out at any moment. Not their fault buddy	NULL
Not at all, I totally agree with you that Saudi should accept more Muslims, the only Eason they don’t is selfishness and the love of money as luxurious lifestyle. Now that’s settled.   From what I read, you seem to pursue an idealism (a perfect photoshopped image of society) that simply cannot exist because humans are flowed and have tons of problems, you have to accept it. Usually it’s the dillusional people who end up doing horrors in the us so I’m just telling you. Please be kind with everybody and don’t do anything stupid. Let people evolve and change, let god judge. Good night 😴	NULL

That’s what I’m saying. If your parents or caretakers didn’t teach you how to save, then you will most likely spend the majority of your salary on short term leisures.

I noticed a lot of my Saudi colleagues are spending theirs on things already provided at work (meals from fast food restaurants while work is giving them a meal on duty) or coffee from starbucks or whatever then they have a coffee maker in the office etc. All those expenses will eat up a 4k salary very quickly.

Well even in the rashidun caliphate  Omar would urge those who are from the levant or from yemen to go back to their homes and not stay in mecca after hajj   As for the hajj, you can apply for it even if you are in America   The reality is no one cared about emigration to mecca before the oil boom in saudi arabia otherwise you would see saudi arabia as one of the most populated countries in the Islamic world	NULL

Why do you think that being a Muslim means that you have an ideological right to settle in Saudi Arabia?   This land belongs to the Saudi Arabs, the descendants of those who inhabited it before and after Islam. There are those who obtained citizenship later, but their Islam was not the reason. You view Saudi Arabia from the scope of a colonial person with a mentality (all countries in the world should be open to immigrants) and since you happen to be muim now you think of yourself as above other expats well guess what you are not. As a Saudi, I find your mentality absurd and unreasonable. There are no countries in the world founded on the basis that it is a country for a religion other than Pakistan and Israel. As for Saudi Arabia, it is a land for its people, regardless of our religion and while the majority of us are muslims it doesn't mean that we're obligated to naturalise billions of muslims like yourself, we're different even if we share the same religion, we have our Arab identity, our culture, our history and our inheritance for a thousand years and more. I find this notion of why don't you Saudis give all muslims the nationality ridiculous to say the least, no one is asking Italians to naturalise all Christian catholics. Be reasonable.   I hope you now know the reason why we are a country that does not accept these ridiculous suggestions.	NULL

"Less racist in Alabama".  Are you serious?  Imagine you start looking for a Saudi citizenship and the first thing you do is spit on the country law.  If your intentions are based on the idea of doing hijra then Saudi Arabia is not the only muslim country (Daar Al Islam). This is important regarding Allah because it is not the same wanting to live in a Muslim country or specifically requesting living in Saudi Arabia. One is true hijra because you want to fulfill your religion, the other is more than that: you reject the other countries and you either go to Saudi Arabia (or let's say any rich country in middle east) or you stay in the non muslim country you are currently in (which therefore make the intention other than hijra).  If you want to be part of Saudi Arabia and contribute to the society, it's not a good idea to talk dirty about country laws, as your act contradicts your goal.  If you want to be near Madinah and Mekkah, you should know that people that get to these holy cities are chosen by Allah. Just because you are muslim does not entitle you to live there, or even go there. And living in Saudi Arabia is not the only path to go there. One solution, which is the most common one, is asking Allah for having the financial abilities to go there whenever you want.  You know your intentions but you also need to be honest with yourself: Why Saudi Arabia?   You are not alone with this goal. I am sure that among muslims in the world the most wanted citizenship is Saudi citizenship (regardless of why). I am one of them. I am currently working (on the path to get a living permit), it is hard but the path exists and I pray Allah everyday to fulfill the goal to citizenship. And I pray Allah and hope the same for you, but you need to be more respectful towards a country you want to live in.	NULL

I think people are focusing more on first half of your question. My Uncle (dads cousin) he was a Canadian national, he was a great muslim. When he visited kingdom for ummrah he loved the Islamic atmosphere so he asked my dad about the citizenship, well everyone know its near to impossible to get one. So my dad told him to try to get a job here and MashaAllah after 6 months he got a good job in a bank and he is living in Jeddah for like 18 years. So why not you try to get a job, not all jobs in the kingdom are "Saudi-exclusive" jobs (as some people say) and expatriates are given Respect and safety, and honestly for me there is no country in the world like Saudi Arabia. It will be worth trying. Good luck brother.	NULL

I'm an expat but work with Saudi kids.  There are obviously exceptions and some kids are incredibly well mannered and kind, but in general what I see with this generation of Saudi children is a complete lack of manners and compassion for people outside of their family circle, kids that don't even return a good morning, that won't say thank you, or that will even ignore the existence of others.  You don't even need to interact directly with the kids, just look at how loud and rude they are at restaurants and shops, running around and screaming like crazy, throwing products from shelves, and giving dirty looks to strangers. In this country people just brush it off as "kids will be kids" or "kids are a blessing from God so let them be". What these adults are creating is kids without empathy, compassion, or just regular public decency, we sometimes call them "feral kids".  Of course the people commenting here going to say that they were raised well, people don't normally go out admitting that they were raised to be little assholes to strangers, but if we look at how the driving works here, you can see that there is no display of empathy, compassion, or respect for strangers as soon as you get behind the wheel, most parents here forgot about that lesson and people seem to conveniently forget about that detail.

Honestly, I'm Meccan and I don't support this whole mass immigration thing. If i want to visit Sweden or Japan, I want to see the locals not finding them a minority in their own country. Same for us as Arab Saudis from Medina/Mecca. This land is ours, the bond is historical, cultural, not just religious. Many muslims upon leaving Islam will lose their religious bond to Mecca and Medina but we will never lose the bond because it is far more stronger than that. I've known an Iranian muslim who used to say Mecca should be separated from Saudi Arabia and pretty much parroting the same nonsense as the OP after four years he left Islam and became one of those angry exmuslims he then again expressed his thought on Mecca but this time saying that it should be bombed, no exmuslim Saudi Arab would say that. What many muslims fail to understand is that this land belonga to its inhabitants. Being a muslim is not justification to go around claiming that you own this place.	NULL

That's not the problem, the thing is that the Zionist ideology views Judaism as an ethno-religion and Israel is the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. Everybody who has Jewish ancestry or his mother is Jewish can immigrate to Israel and get Israeli citizenship, the thing is everyone who converts to Judaism (which is a very arduous process unlike us in Islam) can also immigrate to Israel and get Israeli citizenship. Important to note Jewish people, who immigrate get tax deductions and get a sweet deal when immigrating. Back to the original post, I think in Saudi it shouldn't bar any Muslim from coming to Mecca or Medina, even if it has opposing foreign policy in regards to the country.	NULL
It's simple! The crooked, gangster family of Al-Saud/AlSalool think and treat this land as if it's their very own, and now they have ignited and are feeding off of the racism they ignited in the Saudis to the point of where some Saudis say to other Saudis in a racial remark "WE ARE THE ORIGINAL SAUDIS! WE ARE TRULY, TRULY SAUDIS TO THE CORE!!", forgetting that it is truly only the name of a gangster, dictator family that rules with the might of steel and fire, and any opposer is chopped up and thrown into acid.  AlSaud/AlSalool family feeds off of dividing and conquering the people like this. They don't give a shit about religion, they only care about their thrones, really. They'll lick the boots of the US, Israel, and even the Devil if it means increasing the security and to retain their thrones even by 0.0000001%.

There are two points that I feel are relevant, would omar tell people from non Muslim lands such as Rome or persia to return after hajj? What you are describing seems some what similar to saudi telling saudi citizens not to return to Riyadh or jeddah after hajj and not stay in Mecca, it doesn't sound the same as telling some one to return to Iran or the USA. Secondly where do you think a migrant would be better off economicly in order: saudi, uae, UK or usa?  Also I think it is true that you would get more migration ofter the oil boom, some just for money but I expect some would be for religious reasons but previously they wouldn't have migrated because of the difficulties involved. The same as it wouldn't surprise me if someone didn't want to migrate to libya, yemen or lebanon right now because of the economic and security situation in those countries. But I admit I don't know how the situation was in saudi pre oil boom compared to the other countries I mentioned.	NULL

I, and many people, have opposed the corruption and poverty back in King Abdullah's "GOLDEN" days. (Golden compared to the shitshow we're in right now) Why or how would you know more?	NULL
Hello Ghada, first and foremost you must recognize that you have strength, the strength to face this truth, and also the strength to seek help. This is a rare treat on it's own. So, kudos to you for that.   Second, you might be feeling depressed, and it happens for no reason. Like there's something missing, incomplete and unsolved. Along with seeing things in a negative light, feeling the pressure of disappointing others, uncertainty and many other things that trigger you or make you feel lost.   There are amazing therapists out there that will help you to help yourself. They will guide you further in and seek the answer and source to this depression. Therapists will not give you medications at all, they are not authorized to do that. Psychologist also can't give medication, only psychiatrist (دكتور نفسي) who can and might give you medications which I believe in this stage is way too early.   I know couple of good therapist, and I know one that's online who's really great. Reply or DM me with which city you live in, and I'll do my best to get you someone who'll be very helpful to you.   And like the first comment has declared, reddit is not a good place to get advices on mental health, but still, the step you took to seek help is admirable.	NULL

I personally knew expatriates that spent almost their entire lives in Saudi Arabia, they passed away and got buried here. All in all they lived a great life without having a Saudi citizenship. Their great-grandchildren are now being born here in Saudi Arabia, some of whom are Saudi citizens (due to being born to Saudi fathers).  There are a lot of countries — some even developed ones — that do not grant citizenship that easy.	NULL
That’s really scary	NULL
I don't think anyone has a problem with telling people to go back home after hajj, millions of people come for hajj and if they all just stayed it would ruin saudi. So I feel this athar is possibly being used wrong, a more accurate  one would be if you could find omar telling a Yemeni that came to madina outside of hajj  that he can't stay. Also from what I can tell the athar is talking about people from Muslim lands so it doesn't seem right to use it to talk about people from non Muslim lands. Also the athar seems to be talking about people from one state  so they are all under the same ruler, its not like some one trying to move from Syria because they don't want to live under bashar Al asad.   Basically nothing about the athar seems to have anything to do with the issue being discussed except on the most simplistic level.   In the end I don't understand the issue, some Saudis complain about people asking for handouts or that they would be a burden etc. I don't know if I am missing something or they are being disingenuous, saudi and any other Muslim nation doesn't need to give them handouts, they could just open up citizenship for muslims  with stable income, a fixed amount of savings, beneficial skills, high education, who have been vetted to make sure you aren't letting in extremists  and so on.   If the issue is a matter of economics and security then there are clear ways to fix that, but if its just simply not wanting people who are not saudi by ethnicity  to live in saudi then they can be upfront about that and not muddy the waters. If that's the case then Allah knows best if its ok to block Muslims from living in Muslim countries because of ethnicity, I haven't seen any scholar talk on the matter so I won't attack anyone for having that view but if it turns out it was oppression then I can collect in the afterlife insha Allah.

There is a program now to give citizenship to remarkable people    I think personally my issue with the post is, why single out saudi arabia, why would you demand saudi arabia to give muslims citizenship why not turkey for example, or why not the countries that those emmigrants originated from, why must saudi arabia aoldly bare the burden of muslims.   I think what you mentioned regarding the complaints originated from a rhetoric that has recently emerged from arab and muslim countries that the oil in saudi arabia should go to all Muslims  Or that the revenue from hajj should go to all Muslims.    Which is disingenuous of you consider that in 1919 when tha famine hit saudi arabia no government from those Islamic countries helped them. Or when king abdulaziz called on a Islamic congress to discuss the cost of renovating the holy mosque in mecca. They convened and argued about who should be in charge of the hajj and left without providing financial aid to renovate the holy mosque   And when we were blessed with the oil and invested hundreds of billions of dollars in mecca  which led to the fact thay the hajj  was generating revenue. Some people from neighbouring countries started to claim that it was OUR money not only for saudi arabia	NULL

That is not true from two points, 1- none of these same muslims will dare to claim that they have a right to live in Turkey, Albania, Iran, Egypt, or any other muslim majority country just because they're muslim. This entitled act is shown only infront of Saudis.   2- The vast majority of Saudis are muslims yet none of us think that (it is our RIGHT) to live an Islamic countries and gain their citizenship or else they're evil non muslims pretending to be muslims as fcade (what is always said about us). To the contrary we know very well that their countries belong to their citizens regardless of their faith.	NULL

Well guess what, you're not special person for being muslim. You're actually the tribalist/racist here for implying that being a muslim is the most important thing.   The best most respected community in Saudi Arabia are Filipinos. They're not muslims, they're hard workers, respect the law/the local culture/people. Whilst those who always brag about their Islam are the top 5 criminal nationalities so again being muslim is not an expertise. Keep your religion to yourself.  I honestly believe that someone like you who is an Islamist anti-Saudi propaganda parrot is not needed here.	NULL

I'll put a disclaimer first, I haven't checked with a scholar what the actual Islamic ruling is, but I lean towards it being at least good if not a duty for every Muslim country to assist Muslims who live in the west with no citizenship in any Muslim country to move to get a citizenship in some Muslim country. Yes I'm including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi  etc. As for the handouts, aside from free heath heathcare what is there? And you could always fix this by limiting immigration to people with a stable income, savings, education and so on.   If your issue is people taking advantage of saudi then there are things that can be done to fix that, if your issue is you don't want non Saudis living in saudi then be upfront about it.  And for your second point, I could understand a Shia saudi thinking that Iran should take him in and I could understand a sunni Iranian thinking that sunni nations should take him in and I could understand a salafi from a non salafi country thinking saudi should take him in.

"There is a program now to give citizenship to remarkable people"  Alhamdulillah, sounds like a step in the right direction.   "I think personally my issue with the post is, why single out saudi arabia, why would you demand saudi arabia to give muslims citizenship why not turkey for example, or why not the countries that those emmigrants originated from, why must saudi arabia aoldly bare the burden of muslims. "  I agree that if saudi has a duty to take in muslims then why shouldn't the other Muslim countries. But I do think that it is understandable that if someone is leaving a western country for Islamic reasons then it makes sense that their top country  to migrate to would be saudi due to Mecca and madina and because saudi is the closest countries to an ideal Islamic system I think.  "I think what you mentioned regarding the complaints originated from a rhetoric that has recently emerged from arab and muslim countries that the oil in saudi arabia should go to all Muslims Or that the revenue from hajj should go to all Muslims."  If all muslims have some right over saudi oil then it would make sense that all muslims have some right over Qatari gass and Egyptian money from the sueze canal. And I don't see why all muslims should have a special right over hajj revenues, but I do see the argument people make about putting laws in place so hajj doesn't become too expensive but maybe those laws are already in place.   "Which is disingenuous of you consider that in 1919 when tha famine hit saudi arabia no government from those Islamic countries helped them. Or when king abdulaziz called on a Islamic congress to discuss the cost of renovating the holy mosque in mecca.

Anyone calling you abed, that's on them. I don't doubt that you got lots of racist dms. It is well known that a portion of Saudis have a vile attitude when it comes to race.

Completely agree, I am opposed to granting citizenships because Saudi is a rentier state, our income doesn’t come from taxes (it does now but only a small portion of it) we don’t have income tax, so theoretically a lot of people would abuse the system and get free healthcare and schooling while not providing the country with anything	NULL
The sys fully control Twitter 🪰 nothing is there by luck or just because fools are trending it 👀	NULL
Personally I hope in the future Islamic countries in general come up with realistic ways to gain citizenship. I'm of the opinion that it atheist good if not a duty for them to assist muslims in non Muslim lands to move to an Islamic country. One way for saudi would be to only accept people with a specific level of income, savings, education, skills etc. They could also decrease the social benefits for new citizens for a generation or two to make sure its not people coming in to take advantage.	NULL
Ahhh! So *definitely* white then 😆😉	NULL
Saudi already has a “green card” system, you get permanent residence and you get treated like a citizen, you just have to meet the requirements which in my opinion need to be hard to get benefits in a rentier state	NULL
How does that work with regards to offspring	NULL
They can live with him in Saudi without having a sponsor until he passes away, but one of the requirements is having “financial solvency” (basically rich) if he passes away I’m sure his kids could get ones for them selves	NULL
Yea I think that's where I would disagree with the current system, I feel that it should get to a point where it passes on to children	NULL
It’s a step up, I would love seeing muslims with great knowledge in their fields to live in saudi and get citizenships, but we don’t need average doctors and engineers, they would be a burden on our GDP even if they share the same faith with me	NULL
Rip	NULL
The only solution I can think of for that is making new citizens have to pay tax, but that would probably make people hate saudi more because the would say its second class citizens	NULL

My experience was quite a while back but I remember that the universities in the central region (aka Najd) had a unified, centralized platform where you can apply to multiple institutions. Otherwise, it is more typical to find each university with its own website.  Each university has its own enrollment dates and you can usually find a website that makes lists for those dates.   Check each uni’s system. Some might accept you in the program and require you to finish preparatory year, but the majority would accept you for their prep year and you get to compete on seats according to your performance. Having decent English is very helpful. Acquiring IELTS or TOEFL would help reduce the load if you could apply for the English curriculum exemption.	NULL

Salaam. I'm planning to do Umrah Insh'Allah from Canada and I have a layover in Cairo for 8.5 hours. I am fully vaccinated with a third booster. Of course, I will be getting a PCR test done as well approx. 36 hours before my departure. I was thinking of leaving the Cairo airport to check out Pyramids but concerned about whether I would need to get PCR test again to be able to fly to Jeddah after and not having to quarantine. Can I confirm that you actually had to get PCR again just because you had a layover in Cairo even though you were fully vaccinated and your PCR was still within the 72 hour window to your flight to Jeddah from Cairo? Thanks	NULL
No offence to women but the ones i see in most accidents are women driving	NULL
Thanks for the detailed breakdown. Just curious, during your layover in Dubai, did you ever leave the airport?

 In addition to any visa and quarantine requirements as applicable to you and your country of residence, you need to register on the Muqeem platform up to 72 hours before arrival in the Kingdom. Upon arrival in the Kingdom it’s mandatory to download the Tawakalna app within 8 hours. You should then be able to book a slot for Umrah through the app. You could also try the Eatmarna app for booking an Umrah slot.  Slots are normally made available a week in advance and if you would like to go during peak times (e.g. Thurs night/Friday) try and book a slot timeously as these slots tend to fill up quickly. May you have an accepted Umrah and remember us in your duas.	NULL

Honestly just ignore them, they are ignorant and have no clue how things actually work, if a man saw his wife cheating then he needs witnesses that can confirm his statements, or record it, but if he doesn’t have any proof of it then he is the one getting punished by law, so the sensible thing to do is break it off with the wife and she will get her punishment from allah, but if he does have witnesses and actual proof she will get punished by the law and allah, and vise versa with females. Not everything has to be fair rn, everyone will get their share of punishment that they deserve in jahanam, maybe i didnt get my punishment by law now, because its not perfect but i will get it later from allah, sadly people only think about this life and not the one after.

That's not how it works. You're making it seem as if Islam is subjective and open to interpretation.  It's not.

Anyone who goes against this objective interpretation is either an innovator, or if his innovation is extreme, a kafir.	NULL
This is the best and most helpful answer. We came on a tourist visa, filled in the muqeem, downloaded tawakkalna (it won't work until you get to Saudi) and then also got the eatmarna app. I highly recommend getting the eatmarna app, it was very was to use. We never booked through tawakkalna. There are some restrictions, Rawdah at Masjid Nabawi in Medina can only be visited once every 30 days (they don't tell you this before you book). Umrah can technically only be booked once every 10 days, but sometimes there is some glitch and people qere able to go in a shorter time period (pr maybe just a Gift). But you are able to pray at Makkah any time you want by booking through the app. Always carry your passport and visa with you, but they never checked us.	NULL
Depends on your exposure I guess.  I’ve met way more presumably straight Filipino men and they’re actually pretty damn cool.

I worked with a lot of Filipino and for sure there are a lot of them are gays I can tell it's like 25% of them are gay.

That's what they are trying to do.  Unlike straight guys they won't try to get your attention and you won't notice if they exist  But let me tell you something may shockyou.

OMG, I'm from a different Arabic country ( Libya ) and I've noticed the same as you , I've always wondered why,  here in Libya most of the Filipino I've met are feminine, I swear to god I'm not exaggerating at all, I always said to myself, maybe it's just cultural differences, but I've met Filipino who are very straight.  Another reason is that the  vast majority of Filipino who came in our country start working as nurses in the hospitals( is it the same in saudi arabia ? ), which is a female predominant job, and one of the careers that many gays choose to pursue worldwide " even the Arabs ". One of the stereotypes about men who work as a nurse is being feminine, which is relatively true!    not all of them though.  &#x200B;  صاحب المنشور ماقال حاجة عنصرية، هو فقط يسأل لماذا تتواجد هذه الظاهرة ! ووضح وجهة نظره، ابتعدوا عن المثاليات، كل شيء قابل للنقاش والراجل وضح انه لايقصد العنصرية ولا يعمم	women

For iPhone users only. Let’s say you forgot to disable the location for the app like you usually do. Later on you find your battery is draining faster than usual and you remember that you didn’t disable the location for the app. Run this shortcut (with open short cut and run of or save it to Home Screen next to Tawakkalna or automate it) and it will directly to the location settings of the app instead of the usual way of going to settings/privacy/location/Tawakkalna/ all that is remaking is to choose “never” and done.

Actually similar thing happened to me but with Zain. When I purchased the 5g router which came with a free unlimited one month internet. I used it for a month and stopped. They black listed me cuz I didn't renew the contract. I didnt even know that but when I wanted to close the line, they said I was black listed for not paying the contract.   Told them I didn't even renew to begin with. In the end they unblock me.   My best tip is he goes to another branch and ask another employee.  Just as they black listed him, they can remove him from the black list.	NULL

This is a basic question.   Winter and summer everywhere is well known.   In the North Hemisphere where most people live which include Asia, North America Europe winter is 21 December to 21 March.  In the South Hemisphere it would be the opposite as it would be Summer during the same period.  .	NULL
Summer in the North Hemisphere starts in 20 June which is called Summer solstice when the Sun is highest in the sky. This is until autumn (Fall if you are American) which is 22 September	NULL
As for areas in Saudi the is the special climate during winter features.  In North, Center and East it normally is coldest in late December to Mid February.  This would include Arar, Turaif, Skaka, Tabuk in the North where they have the coldest weather then followed by Centeral Saudi Hail, Qasim, Riyadh and close to this is East Coast Dammam and Alkhobar and surrounding cities.   Jeddah is peculiar as it rarely becomes to cold only around 18 or lowest around 15 and for possibly a day.	NULL

I'm not sure what this does.

governments don't fear their populations, governments respect and protect their populations.  the Tawakkalna app is a good app overall, you have your ID and driving license automatically in it, removing the need for wallets, it helps track where you are if you were in the case of an emergency, and as an idea, it is great.  but since the technology hasn't advanced as much as this Tawakalna app needs, this means that to use it properly with all of its functions, your battery will be depleted so quick you can't even get to enjoy your phone, so while the idea is great, the implementation is lackluster.  maybe we could wait a few years for a technology that would achieve every pro in the tawakalna app without any cons, or just wait until the covid pandemic is over and just delete the app.	NULL

I have heard of dozens of examples where being tracked actually helped the person, whether it was on a medical emergency, when in a dangerous situation, calling the police, and so on and so forth.  so unless the person is a criminal, I cant think of a reason when someone doesn't want to be tracked for "non-battery related" reasons.

I'd say I'm pretty good at dealing with the heat, here are some of my tips: * Fill a jug up with water, put it in the fridge and use that water to shower or really whenever you feel hot. * Try using a fan instead of an AC * Buy sprayer thingy that sprays liquid, I don't know how to explain it, like a windex bottle lol. Fill it up with water and spray yourself whenever you feel hot, extra points if you leave the water in the fridge. * Buy long shorts so that you can cool off while staying halal (this is mainly works for guys, as for girls I guess maybe this works at home) * Cover excess windows that do nothing but make you sweat more	NULL

Best suggestion I can give (Unfortunately not everyone is comfortable doing this) is getting a very short trim and going bald for the summer.

Whether you leave to see the pyramids or not, you will be required to get 2 pcr tests and do a 5 day quarantine. Saudi has Egypt as a red zone so if you're flying through there they require the added quarantine and pcr test. And it doesn't matter that you have your vaccine/booster up to date.  To be able to get the PCR test you would need to make an appointment through the "hunger station" app and they'll come to your hotel and do the test.  I would honestly try to see if you can switch flights to see if you can fly into a different country for a layover or just fly into Medina or Jeddah as a direct flight. Because when they make you quarantine you have to be quarantined.    Check this website for updates on Saudi Covid travel rules/guidelines for countries.  https://www.saudia.com/before-flying/travel-information/travel-requirements-by-international-stations  Once you get there assume you will be on your own. No one at MOH or tawakkalna hot line are any help.  Please let me know if you have any other questions. I'd be more than happy to help.	NULL

The fatwas I mentioned are typically different takes on the same verse. The verse states that non muslims should not get near this holy mosque. The ambiguous part is “get near”. Some went to say that was relative to migration and settling, while passing by is okay. Others included passing, and referred to get near as in physically. They take examples from how the prophet behaved back then, like stopping non muslim traders outside of Makkah and let whoever wanted their goods to go to them instead.   Deciding on variation you think is right is your duty to accomplish. But to absolutely throw everything out the window because it’s “based” is foolish and ridiculous	NULL

Wrong again. First, the Quran did only mention the holy mosque, but it has used it before to refer to the region rather than the exact location of the mosque. If you look up the verse of ascension, you’ll find the Quran says that the prophet was sent from “the holy mosque to the Aqsa mosque (in Jerusalem)”. The prophet wasn’t exactly in the holy mosque when he left for Jerusalem, so it refers to the region. The region is referred to in Arabic as “Al Haram (Almakki)” (aka The Bounds (of Makkah)). Those bounds are defined in hadeeth and include the majority of current day Makkah, but not all.   Secondly, when it comes to Medina you’re not wrong. I was not aware of it until now. Supposedly, Medina is not banned for non Muslims. It shares some aspects of the holy lands like the banning of hunt and woodcutting, but in Islam is open to non Muslims. As a matter of fact, the prophet pbuh died while his shield was mortgaged to a Jew. So, I don’t have enough understanding of the current ban from Medina tbh to form an opinion yet.	NULL
To be honest it depends on the person and the vibe she gives off, for example if she seems to be friendly small talk is ok. A lot of the women here unconsciously set boundaries with the opposite sex so if you're great at reading the atmosphere you're good to go.

First, i will say once you have children you don't want to raise them in environment where disbelief and sin is rampant - if you want to raise your children on the faith that's not the environment for it. Second, even before you have kids, you should strive always for what's good , not necessarily what's easy or hard, and attempt to earn allah's approval in everything you do - and you don't necessarily want to be tested on your faith. If living in America allows you to earn a much better income than overseas and with that income you can support your family and donate much of it to starving muslims overseas, then there's good in that (but if it's merely to hoard wealth or waste it on luxuries then that's not the right path to take). If you can also at the same time be a good role model as what islam looks like, for example by helping your neighbors (smile, greet them, shovel their driveway, give them gifts, invite them over for dinners) and spread dawah to people who are receptive of it then there's even greater good in that.  So living in a country like America can be better or it can be worse for you, it can bring you closer to Allah or further - depending on your actions. For most unfortunately it is worse for them.  قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّىٰهَا  وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّىٰهَا	NULL

First of all welcome to Saudi and I hope you’ll have a great time here, as for the culture it isn’t as closed and complex as it used to be in the past years. The people here are very friendly and generous. Apart from that I have three things to you to remember  1- always be nice ( and I’m sure you are) 2- don’t compliment the appearance of the females  3- 99.99% of the people will understand that you are from a different culture if you made a mistake	NULL

I'm an expat in Riyadh.  I agree with the comments that say you should judge the 'vibe' of the person. It is ok to speak to a woman if you need to (e.g. if they left their card in an ATM). I would avoid small talk if you see a woman in a supermarket etc. It just puts them in a slightly uncomfortable position. Of course if they initiate it that's fine.  I know some Saudi women who wear a veil in front of Saudi men but not in front of me (a Western man).   In the workplace most of my female colleagues are very friendly. I avoid asking if they are married or about their family circumstances. Other than that I'm fairly open once I get to know them (I've asked if they have drank alcohol, ate pork etc - many have on foreign trips).	NULL

SA is a very diverse country in relation to culture and people’s thoughts and behavior. Some people are outgoing more than the others. That’s why you should know which person like to give and take with you from the initial encounter, you will know it. Generally, friendly smiles are okay, just don’t be creepy.

Lmao of course you can smile, small talk is fine, just be aware of social cues, if you feel like she doesn’t want a small talk then its not really necessary.

KSA has significantly changed. It is not as conservative and gender segregated as it used to be. In fact, many coffee shops and restaurants no longer have a segregation between "singles" (males) and "families" (females or families). That being said, KSA is not as "open" as Western culture.  It's good that your conscious and don't want to offend or intrude on anyone. In my company, many Saudi males and females work together, chat about life, and have lunch together, whether in groups or one-on-one. But of course every institution is different and also every person is different (a female friend of mine who works in a different place which has a different environment) . My advice would be for you to initially be formal, then feel the vibe and atmosphere of the place you are in and the people you are dealing with, and become chill as the place you are in.	NULL

I agree with most of what was said. It depends on the personality of your colleague. For example, we used to have a female employee who I can have a good conversation like food cravings (coz she's pregnant that time), culture differences, some photo editing, etc.. On the other hand, we currently have two accountants who are a bit shy and rarely speaks to me. Probably if they need something work related so I never initiated any personal conversation to them.

I read the transcript. I don't agree with anything he said about America being great but everything he said about Saudi Arabia is true.   The best king Saudi Arabia had imo was King Khalid but his reign was also the shortest 🥺. He increased government worker's salary, he improved healthcare and education in Saudi Arabia and so much more. Life of citizens and foreign workers living in Saudi Arabia greatly improved during his reign (no tax, no dependent fee back then). We may not have cinemas or concerts back then but at least living was more comfortable and affordable. His reign was called Saudi Golden Era or the Era of goodness. May God Bless Him 🥺	NULL

I don't know, but have you looked at [this](https://www.my.gov.sa/wps/portal/snp/servicesDirectory/servicedetails/9505)? It doesn't say anything about Islam. Maybe just try it and if someone asks, tell them you converted by yourself and you don't have official confirmation yet.	NULL

I work daily with saudi woman and i treat them like i treat my sisters, and they do the same with me. So there's no issues there.  But im talking about approaching strangers, potential friends or partners. It just often seems like I'm looked at as a creep even when im standing in line next to them. Soemtimes it feels like they will actually bite.	NULL
Send me a PM, maybe I can help	NULL
I think they have the bus service running that replaced the earlier 2sar coaster services.  I see a lot of buses packed with people.  Next time I see one I'll take pictures and put it up here like insta.  Pics or it didn't happen!	NULL
I also went to international school about 12 years ago, I remember the classes were segregated between genders, but all women including boys from kindergarten to grade three can interact with each other outside of class since their classes are close to each other and don't need complete separation, but once the boys get older (grade 4+), they are moved to a completely different side of the school where you cannot interact with the other gender.  &#x200B;  but I am talking about American schools, I hear they run American tests (SAT), European tests (AP tests and classes), their curriculum is 100% English, they have after school activities like clubs and whatnot, but they are expensive AF, I hear 1 year for a kindergarten in 70K riyals.	NULL
>joke with them, etc. and talk about anything as long as it is not religious or political.  Same with the girls. Just no physical contact or lude jokes and you're good. Sometimes girls would be more friendly with a foreigner because it won't "look suspicious" as if it was a saudi.	NULL
Oh, now I understand. Yup, they are segregated as well. Holy cow! 70k?! I’d rather buy a decent car with that 😂.	NULL

LMAO  when you talk about approaching strangers, do you mean you are planning to get married this way (dating)? or is it just small talk to strangers?  >!the advice I'm about to give you is from a fellow introvert to another, so i still haven't figured out the secret to communication lol!<  for small talk with complete strangers, then it is ok, as long as you have something to say like if she forgot her wallet, forgot her order, forgot something or anything that would come out as natural when talking rather than creepy.  if you are planning to get married not the traditional way, then you could join clubs or places where they have the same interests as you, you know, social clubs, whether it was a stand-up comedy, board games, anime conventions, or coffee culture, or anything else.  remember tho, you are not there to date, you are there to meet good people and potential friends, make your conversation natural, you are trying to find the "good people", then you will try to raise your relationship with those "good people" to "friends", then if you ever felt a particular feeling toward someone, then you might ask them as a friend to hangout more, ask them about what they find in a future husband, and gradually yet steadily, try to convey you are interested in them.  though i myself prefer the traditional way since there are very little chances of doing something "haram" intentionally or not, but if that is what you prefer, then go ahead.  just remember society doesn't look highly towards "dates" among non-married/non-engaged, and in the traditional way, you would most likely get to spend 3months-12months engaged, meaning you could see the other's true self and personality.  anyway, good luck, and if anyone has any comments on anything i said, please go ahead and say it, I'm happy to know where i am wrong.	NULL

I will take the chance to vent what I always have thought: If driving in Riyadh followed the rules of civilised driving, the quality of life would improve. This means less stress for all passengers, less traffic accidents (big and small) and orderly transit.  Here the speeding driver never do the math, if you increase speed 10 to 20% , you are not going to save time in the same proportion, you will double the risk for everbody (yes!! For you too), if you departed late you will not arrive on time by speeding (but you may arrive early to the afterlife, may be even with some company too, isn't it wonderful?!)  For those Fast & Furious, remember, death will be your best option, killing others and go to jail or being paralyzed from the neck down is also a feasable option. Don't try to prove it, you won't have a second chance.	NULL

We quarantined at our hotel room in Jeddah.   We were actually unaware of having to quarantine so, we stayed in our room trying to figure out what was going on and didn't know there were government facilities where we had to quarantine.  If you are able to wait to register on your app, do so. My app went from green to purple (immune to institutional quarantine) in 2 hours. Honestly, if we know that was going to happen we would have waited until we got to Medina to register on the app.   The people only care that your app is green and don't make you scan in. So I suggest that you take a picture of your app when it's green and then try to make umrah with that if you're unable to get your app to work. Because even if you do your pcr tests and quarantine there is no guarantee that the app will update in real time.  I recommend that you carry around your vaccine cards with you. A lot of people are running into this issue of the app not working and depending on the guard at the Haram you might be able to talk to them and explain the situation and still be able to do umrah.	NULL
I fully agree! Plus I think most people actually want to drive properly. Just the amount of aggressive idiots is too high/ they seem to not care much.  I can even live with people not concentrating or even checking insta in traffic jam. Just being an idiot on purpose sucks.	NULL

General rule of thumb: don’t engage unless they do.   1- in a public place with a none employee, it’s the general rule.   2- in public with an employee, depends on how they interact with you, are they smiling and seem to be open ? Yeah go ahead.  3- work place: kinda depends. Even though I am a college student, I’ve participated in a startup accelerator (not my company) and my mother is a business woman (owns a restaurant in Jeddah) in general it’s really normal to have small talk and opening conversations from your side. But if they look like they are modestly dressed + they are reserved, go to the general rule. But it’s really normal now in the work space to talk with your female colleagues even if it’s not work related.   At least that is my impression and what I’ve experienced.	NULL

\- You need to be vaccinated, and have at least 2 shots. Vaccine rules for Hajj 2022 hasn't been released yet  \- How the lottery works is that you register your interest along with a pool of other people. Then a random person is picked by an algorithm until all the spots are filled. You have to then go to the website and finish your application/pay within a set period of time.  \- As a saudi citizen, your qualified for local hajj, which is handled differently that hajj from outside the kingdom. You would use the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah website. They will make their portal available when its time to register for hajj. Honestly, its best to follow their arabic twitter account to keep up to date.  \- Having an expired ID can ruin your chance of being able to sign up, depending on the filtering process they set that year. You can get your ID renewed, just contact the saudi consulate in your country.	NULL

No. Definitely not. Why would a girl get harassed for not wearing a hijab? That used to happen many years ago. Not anymore thankfully.   When you asked would it get attention, of course it would.

In general, smiles and talks are acceptable. Just use your common sense (no politics, religion, sensitive or sexual talks and jokes).  Other than that it depends on the person, some females are not comfortable talking and engaging with stranger mens and you have to evaluate their reaction and engagement with you and decided whether to stop or continue. However, because you are not Arab, most people will take that into consideration and won’t judge you for doing something unacceptable in the Saudi culture, so don’t worry. Also again because it depends on the person you are engaging with, some women do shake hands.	NULL

Another time in khobar at 4 am, my light turned green and a guy who was going fast behind me  thought it was a good idea to drift on this turn. While this sedan is drifting on this turn going left, an FJ cruiser was trying to make the light that intersects going minimum 160 kph. Huge crash,all involved died.  Never let your temper get to you driving here.	NULL

Many women have artificial blonde hair in Riyadh, but if your hair is naturally blonde you might get some curious looks, although not many will care since alot of Syrians live in Riyadh and alot of Syrians are blonde.

I'm an egyptian man with dark hair though so I can't tell you with accuracy.	NULL

Well that's not a wise thing to do Whenever you encounter someone on the road just wave to him and let him by   I actually heard a couple of stories that occurred in  3rd ring road,makkah One of em was told to me by an officer about a guy who cut someone off the road so the other guy went furious about it and followed him to his neighborhood(3km maybe or more) and shot him with a gun he has in his car.  May Allah have mercy on the one who died	NULL
Definitely Al-Hofuf, it might be smaller but got way more places to visit and to experience the culture here in Saudi Arabia and it is also closer to border.   Dammam is cool but personally I think it is over-rated, nothing happens there unless you want to go to Bharain	NULL

Riyadh and Jeddah have location and diversity on their side. Riyadh being a capitol and a central point in the kingdom, while Jeddah being the economic and business city near Makkah and Hijaz. They have somewhat of a touristic reputation with Riyadh representing the Arab identity, and Jeddah the melting pot of ethnic diversity.   Also, population wise, they are the bigger cities of the kingdom. Larger consumer base = more money	NULL

Bad idea, and it proved so in the US. The delivery company will lower payouts if they noticed the drivers are getting lots of tips. if you got cash on hands, that's great, if not, you dont have to tip. I'm also agaisnt the whole American tipping culture. It shouldn't be a thing here. They have salaries, they are getting payed for the service they provie	NULL
Yes malls are declining in the US and will eventually decline in Saudi. But this doesn’t have to be the end of the mall. They need to reinvent themselves into places for entertainment rather than shopping.    https://youtu.be/C_JiP-j2FwM	NULL

I doubt it, a lot of people drive across to bahrain to go to shopping malls that have the same shops as Saudi, it is more about as others have said 'the experience'. I know lots of people who go to malls here to either window shop, go to coffee shops, cinema or restaurants.

I've been in a few fender bender accidents in 2 years by not allowing being cut off by reckless drivers. Not found guilty once. Insurance is doing their job. I have found pure bliss by seeing people writhe from anger after driving so shit that they got themselves in an avoidable accident.     If you're not in a hurry, let them bump into you. Claim insurance. Waste 1-2 hours of their time.       For Riyadh, I suggest a dash cam. I loathe driving there. Khobar is a exponentially better experience, as well as Jubail.	NULL

i’ve ridden in a crown vic before and I noticed why every single person who drives one is reckless, they’re literally boats, and handle like boats on water, yes, barely any brakes... it would take you forever to stop let alone get back up to speed so the drivers just don’t use their brakes they try get by without slowing down.

you’re also wasting your time and destroying your car even if you replace the parts your car is losing value	NULL
I assure you i lived in lots of saudi provinces. If your home has no cash change in it, it's considered weird by the majority of folks.   Having the tipping option in the app is a bad idea, if the establishment noticed or knew the employees/drivers are getting tipped with each delivery/service, they will lower the payouts/salaries. It's as simple as that.   If you really want to tip delivery drivers, do the effort of carrying some change.	NULL
Couldn't agree more.   If i may add, tipping incentivizes businesses to give less salaries.   If the business cannot afford to pay it's employees it shouldn't rely on customers to do so. The business shouldn't exist if it's not able to keep up with its costs.	NULL

I am from Alkhobar which is part of the metropolitan area of the three joined cities the others being Dammam and Dhahran.  Alhasa which is the district name has many small villages and two cities Hafouf which is the capital and Mubaraz. They are relatively large and there are historical sites dating way back as it was a bastion of the Ottoman rulers during the Ottoman rule there hundreds of years ago. You can get a tourist guide to arrange for sight seeing.   Anyway the other points you could easily look up online.  Distance is something you should consider as it will take 4 hours to get to Doha from Dammam if you take the coastal road (95) not selected on Google maps for some reason...  Alhasa is slightly less at around 3 hours.  However consider,  boarder control whichl takes around half an hour or so depending on the number of people going through.   It may be that during the games lots of Saudi sports fans will be doing the same and that could easily rack up the load on boarder formalities taking a couple if hours maybe more to go through.  Similarities between getting from Alkhobar to Bahrain border on normal days it takes 30 to 25 minutes and you are through. On a weekend it may be 40 to an hour. On holidays it may be up to two hours.  Why not eliminate boarder control element search in North Qatar or the west...  If I was so keen I would simply get a tent rental with all the conveniences. Lots of locals and Saudis do this but you have to be used to camping life for an extended period and depending on the quality it may be a bit pricey.  Look at this option +974 3364 9458 https://maps.app.goo.gl/3B4JNJB9mjtSc9GK7  As an example of the tents ,,	NULL

People especially women consider mall hopping as a recreational activity here and since there are cinemas in every mall people have an added entertainment reason to visit more often. Also buying clothes online is still not as common as one might think. A large population of locals and expats prefer not to use credit cards/debit cards for e-retailers especially thoses wary of fraud and ignorant of the concept of returns and refunds.   Malls in the U.S. didn't go out of business because of lack of interest but rather their bad business practices further compounded by the pandemic and bankruptcies of the large firms owning them. Unlike the U.S. you will never find Karens and Kens fighting for their "rights" to protect their "freedom"  from vaccination and masks in K.S.A. Most people here have common sense unlike the idiots living in the U.S. For a small population of stupid people the compulsary vaccination mandate is enough. So if the malls are relatively safe and social distancing is being practiced people will still go. If you need to understand the popularity of malls just try finding parking in one on a weekend.	NULL

The border situation is something we should clearly take in account. Thanks for the advice. We probably look for an hotel room at Doha and visit Saudi Arabia (dammam or any of those other cities) some day when we're free.  But, if we don't find any hotel room or any space at Qatar, we'll consider being at saudi arabia most of the days.	NULL
Yeah, Dammam looks beautiful and would love to be there some of our days during this trip with my old man.	NULL
Pretty cool	NULL
I have a fair share of excellent and worst delivery services here. Sometimes, the problem is with the third party courier. They don't have a sense of urgency.

Are there people that still take seriously what the westerns say about Muslim countries? Those people are extremely ignorant.

If you're "westerner". You'll get a lot of leeway... A LOT. You can act exactly how you'd act wherever you're from (assuming it's less conservative than Saudi). Same rules apply.  Saudi women are among the friendliest and most easy going in the world. More so than western women. Don't be afraid to be your %100 self. If it's not going to get you in trouble in the west, it definitely will not get you in trouble here.	NULL
اتوقع من وجهة نظري انه المنطقة الشرقية سابقة بالتطور لكن لو تناظر بقية المملكة اقل تطورا على سبيل المثال لا لا الحصر معدل الرواتب في الشرقية اعلى معدل رواتب في المملكة وهذا لتعدد فرص العمل وقوتها في المنطقة    اما مناطق المملكة الاخرى ماكان لها نصيب من زخم الشركات او فرص العمل او القطاعات المختلفة .

To be honest… closing school this early did end up helping building up a general awareness of how serious covid is, and now almost everyone is vaccinated and responsible   Also the fact is back than all of this is still new to us and all soo I understand why they chose to play it safe and switch to online learning   At this point covid feels more like a simple flu that comes from time to time	NULL

There were moments when I enjoyed it but it is quite the shock to the system to be honest. Even for colleagues from Jordan and Lebanon, the culture shock was real. It’s about trying to make friends in the workplace, and finding ways and reasons to explore the country and the region (Western Asia) in general.   I wouldn’t discourage anybody from trying it, but I would say that you have to manage your expectations. Even when speaking to some of my Muslims friends, they were excited to go to Mecca (the city I was in was about 1 hour away), but for some of them that wasn’t enough to keep them there. In contrast, I’ve worked with people from the UK and other western nations who love the lack of pressure in the workplace and generally enjoy the paycheque.   But yeah, in all it was one of my harder international assignments, and though I wouldn’t do it again, I wouldn’t say I hated it.	NULL
As Saudi's become more prominent in the West through PIF investments, I feel people's understanding of the Kingdom is evolving. God willing this continues are the Kingdom shows further leadership on the international stage and encourages more tourism to its natural sites.	NULL

you have to be 16 or more to register in agym however you came do it if you parents give you permission.. gyms vary depending on where exactly you live and what is their specialty (boxing, weight, cardio, swimming,.. etc) I would recommend you go on a visit to the gyms nearby your house and check them out ( I did that a couple of time and they always welcomed my visit even offers me a discounts sometimes) if you into swimming and basketball the fitness timw can be a good option if you like boxing round 9 is great  if you need any help feel free to message me	NULL

I spent a couple of years in KSA a couple of decades ago and loved exploring the country and the meeting the people although some aspects were hard.        I was really glad I had read up on Culture Shock as it had a big impact on me and others from the west after a couple of months there. One thing to remember, it is a very young country/culture so many things such as systems/procedures cultural values are all over the place relative to the west. Typically there are loads of expats at work places to help you out (I was looked after like a child when I first arrived).	NULL
ان شاء الله اقدر افيدكم بكم معلومة  فيه منظمة اسمها نادي الخطابة، او Toastmasters وعندهم نوادي في كل مكان بالعربي وكذلك نوادي بالانجليزي. منظمة غير ربحية ومتخصصة لتطوير مهادة التحدث امام الجمهور وكذلك لتطوير المهارات الاجتماعية. اكتب لي في اي مدينة ساكن وانا اوصي لك هذي نوادي الخطابة اللي حولها.   من ناحية كتب تطوير الذات وزيادة الثقة في النفس، هيا كثير، لاكن هل انت متأكد اخوك حيقرأها ولا انت حتجبره او تقرأها له؟ انا اقترح كتب ومحاضرات الدكتور ابراهيم الفقي.   اذا حاب تفيد اخوك شخصياً، شجعه يخرج معاك بس لاتجبره، ولاتجبره يتكلم ولا يسوي اي شي، خليه يطلع معاك بس وبلغ اصحابك انهم مايحاولون يبدأون محادثة بالقوة معاه، هوا حيتحسن مع الوقت.   كذلك تقدر تفيده بانك تحاول تعرف ايش اهتماماته وتساعده يلاقي مجتمع يشاركه نفس الاهتمام.   لازم تعرف انه فيه شي اسمه رهاب اجتماعي، وممكن يبدأ عند الشخص بدون اي سبب. له علاج (سلوكي) مفيد جداً اذا انت مهتم تتعرف عنه اكثر، اسمه (العلاج السلوكي المعرفي) فيه مراكز تعمله مع مجموعات، حيساعده يتعلم مهارات وكذلك يغيير منظوره للمواقف عشان يقدر يتعامل معاها.

From what I understand, America basically orchestrated a coup against a democratically elected president in Ukraine (I can’t quite remember his name) for being somewhat pro-Russian as opposed to pro-EU.   So now the Russians see themselves as fighting against a NATO that wants to expand into their own backyard. I get why they see a threat in that, but overall I guess you could say I’m neutral.   However, I do wish we had closer relations with Russia and China. I feel like we rely on the Americans a bit too much at times.	NULL
