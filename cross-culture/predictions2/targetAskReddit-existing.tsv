Used to be atheist, now I guess I’d be considered agnostic.  But ultimately I realized that no one can/has the knowledge of what happens when we die or why we exist.  Religion is humanities way of attempting to making sense of the chaos and unknown.  I also realized no one person is any different from the last, people trick themselves into believing, that something scientifically explainable is an act or will of a god.  I used to look at religious people as children believing in a more complex Santa Claus, but eventually I realized that people are confused, scared and only know what they know.  Convincing them god doesn’t exist or religion is bullshit is a losing battle that I can’t even ultimately prove myself.  Sometimes I wish I held a strong belief of human existence and what happens when we die,  I’d definitely have less anxiety.  But I think ultimately it’s a good thing and has humbled me, and helps me take a rational/objective approach to life.  No one knows ultimately, but we can disprove many things based off what we do know.	NULL

My grandpas father captured a nazi flag from a small fort in central Germany.

Came to realise that its all a bunch of illogical bullshit when I was 11. The irony is that my granny who was heavily religious, gave me a book about pantheons of the world that explained each ancient civilization's human origins theory, deities etc. that She deemed as fairy tales. After reading it and knowing all I knew about christianity at that time, I asked myself the big question "whats the fucking difference" since then I gradually started losing faith untill at 13-14 I fully rejected the idea of a real god and other higher powers as reading more and more about what different religions did in the past, what they do now(looking at you christianity and islam), and also how the human mind works and how it's influenced by the mechanisms that form any given religion. Now I am open to Discussing and Analysing the existence of higher powers, but certainly won't believe without solid proof.	NULL

Yes, definitely. It's how I met my wife! I consider it to be the opposite of something like tinder.

The survival instinct kicked off in my brain and made all the problems feel small and insignificant compared to the extreme will to live that forced me to gasp for air even though minutes earlier I was sure I'd be happy for it to all stop.  Euphoria for days afterwards, the loss of consciousness as I struggled to survive made every breath after waking up feel amazing. Food, drink and even the ambient air on my skin felt better. It convinced me never to effectively commit suicide in the future, and finally tell a doctor (I was 13-14 so it still took 2 years before I got up the courage).  Unfortunately as you said the feeling doesn't last and I would self harm and sabotage myself until I got the therapy that I needed. So happy I kept working hard to heal, it was worth the effort.	NULL

Just to humorously channel my ex's pedantry for a moment: I'm not entirely sure this would be categorized as a "non-sequitur". It's more of a misunderstanding about the starting point of the discussion that left us coming from different directions to get to the same middle.  In my experience, "Romans were pale white" is a very common contemporary belief (in my country), and it is not a super unheard of topic of discussion, so more than once I've had this conversation with people where the starting point was "Ancient Romans were mostly non-white" and the response was either "That's interesting/what are the sources/more info" or very blatant racism at the thought of having "white history" challenged. I apologize for the error in judgment, it is a very charged topic where I live and I am used to equating it with extreme racism.	NULL
I've heard people say that they want the boy to "match" the father. As though there is some daddy-son dick matching competition that they want to do well in.

Just because I’m not actively complaining about cramps does not mean that they don’t hurt a lot. I choose to not make a fuss and that is what I prefer, just sucks that a lot of men see it as “just cramps”. Not often but sometimes I get cramps that wipe me out, if I don’t sit down I will either puke or pass out. Happened once when I was helping my dad in the garage, he was rolling his eyes the whole time and being like “fine then just sit and I’ll do this myself.” When you feel crappy physically, someone piling on the guilt is just the cherry on top.  You should know, because a lot of women’s pms symptoms get downplayed and dismissed. But in general a good tip is that if anyone is telling you they are in pain then don’t be an ass about it.	NULL

Your statement that I was initially responding to is "God is a manipulator and textbook abuser."  So my point is that in that sentence you are both accepting their god's existence and framing his followers as victims of manipulation and abuse by him.  My argument is that if that god does exist then he is not manipulating them because they cannot have free will *to be manipulated*. Manipulation requires choice.  Further, I am arguing that because the doctrines of free will and god being all knowing cannot both be true then their god does not exist so his followers who claim to act on his behalf are actually acting of their own volition.  If you want to say that religious leaders are manipulators and abusers that is a different discussion. You didn't say that. You said that "god" is.	NULL

One guy I dated before that had Marfan syndrome and rode his motorcycle across a college campus in an anime girl dress while holding a metal sword he’d dipped in gasoline and lit on fire. Also objectively an idiot.  There was an ER doctor who had many horrible corrosive acids in SOBE drink bottles in his closet.

Not me, but my husband. One night out with our friends, I got shitface drunk. So my husband carried my purse for me. He got called so many names. I was so ready to fight them, I even took my earrings out and wanted to throw my “chancla”. My husband restrained me from causing a scene and for good reason. I think he said something about me not loosing my jewelry and shoes. I can’t remember well. It was a fun night, but that last bit really annoyed me. I didn’t know carrying a purse would automatically make your dick fall off or be gay 😒	NULL

I totally agree that 2.5 months is not long enough to call a solid relationship. And I've been completely crushed by someone I was with for a short time, too. My friends did not understand that I was in honest to God, genuine, soul rending pain. I took a long break after that.   You're also right that luck is a major factor. Of course, each person in the budding relationship is responsible for actions that may make it or break it, but if you're truly lucky, you'll find someone who is ultra compatible with you. Yeah, odds are against it but that is not unique to you. The same is true for everyone. It may be mathematically accurate to bet it won't happen but that doesn't mean it can't. Rose tinted optimism isn't always healthy either. Rather, remain open to the possibility, and actively keep watch for the possibility.  Consider four leaf clovers. Most people will never find one because they don't bother to look. They think, "They're so rare it's not worth my time to look. I have better things to do." Perhaps that's true. But I have found several four leaf clovers because I remained open to the possibility and took the time to look. In the end, it was just a clover with an extra leaf and it brightened my day nonetheless. How much greater is finding your life partner?   So maybe 2022 won't be the year. Odds are against it. But what if it is?   I wish you success!	NULL

There have been studies to show that no species are dependent on mosquitoes. In fact, any species that eats mosquitoes do not eat enough of them for a complete eradication to be concequential. If I remember right the only species that would be effected was a specific type of algae that is a primary food source for mosquitoes during infancy. However, the change would be miniscule as these algae are also eaten by fish within their ecosystems. So really, the minor ecosystem change would be a slightly larger availability of food for the ecosystem.	NULL

Nah. As someone who studied fashion 20 years ago, Balenciaga is and always will be an iconic brand. The problem is the youth influence on the creative director today. The pieces might look terrible individually but separately they are quality - and the collections tell a story. It’s a bit deep. But I will admit that as an outsider without much background on the brand, you either LOVE it because you’re a teen into labels or you hate it because you don’t understand it.	NULL

To be completely, totally honest?  I would go back to the tried and true.  I would design a system so that all of the children ended up in some sort of institution for a majority of their days when they were babies and onward, anything like some sort of preschool or daycare or whatever it would be labeled or whatever combination of institutions would be necessary for compliance.  I would then indoctrinate them into whatever I wanted. Whether I wanted to have them come to my side or whether I simply wanted to undermine everything that their civilization is, then this has proven to be the place to start.  It has been said " Give me a child before they are 5 and they are mine for life. " and that is absolutely true, sadly.	NULL

Same for me for the job. I would quit my jobs in black out rage and then immediately get a new one, confident I could do it this time. rinse and repeat for about 7 years.  And yes, I had to see their doctors twice and both times they were like "nah u fine"  My lawyer hired an independent doctor basically to get someone outside of my regular ones to agree with them that I had shit wrong with me. Only had one 2 hour meeting with her and when you go back and look over her report she pretty much said the same things. All my doctors filled out the paperwork consistently, that I had issues getting along with others, that I was prone to emotional outbursts, had issues with authority, and had physical ailments that left me in constant pain.  &#x200B;  The judge found that my physical issues were only "mild" (boy do I wish there was some kind of machine I could use to transfer my pain to other people) but in the award letter stated something along the lines of "upon reconsideration, ailments of claimant were more severe than originally thought"  &#x200B;  Honestly I do NOT understand why I wasn't awarded when I applied back in 2014 (after my fiance's suicide) because even that report, which was from one of their doctors cited the same exact issues as all my doctors. Doctors that I wasn't even seeing yet as of 2014. Everything was consistent!!!!  &#x200B;  I applied a 2nd time in 2018 after a suicide attempt but my family convinced me I was making it uip and I didn't go through with it. Finally Jan 2020 I couldnt take it anymore and was going to admit myself to the hospital but I didnt because of financial reasons, I quit and applied immediately. this time I stuck through. they denied me in May 2020 and then June 2020, got the lawyer Sept 2020. Saw the judge June 2021 and was awarded in Aug 2021.  &#x200B;  I don't think I could have done it though if my husband wasn't making decent money. he supported us, along with credit cards for all of 2020. but it was sadly very convenient that my car was almost destroyed in a hail storm and then we got those stimulus checks. Kept the insurance money for my car and used the stimulus checks to live off.  &#x200B;  My monthly benefits are not that amazing. They definitely couldn't support me if I were by myself unless I lived in income based housing or had roommates or lived with family. However, I do have a part time job that brings home $500 a month. And my husband of course works his butt off.	NULL

More often than not, the person you lose your virginity to means something to you.   To me, it depends on the situation. If I’m dating the girl and turns out she’s a virgin but wants to be intimate, sure. But a virgin trying to get into a ONS/FWB situation… I’d prefer not out of fear of attachments in those situations, I’ll just stick to someone who sexually is more mature with those types of situations.

Still, that doesn't cancel out the idea that this is, in the end, some sort of creation - it only deepens the pool, so to speak.  I'm not religious, and I don't believe in a God in the sky who'll send us to hell if we're naughty. I think it's entirely possible that this - all this - came from "nothing", whatever that means.  I think it's just as possible, however, that this *is* the result of *something* that *was*, and isn't as simple as "there was nothing, and now we're here".  Call it God or gods or "the higher power", call it bullshit - whatever.  All I'm saying is, I don't think anything about how we're here, or why, is outside the realm of far-out possibility.	NULL

No it’s not, any “not in my backyard” is a NIMBY it’s what it literally stands for.  Both racist shits not wanting people or other race to come into their community snd gentrification are both forms of NIMBY.  Also, it’s not always race related, it’s probably rarely race related and that’s just anacdotal.  Most the time it’s about wanting to create more population density in an area that is less dense through any number of means and people they not wanting that.  There’s a measure recently in Cali about rezoning a neighborhood that had sfh to make it into duplexes and split the lots and the people there were like eff that for obvious reasons, why does LA or San Fran or wherever it was need MORE people.

You need to realize that some people claim to do things in the name of God but in reality they aren’t. Being a Christian myself it’s sad to admit that some Christians hate others and do stuff that the Bible tells them not to do. It’s either cuz they’re lying about being Christian (hopefully not) or they’re confused. Which is why I pray to God to help them and every Christian follow his Word better, for if we follow his Word like how he intended us too, then everyone in the world would see how great God’s love is, and then everyone would want to turn to God and confess and repent.

Alright I have to share this because it blew my mind. My cousin is a famousish rapper. He’s successful but by far the least educated person in our family and it shows in every aspect of his life. When seeing him recently I brought up how I got my vaccine. He brought up how he wasn’t sure about it and I asked why. His response was “bro do you know about Bill Gates”. I honestly thought this was a meme and never so I look at my gf with eyes saying omfg. He then goes on and says “well Bill Gates created windows, then he created computer viruses, and then he made norton and sold it to combat the viruses he created”. His explanation ended right there. He did not elaborate further and acted like he dropped the biggest knowledge bomb ever. No mention of real viruses or anything. It was the craziest thing I’ve ever heard firsthand.	NULL
There's a lot of good points about not needing a reason which I agree with, but I had every reason to be a real thumper growing up. With where I grew up and the amount of indoctrination I was around at the time I'm unsure if I would be where I am ideologically if faith hadn't been given the opportunity to entirely fail me early on. My mom died when I was pretty young and although my family was ivolved multiple days a week in the church nothing really happened after. My Dad stood up and told the congregation at the start of church that Sunday and then things moved right along. I didn't expect a service about my Mom or a second funeral, but I know now I was grasping for tools or eve a true sense of community to deal with this event that nobody around me even really wanted to think about from their reaction.  In a similar theme recently, my grandfather has dealt with some serious caretaker depression. According to their doctor he's doing the job of four on call nurses just trapped in the same house as my grandmother. Its been almost six years like that and recently he told me outright he was depressed. This was an unprecedented moment of vulnerability for him. My grandmother's reply to the man she chose to spend her life with, had been washed, fed, and medicated by multiple times a day was to "put it in the hands of God". That eroded any last grains of respect I had left for her or religiosity. She could've said "I don't give a shit" and I'd still respect her a little more for being honest and not using God as I've been forced to see the idea. An absurd story that helps people disassociate from the grim reality they live. It fueled serfdom, it fueles imperialism, and it fuels capitalism because you don't have to give a shit about anyone down here if the paradise in the sky is open and agreeable.	NULL

Probably a video of some dude sitting in a chair facing the camera. Then he started rubbing some plaster looking stuff alllll on his head, it looked like it had other stuff in it though.

I would consider myself a fairly logical, calm, and orderly man.  I do technical IT work for a living, so my brain and personality tends to be that way.  But when I get in "'the mood" all hell breaks loose in my brain and all I can focus on is getting "that fix" like it is a drug.  It is a burning desire for that euphoria, and then after it's over it is like the HULK or Mr. Hyde has disappeared and the real me returned to claim my body and I return to my work and duties with clear and focus intent.  But that burning desire is focused within by crotch, inside my pelvic region.  My penis is the antenna and transmits the "good feelings" inside of me where it actives something (I don't know) inside my pelvic region that eventually erupts!!!!  My body explodes with every good feeling.  I can't breathe, I can't think, I can only feel warmth, love, happiness, tenderness, joy, just everything that I'm missing in life.  And then after that moment it's gone.  The raging storm that was inside of me is now a calm ocean.  The raging beast is satisfied... for now.  I have been given a reprieve to continue my work until it reveals its ugly torment.	NULL

Left wing here. I routinely argue for government spending to be fixed, and cut. We need to work more efficiently so that our tax dollars go to more. This means cutting a lot of the excess bureaucracy and jobs associated with it, honoring budgets and sticking to them, and limiting debt spending. It’s odd though, it seems democratic presidents are better at this agenda than their recent Republican counterparts. It’s the Congress that gets me angry with their pork infested budget bills. And that’s a both sides issue.	NULL

Pagan by technicality here. My gods serve as a symbolism of the more intangible forces of nature but i do not believe them to be literal beings.   The wicca and magika thing to me (i dont practice any form of magic) is just a form of prayer or meditation of prejection or whatever you want to call it. Practicing witch craft in a way is the same as praying from my perspective i dont take it as a literal tapping into the forces of nature and controlling them. But its the same as prayers. If you think jim carrey is out there scrolling through your prayers granting them like wishes, any judeo christian will tell you thats not how god functions and so practicing magika expecting a direct cause effect relationship is probably not going to work.

Right wing here, here's a couple left wing opinions.  Mandate the COVID vaccine and any subsequent boosters. No religious exemptions, only strict medical exemptions.  Abortion is 100% unrestricted.  Ban coal use immediately, ban sale of ICE vehicles by 2025, all energy must come from renewables by 2030.  Tax the rich. 50% for people making $1 million or more.  &#x200B;  I'm right wing because:  Unrestricted firearm access, probably stopping at tanks and fighter jets. End most welfare benefits. More military and police funding. Build the wall, deport all illegal immigrants. School choice (public school left a horrible taste in my mouth). Massive import tariffs needed.

Tantrumming after being told "No" or getting rejected. Also, not listening to people when they are presenting a differing perspective or opinion. Basically a lack of basic empathy skills, forcing their options and feelings on others. Using manipulation or physically bullying someone to get their way. Bonus points for temper tantrumming and blaming others when manipulation and bullying don't give them what they want and drives people away.   Also when they "know" how people think or feel without asking... Huge red flag. Someone who makes constant assumptions about their partner without talking about things first with them is a trash human. They think they are dating a fantasy not a person which is a huge sign of immaturity.   Also guys who try to rush into relationships under the guise of "being friends" and use basic kindness as a manipulation tactic for sex.   Thinking someone is your friend only to find out they were only nice to you for sex is literally the most whiplashing experience. I would debate it hurts as much if not more than being rejected. You are losing someone who you thought was your friend only to realize all your time with them was a huge lie. It makes it's hard to trust guys afterwards and causes you to be paranoid about your relationships with guys. So many people don't understand how traumatic that can be especially if you get sexually assaulted or worse because you trusted a guy as your friend and they just used that trust to get access to you.   Hard pass on any guy who exhibits this behaviors. Immaturity in a guy typically is given a pass and is even expected in some cultures, but I would debate that immaturity in men can be dangerous to others safety. If you see a guy exhibit anything I mention above, run.	NULL

I’m not arguing god exists, but none of your arguments make logical sense. Saying no to something may not be visibly different from “not answering” but it is not empirical proof that the belief in god hearing prayers is false. Working “mysteriously” is not empirically identical to not existing, even if it happens to look “visibly” the same to you. Etc. Again, I’m not arguing for any god’s (or gods’) existence, but your arguments here are weak and illogical, as they amount to you claiming something doesn’t exist simply because it is not easily apparent.

How would that help?  If it’s a federal holiday like Labor Day or the 4th of July, banks, offices and schools will be closed. These largely employ people who work 9-5 jobs and can find time to vote on Election Day.   Stores will still be open. Restaurants will still be open. So the people working two jobs to put food on the table are still going to be working a 12 hour day without time to vote.   I don’t think making it a holiday solves the problem. I’d rather see early and mail in voting expanded across the country. Instead of Election Day, it can be election week.	NULL

The homosexuality issue has been hijacked by neo Marxists to promote an agenda a bunch of other policies.  Just look at the bottom of every job where roughly 99% of companies claim that they are an equal rights employer.. And then contradict themselves by mentioning how members of the LGBT community will be prioritised.  It is a political issue and only an idiot would not lie on that part when they literally get less credit points for not being straight.  There are tons of policies being promoted in the name of homosexuality.  Including pretending to fight for thr rights of trans children.. By allowing pseudo scientists mess with their bodies.. Something that America does not sound to be concerned about since they allow pseudo scientists to fuck with the bodies of young children from birth via circumcision.  And of course.. Any debate is bot welcome.  You are meant to accept that homosexuals have less rights.. Even in thw year 2021 and fight ovee stupid issues such as a which bathroom to shit.	NULL

Because God and faith have done nothing to create the things I enjoy today.   God did not help us discover radio waves.   God had nothing to do with the creation of the cellphone.      Anything I enjoy today is not the product of a superior being but the cumulative effort of human ingenuity.  No God or religion took us from mud houses to highrise.  I respect and  believe in what gets shit done. Science has a lot more to show in the last 200 years alone, than all gods and religions combined over several thousand.	NULL

Brought up catholic and got so sick of the women hating, gay hating, child raping, multi national money making power corporation that is the Catholic Church. There was just no link between what Jesus said and what the church does. Then well, science. I just saw religion as a way of explaining things that weren’t understood at the time. We know more now. Sure we don’t know what happens when we die but I’m pretty sure there is no heaven or angels or St Paul’s gates or however many virgins.   The concept of the leap of faith and believing in things with no evidence was just a big No from me. The the Taliban and what they do in the name of religion. It’s pure ignorance used to justify power. I’m done with the hate and war and killing over my imaginary sky fairy is right and yours is wrong. I live a good life, I’m kind, I’m thoughtful, I’m generous and I help my neighbour, if there is a god, it will understand I did my best. So it really doesn’t matter.	NULL

Agnostic, not atheist here  There is no proof of a higher power and if there is we are silly to attempt to understand it  Religion is used to explain things that can't otherwise be explained, we have 2 things left in like we can't fully explain. Death, which is the big one. And suffering, (questions like, why am I poor but he was born to billionaires and has anything he wants, or why did that car crash that killed my wife happen)  We die and that's the end, consciousness is a byproduct of survival. And the world is so big and has so many things happening it's impossible to predict.  I won't argue there is nothing, simply that we have zero data or understanding of anything outside of our perception	NULL

I’ve watched Taylor’s live performances (one of the more notable ones being her Tiny Desk performance) and her instrument playing doesn’t strike me as well above average. Her song writing is where she shines the most. She knows how to write a great song & that’s undebatable.  She’s good at piano and guitar but it’s nothing impressive. On piano, almost every chord she plays is beginner level and the songs can be learned fairly easily in a day.  Same with guitar. Almost all the chords she plays are the beginner open shapes you learn when you first start playing guitar. I’ve never seen her even attempt to play lead (not saying you have to in order to be considered a good guitarist, just an observation), so I’d say rhythm is where she’s most comfortable. It’s also hard to find footage of her playing a barre chord lol. Nathan Chapman plays a huge chunk of the guitar parts we hear on her albums.  There’s nothing that “stands out” about her playing but She’s good enough at each of those instruments to write great songs though & that’s all she needs!	NULL

People base their "criticism" against God based off of whatever they think God is, and not what He really is.  Basically all the comments about child cancer, rapists, genocide etc. etc. is the consequence of free will.  If you have the free will to do good, other guy also has the free will to do bad.  Moreso, bacteria is much as the same creation of God as is plants and humans. It is the free will of bacteria to evolve to kill humans, as is the free will of humans to kill animals. And most importantly, it is the free will of humans to basically choose the right course or action to be in God's favor or not.  Frankly, I do not care at all if ya'll want to be religious or have no belief at all, I'm not the one to judge. But at least try to put in good arguments when you want to oppose something.	NULL
It is a licence to be corrupt that undermines democracy at it's core by the unelected and unaccountable.

They are accountable to no one but their shareholders. They bleed governments of the taxes they need to function to increase their influence and power. This done by allowing lobbying and it is the center of all that will consume us and why nothing is done that does not directly benefit the very companies destroying existence for a profit. They are sociopathic and their influence total, stop lobbying and we might yet turn this around but without it they will continue to exert power no one elected over our money, our lives and existence as a whole  .

This may get buried but what hammered the final nail was when I realized how Christianity was spread and used to control a population of illiterate people by making them believe in blindly serving their Kings, Lords, etc. or go to hell.  A set of morals and philosophy was already established in many places, and Christianity came with extra, unnecessary rules to encourage people to hold faith rather than questioning the world (Discouraging learning). Work hard and expect little in return (help the rich and comfortable, keep the poor poor). Marry and procreate (make more workers/soldiers/followers, you can't have a kid back then if you were gay for example).  By spreading the word of God, how much power did that give the Pope, the Kings, the Rich? How much pressure were people under to believe it or face punishment and a sentence to Hell? It just makes too much sense to me that it was a religion used for power.  On top of that, I just think with what we DO understand of the Universe, it doesn't really fit the puzzle. I'm more of a nihilist, universe is fractal and infinite kinda guy. Time is a dimension and for something to exist outside of it, I don't think would care very much about us, or anything of our size.

Dumb? maybe. Crazy, definitely. So when I was 7, I got hit by a car going 40 or so. I was not breathing, turning blue. A cop gave me mouth-to-mouth, and here I am. I have permanent damage, walk with a slight limp, due to nerve damage from not breathing for awhile. It’s not bad. So anyway, Covid got me out of the gym so I started riding. On the trail. April 29th of last year was the 50 year anniversary of my bicycle accident when I was 7. I decided to ride 50 miles to commemorate kicking ass on my injuries. So the day comes. Mile 36 into my ride, this 30-something year old ran a red light at the bike crosswalk. You guessed it, I got hit again on the 50 year anniversary. Fractured L1-L3. This April 29th, I will do 51 miles on my new bike!	NULL

Agnostic-leaning atheist here, if that counts. To explain that first, I don’t believe there is a single human being alive that can or does truly know what is beyond - But as a science buff, I can tell you one side makes a lot more sense to me, and it isn’t the big man in the sky theory.  Beyond that, I did personally grow up in a very Christian household though, and going by my experience and others’ around me, that always tends to lean you one way or the other on its own, lol. There is a reason some people have Christianity-provoked PTSD; I’ve never seen a religion weaponized quite as fervently as it is in America, and growing up with that, plus stories of Satan stalking vulnerable people, how all of my friends were going to hell, and mental illness just being “demons” you need to “fight harder” to name a few things, I found myself pretty turned off from the whole thing. I ended up way way more resentful of secular religion and all of its “pick-and-choose for convenience” views than finding peace in it since escaping private school.   I really despise the hypocrisy above all as well, you cannot stand behind an all-loving God and in the same motion condemn your fellow humans, his creations. It is also a sin to speak for the Lord by their rules, yet they always have something to say about someone who is not following scripture by how they individually interpreted it. In my eyes, God is just an excuse for people to pass ugly judgements against one another and treat them absolutely inhumane, but with the added perk of being able to say they have a ‘reason’ so they can sleep comfortably at night. Needless to say, I’m not a huge fan of the focus on pressuring other people to convert for a self-pat on the back and a cozy seat in heaven, either.  Bit of a tangent there, but I guess after all of that is said - an overwhelming component of my disbelief comes from a deep dislike of the followers of my country’s most prevalent religion, and I would honestly feel too ashamed to rally behind something so disorganized, hateful, and with a long bloody history behind it. I’ve considered looking into other religions, but after everything I grew up with, I do find it difficult to force myself to believe in any higher power at all. For now, I’m content to simply be healing and living by my own moral code: treat people right, you know, regardless of the reward.	NULL

I agree, it’s technically wrong to say something like “Irish accent” when there are loads of different accents in Ireland, some of which if you heard side by side you’d think they must be from opposite ends of the planet from one another. Tho all that being said, I still call my accent American, and I don’t think I’d differentiate the different English accents by name. It’s just easier, and most people know how diverse accents can be, even in the same country.  Tl;dr yeah kinda no kinda	NULL

Similar situation. I stopped gaming almost entirely between 2010-2018. Barely even touched the smash games that came out in between.   What finally allowed me to get back into it was figuring out how to play games with 0 expectations. I stopped expecting it to exceed my rose tinted memories. I went into breath of the wild with no knowledge of how it worked or really what the story was.   I don’t play as much as I used to, and for me I think that’s a good thing. Sure playing Halo 2 for 12 hours with friends was awesome as a teenager, but would I do it now? *Should* I do it now?   It’s more than just games, this feeling to me is emblematic of getting older. I think we forget that we change over time, so it makes perfect sense that certain things will come and go that pique our interest. Taking them as they are as *we are* in that moment is the key to maintaining enjoyment in my opinion.   Sorry, long rant over. Hope you can enjoy games still in your own way!	NULL

Leftist is a distinct and absolute range of points on the political spectrum.  It’s your socialist, your social democrats (maybe, if you’re being generous your third way liberals), and your syndicalists (I’m likely missing a few).   The right is “mainstream points not on the left”.  It’s a more flexible set of policies. Plus, conservatism is a relative ideology that varies from place to place a lot more than leftism does.  Plus, classical liberalism (and a few other liberal threads) are usually considered right wing, but are only really “conservative” (in an ideological sense) within the US and UK (where they have a strong history).

The Beatles had some pretty complex and unique songs, but to say that kind of innovation doesn't happen today is braindead and stupidly ignorant and only shows us that you don't have a very broad taste in music.

When we found similar pants from H&M, she couldn’t wait to show her teacher (who was from SE Asia). It made me wonder if it would be “ok” to buy them if we found a genuine pair of shalwars in her size at the thrift store. We haven’t found any (and now she only wants fleece-lined leggings)… but I often see tiny kameez that would look so cute on my 9 month old (I leave them because the 9 month old doesn’t care what she wears but there is probably a family out there looking for tiny kameez who would appreciate the cheap price. I also would hate to offend anyone if they saw this as cultural appropriation).

I think the easiest way that I or anyone can deal with this situation is just by basic empathy. If the person wanted to date someone else instead of you, obviously it's their choice. But one can also think of it if the roles were reversed. Suppose you are someone who goes head over heels for someone, you ask them out, they say yes, and you start dating them. Happy story, right? But what obligations would you have to someone else who might have had a crush on you, but has to feel a little heart broken because you start dating someone you're interested in?  Such situations take on a whole different color when you are not the one who is disappointed, but may have disappointed someone else.	NULL

Ooo this actually happened to me once. Ok so I was working at this call center. There was this cool lady I worked with. Let’s call her Abby. She and I were work friends but Abby was kind of what people would fall white trash. One day Abby seems upset. I ask what’s going on and she tells me her mother had to flee the states. I ask why and didn’t get a lot of info but I knew it was drug related.   A couple months later and I’ve forgotten all about it. Then I notice Abby has been gone for a while. Like a couple days that turned into a couple weeks. Queue me getting this call from some random man. He tells me he is Abby’s father and that she was going to move to Florida where he lived to be closer but she left and never arrived. Apparently my name came up because we were Facebook friends.   He tells me she left our area on say Monday and on Friday the police in Kentucky find her car at a gas station. She is missing. I tell her dad the truth that I had no idea where she was.   This obviously peaks my interest. So I start researching. Turns out someone rolled on her mom. I mean spilled everything. She was running a pretty substantial meth ring. She had fled the country though and no one knew where she was. I develop this theory that Abby has also left the country.   Later they confirmed that she did in fact orchestrate her own disappearance. She made plans to move in with her father. Then purposefully abandoned her car at a gas station and got a ride to the airport in Kentucky. Then flew to whatever country her mother was in that did not extradite.   What’s even wilder my friend had this cousin who was always into drugs and stuff. Around the same time Abby went missing he was in prison. His wife kept saying he was going to be getting out.

I was always into technology and taking things apart, even as a kid.    Every break for the holidays at primary school we had to either go to the nearby church, or have an assembly where the local minister would come round and preach.      This year he wanted to illustrate a parable with some "nice pebbles" he found on his walk. I should point out that he was a very nice chap.     He strolls up to the overhead projector, plonks the pebbles on the top and then, of course, all we saw was some pebble-shaped shadows. That was it for me. As soon as it turned out he didn't understand something so simple, in my mind I started questioning how he could understand and teach us about all this hidden stuff about God and heaven if he didn't even understand a machine that was rather obvious how it worked.

it doesnt really make sense scientifically, nor does it match my beliefs,, but i believe that if we do have a god its probably smthn cool or soemthing that'd make sense like conciousness or something, not some cruel man in the sky that'll send you to hell for ridiculous shit  it feels like the biblical version of god is to christians as santa is to children, just something to keep people "good" and in check, and even as a really little kid i had my doubts about christianity and god, i relaly hate how i was forced to learn something that i didnt believe in. i only ever believed in a god or prayed to that god when i thought my grandpa would die. but then i wondered if everyone worships this guy and he has this like, cult following pretty much, then why is he so cruel.   i think thats when i lost  all belief. my mom would always get angry atme when i'd doubt what she said about the bible, or a god, but she could never back herself up.  i wish people wouldn't blindly follow religions that they were taught at birth, and instead do their research, find a religion that they can really believe in, or maybe even become an atheist instead of blindly following what a book tells them without even thinking outside of the box, i think its why people can be so stupid sometimes  the earth and the universe is so fucking weird though?? like just think ab quantum mechanics . that shit is fucking weird. im  13 so i obviously dont have a very concrete understanding but its so weird, and the fact that all of that weird shit is the building blocks of the universe is just weirder, but it doesn't really seem odd because our perceptions of things have been regulated to what our daily life is   but dont look outside the box too much or else you'll be believing in some weird shit, but i cant really say much because i think the earth might genuinely be trying to kill us	NULL

A hit dog will holler, as they say. I tend to think it's a problem of many social media sites being echo chambers. Instead of really taking a look at who they are as a person, many people seek out others with the same unhealthy mindset and they feed each other. I don't think they are nearly as common as they seem to think they are. It's amplified by social media, but most people who want to find a partner can do that. Sometimes, there are people who won't due to bad luck, but these people usually aren't bitter about it.   A lot of these people you are talking about are bitter and resentful. They show their ass all the time and are shocked no one wants to be around them. If all the people you meet are entitled, vain, shallow, selfish, stupid, etc, it is a sign that you are some of those things.  Water seeks its own level. If you tell the five-letter brigade or FDS folks that, they get pissed. It's easier to be a victim because then you don't have to do anything. It's all someone else's fault.  And when these folks do try to date, they engage in stupid behaviors that ruin their own cause. My bestie convinced me to download Hinge. I'm on there not even two days and get four insulting messages in response to photos and prompts. One of them insulted my speaking voice. What are they even trying to accomplish? These are the same sorts of people who will get on social media and cry about not being able to find someone. Well, yeah. You're an asshole. What good person wants to be with an asshole? I block the stuff and move on, but the problem is very few people in their life are going to sit these people down and say "Look, you're an asshole".	NULL

To prove a negative- the “doesn’t” in “god doesn’t exist” is hard.  Most athiests, correctly, point to the correct onus of proof: is there a reason to believe that a god *does* exist?  I won’t delve into logic any further, except to say that start from “can you prove god doesn’t exist?” Is a perversion of logic.   However- there is a proof against god that I find compelling. It’s attributed to Epicurus.   God is all-knowing, all-loving, and all-powerful. Any being that isn’t those three things is not god, it’s something else.   And yet, evil exists. Pain, suffering, hurt exist.   This means that, either:  1. God knows and cares but can’t help it.  2. God knows and could help, but doesn’t care.  3. God cares and would help, but doesn’t know.    The result is simple: there is no thing that we would recognize as a monotheistic creator god. If there was, things would be different.	NULL

The microwave background radiation is what concludes that the size of the known universe is finite. You are correct that it is bigger than what is observable, but the Big Bang Theory is not constructed solely based on the observable universe, it accounts for the whole Universe as it existed at T approaching 0.  The issue with "a lot" (which in this case would mean an asymptotic number approaching infinity) is that asymptotes necessitate the existence of *time*. In order for "many but not infinite" Universes to exist, they would have to be *approaching* infinity which necessitates the existence of time. In an atemporal state with no dimension of time this cannot be done. There would have to be some "preset" number of Universes that is not infinite but sufficiently large for this Universe to exist within that set. Which is a scenario so painstakingly specific it has to be constructed in that way specifically to avoid invoking the idea of a conscious agent, for one could never arrive at such a conclusion without that goal in mind. It is logically absurd.	NULL

I don't really consider myself an "atheist" and actually hate that term because it implies some unfaltering disbelief in a higher power. If there was any concrete shred of proof good existed, I'd believe immediately. It's just that there's literally zero evidence.    But I also do have a moral issue with religion. What makes the Christians right instead of the Muslims or vice versa? You're going to believe whatever your parents taught you and whatever is popular in your place of birth. How can a fair and just god put someone in the middle east and let them grow up in an Islamic home and then send them straight to hell for not worshipping Jesus like all the Christian - born people he placed in America?

It's the first podcast I ever started listening to and has been the only one ever since. I've enjoyed all 530 episodes and each one is delightful in one way or another.

It's a beautiful marriage of John August's machine-like ability to aggregate and organize topics and Craig Maizin's ability to be Craig Maizin.   I'd pushback and say that they've podcasted their way out of obscurity and are well regarded rather than underrated but I take your sentiment well because I don't think you need to be a writer to enjoy listening to them, more true is that when it comes to the off-theme bonus segments.

Humans do not categorize that way, so any use of "alpha" male is inherently incorrect. There is no correct way to apply it to humans, and so every use is at best metaphorical.  Humans have extremely dynamic social status that shifts constantly even over the course of a single conversation. Someone who consistently attempts to maintain the highest status level in an interaction is going to be *extremely obnoxious* to everyone around them.  As such your definition of "alpha" here is basically "a person who appropriately cedes his alpha status like a normal human." So it's use is both inaccurate and not even really coherent for listeners.	NULL

Sometimes people make mistakes, right? Not the end of the world right? WRONG.  Part of my job is interacting with a position that corrects my work above me. A normal month I do about 50 cases, and they need to review 2 monthly for quality assurance. Not often, but sometimes I make mistakes and they mention them so I can correct them.  Every once in a blue moon, the feedback I get will clearly be either intended for a different file (wrong name, wrong case number) or will get information wildly incorrect (feedback talks about how a person is expected to recover, but client statements and doctors notes say they're on their death bed).  I have never once been able to bring up that the feedback was clearly meant for another person (to be fair only happened once) or been able to clarify an obviously contradictory error on the assessors part without them complaining to my manager. I would say in my total career so far, about 5 years, it has only happened four or five times.  Every time except for one my manager spoke down to or yelled at me for not being a team player or for undermining the authority of my assessor. I can assure you the language used in my responses was akin to "Hey, I noticed the case file didn't match up, just want to make sure this was my feedback" or "I just wanted to touch base about the medical note on file showing the doctor is giving them 3 months to live. You told me I should have denied them because they're supposed to recover but I'm having trouble seeing where they are expected to recover. Can you help me here? I just want to make sure we don't deny somebody who is entitled."  I would say this stuff is a huge indication that somebody hasn't matured. Being unable to accept any fault, even minor fault, and being willing to affect somebody's livelihood to maintain that is pretty immature.   Unfortunately, even though the occurances of this are uncommon, it has been about 80% of my assessors and half my managers that actively do things like this.  One time my assessor just responded "oh, I missed that note, you're right that does change things" and I was absolutely flabbergasted at how simple the response was. It took me and that assessor five minutes to correct a five minute issue in place of two meetings, a discussion about workplace professionalism, and then me going through the file with them watching to show them the issue still needs to be clarified before the file can be closed. It made my week, it was amazing.	NULL

You need gas chambers to call it genocide? Even suppression of language is considered genocide.  Genocide is genocide, doesn’t have to match the degree the Nazis did it at. Palestinian children are murdered by the Israeli government. That definitely qualifies as genocide. Killing the children of a people.  Saying Israel treats Palestinians poorly is a gross understatement. What did palestinians do to deserve being pushed out of their homes, and have their children and family members killed? Innocent people die for Israeli colonialism. Isn’t what the Europeans did to the native Americans genocide as well?	NULL

people who get into the "craftsmanship" and "complexity" angle with music, who pride themselves on having sort of exclusive, discerning taste, can be easily turned off by the relentlessly broad strokes country musicians (read: the five songwriting teams from nashville who write everything) tend to paint with. And truly, the music can be pretty goddamn manipulative. I understand that's weird to say because in a sense any emotionally substantive music would be, but there does seem to a be a real tendency to pander in a fairly calculated and cynical way with a lot of the radio country stuff. But I agree that writing off any genre, even if it's as widely reviled as "radio country hits" is almost always a mistake	origin

One day when I was a toddler, maybe something like 4 years old, I SHOULD’VE died.  I wanted to get something from my parent’s room. They had a super big dresser, and I reached for the top drawer. I used a little stool and pulled the handle, and the entire dresser toppled over. Since I was little, pulling on the top drawer handle pulled the dresser drawer DOWN, not OUT. This entire dresser, full of clothes and other stuff fell on me. If I remember correctly (from what my mom told me), my arm also got caught in the drawer as it landed on me.  With such a heavy dresser, and me being so tiny, I could’ve been killed, or injured.  But somehow I walked away totally fine, not a scratch, not even a bruise.	NULL

Haha I will admit that when the song started I was like "this is just noise" but as it moved along it started to grow on me. It definitely saves itself after 2:55. Have you heard of Genghis Tron? I wouldn't say they are black metal at all because they play around with synth, but the aggression in their songs are similar to Damaar (beautiful band name btw). I mostly listen to their albums "Dead Mountain Mouth"  and "Board Up the House" - but mostly Dead Mountain. Their albums are an experience. You almost can't listen to one song on its own. I used to buy metal hammer and rock sound magazines back in the 2000s and White Walls was on one of the free CDs that came with these magazines. It was the first time "screeching music spoke to me". I dunno why they work for me but they just do. Their songs are very experimental and mix and match genres fluidly. I don't know any band like them and I also don't know anyone who knows them haha. I haven't heard their newer stuff but looks like they still make music to this day.	NULL

I'm working 2 days at a middelbare school (kinda like high school I guess) since a few weeks now. Quite a few of the students are very interested in me as a person. Asking questions like "what did you want to do when you were our age" and stuff like that.  And one off the best things was "sir, do you have a boy or girlfriend?"  It was so casual asked, like it is the most normal thing in the world to be together with someone of either gender. That made me happy.	NULL

With all of the horrific things that happen in the world such as genocides, cancers that effect perfectly good people or young children, wars that drag children into conflict etc, clearly no god or higher power can exist that condones such cruelty and misfortune, or if they do exist they're incredibly cruel, and not worthy of worship in my eyes.  Also, if every religion thinks their deity/deities are the "right one" and the rest are wrong, my assumption is that none are the right one. Certainly if I was a higher power entity / god, I'd want everyone to be very clearly on who or what I was, not have a load of variations based on geography and history...	NULL
Honestly if you're asking the question, you're most of the way there.   What helped me understand it a bit more is to "think about thinking". Or some people call it meta thinking. When you're angry, or bored, or sad, or excited - take a second to ask yourself some questions. Why are you that way? Have you been sad/angry etc more, or less, recently? Why? If you act in a way that appears to hurt someone around you - Why did you act that way, and why do you think they reacted that way? Are you more excited/bored than people around you? Did your emotion lead you to a decision that, in hindsight, was particularly good or bad? In 30 years, do you think you'll look back on the current period of life and think it was good, bad, or you won't even remember it?   Try to ask yourself a few of these questions every now and then, and it'll get easier and become more of a habit. Hopefully it will help you become happier in the long term and make those around you happier because they are around you.	NULL

I graduated from high school a year early and then I went to a community college immediately after. I was still 17 when I just started at that community college. I also didn't look my age. I looked younger by about 2 years because people would constantly tell me that I looked about 15 lol. I ended up taking a math class that one of my high school math teachers happened to be teaching. She was around her mid-thirties and was always friendly with me, even during high school but as the semester went on she was becoming a little too friendly.   Being young, naive, and awkward I didn't really notice how inappropriate she was actually being. In private she would make inappropriate jokes about how she wanted to celebrate with me when I finally turned 18 and when I did turn 18 she would make jokes about how I was a man now and legal and that kind of thing. She would even start touching me. She wasn't like touching my crotch or like my butt but she was always putting her hand on my shoulder or hand and even one time on my back. It never went any further than that but now when I think back at it, it was definitely creepy. It makes me rethink all our interactions during high school.	NULL

This is mine too. It keeps getting more and more ridiculous and when coupled with the idea that “if even one person is offended you shouldn’t do it” it gets impossible to ever share in culture because someone will get offended.   We make steps forward by learning about others and accepting them. Every single negative belief that I was raised with has been stamped out by making friends with different people and learning that they are just normal folk.	NULL

I don't know if it's even fair here to say that anyone who's engaged in abusive behaviors is an abuser, that's also labeling and reductive and bound to get the worst offenders of abuse to think they are irredeemable and not seek treatment or go into total denial. You even said people with NPD cannot handle the idea that they have flaws. If someone with this disorder who'd engaged in abusive behavior read this, wouldn't the natural response to be to run away from the label of abuser and not be able to acknowledge their own behavior?  It's naive to say that some disorders aren't more associated with abuse and it's naive to say that narcissists don't frequently engage in this behavior. Yes it's the response to feeling like they are being fundamentally attacked in situations where that's not the case, but it's still abusive.  I think labeling people as abusers is probably more harmful than anything because it would dissuade people from addressing the core cause of why they are abusive, which is this case is narcissism. The solution is not to be naive about the harm NPD can cause the individual and their loved ones, but just more education on the discover itself, probably.  I know other people can be abusive too. I'm saying this is someone who was emotionally abused by a mother who probably has bipolar disorder and I don't consider her a lost cause. I recently ended a relationship with someone with probable covert narcissism and I don't consider him irredeemable either, but he's got to seek his own help and I'm not sure he ever will.	NULL

> I think women are just as attracted to men as men are to women.   I totally agree with the rest of your post, but I'm actually not sure this is true.  I believe the average man finds the average woman more attractive than the other way around, even after you get past the initial visual stage.  That is, if you were to take men and ask them to rate the attractiveness of a random selection of their female acquaintances (not just some pictures of randos), I suspect they would rate them a lot higher on average than women would rate their male acquaintances.  It's likely for the same reason you mentioned--women face greater consequences of sex, so they have an incentive to be more discriminating for the expected benefits to be worth the expected costs.

To enroll in a driving school you need: medical certificate (about 50 euros); revenue stamp of 16 euros; anamnestic certificate (16 euros); two other additional payments of 16 euros each; payment for the Civil Motorization of 26.40 euros; payment for the Ministry of Transport of 26.40 euros; photocopies of an identity document (variable cost). The cost of registration itself is around € 200-250. A single driving exercise with the driving school costs around € 40 and usually around 12 exercises are done before you can take the exam. In addition, both the theoretical and practical exams cost at least € 120 each.	NULL

Needs to not only be free, but automatically issued to every eligible voter without requiring them to lift a finger. There also needs to be a back-up system or database so that nobody is disenfranchised due to homelessness, temporarily displaced due to wildfires/domestic abuse/etc, recent victim of theft or fraud, or simply lost the card.   I don't trust that the federal or state governments can pull this off without disenfranchising some - and those who do get disenfranchised are the ones whose vote is literally their only way to participate. People on the margins don't donate money or time, attend town halls, or join advocacy/lobbying groups.   In the end, the cost is too high and the risk too great, to solve a problem that doesn't really exist. Ineligible voters casting votes/eligible voters casting more than one is virtually non-existent.

I'm not one, but it's definitely possible to be a "gnostic theist" or a "gnostic atheist."  - There are people who believe it would be impossible for the world to exist with a god, and the world does exist, so... - There are people who think that the existence of a god is logically impossible. If, by definition, gods are omnipotent, could they create a stone so large that they themselves couldn't lift it? It really depends on how each religion defines what a god is, but some may be impossible by definition.	NULL
Left: I believe in the efficacy of well regulated market capitalism. Many "left wing" policies are about human rights or making a more equitable market playing field. Capitalistic markets where they function well need many market players with lower barriers to market and no firms having a controlling sharing if the marketplace. Think of farmers markets as an idealized example. The government or an de facto government provides a space, organizes the arrangement of pathways and pavilions, restrooms, emergency workers as the need arises, it regulates the size of the stalls and may try to organize vendors locations based on products sold. Both vendors and customers compete for goods and services. If a customer cannot get a specific product from one vender at the desired price, they have the Oppurtunity to seek the same product from other vendors or competing products.  However it's important to note, in economics, not everything is suitable for a market capitalism. I'd say the important aspect is competing customers and vendors who are negotiating only for the price in fiat currency for goods or services and neither is left in a state of destitution or dispare based on a single exchange. There are many "markets" where capitalism fails. Consider infrastructure. It's untenable to have competing vendors try to service your house with say competing rodes, or competing telephone lines or water or gas lines. In such cases the local government often takes responsibility for infrastructure or monopolistic hyper regulated companies do so. In a different way, medicine is not a capitalistic market: the patient negotiates with their life and wellbeing while the medical provider negotiates over money. There is not a meeting if the minds fundamentally except in the very few rare cases that are more akin to body modification like piercing or tattoos than medical science.  Historically the US' success and technological innovation is a result of the capitaliatic drive backed with tremendous research by the US government. The US has by far the most Nobel Prize winners. However that innovation and growth was also undertaken during times of economic stability for workers was guaranteed and protected by unions. We wouldn't have the standard working conditions or the weekend or the consumerist culture at all without the workers unions providing a checks and balance that the owner of capital must temper their greed by providing profitable working conditions and renumeration to the worker. Without the social welfare programs and unions if the mid 20th century earlier and later eras have significantly less multithreaded growth and greater financial instability.	NULL

Genuinely my first reason was depression everything else like how silly it is, lack of evidence, etc. those cane later. The belief made me extremely unhappy and made me fail to correctly rationalize why negative things were happening in life. Got a horrible mindset that God was unhappy with me and thus these negative things are happening. Resulted in poor grades, a more reclusive social life and being unable to enjoy the things I enjoy. I was becoming suicidal.  I give credit to my dad who saw this and intervene. He's a really soft on religion as in he technically believes but dislikes the church and he's probably as close to agnostic as a religious person gets. You could never tell from any interaction with him. I don't know if he's gone atheist now but it doesn't matter. He never pushed the religion thus I was technically free to go with any.  Anyways to wrap it up. I decided to drop praying, drop any ideas god is watching, etc. That I'm responsible for my actions and if bad things happen I may be able to nullify or correct that. If I don't it would be on me. I think this cured my depression. Instead of wanting to end life early, I'm now in the position that I want it to go on as long as possible. I've now had an overwhelmingly high amount of happy days since leaving bad days to injuries and illness both of which don't really happen much.  Why would I ever go back to the thing that gave me misery?	NULL

Firstly, the modern self-identified strain of ‘liberalism’ is explicitly correlated with mental illness. Studies of the mentally ill have found that they tend to vote less conservative and more liberal (Howard and Anthony, 1977; Kelly, 2014) . One paper, for example, found that 78 percent of mental illness outpatients in Germany preferred liberal political candidates, compared to just 56 percent of the general public. More recently, Kirkegaard (2020) analyzed the General Social Survey data and found that extreme liberals had a 150 percent increase in the rate of mental illness compared to moderates. Conservatives — even extreme conservatives — were 17 percent and 24 percent less likely than moderates, respectively, to have been diagnosed with mental illness.   Meanwhile, Pew Research Center’s March 2020 American Trends Panel Survey similarly showed that 38 percent of ‘very liberal’ whites have been told by a doctor that they have a mental health condition (compared to 20 percent of moderates and 15 percent of the ‘very conservative’).  More broadly, the same strain of ‘liberalism’ has been associated with destructive and unhealthy behaviors. Conservatives tend to be happier (Napier and Tost, 2008), healthier (Subramanian and Perkins, 2009), and — you guessed it — more attractive (Peterson and Palmer, 2017). Believing, as they do, that they have personal responsibility for their lives, they also tend to live longer (Kondrichin and Lester, 1998; Smith and Dorling, 1996). Studies suggest that liberals, meanwhile, are more likely to drink alcohol (Yakovlev and Guessford, 2013), take drugs (Nour, Evans and Carhart-Harris, 2017), and be promiscuous (Hatemi, Crabtree and McDermott, 2017).

I agree.

Once you work retail and fast casual...  Deli meats have a 50% profit margin and soda in a cup from a fountain is like 90%, and every cube of ice increases it. The cheaper the deli meat, the more water they add, so the less you pay the less meat you get. Just get a rotisserie chicken and slice it up for sandwiches, even if you don't finish it you're making a better economy (tho you should freeze whatever you don't eat for soup or whatever).  Women's fast casual clothing is worth pennies per item. Even after you consider shipping, labor, advertising, etc. The expensive items are couture, the crap you buy in Old Navy that gets holes in it after a wash? Literally worth a quarter, if that.   Physical books are pretty expensive to make. Pay for your books or go to the library. If you want cheap books, get e-books and I'm not saying you should pay for them bc hosting a text file is like a fraction of a penny per year.

First of all, I did not make any statement about justification. This person said blocker are not used in cisgender children and I disproved that.  However, blockers are absolutely justified in trans adolescents. It's a matter of quality of life like all medical treatments. Desired effects are weighed against risks. Delaying puberty for someone who is trans makes the difference between an easier transition and a potentially much more difficult one. It is a matter of increased mental health and quality of life, both current and future, for the patient. They will not be on blockers forever, puberty will be delayed, not halted indefinitely.  Statistically, the risk of discontinuation/detransition for trans adolescents who make it as far as receiving blockers is extremely low. This indicates that the vast majority of those who receive them continue with their transition. This means that those who receive them continue their transition into adulthood and therefore directly benefit from the delaying of puberty and being able to make an informed decision on which sex hormones they wish to have in their body and which puberty they choose to go through.  Ultimately they should be the ones to decide if they want to go through blocker therapy or not. I know that when I was an adolescent I'd have been deeply grateful for that option. Instead I went through a puberty that was harmful to me and spent close to 20 years in mental anguish. I had to watch my body change in ways that made me want to end myself every single day. I spent years suffering, trying to kill the pain. Worse I knew the puberty was coming and spent my entire childhood fearing it's approach.  As a physician I swear to do no harm. I would not deign to put someone through what I went through. You do not consider the future outcomes when you make statements like yours, you are just implying that adolescents cannot weigh the outcomes or be aware enough of their gender identity to know what they want.

[meetup.com](https://meetup.com)  I was in a new city and I found a meetup for people around my age (20s-30s). I met like 4 or 5 people and got their numbers, and then just started going to things with them. I probably didn't end up using [Meetup](https://Meetup.com) more than 5 times total, but it got me meeting people which was the goal.   Like a lot of people said in this thread, you can't really be *looking* for a partner because women can immediately tell. You truly have to make genuine friends first, and just be living your own existence in the meantime. This is why having hobbies helps; they keep you busy and they're another way of meeting people.  I also don't want to make it sound like this was easy. I met my partner as a friend a year into moving there and we didn't date until about 20 months in. I was hungry for love and got pretty discouraged during that time. And then, BOOM, she came along and I wasn't even looking for her. It's all about putting yourself in the right situation to be noticed.	NULL

There is still one album that I seem to return to when I am really depressive.  Silverchair's "Freakshow".  I first got that CD when I was in a bad relationship in HS.

I’m not an atheist but as a counterpoint I was raised Christian lite as opposed to heavily religious and eventually I just faded out because I was never really that interested in it but recently I’ve been getting back into it because it’s just nice to be a part of something bigger. I was atheist and I learned all the arguments (one by Ricky gervais comes to mind where he says that any religion believes that every religion but theirs isn’t real whereas he believes all religion, essentially saying that he only believes in 1 less religion than religious people) but despite the contradictions I do believe in a higher power and I truly believe it comforts me and makes me a better person.  Recently started going to church again and I’m kind of saddened by the lack of enthusiasm or community. I do believe in a god and the Christian version works for me but I guess I pray to a more agnosticism version of him.  Also, for the atheists. Isn’t atheism and Christianity simple saying that despite the lack of evidence both sides are talking in absolutes, surely agnosticism is what everyone is as atheism can’t disprove god due to lack of evidence anymore than religious people can prove god for the same reasons?

There might be something that created the universe but it's sure as hell not a christian god or muslim god or whatever. How egotistical do you have to be as a species to think that the universe was created solely for you.   Another big one is that it's just human nature to try to explain everything we don't understand with fairy tales, when we didn't understand lightning it was because of thor, when we didn't have science it was magic and now we don't know why we exist so it must be because god wanted us to, pretty hard to be religious when you've seen that pattern.

I think a really great explanation of this is found in Romans 7 if you’re curious about it! Here’s a bit, I won’t post a huge wall of text in case you aren’t interested, but it goes on beyond this to talk about sin and the law for quite awhile and it’s pretty interesting.   An excerpt: “Do you not know, brothers and sisters-for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives? For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him. So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.  So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.”	NULL
Society saying „oh no you don’t need to be the strong gender anymore“ „you don’t need to be the „hunter“ anymore women are strong“ (which I’m not saying they are not) but I just can’t shake the sense when a man talks about his feeling, cry’s in public, shows vulnerability his surroundings react differently than when a woman does. „Stay strong“ is the most compassion you’ll get back. It’s made me a good more careful about showing my feelings or even just showing I’m hurt, because I feel Society still expects the man to just suck it up.  + point: the trend of equality for both genders (which is something I stand for) has very early shifted to „all men are pigs“ „fuck men“ and in many parts turned into inequality for men..

After spending the first couples years of Secondary at an all-boys school, I was then a bit overwhelmed one I moved to a mixed-gender school. I was young and immature and immediately fell in love with 8 girls (not reciprocated). To my friends I referred to them as my “mamacita’s” (Eddie Guerrero/Chyna story arc was current in WWF at the time). When break time hit, I’d tell my friends that I’m going to find and count my mamacitas. I would then seek each of them out. Just walking past each one of them would count, and then i’d move onto the next. Wouldn’t talk to them, didn’t know how. If they happened to look at me, I’d run away pretty fast.

From Britannia.com  “The nation plunged into mourning, little suspecting that the beloved leader they eulogized as “an ideal American” would soon be revealed to have been the head of the most corrupt administration in the nation’s history. Senate investigations uncovered Forbes’s illegal financial dealings at the Veterans Bureau and pointed to Daugherty’s collusion with the Ohio Gang. Far more serious was the unfolding of the Teapot Dome Scandal. In 1921 Interior Secretary Albert Fall had persuaded Harding to transfer authority over two of the nation’s most important oil reserves—Elk Hills in California and Teapot Dome in Wyoming—from the Navy Department to the Department of the Interior. Fall then leased these reserves to private oil companies, netting for himself several hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts and loans. Fall and Forbes later received jail sentences for their crimes; Daugherty twice went on trial, the first resulting in a hung jury and the second in a not guilty verdict.  Harding was never personally implicated in the scandals, but he was aware of the actions of Forbes, Smith, and the Ohio Gang and failed to bring their corruption to light. By the mid-1920s the public began to regard Harding as a man who simply did not measure up to the responsibilities of his high office. Rumours of his heavy drinking in the White House (at a time when Prohibition was the law of the land) and of his involvement in extramarital affairs further degraded his reputation. In 1927 Nan Britton published The President’s Daughter, in which she claimed that in 1919 she had given birth to a child fathered by the future president. In 2015 genealogists announced that DNA tests showed that Harding was the biological father. Although historians have challenged the veracity of other allegations made against him, most of them agree that he was the least capable of the nation’s chief executives.”	NULL

Exactly the same. There is no reason to when science explains the majority of things (and the places where it doesn’t, I’m comfortable enough in my position of insignificance that it doesn’t bother me whereas I’ve found a lot of people fear not knowing this) and there is literally no proof (no I don’t believe Mary was a virgin and Jesus was gods child or wtv). Science is my ‘religion’ and all I need to explain where we all came from. And besides that, I think worshipping people who haven’t don’t anything is weird, so many bad things are born out of religion (I know that there are also many many good things but those bad things still exist, and those good things can exist without religion), I don’t need a religious community and comfort when I can have any other type, I am missing nothing from my life by not being religious, as well as my belief that it is outdated now that we know scientific reasoning as frankly, I think it’s absurd that people believe some bearded dude in the sky invented the whole universe. I believe in aliens, not magic (and even then I’m not sure if I believe in aliens because earth has so many impossible coincidences that made life possible so that either means it could totally happen again or it was so special it could never happen again, yes I turned this into my belief about aliens).

Kids are often taught its either a terrible offense or hear it thru their parents daily. Either way, they’re not supposed to curse. At the end of the day they’re going to do what they are told not to. I always did what my parents told me I wasn’t allowed to do and ended up abusing it. I wouldn’t say that means teaching them to express it, because it is offensive to some. But maybe putting less emphasis on the need not to, and show them that you don’t need curse words to express yourself.	NULL

Okay, this is different than what I imagined as "cool". What you describe here is something on a more professional, technical level. And honestly, I think it's very respectful--responsible, even!--to the firearm in question to know its technical details and to want to take care of it. Taking pride in your tools is great, too. Keeping yourself fed for a long time with a single shot is not just awesome, but also responsible, due to the decreased consumer consumption.  But there's a line for me.  What I'm getting at, where I draw those lines, are those that make owning firearms a defining part of their personality. Those who own simply for the aesthetics. Those that brandish them and flash them around in the open for no reason. Those who show them off while not showing an ounce of respect for the tool. Those that think owning a firearm makes them "cool".	NULL

My in-laws INSISTING that the Government created this pandemic JUST so we'd all have to get a vaccine so they could track us, and infringe on our rights...  To be clear, this same Government that can't seem to figure out how to properly count votes, created a pandemic, convinced every other nation to get in on the scam, and then produced a vaccine they want us to take. JUST so they could track us and INFRINGE ON OUR RIGHTS!  I'm sure the conversation in the government went something like:  "WE NEED TO TRACK OUR CITIZENS, ABUSE THEIR RIGHTS! Ideas? Anyone?"   "Well, people carry a driver license, have a social security card, are required to register to vote, register for the draft, and get your kid vaccinated to go to school. Most people are carrying a mobile phone, have to show their passport when travelling, and must pay taxes. We have everything we need to track people!"  "NO WE NEED MORE!

It's sad to me that so many people in a religion never take the time to learn the tenants of it.. I feel bad for their kids and loved ones the most because of exactly what you're saying. You can read God's plan right there in the Bible. Wether it's true or not is up to you to decide but in the Bible god's plan was perfection, pleasure, relationship, fulfilling work, and peace. That's it. Then people broke it because God gave choice, imagination, and creativity. I believe lovingly so. Ever since he's been only trying to save as many as he can. I really don't understand where all the other "answers" as you said, "non-answers" come from. I'm sorry someone in your life tried to cover their ignorance with bad answers.	NULL

- Organized religion makes no sense.

I am actually in favor of making it illegal for any government employee to lie to any member of the public in their capacity as a government employee.  They could use as a defense only that they were unaware of the truth at the time, so they thought they were telling the truth, which obviously only works once.  The punishment for a conviction should be that they are permanently removed from eligibility for any and all government employment.  This would make undercover work impossible.  I'm actually Ok with that, but I'd also be OK with a warrant requirement, such that any undercover work must be pre-authorized to the specific lies told and to whom.  Which would still make things difficult, and I'm fine with difficult.	NULL

It's a tie between two events.   A few weeks ago, I was experiencing sleep paralysis. I was stuck in bed, unable to move, there was a shadowy figure at the foot of my bed, the usual things that happen. I eventually "Woke up" from it, laying on my back in bed, drenched in sweat. When I sat up and tried calming myself, I saw that the figure was still at at foot of my bed. It was whispering something I couldn't hear. I got the sudden urge to leave my room, but I had to walk past the figure in order to get to my door. I tried opening my window, but I couldn't open the curtains for some reason. The figures whispering got louder, and it was saying "Don't wake up. Don't wake up." I got off my bed and ran past the figure to my door. I opened my door and stepped out. The figures whispering turned to yelling. I suddenly felt extremely heavy, like I was about to fall to the floor. I struggled and tried walking to my parents room. My vision got darker and it got harder to walk. Somehow, I made ot to their room. The figure was standing over my dad, and whispered "Don't wake him up." I tried screaming, but nothing came out. The figure got closer to me, and before I knew it, it was morning and I was in bed again. I was shaking like a leaf, and sweating like crazy. I'm still pretty shaken up because of it. The dream I had was so vivid, I'm still convinced it wasn't a dream and actually happened.   That, or the time I got lost at Walmart when I was like 6 lol	NULL

In a thread for "controversial opinions", you're near the top of the controversial sort for comments. So there ya go, mission accomplished.  For what it's worth, I think your opinion is undereducated on the varieties of rap out there. Speaking quickly *is* a skill, whether its one you value or not. Creating the intricate rhymes that defines modern rap *is* difficult and requires skill. Not all rap is...   > someone else's samples turned into beats on a computer and someone literally talking fast often with autotune and littering the lyrics with slurs and derogatory language.  However, given your opinion on music in general, I sort of don't imagine you'd be willing to give much of it a chance. If I'm wrong, let me know and I'm sure I can (or Reddit will) offer up some rap that doesn't meet the prior criteria.	NULL

My mom is very religious and I as the youngest always had to go to church with her so I became actively involved in the church (bible study, choir, youth thing). I also used to pray a lot on my own but then I grew up, I started to question things and I saw the discrepancy and hypocricy.   I became disillusioned with the church and then I realized what your options are really when it comes to "GOD".    We either have an idle/inactive God and he doesn't give a flying fuck about what he created (ergo his lack of influence in what happens) or he's not real. The whole devil thing is a scapegoat to questions about God and evilness in the world. Basically through logic I realized that the bible's version of God is bullshit.   Now, I definitely don't believe in God as we "know" it to be but I do think there's something there maybe but there's absolutely no way we could ever possibly know or understand. We're just ants.

When i was in my mid 20s, a crazy blizzard had just started and I had a rare day off. I decided to walk to the drug store before it got too bad outside and while I was standing in line, I noticed this tall white guy 2 people in front of me with his head turned to the side, staring down at me out of the corner of his eyes, with a disgusted look on his face. As we waited, I noticed him looking at me a few more times and got a bad vibe. He checked out and left and I took my time, hoping he'd be gone by the time I got outside. He was not.     I walked out and turned right to go to the sidewalk. Out of the coder of my eye I saw him standing in the parking spot closest to the door. He exited the parking lot and started following me. It was like 2pm and there were a ton of people out, so I didn't immediately panic. I used to work at a coffee shop on the way to my house, so my plan was to get there for safety.      I looked back every now and then and he was walking at me so intently and was getting closer. The way he was looking at me and the ground he was gaining on me sent me into flight mode and I took off running in the snow in my snow boots, which slowed me down significantly.     I made it to the coffee shop and told them what happened. We looked at the front windows and he walked past, looking inside for me. Then a few moments later he walked back the direction he had come. He did this a couple more times, before I was finally pissed and ran outside to....idk, fight him? And he was gone. Then I called the police and looked over my shoulder as I walked home.      I never saw him again after that and luckily I live in a new city now, but that was the first time I had actually felt targeted by someone. Hunted. I'm assuming he thought I drove and was waiting in the parking lot to follow me to my car, but decided to try to follow me home instead.	NULL

I got a bottle for new year’s eve (what a day to write this) back in undergrad. Went to a party with my friends and I remember just not liking it at all, but could drink it and so I did. The next day was the first time my parents found me hungover when I couldn’t stop puking and I had to work. My manager was the kindest soul ever and he just watched me struggle for a few hours before he said “why don’t you just go home?” Until I got COVID this year and lost all taste/smell I couldn’t even sniff tequila without gagging or wanting to puke. This was made worse by my entire family having tequila as their liquor of choice and constantly being around. now I can kinda somewhat tolerate regular tequila, but jose is still a no go.	NULL

From what I recall from my Labor Law course, >90% of CBAs do not allow for “direct dealing.”  The union claims it’s so that the business can’t negotiate higher pay individually with a majority of the workers so that the workers will be less willing to strike for other issues that need to be addressed collectively.  The reality is that it takes away power and control from the union, and they don’t like that. One of the biggest tools for the unions are negotiating pay increases. If employees can get those on their own, they might start questioning the need for the union.	NULL

I appreciate that.   Overall, yes I feel that it’s a very good thing that I don’t get stoned anymore. I’m on meds and the combination of the two are a crazy high. My psychiatrist has told me for years to stop getting stoned. Plus the money and sheer waste of time. I got my first full time job 5 years ago. I’d probably spend $200+ on weed products every month. I’d get stoned after work and not want to do anything afterward. Or I’d wake and bake on the weekends and I wouldn’t end up doing much either.   I do miss the feeling of getting high until the anxiety and paranoia hit. If there was a way to just get a body high without anything in my head, it would’ve been much better. I generally enjoyed getting high at parties when a lot of others were doing the same. NYE 2017 and 2018 in a nutshell for me. However, most of the time I usually got stoned alone or with my roommate. Stoned alone is terrible on my psyche. I started smoking a lot of weed 12 years ago during my second year of college. I lived alone at that time and didn’t have a lot of people over. I’d show up to parties stoned and feeling super self conscious. Then I’d have a bunch of really awkward interactions with people.   So overall, I miss it a little bit but I don’t miss the externalities and opportunity costs. Even 2 years ago, I never imagined a life without weed. It had been a big part of my life for 10 years. A week or two into the March 2020 lockdown, I realized that I might not be able to mentally survive if I kept getting stoned. My stoner friends are jealous that I’m able to be headstrong without needing weed.  I feel very fortunate that I was able to achieve some self-improvement during the pandemic.	NULL

2012 on OkCupid.   We were matched and I had made an agreement that I would not say no to anyone who asked me out. I was tired of going out with jerks and figured maybe I wasn’t the best at picking so I came up with the rule. He wrote to me and I wasn’t interested but I went out with him anyway. I met a girlfriend for dinner before our first date and I told her I wanted to bail. She said to go on the date because what if he was it. I thought this was such a stupid thing to say but agreed I would honor my rule.   We met and I knew it. I remember thinking “oh fuck, this is gonna get serious”. We’ve been together almost a decade now and have two kids and a happy life. Not always easy but it’s happy and very loving and warm. We have been through a lot together and I’m so happy we have each other. Life is better with him.   As we got to know one another we had a ton of overlap in life. Our parents went to highschool together, we lived across the hall from each other for a while (in Brooklyn), we were at the scene of the same car accident, etc etc. We’d done circles around each other for many years and I am forever grateful to the algorithm that put me on his radar.

the problem with you people is that you don’t really take your time to dive into a genre of music and make assumptions based on a few songs you’ve heard, rap can be the most beautiful, expressive and experimental music you can hear. I’m not here to call any genre of music “garbage” because there exists good music in every genre you just have to look, your narrow perspective on music just can’t accept that. Please listen to songs such as “90210” by travis, “runaway” by kanye, “see you again” by tyler, these are all beautiful and expressive rap songs. Not all rap songs are or have to be about “drugs” or “sex” (even tho there’s no problem with that, and most if not rockstars used to sing the exact same thing). If you’re also looking for music with “meaning” or “insightful” lyrics, then listen to Kendrick, MF DOOM, Freddie Gibbs. There’s so much to rap, so it’s honestly such a dumb take to categorize all these different sounds as one the same. The issue with you people is that you really can’t open your ears to different sort of music, and constantly provide these dumb takes online.	NULL

International travel.  People just started getting so pretentious about it.  But at the same time, most places have become so touristy that it’s insane.

But at the same time, because of the sheer numbers, people have trashed a lot of nice places, or turned small towns into English-speaking T-shirt and bar-hop zones where everything is geared to the tastes of people who want to take selfies and buy shirts and get wasted rather than people who want to relax on a beach or actually visit the country and see local stuff.

I was staying with a friend at her university accommodation on New Year’s Eve a few years ago (exactly 3 years ago today infact!). We had some drinks in her house before heading out to a house party hosted by one of her friends. I didn’t really know anyone but made an effort to chat to people.   One guy seemed to latch onto me and in the middle of chatting tried to kiss me. I got freaked out and pushed him off, walking away to find my friends. Weird interaction but I put it down to him being drunk or possibly on something.   The rest of the night I kept catching him staring at me in a not so nice way, and despite being pretty drunk myself it was making me really uncomfortable. He didn’t care if I noticed him staring he was just staring at me with these dark, cold eyes. It was a feeling I’d never experienced before. I felt a sense of relief when we headed back to my friends accommodation for the night.   We woke up in the morning and I realised that my phone had been on charge all night but wasn’t charging. My friend went to investigate and found that the electricity wires outside the house had been cut and tampered with. The repairman told us we were lucky the house hadn’t blown up.   Oh and someone had written ‘SLAG’ on the front door in marker pen.   They never found out who it was but I am utterly convinced it was that weird guy from the party.	NULL

That’s one of the great things about getting off of network television, where you have to go to a two minute break every six or seven minutes. You can tell a story (or a block of a story) in as much or as little time as it takes to tell. Sometimes you can tell where they’re trying to hit a certain attention span or syndication requirement, but then you look at shows like Black Mirror, where the runtimes are all over the board.  With regard to Chernobyl, I think the choice was to either pad out a couple of episodes and risk boring the audience or keep it concise and hope they’ll stay with you for an extra 25 minutes.	NULL
Yes I’m perfectly aware of the symptoms of depression, it’s my job. You are splitting hairs and misconstruing what I am talking about.  The academia and what it is in practice are similar, but the written definition is more limited.  I’m not saying that feeling sad is the same thing as depression.  I’m saying that if you are in a constant state of sadness, what you are experiencing is depression.  Sometimes depression presents as just feeling nothing.  The symptoms… isolation, hopelessness, poor/excessive sleep, appetite changes, mood swings… all of those are just symptom of depression.  They aren’t “depression” just the symptoms that manifest from it.	NULL
It was more a tag along to the answers already given like "Why should I, where's the proof, which God, etc.".  I guess my answer is more of a "Why do I need to believe in something just to conveniently explain the universe". It's hard to put into words.  I guess in the past man would use "God" as the excuse for everything (rain, the sky is blue, plants grow), now in the present they're aren't as fanatical claiming everything was God's doing but there is still a little of that for the things we largely don't understand yet. Just seems like an excuse to me. Perfectly comfortable with the idea of the unknown and if past performance is any indication, God had nothing to do with anything.	NULL

Dude just shut up. The guy that was killed was drunk as hell and attempting to comply with orders that even a sober person would have problems with. It was a pellet gun and while, yes, he shouldn’t have been so dumb with it, he was not shooting at people nor did he have the pellet gun on him when the officers arrived.   The video shows this man terrified, crying and begging for his life, literally crawling on the floor at the behest of the pos cops. Brailsford shot him. Five. Fucking. Times.

Oh yes absolutely! Alessandro really knows how to style and put Gucci on the market. The fashion shows though are truly spectacular and such a stark contrast with regular Gucci stuff you see in popular media.

Back in high school I was in Journalism class, and the students in the class got admin privileges on their Accounts and a separate admin account which had a shared user name and password for everyone to access the journalism drive...  At my high school there were four network drives The "U" drive which was your personal, The "S" drive which was shared and the "A" drive which was the teacher drive and the "J" drive for journalism.... (The last two were hidden, "A" if you weren't a teacher and "J" if you weren't in the Journalism class  The "J" drive had a shortcut to the "A" drive to which I eagerly got into with the shared journalism credentials... I used that to get one of my school award templates, make a copy to my "U" drive and put my name on it and paste it back into the "A" drive with the other ones (it was just one giant folder of awards, separated by grade not teacher, which was dumb but it helped with my plan).  After that I knew that I was gonna use the shared credentials to install things on the computers, so I would install different things whether it was productive or video games, I remember installing Evolution Decompression and a different Warframe file extractor and using it to datamine... I had a burner account that was low on mastery rank and since it was on the school too, I was safe from getting my home IP logged in their servers for a block if it was ever detected....  Surprisingly no one found out about any of this until now....	NULL

But you don't really own it, do you?  It's not ownership when all you own is a bit of text that's special in this one context.  Let's say you buy the Mona Lisa as a physical actual painting.  You can draw on it, you can tear it apart, you can put your signature on the back forever marking it as something that was once yours, you can take it from 1 place and put it to another. You *own* it and have the right to do whatever you please with it. If you want, you can take it somewhere and bury it in a nuclear bunker for 30 years so that noone can see the OG for this 30 years.   Buying the Mona Lisa as an NFT is getting a receipt that says "You own* the Mona Lisa! \*But it stays in the Louvre, you can't modify it in any way, can't even really see the original"  I'm pretty sure NFTs get you no actual rights to the art at hand. Again, you didn't buy the nice picture at the front of the NFT, what you have is a long bit of text that, in one particular application, will return a result of "You own [thing]", despite the fact that this is completely false.  There's no rights to the picture that you gain therefore you can't even count it as one of your posessions,you don't even get the original file (that part is because computers, I could go more in-depth regarding this too).   Like, really, do correct me if I'm wrong but that's what my understanding of NFTs is. Pictures are a cute forefront, but you only buy and receive a piece of text.	NULL

Probably false. Or survived for other reasons. The only reason to drink in cold conditions is to theoretically limit frostbite or damage to extremities. The body naturally tries to keep the core warm since if it goes, everything else does. Alcohol can inhibit that somewhat and send warmth to extremities but at the cost of lowering core heat. It's probably not a good idea if you expect to be in extreme conditions for long.   In this case, it wouldn't have changed much compared to other people in the water since so much heat is being pulled from the body due to water contact and in reality would have caused the heat to bleed faster due to it being spread over a larger surface area.

Communication. You both have to be willing and able to be heard AND to listen. My husband and I literally have not had any major fight (infidelity, finances, family, etc) its all been tiny little stupid things that we usually address shortly after it happens so it doesn't build up into any further negativity.  It's acknowledging when you know you're wrong, or when you both are. Plenty of times where we get into a spat because of a misunderstanding and because of xyz reasons we let it get to us and we make it worse. But by the end of the night we sit down and talk.

This state park 45 minutes from me. It was on a lake and had a clean pristine beach and a comfortable amount of foot traffic.

Now I only go there for the hiking.	NULL
Yeah ikr. It's difficult to understand whether there is definite malicious intent in their actions or not. I remember he told me that everything he did in his life was extremely calculated. His energy turned toxic when I told him I'd run out of my heart pills. Couldn't afford to go see a dr to get a refill, he could have paid for my visit, he has paid for me to visit the dr before. I didn't ask outright and I am aware it's not his responsibility, but he wouldn't have put a dent in his account to have helped me. Anyway my novel here is meant to illustrate that I think ghosting in my case was malicious.	NULL

The concept of “intelligent design” is what disproves the idea of god to me.   Those that have faith tend to push this idea forward, and in THEORY it makes sense that a deity would put some thought into what they “create.” Any designer worth their stuff develops a reason for why they designed things the way they did.   So then I look at the human body and keep the “intelligent design” argument in my mind. As a designer myself I look at the part of the body below the bellybutton and above the mid thigh, and I have a very simple question to ask.   What fucking asshole deity thinks it is a good idea to put a playground next door to a sewage treatment facility? Last time I checked Six Flags doesn’t build their parks on superfund sites.	NULL

And besides all of that i also just don't trust the logistics of it. The Bible isn't the word of God, it's someone claiming their word is the word of God. Fine, God's word is infallible, but man is not. Corruption and deceit didn't just start existing in the 1980's.  "But the Bible HAS to be the word of God. Look how old it is." Yeah and how many times have people rewritten, and reinterpreted it, rewritten it again, edited out the things they didn't agree with,  reinterpreted it again from some older version, added things they swore were in there before, then scraped and re-translated from tales that were passed down for several centuries entirely by spoken word? Also I'm pretty sure the Epic of Gilgamesh is older than the Bible, does that not mean some tale about a Sumerian gigachad and his monster boyfriend are more valid than Jeezus?	NULL

Just some perspective on the fleece - God is not a magic Geenie always giving us what we want. He's a person and chooses to reveal Himself in different ways. The Bible (Jesus in this verse) also says "An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” i.e. Him dying and being raised in 3 days is sufficient 'proof' of His existence.  Also, "you shall not test the Lord your God".	NULL

Brain generated virtual reality. So instead of a screen we blast into our eyes with some gyroscope controls, we stimulate the input for our sensory centers in the brain directly. Then take the output in response to those signals and give them as input to the simulation. The result is an all encompassing simulation that's convincingly real with all the senses involved. Then we can research on a way to get out of the simulation. Maybe that's not the best order idk.	NULL

this is so specific I’m surprised I have a story for this.   When I was in elementary school, our cafeteria had a “salad bar” with all kinds of condiments and fruits and veggies. There were also a lot of salt packets. And pepper packets. Kids would dare each other all the time to try and eat as many of the foods or condiments on the bar as they could.   Needless to say the salad bar didn’t last very long, but in its short time I did a dare where I ate ten jalapeños at once, and another where I had to ingest as many salt packets as possible. I don’t remember exactly how many I ate, but I do remember it was a lot. So much that it made me incredibly sick and I had to go home for the day.	NULL

Collegiate > A trans man student-athlete may participate on either a men's or women's team, unless receiving testosterone, in which case he may only compete on a men's team; athletes receiving doses of testosterone as a part of their transition must apply for a medical exemption through the league, as testosterone is considered a banned substance in the NCAA.

I’m 8th grade I got in trouble for “cheating” when a student across the room asked the teacher for help I just randomly said “the answer is B” I didn’t even know what even the student needed I was just being dumb.

So it was my turn to call and I “called” my mom when reality I just dialed numbers and spoke to the dial tone.

The Penis head has 4000 nerve endings and is what feels the most during penetrative sex. Imagine the feeling of the clitoris when its engorged (during times of how arousal for women) and then its blanketed by a warm, tight tube around around it. Imagine the sensitivity of the clit is most dominant at the head and underneath of the shaft and then the rest of the penis is maybe as sensitive as the nipples. Technically, the penis is half the sensitivity of the clit, but the organ is nearly the same. In gestation, when the embryo starts to become male, the clitoris grows and grows until it becomes a penis, so for the most part, the clit and the penis head are almost the same.   As for the testicles, the scrotum feels similar to the labia does. Its sensitive, but not highly sensitive. Having your balls licked is similar to the vulva being licked.   Recieving head is sometimes cold and not as "full" as vaginal penetration because its not fully wrapped around the penis.   In both cases, when the penis bottoms out (the vagina isnt deep enough to take the full penis) it can actually hurt. I have bruised my penis during sex with some women who werent as deep. Just imagine beating your clit on something over and over again.   As for ejaculation, imagine the feeling of when you (the female) orgasm. The orgasm isnt as long, but the contractions are just as strong. Those contractions a female will feel in the pelvic walls, sometimes in the clitoris depending on the woman, for men, its all concentrated on the penis and a little bit on the scrotum. Generally, imagine the feeling of peeing (fluid traveling through the urethra) but in large spurts of a thicker liquid. The high of climax usually lasts 10-30 seconds for men.     Tldr: similar to the clit being massaged on all sides by intense warmth and fluid. Just get warm massage oil and a soft heated towel and massage your clit, thats 70% of the actual feeling.	NULL

It’s really any form of life again after I die that I wish was an option. Reincarnation would be nice as well, though it would require some kind of a soul just like any other afterlife mythos, and there’s no evidence for souls either.

I think everyone should spend time coming to their own conclusions about the unknowable aspects of the cosmos and there shouldn’t be rigidity to it. That’s why I don’t prescribe to a religion.

There is no reason anything at all needs to exist, nothing-not a damn thing, and it does! That’s god to me. There is no scientific reason something(s) cannot exist outside of our space time, so don’t act like you know there is nothing bigger than us. We are self conscious space dust!

When I was 11, I realized that I was Buddhist because I was born in a Buddhist house.  If what your religion are (at least for a major part of your life) somehow depends on pure luck then maybe it is all bullshit.  Ponder on it for a week or so ( I was a kid, give me a brake).  Then I realize that religion sole existence must be to prevent people from harming one another.  They use fear to regulate what people SHOULDN’T DO which make sense bc without it, people would kill with no remorse (I was thinking in a scenario where laws do not exist yet). After realizing what religion was for, and how they used it to get money from people … well.  It is all downhill from there.   Don’t get me wrong.  Religion also gives people hopes and a sense of communities, which is good.  But I think the manipulations, and the corruption outweighs all the positive ness of religion.	NULL

When I was 19, my dad tried to kill me. For some context, I am adopted and ever since I was a little boy my adopted dad always hated me. He said he only wanted daughters and not a son. All throughout my childhood and even until I was 19 my dad would abuse me. He would hit me all the time and say horrendous things to me. He never liked me. One day I was chillin in my room, and he came up to me and started yelling at me because I didn’t pull the weeds out of the backyard good enough. He then proceeds to grab my hair and start shaking me. I finally had enough of it, and I pushed him off of me. He fell down, and then the next thing I knew we were in the front yard fist fighting. I’ve never fought anyone in my life, and it was soo scary. He then realizes that he’s not going to win, because he’s waaay older then me, so he grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the garage and starts swinging for my knees. Then somehow he pushes me on the ground and starts punching me in the face while he’s plopped on top of me. I was only about 170 at the time, and he was at least 260. I had to use 1 hand to hold him back from hitting me with the bat, and then I had the other hand trying to gain enough strength to push him off of me. Luckily after a couple of minutes that Adrenaline strength paid off and I pushed him off of me. I then grabbed the bat and I called him a P**sy. I then left the house for 6 months, because I wasn’t goin to call the cops, because I have a little nephew who’s favorite person is my dad. So I didn’t want my nephew to grow up without a grandpa, but if I would’ve gaven up, I think I would’ve died that day. Now I am in the Army, and my dad actually calls me his son and is proud of me. We are ok now, but I will never forget the horror and PTSD he has put me through.	NULL

Yey. Throw away time. I am going to keep things ambiguous as possible. Also English is not my native language.  While I was around age 12 my did died in a civil war. After about two years my mom started a relationship with a dad of a female classmate of mine. She had lost her mom about 5 years back. Due to a bus bomb.   Initially I hated this new life. I hated my step dad because I felt like that he is trying to replace my dad. But with time things settled down and me and my step sister fell in love. Mostly emotional support for our trauma I guess. (We never received any therapy). Never had sex because in our culture female veganity is kind of important. But we came pretty close.   This continued to our early 20s even through our university days. Both of us dated others just to cover things up. There was no realistic way for us to progress our relationship. So she agreed for an arranged marriage. Meanwhile I immigrated to a different country. Still we maintained a long distance relationship. After 5 years she found out that her husband was cheating on her. after a lot of fighting he divorced her and she is now single. Luckily she did not have a kid because she was in grad school.  Now she is coming to the country that I am living as a graduate student in few months. In here it is legal for step siblings to get married. But we are not planning to tell anybody that we are step siblings. We actively avoid people from our country so that our secret is safe. We really dont have any idea how to keep it safe forever, but we dont care either.  For the first time in my life since my dads death I am not depressed. I feel positively giddy when I think about future. I dont care if it is incest or not.   We seriously cannot talk about this with anybody. Not even my therapist is going to hear full details. Thanks a lot for OP for this question.	NULL

I was 7 in Sunday School when we first learned about Abraham and Issac.  And I kept asking why God, who knows everything and sees everything, would ask a father to kill his own child.  To which, I kept being told that it was a test of faith.  A test of faith?  But doesn't God already know?  It's a test for Abraham.  Yeah, ok, but again, doesn't God already know Abraham's heart?  Why would he need to test this?  To which I was sent to the office and my mom asked me to not ask questions like that again at Sunday School.  She was ok with us talking about it, but not there.  That logic also didn't sit well with me at 7.  But I'm not quite ready to say there isn't something bigger than me, and I call that God, so I'm not atheist.  I just hate religions.	NULL

Also, high country rivers can rise unexpectedly, fast, by huge amounts.  So it may not be safe to camp close by.  Even if it's not raining where you are, it might be raining up in the headwaters of the river.  I remember wading through a stream that was less than knee deep and 3-4 metres wide on a day trip guided by a national park ranger.  We were walking through a gorge maybe 30-50 metres wide between sheer cliffs and the small stream was meandering across the riverbed between the cliffs.  It looked perfectly harmless, didn't even warrant being called a river.  The ranger drew our attention to the cliffs on either side.  Up to a height of over 5 metres the rock was completely clean of moss.  He said a flood had come through a couple of weeks earlier.  I couldn't imagine how much water had come down that gorge - 30-50 metres wide by 5 metres deep.  Ever since then I've treated high country rivers with a lot of respect.	NULL

When my youngest son was born. There was some complications at birth. Long story short, when he finally came out and he was placed on his mothers chest, he was quiet. No crying. After a few seconds the nurses grabbed him and yelled to me: follow us, and they disappeared out of the room with my son. I was so confused and tired after being awake for 24 hours straight that I was a bit slow to react. I went out to the corridor outside the room and had no idea where they went. One of the nurses came back and grabbed me in to another room where my newborn son was lying on his back on a towel and he was still quiet. I could not even register what the nurses was doing. All I could do was look at his tiny face, holding his tiny hand having the weirdest feeling I have ever felt. In my head it was like: I don’t know this little person. I have never met you before, you are a tiny tiny stranger, but I love you so much already and if you don’t start breathing and screaming soon like newborns should, I don’t think I will be happy ever again.  I started thinking I would have to go back to my girlfriend without our son and tell her he did not make it. I’m crying just writing this…Luckily, after what felt like an hour but was probably just a couple of minutes the nurses managed to clear his airways and he made his first little baby sounds. I got to wrap him in the towel and cary him back to his mother to say hello and spend some quality time with her boobs. He turns 4 in a couple of weeks and is the sweetest, most charming and funny person you could ever wish to have in your family.	NULL

As a kid my mom was constantly trying to find her spirituality so she drag my brother and I to every religion under the sun. Christian, catholic, Mormon, Hare Krishna, non denomination. They seemed basically the same. Then I learned about the mythologies of the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians and realize at their core they were all the same. To explain what could not be explained at the time and to control the masses so a few could hold absolute power. My in laws are all Christian at varying levels, my oldest sister in law is at a Christian cult and constantly sends me letters asking for me to come to her church to be saved. Covid has given us the excuse not to see them which has been nice.	NULL

There are tons of dating sites for it online! I’ve always thought casual dating was fun so I decided to try it just to see what it was all about. In my opinion it’s A LOT like dating off of tinder or any other dating site. Even though the men have the money, the woman still have the power (at least in my experience). You’ll get lots of messages, a lot of them are creepy and not even worth a response. But I figured I’m normal and on there, there must be some normal guys on there as well. Went on a lot of first dates until I found someone I actually enjoyed talking to, was genuinely attracted to, and it’s been a blast :) Not to mention the trips and financial assistance are pretty nice lol Plus he’s not that much older than me so it’s not like I’m selling my soul in any way xD	NULL

Cancer is a huge cost center too. Obesity greatly increases your risk of developing cancer and reduces your chances of surviving it. A lack of exercise is just as bad, even when studies control for weight.  This goes beyond the health care industry really. Overweight and sedentary people have more mental health issues and lower economic productivity. It's an issue so easily fixed yet they place a burden on society in a wide variety of ways. Something needs to be done about our obesity epidemic. Saying "it's their body, their choice" ignores the real negative effects their obesity has on the country at large.	NULL

You are correct, our definition of god being a man who lives in the clouds looking over us and judging us is bs. However, an adjustment to the concept of "what" God is makes it much more palpable for a modern world. If you were to define the original point of infinity prior to the big bang as a "perfect number", then that could be construed as God. When the big bang occurred, and physics, time, space, matter, etc are all generated, they stem from that perfect number. Thus, God is "all encompassing." Since everything follows mathematical equations to the construct, everything can ultimately be solved. Thus, God is "all knowing." And finally, this would be the proof that we do not live in a world where anything truly random exists. Everything would be deterministic. The idea that we are individuals with true individual thought would be false. We are simply a mathematical product of the universe. And while I don't believe in the man in the sky theory at all, I could potentially believe in a physics/math based theory.   However, most people can't wrap their heads around something like this, as it's not comforting, so man in sky theory wins for the masses.	NULL

I remember one year My mom took me school shopping It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister All hopped in the car We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall MY mom started bugging with the clothes she chose I didn't say nothing at first I just turned up my nose She said, "What's wrong? This shirt cost $20" I said, "Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!" The next half hour was the same old thing My mother buying me clothes from 1963 And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips! I said, "Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep" She said, "You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet" I said, "Mom, let's put these clothes back, please" She said "no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show" I said, "This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers But if you don't want to I can live with that but You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks" She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same Inevitably the first day of school came I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick But my mom said, "No, no way, uh-uh, forget it" There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought And those who weren't laughing still had a ball Because they were pointing and whispering As I walked down the hall I got home and told my Mom how my day went She said, "If they were laughing you don't need the, "Cause they're not good friends" For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times So to you all the kids all across the land There's no need to argue Parents just don't understand	NULL

Trying too hard to seem interesting, smart, or specialized in mixed company to the point that it makes others cringe with each sentence that falls out of his mouth. Proper socialization begins early and when a human is lacking those skills (to read a room) it is obvious they are still socially immature.  Pro tip: practice listening skills, asking socially appropriate questions in mixed company, responding humbly and without the need to brag. With time people will learn your special set of skills as they choose to seek out your company. If you give away all your skills in the first five seconds of a communication it isn’t endearing. It is weird and creepy and will absolutely turn off your desired company of others.	NULL

I grew up with my parents both having grown up in a catholic environment. They were believers but not active church goers. My Dad told me. This is what I believe and I'll explain it to you but you have to make your own choices I what to believe in. So I tried going to open Wednesday church sessions with other kids around the age of 12-13. My mind couldn't comprehend why they would thank God for work people put in to make something happen. And then stand around and sing hymns and praise the lord. I might be selfish but if I put all the effort in to make that happen I dont want some "higher power" taking credit. I also couldn't wrap my head around rising to the heavens as it was a tangable plane.

>Nah not everyone wants that.  sure. but OP was asking for individual opinions  >Convenience... Console wins  i definitely agree with this  >Bang for the buck... Console wins. (there is no possibility you can build PC for the price of PS5 or ne Xbox, that will run games as good. And only peripheral you need to have is a TV. Rest is in the box).  i disagree with this a bit. Like I said, over time the PC is cheaper, but initially the console is cheaper. every 5-10 years, you need to replace your console. for PC, every 5-10 years you need to replace the GPU, increase RAM, and/or Mobo/CPU.   and i'm contextualizing this in the Mid-High range of performance/price. you can build a gaming pc for 2k, but recursive costs would be $500-800 every 5-10 years.   >Upgrading you PC sure... Parts aren't cheap, and how many of those will you have to upgrady ny the end of console cycle.  generalizing, you only need to upgrade as often as an entire console is released.  >Cost of games. Deals are great on console store fronts now, and those with disc versions of the consoles can buy preowned hard copies for near nothing.   With PC's, you can still play the games you previously bought. I'm seeing, from Steam, also has great deals (assuming they're comparable to console). Then there's the consideration of Hacked/Pirated games being free.  >There is another factor - I work in front of a computer all day. And yes I do have a nice chair amd comfortable set up at home, but I have no desire sitting in my free time in front of a PC any longer than I have to. I could connect my PC to TV but that would involve either bringing my PC to the living room and messing it up with whole set up which I have no space for. I could buy 20m HDMI cable but that is just a bloddy mess if I don't properly fit cable in, which is another thing I don't want to hassle with. Wireless connection sure... Latency or connectivity erros.  this is more of a situational thing. Everything you say is significant and relevent, though it is a personal preference how you have things setup.  >Because Windows connects 100% of the time and never disconnects(that is sarcasm).  sarcasm, but true. lots of issues with windows, can't deny that.  >And last thing... Post doesn't ask about PC, so you argument is more than invalid here.  i can agree with that. I didn't like the limitation proposed by the OP and just wanted to share my view, so others can consider it (if they haven't)  >I get it PCs are great, but not everyone wants one even if they have cash for it.  i agree. people have preferences and priorities.  >I was a PC gamer for half of my life, but as long as I do what I do, I have 0 desire to invest in one and I see absolutely zero advantages in getting one for gaming for me. A lot of people feel the same, and you comment is just irrelevant in those cases.  Have you tried to play Vigor on the PC? so much more control (and fun) with keyboard/mouse. Would I play Breath of the Wild on PC? not without a controller, because it's optimized for that input, and i can easily use one on a PC. I can also quickly switch to a chat channel and use voice chat. There are plenty of advantages in playing the same games on PC but if you don't have an interest in it, then i fully support your preferrences.	NULL

The hypocrisy of believing in your own God and no-one else’s, sometimes to the extent of resorting to violence was a big wake up call.     As to why I’m not spiritual, it will never be possible to disprove the existence of a non-interventionist God, but it will also never be possible to prove that our universe didn’t originate from the fart of a giant space whale. Point being that to me the idea of a higher being is a cop-out to accepting that we don’t know.	NULL
I have often wished I could believe, I just can't. I'm more agnostic than atheist but I think that even if there is a 'higher power' it's so dang high that we're not even blips on its radar. I've never been able to wrap my head around why a loving god would rule using a system of guilt, threats and punishment. Like, biscuits taste nice but enjoying them means you suffer for all eternity and when good people die young / in horrible ways it's always because god loved them too much or it was part of a bigger plan. Umm... but why, though? No one has ever been able to explain in a way that clicked for me and suddenly made religion believable.	NULL

Lol totally agree… if this was 2010. Been using iPhone for many years and I’ve NEVER broken a screen or bend my phone, even tho android fans talk as if it’s gonna happen by just looking at it. Yeah, the iPhone 6 was a failure with really poor build quality, but that was really long ago… even my five year old Mac is in perfect condition. But, if you do spill water on it and it somehow gets into ports or some shit and destroys your batter… well, thank god they made it so that you can repair it yourself. Not gonna type everything about it so you can just read this article: https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy. Apple specifically went out fo their way to make independent repair ~~harder~~ easier. And the fact that they design products to fail? Since when? Since the battery in the iPhone 6s which is 7 years old where you could get a new one really cheap? Cause idk, my mom has had an iPhone 6s for ~7 years and my dad has had a 7 for ~6 years and nothing has ever broken with them. I’ve had the iPhone 5s until the X came out, and again nothing was broken. I hear more often about android phones screen brakes than iPhones… please, enlighten me with some factual articles about apple “specifically designing their products so that they fail” which was written… well, let’s say written within the past couple of years	NULL

Plenty of less extreme examples too  2. There are so many religions, each with their own god? Why is it that your god, your history, your rules, are the true ones, and everyone else is fake? I think it’s more likely that they are all fake.    3. Spite. I don’t want to be apart of religion because a lot of them are quite shitty. A lot of religions find ways to not pay tax, and like to cover things up such as crime, where that be in a small family or a whole community, religions breed a hush hush mentality.	NULL

Was for a while a semi serious road cyclist, I shaved my legs because a) dealing with road rash if you come off is much easier without hair and b) muscly legs look fucking more so when smooth and tanned, and c) cycling is a tribal sport, so if the pros do it you do it to feel part of the tribe.   Had a mate say it was a "worry". I told him no one defines my masculinity except me, and if his masculinity was threatened by my legs that's on him. He wasn't sure how to react.	NULL

i was in 5th grade. one day, my mom and step-dad dropped me off at my grandparents house because my mom’s company was having a party. my grandma was at her sisters house, so it was just me and my grandpa. i thought nothing of it really. i checked up with my mom every now and then, so i had no real reason to worry. it was around 2am and my mom stopped responding. i started worrying, then i hear the alarm from the front door go off. it’s my mom and step-dad. except, my mom is practically dragging my dad inside. he had vomit all over his suit and shoes. wasn’t a pretty sight. my mom laid him down on the middle of the carpet in the living room. he started talking crazy and it made me uneasy. he then proceeded to throw up a bit. my mom cleaned it up. about two minutes later, my dad starts blacking out, and regaining consciousness. he starts talking crazy again, saying stuff like repeating the number “666” my mom went to go get paper towels and told me to stay there with him. because he was talking absolute nonsense it scared me and i went to the kitchen to go get my mom. he grabbed my hand and looked me in the eye and said “666 is coming” i freaked out and ran to the kitchen. then, me and my mom hear a faint noise. i thought he was throwing up again. we rushed to the room, and he was choking. my mom was panicking and tried giving making him cough it out. after about ten seconds he stopped making noise and went limp. my mom put her head against his chest and her eyes widened. she started crying and giving him cpr. the smell of booze and throw up made me nauseous, and almost made it seem like a dream. she ordered me to go get the phone to call 911, i stood there frozen not knowing if this was real. she yelled at me and said “GO CALL 911” in a shaky panicky tone. i went upstairs trembling stumbling over things trying to look for the phone. i got it and rushed downstairs, she dialed 911 while continuing to give my dad cpr. my heart was pounding. my limbs were ice cold. my step dad then spit up vomit. i was just relieved that he was breathing. the police and ambulance came pretty quick. this one office took me to the kitchen and told me to stay there. i was crying uncontrollably and she hugged me and comforted me. while this was happening, my grandpa came downstairs. they ended up telling my mom that he just had a little but too much to drink (no shit) and other stuff. they ended up leaving after about half an hour. my grandpa looked at my step dad in disappointment. my step dad was still on the floor, but this time with a pillow and blanket. my mom and grandpa ended up having a heartfelt conversation in the dining room which is connected to the living room. my mom told me to go to bed, but i couldn’t. i kept checking up on my step dad putting my hand against his heart to see if it was beating. i ended up falling asleep on a chair in the living room. the next morning, my step dad woke up and told us he had a splitting headache. the last i remember them talking about it is when i was tailing behind them as they walked to their room, my mom said “so you don’t remember anything that happened last night?“ as she handed my dad a Gatorade bottle, and he said, “no?” then they shut the door on me. of course, this traumatized me for a good while. every time my parents would go out i use to breakdown crying. i stopped doing this in 8th grade. i’m much older now, and i have a fear of throw up. they literally never ever talk about it though which i think is crazy. it’s in the back of my mind now, but every now and then i think about this incident. it still gives me shivers :p	NULL

Yeah I hear you that there must be others, and I have listened to it, it’s just very surface level subject matter I guess. Like nothing to make you think too hard honestly. Maybe love is too narrow of a definition maybe it’s like ‘social turmoil.’ Like what about existence? What about struggle?  Not that we don’t need art about love, I just don’t consider it as important or as art about existence art about suffering, art about injustice. Maybe there are songs you could point out that are there but it’s like gotta be a really low ratio, because all I ever hear is that she broke up with somebody.	NULL

By the same convention, you would just put the prefix a- or an- before each word, to mean "without" that thing.  Atheist stems from the Greek word atheos, meaning "without god(s)."

My school wasn't that bad (unless you count drug dealer as a 'profession' they taught us not to become).  Tbh, money was never really talked about or judged by the teachers. The kids on the other hand were a bit more snobbish on that regard. It was some little things though that always highlighted the differences - I was one of the "less well off but still reasonably well off" kids and it was things like being expected to provide your own costume for the school play you were in. When doing Grease, it was just assumed that the kids parents would be able to go out and buy black leather jackets for all the boys. I couldn't even find one to borrow - I borrowed a brown one from my uncle, it was the closest we could get. There was a school trip to British Honduras (from the UK) too at one point. I really wanted to go but my parents couldn't afford it - but most parents at the school wouldn't have batted an eyelid. Some did raise money, but I wouldn't have been able to raise nearly enough to be able to fund my way by myself. My parents were by no means poor, but some things were just a bit out of reach, or would at the very least have required more thought and planning than other parents would have needed to give.	NULL
Oh thank you so much!!! I'm actually planning on moving to Grand Rapids this Spring. I love everything about that state.   Pictured Rocks was originally what put me onto the UP.

Far left. I believe in capitalism, 100%. It is the best way to solve tons of problems. It needs strict rules though, and those need to be enforced vigorously. That puts everyone on the same footing and makes the market fair. What we have is loose rules that are seldom enforced, and even then minimally. Some areas capitalism only hurts, such as healthcare, eduction, and prisons. Those should be off limits for profit.	NULL

The singularity that was the source of the big bang, more an expansion than an explosion. Where did that come from? No idea.   God? Maybe. But then, where did God come from?  If he's always existed? Well, if one thing can exist always, why not another? The singularity could've been a quantum event that we don't understand, the result of incomprehensibly massive black holes colliding, the result of a universe undergoing the big rip, any number of cosmological events we have no way of knowing about. Even known space is so vast we have trouble comprehending it. Outside the radius of the visible universe there could be countless similar events, but at a scale we should never hope to measure.  There isn't any logical reason to assume God over universe in some form. I actually tend to believe in some kind of creator myself, but I'll be honest and admit that it's just because I want there to be a purpose. Meaning behind what seems like arbitrary suffering. I won't ascribe benevolence to it though.	NULL
People shoot themselves in the foot by instantly jumping into a huge caloric restriction. Slow weight loss is much more manageable. For me the best thing I did was reduce my daily calories by 100-200 a week until I got down to a respectable amount. You don't even really notice the hunger because it took you four or five weeks to get to a big deficit and by then you are used to it.	NULL

I'm not defending your ex, but approach matters. My comment is a reply only to your own comment as it exists when I read it. And my interpretation thereof.  This is a big deal and a lot of changes that your asking for all at once. I think any partner could feel defensive about this.   Especially if you presented it like this. As "I want to move, I'm cutting xyz, I want you to cut xyz"  There's a kind of implication that you are willing to make sacrifices so they should be too. But you seem to be jumping the gun about them even agreeing that you need to move.   The dialogue should be opened simply the fact that you aren't happy with your current apartment. If they aren't interested in remedying that then that is a real problem.  Even if they don't agree that the apartment has problems, or rather if they don't think the problems are significant enough to affect their happiness, a reasonable partner should understand that it affects their partners happiness and at least be willing to discuss solutions.  Obviously the solution you are most interested in is moving out but there may have been other options at least for some of those problems such as having things fixed.   Federal said at the end of the day asking someone to move is a big ask. Yes even for your partner. It is not something that can be made unilaterally. Not even considering the financial aspect moving is a bitch.   The other sacrifices you asked him to make are similarly not insubstantial. They should have been brought up in the course of a discussion of how to afford a better place but not things you expected simply suggestions for how you could both save enough money to get a different place.   Again I'm not trying to side with your ex because for all I know he was a cunt. Just trying to say that the way this comment is worded sounds like it could have put almost anyone on the defense in an unhealthy way for a relationship.	NULL

In reality, there are 12-15 unelected aides doing the work for each district, because the congressman has to raise thousands of dollars *every day* to buy enough TV ads to reach 800,000 people.	NULL

Pretending they don't have feelings, or trying to act like some cold, rude, edgelord from a teenage drama.  "I'm used to being alone/ not having people like me.

I'm sorry to religious people for what I'm abput to say but the Bible is just a book to me, there are so many stuff that I disagree with in it.

It depends on the pepper spray.  Whenever I bought pepper spray in the past I would test in on myself to make sure it works.  With all the ones bought from Walmart and such, doing this was fine.  It burned, vision was blurry like being underwater, and it was hard to keep my eyes open like walking out into the sun from inside on a bright day.  Bad but bearable enough that I kept doing it every time I got a new one.  Then I tried it with pepper spray I got from a police supply store.  That was some instant regret.  Throat locking up, can't breathe, burning several times worse than cheap pepper spray, could not open my eyes no matter how hard I tried.  I immediately ran to the shower, blind, and washed it off.  My face was swollen for a week and had chemical burns that looked I had been crying acid tears.  Fortunately my face completely recovered within a week.	NULL

Hi!	NULL
Honestly, I always say he found me rather than the other way around. I was a wallflower at a social event my then-friend invited me to and promptly abandoned me at. Not knowing anyone else, I basically just sat in a corner and waited for it to end (my usual anxious go-to move). My now-husband noticed and didn't want me to be bored and alone so he came over and just started asking me low-stakes questions about myself until we'd found a few commonalities to chat about. He asked for my phone number at the end of the event and just under 3 years later we got married! Amusingly, we were both actively trying to date online when we met, but were on different websites so never would have found each other that way. I'm just thankful my husband isn't afraid to talk to strangers, because I wouldn't have had the guts to start talking first.	NULL

Lol I feel that a kpop hits are flat/ boring compared to other place hits normally due to the kpop indrustry churning out albums like crazy. They put out an album/ep a year at least giving them very little time to actually try something new. Hits from other countries have so much more listenable value as more then anything i can repeat the song multiple times when the song is a true hit and still be impressed after. Not saying there arent any good kpop hits i just feel most of them are bland and tryna copy whatevers popular at the time	NULL

Snap-ish. Went to a church primary school. Had church with sermon every Wednesday. As we were learning about dinosaurs in year 2, we got the Adam and Eve creation story at church. The two things didn’t mesh together and I like and Bristow (my year 2 teacher) more than the vicar so I sided with her. It all crumbled down after that.	NULL

Hell and Heaven. I grew up in a very religious (Christian) house, the kind that prayed every day, never missed a day of church, and read the Bible cover to cover numerous times. I’d say I was a pretty good (by the book) Christian until my later teens when normal teen stuff had me guiltily “repenting” every day for all the ways I was falling short.  In college I found myself hanging onto theism by a thread, under the overwhelming weight of evidence that told me there was no God. That thread was the fear of the 0.001% chance of the  afterlife I’d been raised on.  It was ultimately the strength of the same convictions that kept me trying to follow the “law” of the Christian bible to the letter that ultimately put the nail in the coffin for me.  I went on a journey to learn about the worlds religions to better understand my own, but as my horizons broadened and I learned much more about the many beautiful religious traditions of the world, I also had to come face to face with the realization that billions of people - many of them doing far more than me to improve the lives of others - were, by my upbringing, still going to live out eternity in some kind of eternal torment.  That’s when I knew that even if that sliver of a chance of the afterlife was true, I wouldn’t want to gain admission to a heavenly place run by such a vile creature.  And suddenly (it really felt sudden) it was like my faith disappeared and I felt completely free. 20+ years and I haven’t looked back.	NULL

I was raised in the faith.   But when my parents abandoned me and I was so poor I couldn't keep my lights on or buy food at 19 and I prayed and prayed..... No one answered.  When I was eventually so depressed I decided to take my own life I prayed and prayed..... No one answered.  When I came out of my suicide attempt to find my life in even brighter shambles and needing more help than ever I prayed and prayed..... And no one answered.  When I decided for myself to move to a new town and start over. I didn't pray, I chose for myself. When I got clean and got stable and began to lead a prosperous life, christians called me sinful for reaping the benefits of the career I worked so hard at.  When I decided I was tired of hating myself and decided to finally be proud of who I was, christians called me vain.    So.... That's why.   I got tired of no one answering.	NULL

I'm sure some religious person is reading my post and thinking it's just a flippant tit-for-tat post with no real content, but that's not true.  I'm making an actual point: nobody thinks you have to *justify* not believing in leprechauns.  It just seems obvious to everyone that if there's no evidence whatsoever for leprechauns, then you shouldn't believe in them.  But when you try to apply that same logic to "God", they think you're somehow being unreasonable.	NULL

I don’t always believe people are aware of what they are doing with any real sense of sophistication.  Even when it comes to manipulation.  I think it is more along the lines of “in order to get someone to do x, I do y”.  Having multiple family members like that is exhausting.  My mother was neglectful, financially ruinous, and emotionally, sometimes physically, abusive.  She was good at maintaining presentation.  Towards the worst of it, I shared what was happening with my best friend at the time and his response was literally, “But your mom wouldn’t do that.”  The fuck did I just say? -_-	NULL

In the case of the omnipotent god, it's more akin to proving invisible purple cows don't exist, or married bachelors don't exist, which is doable.

I mean the main thing is like, it's def cool to hate on pop stars, and that's almost always been the case.

I don't approach anything else in my life looking for reasons 'not' to believe. There is no evidence supporting the existence of a deity or deities.  And as our knowledge of the cosmos increases it becomes clearer that our existence is the result of a churning maelstrom of chaotic coincidence.  There are loose rules that govern reality such as the conservation of energy and mass, but the way these laws interact in our universe is ungoverned and wild. There is no design, not by choice.  Does this mean that existence is meaningless? Is this knowledge a curse on mankind? Maybe. Maybe it just means we get to decide our own meaning in life, because in the end, nothing really matters. A double edged sword.  But if there is a God then he is a cruel fuck and we are surely his playthings. I'd rather believe in meaningless coincidence and take my life into my own hands.	NULL

I'm retired, but I had one.  During interviews, he said that family comes first and that I had to take at least annual vacations.  I was salaried but if I had to work very late or on weekends then I got equivalent time off plus.  He said that his job was not to micromanage me but to get obstacles out of my way so I could be efficient.  I'd worked there a short while when my back ached from the terrible office chair I was given.  (I was a programmer in IT.)  I hesitantly went to him and he handed me an office furniture catalog and said to order what I wanted.  A few days later I had a new, super comfortable, office chair.  Anytime some other department was stalling or screwing up and it was slowing me down he'd go talk with them, nicely, and it would get fixed.  I got annual raises and regular bonuses.  (My starting wage was 40% more than my prior job.)  One day he came by my cube and I was on the phone with my wife.  She was at work too.  I had a deadline.  He heard me saying, "I don't think I can pick her up at school even if she's sick.  Can you?"  (Nurses can rarely get away and I knew it.)  My boss heard me and told me to go ... now.  I started up about the deadline and he said something like, "If you want to continue working here you'll go pick up your daughter.  I'll handle any complaints about the deadline."  (This was pre-working from home.)    Anyway, I left.    There are many such examples, and he never once lied to me or misled me.  And he gave me excellent investment advice.	NULL

I really believe that religion was a tool humans developed to establish law and order and explain our biggest fears and mysteries.   The establishment of law and order gave humans basic laws to live by and if you don’t play nice you’re going to go to eternal damnation. This gave early civilization foundation to build on without having a code of laws. If everyone is policing themselves out of fear of what is coming after they die you can reasonable trust your neighbor not to fuck you over. In more basic principles it sets a base line for right and wrong, good ways of life and bad ways of life.   It also was used to explain the unexplainable. We forget that is past times nearly everything people couldn’t understand they chalked up to gods will. We still do this but their are much fewer mysteries. Where did we come from is largely been explained by evolution but we always ask how did life start in the first place. We explain the natural inhuman randomness of our lives as gods will to personify and give meaning to random acts in our environment. And finally the biggest fear or mystery of anything living thing is death. It is inevitable but terrifying to our nature. Religion makes our end just the beginning of something else.   I think religion is still a fantastic tool. People still find great strength in communities of people living by the same values. Religious peoples brain chemistry is different making them more resilient and less prone to depression.   I am just comfortable with things happen that I can’t control and when I am dead I won’t be worried about it.	NULL

The current speculative NFT bubble isn't going to last, and the stolen NFTs are gonna lose all their value when actual utility is realized.

I hope it starts by replacing the privately owned stock markets.	NULL

I think that second/third point about initiative is probably the most common and obvious thing on the list.

Yeah man, i don’t agree at all.  In order to not treat sex as something so personal you have to divorce your sexuality from the humanity of the people you’re getting with. And as far as i can see thats a straight path to psychopathy. You’re sacrificing way too much for so little that its a punishment in itself and it’s upsetting how people can’t see that because they’ve been told lies about casual sex exists and all that.   Yknow before birth control the thought process was that if you have sex…you get pregnant and theres that commitment and vital role to play in the family structure and sexuality, you didnt have any excuses to trivialize sex.   Now with birth control i feel like the way that people treat and look at sex is in a confused manner beacuse we’ve lost what originally tied sex to commitment.   Dont get me wrong, Birth control was ground breaking in a fantastic way. And orgies with my hot attractive female friends sounds awesome, but i also understand that divorcing sex from all these things is impossible, and i dont see how trivializing it will do more good for me then to commit to a relationship with a single partner.

Instantly a story from a sound bowl meditation class I took popped up in my head. Sound pretentious? Reality and the concept of life and the teachings of yoga were lost on this woman. She said she had ALL the certifications and trained with *this* person in *this* country and blah blah. The teacher asked her if she used her knowledge to help and guide others who do not have access to high end retreats while not having to work AND have no kids. She said, "No I'm just working on finding myself and figuring out who I am." Well, you never will and here is why : helping others and hard times make for a more well rounded person. Traveling doesn't *really* satisfy your craving? It makes you happy but still unfulfilled because you didn't really work towards it. I will never forget how pompous and sad she was.

Is it appreciated, though, or are you assuming that the person you were responding to was just swiftly and deftly “corrected” by the other poster and you’re now trying to make yourself feel firmly knowledgeable on the subject by making him feel inferior/incorrect by saying something like “oopsie”?  The belief that your interpretation of what this guy is trying to say is valid is unlikely, if your thinking is so simple and binary that you can only conceive of the idea of a higher power as synonymous with a “god” in the traditional sense.   Further, and respectfully, your arrogance in assuming that you can reasonably correct this person in regard to unobservable phenomena speaks volumes about your ability to think critically about a topic that cannot be answered.

Never said it is. Did not even used misogynistic at the first place. Male & females used, no offense taken, especially in obviously academic lingo.

Dunno why people keep saying this. I thoroughly enjoyed BCS so far, but I definitely don’t see it as better than BB, from the tone, pacing, and story.

I am this statistic. I was a "born again" or "nondenominational" or "protestant" or "evangelical" or whatever the hell they call themselves to pretend like they aren't organized religion for about 15 of my childhood and formative early adult years. Man, I believed pretty hard too. I had some doubts in my 20's and felt like I couldn't trust my pastors and mentors to know the answers. I thought, "Well, if I read the whole Bible then God will reveal his truths to me. I'll go straight to the source." Nope. Lol that flung me straight off the edge of the cliff I had been avoiding. Dropped me into a significant mental crisis as well that I did not recover from for about five years, and I still have generalized anxiety. But my atheist friends were pumped when I told them I stopped believing. And incredibly supportive, too.	NULL
Well I think that it depends on the cultural background. I am from Czech Republic and most of the population is not practicing any religion. So for me atheism is the default.	NULL

When I was 4 years old, I was exploring the backyard of our new house with my 3 year old brother. We found a tool shed with the door sightly ajar. I opened the door fully and looked inside and saw a momma cat nursing a litter of kittens. She hissed at me and I got scared, so I slammed the door shut and ran away, my brother running behind me. A couple months later, I had forgotten about the incident, and I went to the shed again. I looked inside just like before and I saw a mass of decomposed flesh and fur. It smelled horrible so closed it and left. About 25 years later I realized that I unintentionally starved that family of cats to death when I slammed the door the first time.	NULL

"Always" is a strong word, nothing in life is going to be 100% black or 100% white especially not humans who's behavior can change randomly due to getting older or new experiences or whatever else.......but I would also say that cheating on your partner willingly does show a lot about that person personality as a whole, and I wouldn't gamble my chances on a person suddenly changing their personality just because I want it. Chances of that happening are much lower than chances of it not happening , so I say "presume that they most likely wont change" and go from there.	NULL

Admitting defeat or bad choices and wrongdoings is a fantastic ability for someone to have. Again in the Norway episode, he basically ended the ordeal by carefully sliding down the mountain, catching himself with branches and trees every couple of meters, just hoping there wasn't a big unseen drop. He said it was one of scariest things he had done because he felt that tactic relied in large part on hope and he was not 100% in charge of the situation.

God is not even abstract its just a confusing concept in that people tend to use the word god for anything they think is foundational for existance. Its one of those words that there is absolutely no consensus on what it means. I find that impractical.	NULL

I think the real problem is how criminals are prosecuted. Our system says they should only be convicted "beyond a reasonable doubt", but it seems like that doesn't always happen. Of course, I'm speaking from idealism, but when someone has done something so terrible as to kill or rape another person (for example) *beyond a reasonable doubt*, they should be executed.	NULL

A lot of us are bud.   Whats even more notable is that almost every single romance in a movie or show you’ve watched is the result of trauma bonding because it’s the quickest way to force characters together.

Trauma bonding is demonstrated to us “positively” all the time and rarely are actual healthy relationships shown so it’s no wonder we’re all fucked up.	NULL
The best explanation I found was in a book on the enlightenment.  A claim needs more proof the more unbelievable it is.  Someone claims they bought bread from the bakery? No proof needed. Most people buy bread. Bakeries sell bread. The claim follows logically from your experience of how the world works.  You got hit by a car on the way to work? You both work and cross streets to there. Pedestrians get hit all the time. The story checks out.  You saw an albino reindeer? Pics or it didn’t happen. They’re exceedingly rare and you being in the same place at the same time as one is extremely unlikely.  An omnipotent diety pretended to be human and resurrected himself when he got killed? Uh, where exactly is your proof of this act that completely defies all natural laws?	NULL

As a woman, there's flirting with intention and there's flirting for attention.   For example, there's an older lady at work that makes a point to make her boobs touch my husband whenever she's close by. Do I care? Not really. She's not trying to get him into bed, she's trying to get him to notice. She wants other people to notice too, not just him.   When you think she is flirting with you, pay attention to how they act around other men too. I think that will say a lot.	NULL

While I completely agree with you, I have a question that I struggle with personally:  God created His rules to protect us from ourselves.

Why can’t people of the same gender be in love? The only difference is the gender. The body. How is God protecting me by forbidding me to marry the woman I love ?	NULL

"Conspiracy theories" are essentially a byproduct of government lack of transparency through classifying information.

Depends what you're trying to change. Yes everything requiring a system change requires a group effort, but also all changes start from one individual idea that catches on.  The point is you're making that effort to try instead of giving up or putting a blame on someone else (e.g. left or right, corporations, idiots, etc).  That you do something you're passionate about regardless what others say.  Look at those who are trying to clean the oceans.  Started with 1 person making the effort and that eventually turned into a huge group effort.  Or those helping out the homeless by providing shelter and job opportunities.  Hell look at the actions from the groups of people that supported the truck driver that got 110 years for brake failure killing 4 people: Those protests, truck refusals, and letters to the government reduced that dudes sentence to only 10 years which is much better than 110 years.  Then you have all those 1st Amendment auditors that because of their 1 video removed bad cops from their positions, changed public policy, educated local locations, and so forth.  Again just one person eventually making a change by gaining support.  As long as your change isn't racist, prejudiced, hateful, doesn't push religious or political ideology, solves a common legitimate problem in practice, not expensive for the common person (if it is then community raised funds go entirely to the cause), can be joined on by other passionate persons, change can happen.

My town has had a lot of “talk of the town” stories. Currently the main one is a teacher (former teacher of mine) who is facing jail time because they found pornographic content of the students in his phone, laptop, etc. and several students have said that he sexually abused them as teens. All of the guys involved are now of legal age, but when the incidents happened they weren't. It's the talk of the town cause it all happened inside the school, a catholic private school, and all of the guys involved except one are testifying in favour of his innocence, as if there wasn't enough evidence to put him in prison already.

“Religion is the opium of the people” as stated by Karl Marx. Since hearing this quote back in university in my world religion class, it has always stuck with me. I grew up Christian, but have disassembled my faith over the past 5 years. I just don’t care about Christianity anymore because so many people have ruined it and make “Christian’s” sound like bad people. We don’t all picket at funerals, or believe that being gay is a sin.

Maybe not an all around shitbag but he will bring in people to peddle toxic bullshit, pseudoscience, and misinformation and doesn't call out anyone about anything.

Not many people in the whole world (no matter the sex) makes that much. So even before getting to know a guy, they are looking at his bank account. Why? Because they want to be in (or continue to live in) a certain lifestyle? They disguise it as "We just want security for the future", but it sounds very gold-digger. Imagine if it was common for men to say things like that. "I only date women who make $375K or more a year, are six feet tall, and is ok with me being a stay-at-home dad".     You see the double-standard between the two sexes? I just want things to be more about falling in love with the person, than financial benefits. Am I the naïve romantic?	NULL

Summary -was v Catholic...studied it...now not religious but am spiritual see below for details   In college discovered from the priests that the Bible is a fictional piece of work...I was totally shocked and they deducted marks on assignments if u wrote anything about the bible as if it was "let's say gospel"    the bible is actually just a book of myths...designed to help guide people...  I was devastated...during systematic theology classes we learned how to date each paragraph of the Bible using logic/mathematics and were able to scientifically say....each sentence were written and rewritten with sometimes 100s of years between...  So essentially it's a case of Chinese whispers the original messge was lost...so now we just adapt it to whatever we want it to mean...  So this is why I feel qll religions are ultimately the same...people all believe what they want to qnd science can explain most things away...bad things do happen good people...   So I lost all religion...then I opened up to a world of spirituality after using psychedelics...I'm naturally cynical but do believe psychedelics can thin the veil between what we call the world and everything else... I even had experiences with the dead and felt their presence..it could be scary to some but I never felt unsafe...planning to explore this more in time...	NULL

I’m not sure where you’ve gotten that info from.   One of the largest sources of carbon emissions is cows. https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/making-cattle-more-sustainable  Even beyond the issue of carbon though? Environmental degradation. The amount of fees required, antibiotics, and hormones, the amount of agricultural run off generated from factory farmed animals is damaging to the environment in a very real way. Why shouldn’t that impact be minimized? The only real way to do that is to end factory farming and return to older forms of animal rearing that will necessarily produce less meat but in a more sustainable manner. This will have a knock on effect that people will eat less meat.   Can I ask you a question? Do you reject the idea of any life style change being required of you? If so, why?	NULL

People especially really take it seriously lol.  Religion and reason are not incompatible. That's a mindset that comes from monotheism, where the myth is presented as hard fact rather than a myth that can be interpreted.  Which, I mean, fine, you wanna believe that, you can. Free will over everything else. But people act like there's no reason to be religious unless you want to believe in an alternative history and it's be really funny if it wasn't pointing out a really bloody history.	NULL
It started when I was eight (1990). Something was wrong and I hated myself, I wanted basically everything to change - by the time I was 13 I was so distraught I went to hang myself in my closet. I didn't know what was "wrong" with me but something was extremely not right.  Rope broke because I can't tie knots for shit (thankfully)  Got sent to a therapist. I told him all the feelings I had. He legit didn't know what to say or do - this kind of stuff wasn't really well known in 1995.  The next year I found the internet, the ability to search on aol and very early search engines like altavista and (maybe?) dogpile. "Do boys want to become girls?"  The answer was most don't. Those that do are called "Transgender". Then the rabbit hole. I suddenly had a reason to live. Maybe my body was broken or wrong but now I knew how to fix it!  Many false starts and girlfriends who manipulated me to not transition... very stupid... and I'm finally on the path. I wouldn't say I 'pass' in any sense of the world but just to be rid of testosterone and to feel emotions! It's fucking crazy! One of many pieces that felt missing being put back in place.  TL;DR: Confused and sad at age 8. Suicidal at 13, internet showed me that being Trans is a thing, and you can transition. Transitioned - amazingly my depression disappeared by doing so *who'da thunk it???*	NULL

So this isn’t me personally but it’s mainly my mom and grandfather who found this out about my grandfather’s brother.   My grandfather had a military family all of his three brothers went to Vietnam and Korea. He on the other hand couldn’t go due to him having polio as a young child and messing up his leg. My entire family knew about his brothers being in the military and going off to war and killing people. However, one of my grandfather’s brothers was ALWAYS traveling or gone on “vacation” (you may see where this is going)  This all happened when the guy was in his 20s - 30s and then he retired from the military. Going ahead 70+ years my whole family was sitting around the table during thanksgiving and having a good time. I wasn’t born yet so idk what happened specifically. My grandfather’s brother then stands up while everyone is eating and hits his glass with a spoon to get everyone’s attention. He then proceeded to tell everyone he was a spy for the FBI and how he would go on recon missions into Mexico, Vietnam, Korea, and MANY other places. He had just turned 75 which is the age when he is legally allowed to spread the information because most of the information would be of no use by then.   The few times I met him he was a great guy with the nicest wife. He had the classic biker beard and really long hair. He has sadly since passed away along with my grandfather. His stories however still remain!	NULL

I think most people have convinced themselves they believe, but when instinct/human nature takes over, you can step back and ask would they be doing this if they really believed?   An example: Far more often than not when a loved one passes away people are absolutely devastated. If they really believed shouldn't they realize that this life is just a drop in the bucket, and that you still get to spend eternity with that person? But in the moment there's no time to think about that. The person you love is gone and you are reacting accordingly.	NULL

Eternity in hell isn't "tough love," it's hate.    People always say God is all loving, he's not. Even Hitler doesn't deserve ***eternity*** in hell.     Someone who demands respect won't get any from me. Someone who earns respect will get plenty.    One time, a friend messaged me saying they were crying because I was going to hell and they weren't going to see me in heaven.    If they just didn't believe in God, they wouldn't be sad. If they liked me enough to be my friend, if they thought I was a good person, why would they listen to someone who said I wasn't?    Also, choosing any one religion is basically gambling. With the thousands of religions that exists, all of them saying to believe that one religion only, going to heaven is nearly impossible.

I dream a lot of humpback whales. They always find a way in. I’m just suddenly under water. Like I could dip my face into a sick in my dream to wash it and suddenly I’m in open water and ghostly moans and clicks radiate from below. And there they are. Too many of them. Surfacing too fast.  Or a tidal wave rises up so impossibly sharp and tall that I know it will swallow me under, and I see them in the clear water. Big eyes rolling to watch me as the water gets ready to crash. And then wooden boards from shattered ships are swirling around me and sand hits my face and water fills a hundred feet above me, and they are everywhere, bellowing in the dark.   Or I go underwater in the bathtub and suddenly I’m in an aquarium so deep I cannot see the bottom, but I can taste that one of them is rotting down there. I can taste it in the water. Some huge prehistoric beast of a humpback whale skeleton somewhere under my feet.	NULL

Of course it is, it's the whole point, it's why we started this conversation.  Skyrim and Sekiro... are similar games though. So much to the point that with only basic mods applied to Skyrim and suddenly you play in the same way, save your soul in the same way. Couple that with legendary mode and yeah little difference. Well aside from  the story of course, which are of course different.  To translate this back to rap, we have different play styles, different 'mixing' concepts as you put it, but the story is largely the same. Of course I'll play Dynasty Warriors all day, but if the entire industry were doing the same thing I'd get pretty bored. (It's why I don't play Fifa et al).  I appreciate you (and many others) feel that rap is solely about the mixing the voice, the instrumentals, the song structures. The themes, the vocab though... seem to be repeated ad-nauseum. But apparently, that's an 'unpopular opinion'.	NULL
Hard disagree.  Your emotions are yours. And yours alone.  You have no way of knowing how the other person is going to react. If you do, that's intentional.  What if what you just said offended me, or was hurtful? Can I demand an apology, internet stranger? You certainly did mean to offend me by calling me an insensitive dick. Doesn't that then make YOU an insensitive dick for doing exactly what you just said I do? Is it dickception all the way down?  Let's say that someone tells you that the way you chew gum triggers them because their stepdad beat them and always chewed gum like that.  Is that your fault? Do you apologize for how you chew gum? Is it now your job to soothe this person's past trauma? Is it now your job to police everyone around this person so that no trauma-inducing gum chewing occurs? Or is it their issue to work through?  Where do you draw the line? I dunno. I would (and have) err on the side of apologizing, while still understanding that this person has to eventually deal with their issues.	NULL

My parents were really afraid that I would turn into a gaming addict if they let me use the computer too much, so they were very strict with how many hours per week I could play games.  Our family computer at the time made a really obnoxious "beep" when turned on, which you could hear from anywhere in the house, especially if it was quiet.  But only when it was powered on; not when it was awakened from sleep.  Over a year or so I almost never turned the computer off, and logged on most nights after my parents had fallen asleep.  Their strict rules made me adopt the habits of an addict (・_・;)	NULL
Had a badger attack my father at one of our Scottish cousins NYE wedding. My dad went outside for a piss and a badger jumped out of the trees and tried to break my dad's legs. At least I think it was a badger according to my dad's description. My aunt could hear roaring outside and my dad was staggering with blood spraying and his two legs about to seize from under him. My aunt cleaned him up and he continued to drink and party. Next day he was in agony and passed out his pain was so severe. The man had fractures in his legs and literally his shin bone had two major incisions like teeth mark in his shin. I'll never forget that NYE as long as I live. That's why I don't enjoy it.

Another perspective on it is this. Every scientific achievement can be proven and reproved over and over again, and if done by a competent scientist they will get the same results. If we take religion, we are simply taking the word of a handful of people thousands of years ago. Furthermore, I can’t remember who said this, might be Steven Fry or Ricky gervais..? Anyway, someone said that if you took every piece of evidence for religion, and destroyed it, removed all knowledge, and did the same for the last thousand years of scientific progress, and then went forwards say, another thousand years. Then the same science would have appeared, but no religion will ever reappear	NULL

1. Every religion was invented to explain the unexplainable like rain, thunder, earthquake, diseases etc. Now we have science and we can explain those things without the god element. What happens after death is still a mystery but soon it won't be.  2. Contradictions (talking about christianity cause I was raised with it but realised all that stuff pretty quickly but I guess every religion has those) for example old testament says gay people can be skinned alive or sth like that and an unfaithfull wife can be stoned (get hit by many rocks people throw at her) but new testament says to forgive and turn the other cheek and like wtf man decide.  3. It is just the world's oldest manipulation. I feel like most priests then and now just use it to squeez money from people and tell them they will go to heaven for that or do worse things "In the name of god"   4. The people. I have seen tooooo many stories of children molested by priests or other faith representatives but not only that there were human trafficing cases and money loundring but what the higher ups do with that? Just transfer to another State or city no prison, no punishment. Also the people who actually believe, most of the time those people are conservative morons, they don't want to belive in scientific proof but only rely on false priests and religion to judge things and there we have situations like family denying medical help to sick daughter because praying will do the job but no karen it fu*king won't cause it's all BS. These people are also mostly those who don't belive in covid and just don't realise the world changed and force every ounce of this stupidity into others and especially children but if you tell them, maybe give the child the choice  of faith it deserves they start looking at you like a public enemy nr 1 and where is this love and tolerance the bible says about huh?   5. Religion just stops the development of science. I am aware of priests who contributed to it and that only priests where allowed to study in middle ages but  after that the catholic church just slowed every process like wanting to crucify doctors trying to save patients live with new healing methods and remember witch Hunt? Yup, you know basic math or how to make some herbal infusion you are going to be burnt alive you bloody witch thanks to our lovely forgiving religion ( I know I simplified it a little but it's just the "in the name of god" combined with unpunishable hatred and you know the outcome)  6. It's just nonsense every bit of christianity was stolen from other pagan religions just read about christmas for example from where is the tree coming from or all the other stuff I guess not every religion was stolen but when some prophet comes and says some nonsense thousands of years ago maybe it's not the same as doing it now? What would you do if a supposed messiah come today and started a new religion? You would see it as a cult as all religion should be seen.  Stop the nonsense please think, think on your own.	NULL

It is the adoption of a theory of "common language". Left leaning institutions like Second Step are lobbying districts to license their curriculum guidelines that are based on teaching from several theories, notoriously one of them being CRT.

It's highly controversial obviously, and radicals who take it to the extreme would go so far as to call *not* using Latinx as literally violence against them.	NULL

I‘ve written by bachelor‘s thesis about the early history of paleontology and I have never heard such a story, at least when it comes to dinosaurs  (there were the infamous bone wars between Marsh and Cope but their sabotage was just espionage, occassional rock throwing and obstruction of digsites via dynamite, and the latter is debated if it actually happened). Geologists and especially paleontologists are incredibly well-trained in distinguishing fossils from rocks, so the chances of them getting fooled by an artificial fossil (especially if it is made from non-rocky material like plastic) are extremely low.   The closest thing you could be referring to might be the Piltdown Man hoax, but that one was made of actual bone (the skull of a medieval human attached with the jawbone of an orangutan, with the teeth filed down to fit into each other). Contrary to popular belief, the fact that it is a chimaera was already exposed one year after its discovery, but this was not widely publicized, which is why the Piltdown Man could be seen in English textbooks until the 50s	NULL

When people get promoted or gain professional power that is not based on merit and is instead based on something like corruption, sexual favors, bribery, or 'who you know.'

Do not hire your frat brother, your fiancé, or someone's wealthy illegitimate second cousin because of 'wink-wink' networking bullshit.

Your qualifier of “each age group/range, is able to say 1 thing that someone in that age group can almost always relate to. Unless they are amish” is something you can say about any two people, until the amish part which is clearly biased.   We all have more in common than we do different and spending time focuses in the differences without good reason can be dangerous to a thought process.   We can inter-generationally relate and trying to boil people down to their labels is shitty, yeah. If you were to hear I am on the spectrum and treat me a specific way because I am, that is wrong. If you treat me a specific way because that is what I need, then cool.   If you assume you have nothing in common with boomers, you will never be able to see what you do have in common. Assuming a boomer also relates to the rest of their generation without asking them is really short sided.

In my nascent and minimal experience with the industry almost everything for "gamers" is overrated.

I’m asking for the stats because what you said is slander. It’s absolutely not true, and a gross generalization of a party based off of your opinion. Seriously, back up what you’re argument is with a source or else you come off as an unintelligent toddler. Don’t deflect with another question. I responded to one part of your argument asking for proof and you immediately went to the part I didn’t respond to; meaning you don’t have an answer for the first part. This is the problem with people like you and politics. I’m an independent, not a Republican or Democrat, meaning I don’t give a fuck about either party or their leaders. What I don’t like, is people like you spreading an opinion that’s false, solely because you dislike the party. I don’t like republicans, but I also know that the majority of republicans do not wave confederate flags. I live in one of the most red states in the country, and very rarely, I mean very rarely see confederate flags. You’re basically calling an entire entity racist, which is ridiculous.	NULL

I think once someone cheats *on you* there's every possibility that they'll cheat *on you* again.  It's a relationship dynamics thing, once a conceptual door is opened it never really closes again.  That said, cheating in one relationship doesn't mean the person will always cheat in every subsequent relationship. People are capable of change, and every relationship has a different dynamic.	NULL

 I think it boils down to one question: “Are you content in not knowing what the reason of your existence is?”  For as long as I can remember, my answer to this has always intuitively been YES. I can say “I don’t know”, yet never felt my life seem pointless or invalidated.  I want to know, but I won’t accept any shortcuts in finding a verifiable answer. I don’t even think that God acting as a blanket gap filler to paint in all the unknowns is a compelling argument. Its just very lazy and human-centric thinking. As if we humans where really important in the grand scheme of things and the Sun still rotates around the Earth.  We may never find that final answer. But I sleep easy, knowing that we are trying our best to get closer to it and every tiny morsel of additional or corrected knowledge is worth living for. And while I exist, I learn, love, feel, enjoy, amaze, understand, teach, care and encourage as best as I can.	NULL

6 years ago I was gifted a lowered 2000 Honda civic. I decided to take it on a cross country road trip. I usually relied on dispersed camping spots in the middle of nowhere. One of which was way out in a state forest, the road out there was rutted so bad, each tire track was almost a foot deep. So I rode the side with my driver side tires in the middle of the ruts. That little car had no business going on those roads, but she got me out there and back no problem!	NULL

Somewhere between our 1st and second date, I met up with this girl at a mall. Just a spontaneous hangout. At one point we walk by a jewelry shop and she says, "Let's play a game," and leads me into the store.

I'll give a few offerings, I genuinely don't think there's an end-all-be-all book.  Fiction: The complete collection of Conan the Barbarian novels. They were written before Lord of the Rings, has some understanding of real-world influences (since it's roughly based around the same time the Picts were relevant), and he's a varied character and certainly not two dimensional. If you like The Witcher, you'll find a lot of essence in this.  Non-Fiction: The Vikings 3rd edition by Else Roesdahl. I'd never recommend this as a "hurr hurr this is how REAL vikings behaved" but as a supplement to enjoying media. I've grown to enjoy the fictional films and shows on Norse culture because I don't use the book to refute the visuals and plot, but to appreciate how directors work with "palatability".	NULL

Did you know they never bombed Nagasaki or Hiroshima before the atomic bombs specifically because they wanted to see the full effect of the atom bomb? Which makes you wonder how long they were planning on dropping those bombs. Also because the cities had never been bombed they had more people who were fleeing the smaller bombings. The bigger question was do you think it was worth it to bomb those two cities? It stopped the war faster for certain, but at this point Germany had been surrendered for 3 months and Italy had been surrendered for almost 2 years. Japan was alone against the Allies. Personally I think it was just overkill.	NULL

My ex hit me in the face a couple of times and I still don't understand it. We both had some serious mental health problems back then, but there's just a kind of shell shock which overcomes you when the person you love unconditionally strikes you out of malice. I certainly am not a blameless person, but I never wanted to hit or hurt her either. I really never expected something like that to come my way. The emotional abuse I received during our relationship still haunts me, but I'm working through it. I don't think I've told anyone about being hit though. I guess I'm just afraid that people would justify it.  The short version is that she was extremely insecure and hated the thought of me even noticing another woman. One night she got angry drunk and forced me to confess that I had lied about looking at porn. She blew up, broke some shit, hit me, and stormed out. I get that I lied, but it was to avoid that kind of fight over masturbation. It's not like we weren't having sex either. She just had this idea that I should only ever be attracted to her. Otherwise it was "cheating", regardless of the fact I never had an emotional or physical affair with anyone. I even outright ignored most women so that she wouldn't have any reason to become jealous. I did everything I could to make her feel beautiful and cared for. In return she controlled and manipulated me. She heavily implied that I was fat and that was why she wasn't attracted to me anymore. She compared me to a person in her life who actually abused her. Eventually, she coerced our relationship open, which broke me further and turned me jealous and bitter. I didn't really have the tools to do anything else because she rushed into it. I certainly regret some of my words during that time. Eventually, she left me for someone else. It's going to be a while before I can trust enough to have a close romantic relationship again. I don't want to be afraid of my partners anymore.	NULL

I don’t believe in a god because of the way I see religion.   Anything and everything we couldn’t explain, we assumed it was done by some higher being. Creation of the universe? God did it. Where mankind came from? Oh god made us. Why the world has oceans? God flooded the planet.   The bible and other religious texts are stories made up to explain things we couldn’t at the time as stories are the best way we humans learn and share information in an interesting and engaging way.   This doesn’t mean I don’t support those who want to believe. I think religion plays a good part in people’s lives as it inspires them to become a better version of themselves. I, however, don’t get that from religion so I don’t feel the need to follow one	NULL

Worked foreclosure law for 5 years. The number of people losing their homes in America because they got sick, or a parent or spouse or kid got sick, leading to crushing medical bills and/or an inability to work is .... High.   Two stories I still think about... One person had a sick parent move in that needed a lot of care and eventually died, then an accident that killed one of their kids, and then a spouse getting aggressive cancer that required constant hospital trips and ended up dying, all within a year or two of each other.   Another, guy hurt his foot but didn't have insurance so he worked through the pain.... Until the bone popped through the skin a couple months later.  Spent a month in the hospital due to infection, ended up losing the foot, and could no longer do construction work.   We have such a terrible safety net in this country, it's awful to see.	NULL

Dude they’ve literally admitted publicly that they intentionally slow down your phone. It’s planned obsolescence at its finest. They say it’s to prolong the life of your phone, which it probably does, but it makes you more likely to upgrade because you have a slow ass phone. And before that they pushed iOS updates to shut down your battery early. It’s not a conspiracy theory, it’s been proven, they’ve been sued in court multiple times, and they have literally said they slow down phones. Apple is 100% bought in to planned obsolescence, they just put better PR on it to make you happy and it obviously fucking works.  Also let’s be real here the fact that the phones cost $1000+ is laughable, it’s such an inflated price. You’re paying for the name not the product.	NULL

I can relate...my family in my dad's side always loved us but every once in awhile someone would say something like "it is sad you boys are not growing up with the love of Christ in your lives". The funny thing is when you look at my generation within the family, me and my brother's kept out noses clean; I graduated with two different post secondary programs (bachelor's in business and diploma in international trade and transportation); and I own my own house and have a good career. My cousins and other relatives of the same generation who had the love of Christ in there lives stole, did drugs, and basically were all around shitty people.   Not saying religion was causal to their actions but just pointing out religion is not needed to be successful, happy and  a good person.  My issue with religion is the same as others have pointed but also I like to think if there is a higher power out there and a heaven and hell or something like that; that living your life as best you can because you want to vs. what some little book says (a book that has been rewritten time and time again to fit the narrative of rulers and governments of the time) would be there key criteria for if you were actually a good person...bad people/governments/companies do good things all the time but with alterior motives all the time.

Not to be pedantic...but every atheist is agnostic...we can't "lean" toward agnosticism because to be agnostic is to lack *knowledge* of god or gods. Since we still don't have any evidence for the existence of god/gods...we are ALL agnostic...including the religious.  Atheism is a lack of *belief* in god or gods. Many atheists simply conclude, "I have no knowledge or evidence for the existence of god/gods (agnostic), therefore I don't believe in god/gods.  Most religious psychotics, on the other hand, lacking any reproducible knowledge of god/gods, nevertheless choose to believe in god. They are agnostic theists.  Everyone is agnostic. Most of theists. And some are atheists. So, unless you do believe in god/gods, you are very definitely an atheist.  TLDR:  Atheists: "I do not believe in god(s)" Theists: "I believe in god(s)" Agnostics: "I do not know that god exists" Gnostics: "I know that god exists...he's my bunkmate in the insane asylum."

The question is about God, not all religion. So it narrows the scope. The question is what did the op mean by God? That will determine how compatible it is with science.

Archeological evidence?

Was prepared to end my life. Was getting ready. Filled up the tub, got out my little utility knife blade, just...you know. Ready. Huge nerd. I'm in tears, hurting, when all of a sudden, this pops into my head:  "It is not this day." It's from Lord of the Rings. I stop what I'm doing and go listen to the speech. The part that gets me goes like this:   "I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day."   Bawled my eyes out and went for help. LOTR has held an extremely important place in my life ever since. I've had a few attempts since then, but have always had to stop myself and remember that it is not this day. I've been able to get help each time. Spent some time in mental hospitals, therapy, etc.    But those words will always echo in my head. Tolkien amd his works saved my life. I think God put something in my head that he knew would grab my attention qnd keep me going, even years down the line.   Sorry if comment is rushed and messy.

Anyway you've probably heard more about Ringo than you ever wanted to now but if you're looking for the technique everyone's always on about, listen through a solo George Harrison album where half the songs have Ringo and half don't and it'll be pretty obvious.

I would suggest working in the trades industry, they are always in need of employees. Or, if you got a degree, branch off of that. Another idea would be think about why you liked that hobby to help inspire you. For example, maybe you liked painting because you enjoy the self-expression and attention to detail. Find something similar, like pottery-making, or find something completely different, like accounting. Don't be afraid to try stuff, but also make sure that you are financially stable to do so. If you are stuck in retail and restaurant work for now, try searching to other options. While doing so, try and make your current occupation more enjoyable. Perhaps give yourself a reward or something after a hard days work. Or try and trick your brain into thinking it is fun by listening to music or gamifying it. Remember that this will pass and take this situation as an opportunity to learn.  Going on Indeed or something similar would be a good idea to try and find jobs.	NULL

My grandma has it. Best advice I can give you is to enjoy the time you have left with your family who has it. Focus only on the positive. Also, this is a little wierd but there are some small gems in dementia. As their memory fades, they hold onto the most key moments of their life (kind of like core memories from the movie 'Inside Out'). When they see you, they will remind you of a small distant memory of the past that you had long forgotten about. It goes to show how much that small moment meant to them. No matter what it's going to be a sad thing to watch, so try to focus on the positive and be happy together.	NULL

Was looking for the comment. I always get a bit annoyed at the edgy atheist stereotype like we're somehow the aggressors. I'm not in that phase anymore of trying to disprove theists, I understand now that some people have good reasons for believing and it's best not to challenge their beliefs when it isn't harming anyone, but I also don't blame myself for being that way before. In the VAST majority of cases, whenever I would reveal my religious beliefs (or rather, lack thereof), the immediate response was looking like me like I was weird and saying "Why?". Obviously when people treat atheists like that and try to constantly question them and prove their god exists, we're gonna become defensive and develop counterarguments. "Edgy atheists" is just a term theists came up with to shit on atheists who do the exact same thing back to them, and I'd say it's a pretty offensive stereotype.	NULL

I suppose it depends per person. For me the capital T "Talk" is where you establish boundaries, goals, and lable the relationship (girlfriend, boyfriend, fwb, etc). Before the Talk you just go with the flow. Jumping into the Talk too early can come off aggressive while too late can waste everyone's time.  No clue why this guy's having the Talk on the third date and keeping his home a secret till then though. That first month is the easiest casual sex in the world. All perks no responsibility or expectations.	NULL
I have a twin brother and we share a bunk bed (I sleep on the bottom him on top) and I let him go on the bottom bunk if he wants whenever he wants and I let him touch whatever item of mine he wants but when I wanna go on his bed to show him a video or spend time with him in general he gets really visibly upset and raises his voices and if I don’t in x amount of time he physically kicks me off the bed or shoves me out. And when I touch his things and I don’t give them back to him in 3 seconds then he starts punching my arm to the point where it’s not enough to leave a bruise but just enough so that it leaves a sore on your arm for a while. And when I asked him, “Why don’t you let me touch your things or go on your bed? I let you touch my things and go on my bed” then he replied with something along the lines with “I can’t help it” or “I’m sorry I just can’t” and that brings me here to ask the question, is my brother selfish or does he have a mental illness?

I really think the default position, the one that makes the fewest assumptions, is the old hedonistic principle.

It’s not because I’m a woman it’s because of common sense. I didn’t get hurt recently. I actually have a boyfriend. I’ve never cheated on anyone I’ve been with because I actually loved them. Loving someone includes wanting to grow with them. Being a team. If I cheated on them, what does that show? That I don’t respect them enough or care enough about them. You might think you are in love but if you are willing to hurt that person so badly but getting with someone else then it’s not love. You’re just trying to justify your actions because you’re a serial cheater	NULL
I think it’s bad news, and I genuinely don’t see the benefit of it at all. If killing a murderer could bring your loved one back to life, then it would be a different story, but the vast majority of victim’s families either feel no better at all, or worse after watching another human be put to death.   The bottom line for me is that I would never kill somebody, and therefore never suggest that anyone else do so or demand that it be done to serve some weird and perverted sense of justice.   I’ve always felt that way by instinct, but it’s been listening to dozens of firsthand accounts of watching executions that made it absolutely concrete for me. Like… it’s all a very abstract thought until you literally think about sitting down and looking through a window to watch somebody get strapped down to a table and killed. It’s just wrong, wrong, wrong across the board.   Furthermore, I believe that for the majority of people… sitting in jail for your entire life is a worse punishment. The punishment of the death penalty is knowing that you’re going to die… once you’re gone you are no longer being punished and have nothing to worry about. I would argue that the person in the cell next door who is going to spend 50 years sitting in a cage staring at a wall has got it just as bad or worse.   And from a very basic high school debate point of view, I understand that it costs a lot more money to run a death penalty case all the way through the legal system than it does to keep somebody alive in jail for their whole life.   The fact that such an insanely high proportion of “pro-life” people support the death penalty is a whole other can of worms.	NULL

My completely non-religious friend suddenly became disturbingly religious and sent me exactly 30 youtube videos about religion in a span of 2 days. At one point, I told her I wasn't interested and that she should learn to take no for an answer and she replied "I don't feel rejected, you're not rejecting me."  Before that conversation, she harbored anti-vaxxer views and was generally distrustful of science. She watched lots of conspiracy theories, and at one point, she may have joined an MLM.  Too bad, I hope she gets out of that rabbit hole because her imaginary God knows I've tried helping her.	NULL

I was raised Christian. Like church 3/week Christian. I believed until 3rd grade when my divorced teacher, whose second marriage was to God, told me my mom would be going to Hell for having me while she wasn't married. I still get why people believe and why they find comfort in the community, but I couldn't wrap my brain around that at all. It made more sense that my teacher was just making stuff up. I was 6 or 7 and I only remember it because it was the first time I really thought about why an adult would straight up lie to me for no reason. The people who did all the things I associated with the Bible stories I (literally) read every night weren't the ones in charge at any of the religious schools I attended. Belief just kind of fell apart after that, but I still spent years at Christian and Catholic schools.  I still consider myself Christian because I know I have too many biases to consider myself anything else. I will probably always believe there's something greater out there. I just don't really care if you think it's God or a space kid that grew us in his version of a sea monkey farm then forgot about us. For years after that incident with my teacher, I believed that a council of all the animals you interacted with would be the ones to judge you after you died - maybe because there are so many Bible stories with animals that run around judging people or maybe because I was 6.

I don't not believe. I just think that if there's something out there it's very clearly irrelevant to day to day living. It either values free will too much to interfere, can't/won't interfere, or doesn't exist. Otherwise there'd be more signs of its existence. No deity worth my time/energy would require the kind of blind faith modern religions seem to require.   I've spent my life looking for magic. Wishing and hoping it exists. I haven't seen or found anything that works. So, if I'm going to be judged after I die... I'll take it as it comes. I try to live a good life because I want the world to be better for my presence and I find joy in helping others. But I do that for other people and for myself. Not for some hypothetical judgment. But I also know there's more to the universe than I understand, so I won't dismiss things out of hand either.	NULL

Fuck. I thought this was just me. I was abused at jobs because I caught on quick, was always proud of doing a great job and took more work when I finished.

Everything related to religion seemed really convenient to me when I was younger. That may have been because I came from a fairly non-religious family, but grew up surrounded by religious friends. Spend time with religious folks, come home with questions, and parents either don't have answers or have cop-out answers. I'd imagine that's where it started for me. I told my mother I didn't think I believed in Christianity anymore after church one day when I was ~11, and she confided in me that she didn't fully believe either, but figured it was better to keep up appearances "just in case". I think that, on a fundamental level, it comes down to a lack of evidence, clarity, and consistency in most religions, especially.	NULL

Let's flesh this out a bit. One that's not the case, and law is an indirect facet of OP's question but the main focus of it is 'how would I (and other people) as a woman treat somebody'. I answered honestly because we (i.e.,) women are also subject to the question and treatment by society (as it stands). But you're getting stuck on aspects of law.  Whether somebody is charged or stands trial and survives that in being attacked or whatever, is irrelevant (to the question of treatment), that's public knowledge and will be in local media and perhaps national media.That will draw attention in general and maybe also different types of advocacy and associate that attention to/with whatever employer by virtue of the association of employee or partnership (whatever).   If you're in a high-profile position or even moderate, more often than not, an employer is going to terminate as a PR move.  Now comes the question of 'treatment'. Anybody saying that they'd not be concerned or would hang out with somebody who was canceled or is a social media/media pariah with regard to their own job, community, and so forth? Is lying through their face.	NULL

Same goes for vomiting. A couple of times back when I was a seriously heavy drinker (I'm a sober alcoholic), I got VICIOUS hangovers that lasted for days. I would be so sick that I could barely move without vomiting, but also desperately thirsty, so I would keep downing water, which would inevitably come right back up. Once the vomiting finally let up, all the water in the world wouldn't rehydrate me because I'd lost so much of my salts and electrolytes. I had to take copious amounts of Dioralyte to replenish them. On the worst occasion, I ended up in the hospital and had to have rehydration salts and saline via IV. The standard thing they use for that kind of situation is called a banana bag (because the fluid is yellow) or rally pack.  That was the incident that kind of brought home to me how bad my drinking had gotten and set me on the path towards sobriety.	NULL

Late reply, I have no idea why u got so many down votes.  Cheating is horrible, its dishonesty and dishonorable too someone that u claim is the most important person to you in life.

There are many great men who were known cheaters, JFK, Martin Luther, Nelson Mandela. Nonetheless its horrible but we don't know the full story. The spouse could have been cheating too.

It's to give meaning to what is being told to make sure that the person you're telling can properly understand the information you're trying to convey. Because when you just read, let's say a book, or a text, anything like that, you lose 90% of the communication as opposed to when you're talking face to face with someone. So if you want your words to be understood and not taken a different way than you intend to, you should learn the difference between the words so you don't sound or write like you're still in middle school. For instance: There They're  Their  All sound exactly the same and when you read them outlook or in your head, they sound the same.   Like for instance, they're there for their money in your world would be there there for there money. Doesn't make too much sense does it?   There - locational, such as go over there and wait for me They're - they are, when describing people to others, such as They're getting really annoyed with your laziness Their - possessive, as in that's theirs.   Think of if at work you sent your boss an email where you had to use all 3 in the email and everytime you just used there. That would probably confuse and annoy your boss.	NULL

My parents didn’t put much effort into making me religious.  My mother has her own beliefs close to the christian faith but more esoteric   My father is atheist  My 8 y/o self didn’t understand the inconsistencies in the faith. Now that I grew older and learned more, I of course know more or less how stuff happened but it sparked a feeling of mistrust that still prevails to date.  I very much like history and religion is a big part of that. Having learned what the church has done in the past has also not helped in strengthening my faith  I must say though, that the current pope has brought me a bit closer to the church because he seems to be much more tolerant to, say gay people than his predecessors, which I think is quite a step towards the "treat others like you wish to be treated"	NULL

You get an episode like hunting palimens that focuses on a lot of magic things while including some major character development for some characters. Then you also get an episode like hooty helps which is the episode that Luz and Amity get together but also the episode where two characters get magic abilities in a way and we learn a lot about the demons on the island and Eda’s curse	NULL

I think the mystery “third person” in my unattributed but speculated closing quote and yours on the ineffective god could be none other than Stephen Fry. Regardless, that’s precisely who I hear in my head reading those words.   It’s tho eh if “he” thinks it character building for nations of people to starve and be placed under desperate destitution while other fellow human beings on an equal plane in the grander spiritual sense stuff themselves with an abundance of food, god is nothing but a cunt.

Well that depends, but when some high-end local was asked this he said something along the lines of: "You know you have enough money when you go to the restaurant and you don't care or even look at the prices when you order."

Aside from the very few cases like Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and John Wayne Gacy (i.e. prolific serial killers who are guilty even beyond unreasonable doubts), it shouldn’t be used. As plenty of others have stated, innocent people being executed is outright unacceptable, and the financial cost for all the trials and appeals ends up costing more than a life sentence. And the matter of all the appeals and lengthy trials has another problem: punishments for crimes should be need to occur in a timely manner. With the average time on death row currently being around 19 years, the punishment is anything but timely. For some people, waiting on death row basically ends up as a life sentence anyway.  As for reducing crime, its been solidly seen that it the death penalty does little to nothing to lower crime rates. And while it is heavily debated, there’s even a hypothesis called the *brutalization effect*, where it’s proposed that violent crime may actually increase after an execution.  So unless we get another Albert Fish, Jeffrey Dahmer, or Richard Ramirez, that’s a ‘no’ on the death penalty for me.	NULL

heh, Back in college I ended up with a philosophy night class somehow.    Being a night class there was a considerable percentage of adults in it, including these 4 middle aged Karen type women that dragged their Bibles to class and tried to use them to back up their beliefs.   These women could not reason or construct a logical argument to save their lives, all they did was quote bible verses to rebut any argument or theory.     At the end of the class we all had to write a paper on any topic of our choosing, and construct a logical argument to back it up.   Just to piss off those 4 women sitting behind me, I chose to write one proving God is evil.     The instructor was this little old man who looked kind of like a hobbit.   He liked it so much he had me read it in front of the class, and the bible ladies reacted predictibly by loudly assuring me I was going to rot/burn/be tormented for eternity.     Later that summer the instructor that gave me a 4.0 and had me read that paper out loud died unexpectedly of a stroke.     I am sure those devoutly religious ladies were quite pleased and gloating about how God had come through for them and proved his existence just for them by smiting their enemy.	NULL

Yep. The reality is that US Insurance doesn't actually cover the cost of healthcare. You cover the cost of healthcare out of pocket *and then some.* What insurance does is knock the insanely inflated prices down to something that maybe, if you're lucky, won't bankrupt you.  But because so many Americans have no idea what the world is like outside of even their own state, the system persists, when it would frankly be significantly cheaper to cover everyone and cut out the money grubbing middlemen.

I hate these questions, there is zero context to any of these comments.  Some guy may come and read that lack of self reflection is a sign of immaturity and then suddenly reflect on everything.  Equally someone may say that dwelling on past events is immature.  Context is everything; just left an abusive relationship? Probs shouldn’t dwell on that.  A friend confided a secret, probably should reflect why? Drunk a little too much and said something you regret? Fuck it move on.        The ability to be immature is even a sign of maturity in a lot of contexts.  You want to run around in fields with your kids right? Get muddy and scrape your knees.

In my case, that has to do with memories. I’ve created memories of the music my father listened to (Simon and Garfunkel, Dire Straits, Bruce Springsteen, Roy Orbison, etc) because that was played at home. I started to create my own taste in music around age 12 and loved Guns and Roses. The nineties and early ‘00s was when I was a late teen and I like a lot of music from that era when I went out with my girlfriends dancing (mostly hiphop and R&B).   I don’t really create intense memories from current day’s  music. I hear it on the radio and it’s ok as background music, but I’ve never listened to it while being pumped with hormones. Music helped me get through intense emotions, good and bad ones.  I bet lots of current youth will feel the same about current days music when they reach their thirties and forties.	NULL

For me it was backwards. I grew up in Eastern Europe, and religion was frowned upon during that time. It was seen as backward, ignorant and small-minded. So I was never indoctrinated into it at an early age. And once I had the ability to think on my own, any attempts at brainwashing with that nonsense just wouldn't take.  But there was one thing that really helped. The church near one of the places I lived was converted into a museum of history of religion and atheism. It was basically packed chock-full of examples of religion - an Egyptian mummy, a Pagan sacrifice altar, and a space suit, all packed together into one museum. With a Foucault pendulum hanging off a steeple for live demonstrations that the Earth is spinning. And this was in a church. Sacrilege? Maybe, but effective. Made it almost impossible to be converted, when you saw side by side so many examples of conflicting religions (Christians, ancient Egyptians, Norsemen, Pagans, Aztecs, Australian aborigines, etc). It was impossible all of them were right. And it was immediately demonstrated how many of them were wrong, scientifically (planet is round, planet spins, and how Catholic church punished Galileo for it). And this made it impossible to believe in Jeebus, because the whole thing is utterly ludicrous.  So I wasn't so much TURNED atheist, as I was inoculated against religion and not exposed to it to get infected before my brain was ready to fight off its influence.	NULL
On a serious note, I knew a punker gal in high school who had four holes in her ear, always wore heavy earrings and ended up with four very long unsightly holes by her late twenties.

She’s got photos online but I should ask before spilling her onto the Reddit wolf pack.	NULL
Government should be inefficient. It should be doing things that no business ever would, like employing people just in case they're needed, or stockpiling way more than is needed right now because it might be needed in a rare event in the future, or spending way too much money to give access to a program for the last 1% of people that are hard to get access to. The goals of government, and the goals of business are just different.   Everyone agrees that waste is bad, but defines "waste" is very different. It's good to have conservatives around that push to streamline things, but they need to stop trying to run the government like a business. It's not and it shouldn't be.	NULL

Disagree with you. I have a Bose cd clock radio that I bought back in 1997 and it still works to this day. I’ve also purchased two of their Bluetooth speakers and have four sets of headphones (all for different purposes) and they all work and sound great and have truly held up over the years. Also, been an iPhone person since the mid 00s and I’ve never had any issues with any iPhone I’ve ever owned. My Yeti mug is my favorite for my morning coffee. I would counter that their competitors are priced around the same with lower quality.	NULL

Environmental impact of a population can be defined by multiplying the number of people contributing to impacts by the per capita consumption of resources and the resultant waste generated, by the available technology contributing to efficient use and disposal of resources.

You're welcome. Both of these are credible sources by scholarly scientists. You're welcome. Human overpopulation isn't a space issue, but a cause and effect issue.

I'm 27 and happily single now and staying with my parents during my semester break.

If you want something light and pleasant to casually put on while getting started on your morning routine, it'll do the job just fine.

Ohhh my apologies I thought you were trying to disagree with me and prove me wrong. There’s mixed reasoning on why he died but the number one thing said is by hanging. The cell has all rounded corners and you can’t tie a sheet or anything to literally any service.

He had bruising on his face, a deep red and bloody what looks to be rope burn on his neck, and bursted capillaries.	NULL
Led Zeppelin is very overrated. They stole valid artist's work and called it their own while cheapening it's rich quality of the true purveyors of the work. Jimmy Page is a drooling plagiarist unfit for the stage. His studio work is viable I hope he was muzzled to control said slobber.	NULL

Basic logic?  The fact that literally everything about religion and spirituality is what psychologists would call "magical thinking" but we are too pc to point that out?  The idea of having to explain why someone is an atheist is a bit silly at face value...like why would I believe in what is clearly a made up mythology that has absolutely no clear correlation to literally everything humanity has learned about the nature of the universe.

>it's hard to imagine someone like bob dylan or a band like The Ramones to get as famous now as those performers were back then.

They managed to get further with the general public than most "musicians' musicians", though, which is why Hollywood has made them seem retroactively more popular than they actually were.	NULL

The only friendly encounter i’ve had was while living with my slowly dying great grandmother in her last year with dementia. Her husband who i never met died in the room she slept in and his office (where i now stayed) always felt creepy and like i was being watched.

Quite weird but he never made contact with me so kind of disappointed.	NULL

I haven't seen this answer yet but, religion is partially a way to make sense of our place in the universe. I don't think religion teaches me anything I can't figure out for myself. Love thy neighbor, treat others the way you'd want to be treated, and other monicers like that are things I abide by with or without a notion of a God. How does having a God make those things more or less impactful? I can't see a reason why it would.	NULL

Initially my reasoning was "well I have no proof."  Which I do still stand by but there's more to it then that. So many groups preach hate disguised as love for their own benefit based off of their interpretation of some text.  I just can't imagine that if there is a higher power they would be discriminatory.  Mankind has taken whatever and ran with it to fill out their own agendas and I can't stand behind hate.  Of course there are groups who are accepting and loving, which is fantastic, but the loud majority spread hate and I don't want to be connected to something that hurts others	NULL

This.  Adrenaline happens. Serotonin happens. Oxytocin happens. Dopamine happens.   All sorts of neuroendocrine blasts are happening inside your body as a direct response to stimuli in the outside world. Including the behavior of other people.  Those are feelings. They’re facts. Like breathing.   Emotions.  You may be able to control how and when you externalize/express them.  You cannot choose to have them or not to have them.  Except in extreme circumstances, you can can also learn to consciously choose to interpret those surges as one emotion or another.

For example, my father seems to think Colin Kaepernick was the catalyst for the new racial divide, not the system that was killing and abusing people of color. He's went from disliking Ronald Reagan in the 80's to a Trumpet now. He watches Fox all the time and parrots their lies. I point him to actual facts and unbiased sources, which he dismisses as BS. It's to the point where he often tries to argue with me about it as if he's trying to convince me I'm wrong. He is over 90 and just started acting like this, slowly, about five or six years ago. I don't want to avoid him in these final years, but who wants to be around such an argumentative, biased person? FYI he isn't experiencing any senior moments, he is quite lucid.	NULL

Well I guess in some ways justice is a mental construct - in some cultures cannibalism is totally fine for example. I think our progress is a result of our cooperation though, not some objective set of rules. As we grow as a species we change our concepts of right and wrong, and I think it’s been for the better - slavery used to be just. Justice is a social agreement, where we come to an understanding of what we consider acceptable, and usually the idea of justice is that if you hurt someone there are consequences, which is a pretty universal concept among humans, or at least between those who claim to be from the same group. Even as we are now there is no absolute of justice present in the human race, nor am I sure there has ever been.	NULL

Killing is wrong, Mr. Murderer. So we’re going to… kill you. Something about that logic always messed with me.

UK 16 years old you need to either be in school or on an apprenticeship.

My mother was driving my sister and I to school. I was about 7 at the time. I was telling my mother about the bible stories we were learning at school and all the psalms we were singing. I asked her why we don't do that nor go to church.  My mother pointed out to me that no one talks about whether God has a mother or a wife and she told me to think about that. She also pointed out to me that there are many religions and neither are necessarily wrong. She said she doesn't believe in the Bible, but she believes in a divine force which has no ascertianable corporeal form.  Effectively, this brief conversation has motivated me ever since to positively question life. I love learning from all cultures and internalising what I learn to inform my own habits and goals. When I say I'm an atheist, it's not because I disagree with religion - I just don't put all my eggs in the basket of a divine being. I believe in relying on myself for support. But I do also believe in giving back and pursuing charitious efforts, as per the teachings of most religions. I'll continue to synthesise everything that I learn into my own discipline.  I think there are so many ways to interpret things and I believe that any document which raises many contradictory interpretations shouldn't, for this very reason, rigidly dictate your entire life.

Sorry, but I have a hard time understanding your comment. It's not clear what you are referring to with "it(?) does", this has" or "when they". Can you edit your comment and add the subjects at the appropriate places? Thanks.   Btw: I did not address the question of insurance or financing. That's a separate issue. In both cases more competition would be good. Although it might be less likely, since civil servants would have no incentive to bring costs down.

Foreign doctors can't provide the same quality you know. League issues.... Bad people work everywhere, state, private enterprise. Doesn't matter. Competition, property rights, democracy and other mechanisms to ensure alternatives are your best protection against excessive exploitation.	NULL

I have never found, nor been presented with any evidence of God or a higher power. No religion has presented their case in a way that doesn't logically contradict itself at some point.

I think you have your own perspective bias going on.  I already acknowledged that religious history is covered with inhibiting knowledge at times.  But overall, religious institutions have been the primary organizers of knowledge until the printing press happened.  And even after that,  many religious institutions have provided extensive funding for scientific research. For example, the science of Seismology is often referred to as The Jesuit's science because many founding scientists were Jesuit priests. Additionally,  the physicist who first developed the Big Bang theory was also a catholic priest.    I'm aware that there are many darker occasions, such as the Muslim theocracy in the 1100ish that devastated Baghdad as the intellectual center of the world. And the more recent evangelical movements fighting against evolution. Among many others. But there are many examples of religious infrastructure holding organized knowledge together.    Also,  I'm a professional scientist, with a STEM PhD.  Yor	NULL

The why. They will say characteristics and qualities in the dinosaur that typically mirror their personality or by feeling them out a little bit, the personality they wish to be.   Example: a brontosaurus because they are chill and tall as the trees.  This is a person that will go with the flow and get done what they need to but like to have an wider view of how their efforts contribute to the whole. They chose a plant eater, so they most likely won't be confrontational and might not be competition based like a dog eat dog kind of predator. It's all in the why...	NULL

1. You didn't give me an example of what I asked, you gave me a completely unrelated thing save for the fact that someone from the LGBT+ community was involved.  2. It ***hasn't*** demonstrably happened, because for all the articles I've read, only two of them mention that the rapist is gender fluid, and none of them say they were ***pretending*** to be.   So your response didn't even meet the original criteria, and upon closer inspection, it isn't even evidence for your argument.   And, upon further investigation, it appears that even the perpetrators status as gender fluid is in question, because of the whole two articles that mention it, it was the victim who says the perpetrator is genderfluid. What seems most likely is that was just tacked on because he *allegedly* was wearing a skirt.	NULL

Spanish speaker here living in the U.S. The term Latinx gets used more IN ENGLISH than in Spanish. It doesn't bother me--just a demonstration of how language changes to make room for new things. I usually hear it in Spanish in people's self-identifications: "soy Latinx." That's admittedly rare. In English, I hear it more. My university bureaucracy uses it as a gender neutral term, so you could argue that it's entered into English bureaucratese. I'm not particularly interested in the purity of any language, and neologisms happen all the time. I'm not trying to protect either English or Spanish from the word Latinx. It's true that Latino/a and Hispanic are more common terms, but in my mind there's room for Latinx too, especially if someone prefers it.	NULL

Here are my airport rules:  1. Do not, under any circumstances sass the staff. They are just doing their jobs, don’t deserve shitty attitudes, and they can ruin your holiday in a heartbeat. Don’t be a dick, treat them with respect, don’t break the rules that are there for everyone’s safety, and everything will be fine. 2. Don’t be the guy who puts stuff in their hand luggage, that isn’t permitted in hand luggage. If in doubt, check before you leave the house.  3. Airports are warps in space and time, yes it is ok to have a pint in the departure lounge at 04:00, f*** it you’re on holiday - just don’t be the guy who has too much and has to be carted off by the people in point 1.  Here are my airplane rules: 1) Do not, under any circumstances sass the staff. They are just doing their jobs, don’t deserve shitty attitudes, and they can ruin your holiday in a heartbeat. Don’t be a dick, treat them with respect, don’t break the rules that are there for everyone’s safety, and everything will be fine. 2. Wash your hands, clean the fold down table if you can. They’re gross  3. Do not put your feet in between the seats in front of you. This is awful awful behaviour and you deserve all of the dirty looks that you get for doing this 4. Do not passive aggressively force your knees into the seat in front of you. It is not the fault of the person in front of you, that your airline is packing humans into a metal tube like sardines. We have a long ass flight ahead of us, be nice.  5. Airplanes are warps in space and time, yes it is ok to have a glass of wine with your tray meal at 04:00, f*** it you’re on holiday - just don’t be the guy who has too much and has to be restrained by staff, and then carted off by airport staff on landing. No one likes that guy. 6. Upon landing, you do not need to stand up and collect your bag from the locker at the exact point of seatbelts off. You have at least another 15 minutes before this is necessary. Wait until you are told it is time to disembark, unload your luggage, depart in an orderly fashion.

A lot of people don’t know this, but the US had a lot of Nazi sympathizers in WWII. A lot of Germans are high level in finance, and it was actually American banks that continued to allow nazis access to funds after most of Europe cut off all financial ties.

I have mixed feelings.   On the one hand, I really enjoy that the interest/creativity/technology exists enough to create indie games. Back when I was 14 and played SNES literally all night, I would've killed to be able to bring my ideas to fruition (mostly silly ideas now, but at the time it would've been awesome).  On the other hand, the retro 8 bit style games have kinda gotten out of hand. Combine that with the fact that many of them seem to conflate "fun" with "ridiculously difficult precision levels", and I'm just too old for that noise. Having a pixel-wide platform surrounded by insta-kill spikes in the middle of a level where dying means going all the way back is frustrating, not enjoyable.	NULL

It depends on the trauma.   If it still affects the individual into their every day adult life, e.g. repeatedly having abusive significant others, addition, stealing etc. Then a method known as Schema-Therapy is one aspect that could greatly benefit. Essentially, it's a loop of habits, be it played on repeat (like PTSD / CPTSD), habits like picking the wrong social circle is like the snake eating itself - the traumatised individual needs to work their way through finding that loop, accepting it happened and then progressively working on forgiving themselves, loving themselves to help them getting through it.   There are more, intense, methods to get through trauma as well, by very specific professionals. It's called "EMDR". Essentially putting the individual through a sleep-hypnosis to relieve the trauma & conquer it, master it, forgive it, heal it.  I'm not sure what country you're in, or if this is available for you, but hopefully these will help you, or the person you're worried about. Best of luck.	NULL

Raised as a humanist. I always enjoyed learning about religions and mythologies though.  However, I am a very very rational person, as in, I want to know everything and how everything works, as well as that I have reason be my guide in making decisions, which is also reflected in my beliefs.  I have found nothing, anywhere, to suggest there is a higher power. Apart from the Bible, which was supposedly written by God / the word of God. The issue is, the only place the Bible is referred to as such is within the Bible. There are no other sources confirming this. That makes it incredible.  Lastly, events such as turning water into wine or walking on water or curing diseases and lost limbs are physically (by the laws of physics) impossible.	NULL

Whatever there is inside people which allows them to believe in the Christian God, I don't have it.  I never did.  My mother used to take me to church every weekend and I listened to the pastor with scepticism and disbelief.  When I attended the children's sessions, I asked pointed questions that were never satisfactorily answered.  I knew I was an atheist when I was 10 years old only because I hadn't understood what an atheist was before that point.  Nevertheless, I have softened a little bit, and I would describe myself as more of an agnostic now.  There is so much out there that we don't know and so much of the way the fabric of the universe is put together that is counterintuitive and amazing that it seems prescriptive, and the height of hubris, for me to state that I know that all of the things that we can see and experience in the universe is all there is.  I don't know that and I don't think anyone does.  However, I am fairly certain that Jesus was only a human being who tried to help humanity in the only way he could.  I am sure that God is not a big human in the clouds passing judgment on us for telling white lies.  Until we actually get evidence (and there are a lot of calls for evidence in this thread!) of what a higher power is and looks like, we can only speculate - and I think our prior speculations are certainly wrong.  It may be the case that a higher power exists but is truly ineffable, unknowable, because our human brains are so limited we cannot grasp it.    So I would say I was agnostic, because I can't believe since we don't know exactly what the higher power is, and I can't not believe because I don't know everything.	NULL

canadian left (id be extremely lefr in the US)   - what i see is when right wing is offended they insult you. When left wing is offended, they selfrighteously try to make you believe you are unethical and should be censored. Don't get me wrong, both don't know how to deal with being offended, but censorship creates taboos and that has never helped in history. If someone comes out as racist, telling them to shut up wont help them. They will remain just as racist as they were. But trying to discuss together what can hurt others and still offering some amount of respect can (sometimes) make them change and at least help yourself understand them a little more. Maybe youll realize they arent even racist sometimes, they just dont consider the same things as you as being racist. But we hide behind either insults or higher morality bullshit.	NULL

Between 1980 and 1982 much of Australia was surveyed from the air to estimate density and distribution of kangaroos. The area surveyed covered 5.8 million square kilometres (75% of Australia) and included most of the distribution of the three commercial species. Numbers were estimated as 8.3 million red kangaroos, Macropus rufus, 1.8 million western grey kangaroos, M. fuliginosus, and 5.0 million eastern grey kangaroos, M. giganteus. The unsurveyed eastern highlands probably hold a further 4 million eastern greys, allowing a tentative overall estimate for 1981 of 19 million kangaroos in mainland Australia. The numbers of both grey species are known to be underestimated due to conservative correction factors.	NULL

Here's why find this idea baffling. If someone chooses to live as a man, fine. No skin off my nose. But men don't have the organs to bear children. Maybe someday there will be a way to transplant them. For now, though, conceiving & bearing a child is limited to individuals born with those organs. And once those organs are in use, by default you're back to living as a woman. At least that how it seems to me.  Maybe it's something I just don't get, because I've never wanted to either live as a man or bear children, much less do both at once.	NULL

When I was in elementary school we had a Jeopardy game. It was 3 teams of 4 students and we played it in front of a big group of kids. Whichever team won got to have a personal trip to Pizza Hut. We placed our bet for final Jeopardy and the question ended up being stupidly easy. We had only bet $1k though and we were the last to answer. We weren't gonna win.   I had the whiteboard and I just lied when it was our turn and said we wagered a lot more than we actually did. I never turned the whiteboard around and no one but my team knew. My team was all upset about it... until we were eating pizza lol.	NULL

My parents not meeting my wife.  25 years ago when I was in my mid 20’s I was dating a girl who had a child from a previous marriage (married very young as the norm in her state - Utah) she was divorced when I met her.   I’m from the East coast and although my parents were incredibly liberal compared to hers they were still conservative. I was worried about how my parents would react especially my mum to find out my girlfriend had a child and was divorced. My parents were loving and fantastic people just traditional.   After 5 months of dating my girl I knew she was the one and I decided my parents needed to know who she was and meet her. (They already had an inkling I had someone but respected my privacy). My girlfriend was brilliant and she never pushed me to tell them and she understood why I was a bit hesitant unless I knew it was serious.   At 7 months after 2 months of knowing I wanted to marry this girl, I was still trying to build up the courage to tell my parents (I’m a massive over thinker and looking back I twisted myself up for no reason).   My parents were killed by a drunk driver a week later. It was the darkest time of my life, guilt and anger rushed through me. My girlfriend was there the whole time and loved me even when I didn’t treat her so well as I was grief stricken (not an excuse though). She helped me pack up the house, she helped me grieve and she is the reason I most likely didn’t kill myself.  We got married a few years later and my surviving family adore her. We went on to have 3 more children and every day it makes me sad their grandparents never got to meet them and their mother.  Christmas this year my mothers sister and I were talking in the kitchen and she said ‘your mum and dad would of been so proud of you. You have a beautiful family and you need to know that they wouldn’t of loved you any less for falling in love with a single mother, in fact your mother would of been proud’  I needed to hear that, but 25 years later and it still sucks knowing I didn’t have the courage back then	NULL

Conservaform Jew: I don’t see G-d as some actual nebulous sky daddy that watches from a distance. I see G-d more as a moral concept in people and our achievements, if we consider we are made in his image; our science, medicine, technological advances and any achievements that lift up and enrich our human race are all G-dly. G-d can be found in mutual aid and philanthropy, in social justice work, anywhere people are doing good for their communities and those in need. I see G-d in nature and how plants and animals have evolved and adapted to best suit their environments. This is not to say that if you don’t believe in G-d you cannot be moral. As long as you are doing positive things, supporting your community, and not actively railing against being religious you have my respect.	NULL

Several reasons.  1) I have never seen anything that requires "magic" to be true. In other words a model with God is less parsimonious then a model with out god. Thus additional flexibility is not supported. For me personally this argument is completely persuasive, it is fundamentally how I know anything about anything.   2) magic tends to be human centered and the universe is not.  3) there are about 4200 known religions. I don't believe in all of them. Many people don't believe in almost all of them. The one (or few) they believe in tend to be common in their area / time. If people actually studied all of them then picked one it would be less clear they are a cultural thing instead of a "true" thing.   4) this is the least persuasive argument but is the most important to me personally. It is less narratively  satisfactory for there to be no magic, purpose, morality, freewill etc. And I want the truth to have the least narrative satisfaction. Sir Terry Pratchett said he would rather be a rising ape then a fallen angel, I take it a step further and don't really want there to be an 'I' at all.	NULL

 The movie industry is in a state of change. With television and the internet stealing audience attention, the movie industry is finding it harder and harder to make money. They're slowly starting to embrace streaming services, but they're trying to hold on to their old business model for as long as they can. It won't work. The movie industry is going to have to completely change the way it does business, but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon. People are still going to the movie theater and buying DVDs for as long as they can, even though that model is on its way out. I think that a lot of people don't want to see the old way of doing things die. I myself am sentimentally attached to it. However, I also know that it's foolish to cling to the past when the future is clearly better and more efficient.	NULL

Some things i look for - How he treats the people around him  - How he talks about his family - How hard he works ( i go to a hella expensive college so, usually this is how hard does he study in comparison to joking around and not taking it seriously.)  If he treats other people like poop, not the kind of guy I want to be around. If he talks about his family in a poor manner, im suspicious at the very least. People don’t always have good familial relationships but often times they’re spoiled and the people who don’t talk about their families are the ones that have had a poor experience with them (NOT true for everyone of course) Many people at my college are there on scholarship and you can tell who’s not just by the way they act. I prefer people who are hard working rather than someone who’s there on daddy’s money and isn’t even trying. I also have an unwarranted vendetta against “class clowns” and will automatically hate you if you think you’re funny by interrupting class time by pissing off the teacher.   Physically, I’m honestly not too fussed. Small things like basic hygiene (BO is. major turnoff. Please shower or use deodorant. Clinical strength is v nice.) The only thing is that I don’t seem to be interested in overweight people. I don’t mind some chub, but I just don’t find obese people attractive. (I know i might get downvoted for this, I’m sorry, you’re still handsome / beautiful you’re just not my type and that’s ok ;-;)	NULL

I said at its price point, and when you’re talking about a $2000+ laptop your primary audience is professionals. You have a point on touch which is certainly decisive and many Mac users wish Apple would bite the bullet and add it to its laptop line. But look at any laptop in its price range and compare them. I’ll make it easy, they all look pretty much the same.   I’d argue that at its price point, your main comparison is performance and battery because those are your primary differentiators. That’s the only think you are getting at that level that is different from a $1000 laptop. And a few of those I will immediately disregard, very few users care about upgrading their laptop and I/O is basically the same. And of course OS preference comes into play because that’s what we’ve been talking about the whole thread.	NULL

I don’t think that « once a cheater always a cheater » is a law or 100% true. I think the likelyhood of cheating depends on the person’s maturity level, if they learned anything from cheating or from exceptional circumstances. If you meet someone and they take no accountability or can’t explain the cheating in a mature way (saying because you didn’t feel loved is still shitty in my opinion) then I can guarantee you that the cheating/shady behaviour will continue.   I accidentally cheated once on someone and can guarantee that I would never do it to my spouse. I remember when I was seeing this guy (not my current spouse) back in 2015. We were official for 2 months when suddenly he just ghosted me. I texted/called him multiple times but he never answered. We were long distance and a broke uni student so I really couldn’t afford to go to his house. After 2 weeks of silence I thought that it was a sign that he wasn’t interested in me anymore. I was sad but moved on really quickly. I went online to find dates. I had met a couple of guys when a month later the guy I was originally seeing texted me. He didn’t offer any apology and denied he was gone for a month. I really tried to bring up that he ghosted me but I didn’t really want to rock the boat as I was in the middle of my exam period and didn’t want to make him feel bad. I didn’t tell him I went back online. I saw him one more time to go to the movies. He wanted to get physical but I didn’t want to so I just texted my friends to tell them to pick me up from the movies. He was getting sus so he asked to see my phone. I was worried he would see my text to my friends, text to the guys I was talking to online and my online dating profile. I told him no, left the movies on my own and walked 2 hours to get back home. I should have just told him straight up that it was over when he unghosted me. I truly thought the relationship was over after a month of no contact so I dated other people. I know it wasn’t my fault for seeing other people after being ghosted because 1 month of no contact is no bueno but I shouldn’t have lead the guy on any further than after he contacted me. I would never see other people if I’m with my spouse unless I was sure the relationship was over.	NULL

It feels good but probably not as good as you think. The warmth and slipperyness is nice but, like Halo, it's the same few seconds again and again and again, then you cum (sex, not halo... ermmm) which is hte best bit obviously BUT that feeling, tbh, is fairly unrelated to physical sex as orgasms tend to feel great no matter how you got there.  Oral, however, is far nicer, especially if the giver is in tune with your likes and dislikes and has some talent at it.	NULL

If simply seems to me that the most likely situation is that, for most religions,  some guys a long time ago tried to explain something or claim they could explain something.  I think the basis for a lot of religions is people trying to explain things like comets and pregnancy and death, mostly through folklore and storytellers and later politics and written words.  I don't think any religion is more correct. Thor could be real.  It would be nice if a benevolent God existed, though it seems really unlikely to me.	NULL

>Were they good singers and instrumentalists? At least for the standard at the time.  Paul's vocal range is huge (something like A1 - E6) and he was basically a virtuoso bass player. Also plays a bunch of instruments. He's a very impressive singer and instrumentalist.  John was a good singer. Good rhythm guitar player. Basic piano playing. Not top tier at anything, but well rounded.  George was just an okay singer in his Beatles years. His voice really weakened as he aged. Very good guitar player imo, but not top tier. His genius on guitar was more to do with innovation than technical prowess.  Ringo was not a good singer. Underrated drummer, but not top tier. Just super solid. Plays well on unusual beats and in many different styles.	NULL

I’m ngl the last one is true for me. Had 2 exes that went out without me and then got raped. I got zero issues with trusting them, but I don’t trust other guys. It’s at a bar, there’s alcohol, she’s all dressed up, I’m not there, I just don’t want bad things to happen. Idk definitely been a point of contention in a few relationships, but one of the exes it was some random and the other was a close friend I regularly told was creepy. When you see the aftermath of that kind of act; the pain, the change of personality, the feeling of disgust she has (one was super close to her dad but after never was), it just breaks you as a person. You can’t help, you can’t soothe it, all you can do is support from a distance. It changes too much. Sex became a worry for me, I was hesitant to initiate and do anything. Was told by the first ex she thought I hesitated cuz I thought she was a slut, despite me saying why I hesitated so much, and it broke our relationship.   If you’re a guy who takes advantage of girls fuck you, literally please do us all a favor and just go away. Get help.	NULL

This is why Catholics believe in purgatory and Eastern Christians usually believe in some middle-ground for the deceased between Heaven and Hell. It's also why they believe that both faith *and* good works are necessary.   If someone died without ever having the opportunity to convert to Christianity, they wouldn't be damned because both Catholics and Orthodox Christians believe that one can't accidentally or unknowingly be evil enough to be damned. *However*, they also believe that all humans are capable of some degree of evil and whether they're Christian or not, they'll hurt others in their life.   Purgatory is where one's soul is purified and the, "wages" of their sin are paid. They believe that even the souls of believers will spend time in purgatory before Heaven and living a Christian life is merely the process of purifying oneself on Earth before you die. Catholics also believe in indulgences (not paying for them anymore though) as a means of helping the souls in purgatory get out sooner.   In a more practical sense, Christianity isn't just about getting into Heaven, but it's also a distinct system of ethics that Christians believe should regulate human behavior, Heaven or not.	NULL

I grew up in a non-church-going (even on holidays) Christian (nominally protestant, I guess?) family.  What ultimately set me on this path was the contradictions between religions.  Christianity's various sects all having conflicting ideas despite worshiping the same God, with each claiming to be right.  The big 3 Abrahamic religions being basically in the same situation, but generally more bloodthirsty about it.  Then moving beyond that having other religions worshiping entirely different gods.  Every one of them is convinced they're right, and someone back in some far-off year got the word handed down to them that they're right.  If that's the case, whatever being is up there has a serious case of multiple personality disorder, and changes what constitutes the "right way" on a whim and fails to update their followers, effectively damning everyone else.  As I got older, that coalesced into looking to science and provable facts in place of faith.  I identify as Agnostic, so I'm open to the idea even so.  However, that the only "evidence" anyone can point to toward a god of any sort can either be explained by natural processes or only exists in a book purported to be the word of said god, it's pretty weak reasoning.

One of the biggest misconceptions that I see from religious people / Christians / Theists about atheism is that they are told that atheism is an active state of disbelief in god. In reality, there is a bit more nuance to the matter. There are belief stances and knowledge stances. Epistemologically, they are separate, but often lumped together by intellectually lazy Christian apologists, which is why there are so many people with misconceptions about atheism.  Atheists simply lack a belief in one or more gods. An atheist may also be agnostic, which is where a knowledge stance comes into play. A person may come to the conclusion that they haven’t discovered a reliable reason or suitable evidence to believe in one or more gods so they are agnostic. From this position comes even more nuance.  Those who are gnostic atheists claim that they have knowledge of whether god exists or does not exist and thus lack a belief in one or more gods. Per Russel’s Teapot analogy, you’ll find that it’s quite rare to run into a gnostic atheist or anti-theist. Personally, I am an agnostic atheist because this analogy makes the most sense when trying to wrap your head around the arguments that theists make for god.   Those who are anti-theists (also often agnostic) take it a step further and actively disbelieve in one or more gods, but it’s important to note that atheism and anti-theism are axiomatically different positions.  Atheism: simple lack of belief; not active disbelief  Anti-theism: active disbelief  Christian apologists (philosophy) often intentionally misconstrue these epistemological nuances in order to indoctrinate people into believing or paint a picture of implicit bias that is used to discredit atheism as a belief stance.   Simply put, religious belief is a learned behavior.  Everyone is born lacking belief in one or more gods.  Meaning that everyone starts as an atheist (lacking belief in one or more deities).	NULL

Had this happen to me while flying to a job interview right before thanksgiving holiday years ago. Followed the gate number on the paper ticket I got and waited at the terminal. Didn’t fly much before so stayed there until someone else there bolted away saying someone about a gate change. Went to look at the departure list and saw gate changed. Didn’t make it in time to the gate and was about 2 minutes late after running across O’Hare. Was on standby the rest of the day but by a miracle got on the last flight of the day to connect to Dallas super late. Bombed the interview due to the lack of sleep and stress the next day. Also didn’t help I missed an ‘optional’ meet and greet dinner due to missing my connecting flight day before. I always use digital tickets now to double check the gate now.	NULL

But I couldn't outrun it. But when it caught me, the process would start all over again. The same scene with me running from the corruption played over and over again in my dream.	NULL
The orbit isnt a perfect circle, but an ellipsis. The two points closest (perihelion) and furthest(aphelion) from the sun dont coincide with the summer and winter, which as stated earlier depends on the angle relative to the sun. In 2022 the perihelion was on the 4th of January.  The distance difference from the sun isnt that big that one would notice it without measurement instruments.   Perihelion | Aphelion ---|--- 147,098,291 km (91,402,640 mi) | 152,098,233 km (94,509,460 mi)	NULL

I work in a cocktail bar and I had a guy come in and ask me, whilst reading through the menu, “do you have any less gay cocktails?”. I was surprised that question came out but humoured him otherwise. Told him what garnishes each drink has, what the ingredients were and such. He then decides he’ll have a Duke of Wellington because “that doesn’t sound as gay as the others” and it was in a ***biiiig maaanly*** glass.

A few years ago I bought some cheap silverware at walmart.

I had an eureka moment, however, when I realized those long handles made them great back scratchers.	NULL

That covid is not real. What happened was all the government's of the world got together and agreed to start forming a world wide communist government. To do this they decided to start saying a new virus was spreading. They told drs to say people who had a common cold actually had covid. Then when people would die or other causes they would say it was actually from covid. Hence why more older people were dying, they died of other conditions but the blame was pit and covid.  Then to start the controlling on the mass populations they enforced lockdowns to control where people went send what they could do.  Then the vaccine was introduced and this was another tactic to control the population. Get the vaccine or you can't do this etc.  Not to mention that the vaccine wasn't even fully tested and it's actually super dangerous, a good way of harming everyone.  Soon everyone who took the vaccine will either die early or become infertile, leaving the government with more control over the survivors.   On the same note the person I know who believes this also thinks the government is blocking other drugs/medicine that would work against covid, as it would stop people getting the vaccine and giving them less control. Does that mean they believe there's a cure for covid? But I thought covid wasn't real?  Hard to argue with people like this.	NULL

I used to volunteer at one, it was a local business not a chain. It received so much stuff that it started trying to give it to other thrift stores. Eventually they couldn't take it all either.  An enormous amount of stuff would end up getting thrown out, and not just garbage. Perfectly good items that the business simply didn't have room for and no one else would take.  Half the time it felt like the place was just a middle man that took people's stuff to the dump for them. Simply because it didn't have the space.

Hello, I am from Fiji and in terms of the water situation we are not too deprived cause we are blessed with an abundance of fresh water sources. The only problem is the infrastructure to get the fresh water to the people. The pipes are old, pumps are not really working as well as it should. SO yes the Government is using money from taxes on other things.  However when you do buy Fiji Water you do help the community where the Fiji Water factory is situated on. They get paid lease money plus the company does do some charitable work around the country.  I don't know how much Fiji Water is sold in your country but here in Fiji it is sold for $3.20 FJD (about $1.50 USD) in supermarkets. Just wanted to add this.	NULL

Ok clearly you aren't understanding anything so let me really explain it. First google a world map and locate the Ukraine, Russia, China, and Taiwan.   Russia has had a never ending desire to get a warm water port on it's Eastern side. Russia has *always* wanted this. It also doesn't want to have a non-ally right on their boarder. The only way to get to the Mediterranean and prevent a non ally boarder is to take the Ukraine (and eventually others) because while Crimea is nice and all it's essentially sea locked in the Black sea which isn't connected to the Mediterranean. Now the US has started being ally-ish with the Ukraine since 1991-ish meanwhile the Ukraine has been trying to warm up the EU to let them join. Russia has issue with this because the whole non-ally neighbor thing. Now Russia is really *really* eye balling the Ukraine because so far Biden has made an ever loving fuck up (and pretty much all the world agrees with this) in Afghanistan withdrawal. So for this moron to stand up at a podium and say "yeah we'll just supervise to make sure things don't go bad" in the event of Russia going into the Ukraine; he's essentially told the world our allyship means nothing and gave Russia the green light because we won't do jack shit.   So why does this matter? I mean it the Ukraine it's not it's super important to us right? *Right?* Well the issue has to do with Taiwan. You see just like how Russia has been on a foreverquest seeking a warm seaport, China has a foreverquest to take Taiwan. And I mean that literally they said "not if, when". As far as the CCP is concerned Taiwan has always been theirs and has always been apart of the CCP. Now Taiwan has been our for real ally for far longer than the Ukraine. If China thinks we aren't going to defend our allies that *when* might be really god damn soon.   The issue with China trying to take back Taiwan? Well firstly you have the whole WWIII potential, but also assuming we just don't help to avoid that. Taiwan is the worlds *largest producer of computer chips*. It's not just the amount the produce (and they make a lot) it's also the infrastructure around that production and the quality of chips they make. No one else comes close to Taiwan computer chips.   Have you seen the current prices of cars lately? I actually looked up my 2017 Wrangler which I bought new off the lot in 17 and I could get *only $3000 less than I bought if for* if I used it for a trade in. Why? Because there is due to Covid a serious chip shortage. Cars have chips, your computers has a chip, your phone, has a chip, your TV has a chip, your router has a chip, your god damn refrigerator has a chip in it.   Is it starting to make more sense why China taking over Taiwan is bad? I mean besides the whole Sinicization of Tibet, or the Uyghur genocide, and other unethical shit they've done. It is becoming more clear why Biden speech making the US sound like a flaky ally is bad? Have you notice how during this explanation I've not mentioned Trump once because he has nothing to do with Biden sounding like an incompetent leader? I get you don't like Trump and that's fine. But stop pretending like Biden is competent just because you don't like Trump.	NULL

While I do love Col Potter, I do think Henry really showed a better reason for why Radar was so valuable. But Potter being career military did give a really interesting character compared to everyone else who was not.     As for BJ I think the thing that made him really great immediately was two character traits (both shown early on), which showed him similar and different to Hawkeye. The first being that he was just as happy to have fun and get drunk with Hawkeye. The second that he was actually faithful to his wife; to the point where the one time he had a one night stand he had a full existential crisis. When it would be really easy to justify him looking around at everyone cheating and go with the flow.     Also, I really think switching out Burns for Winchester was a great progression. Burns was just antagonistic. Winchester was not antagonistic, but was an opposing force in many ways, which caused organic conflict in the swamp.	NULL

I think you need to be an optimist to be an agnostic or a theist. Tons of basic human desires get neatly packaged and dealt with by the introduction of a higher power. Purpose, death, the question of if what you're doing is "right." But that's so convenient that it perfectly matches up with what someone scared would come up with to distract themselves, and the lack of evidence for any religion points to that being the case.  I'd greatly prefer to be religious, it'd solve a couple of debilitating fears that I have and there aren't any downsides if you take the modern approach where you find the things you disagree with to be allegorical. But that's like telling me that you'd give me a hundred thousand dollars if I believe in Santa Claus. I just can't.	NULL

For the first question, not exactly - while there's some choice involved (mainly between two different procedures, and several different ways of doing both and options within that) it's not quite design-a-dick, the "customisation" boils down to "generally smaller than average, size determined by luck" with metoidioplasty (which builds on what's already down there) or "roughly average/proportional, size determined by the surgeon and where the tissue to make it came from" for phalloplasty (which makes a whole new penis using tissue from another part of the body, commonly forearm).   The option to hook everything up to pee standing, and the option to add balls is a choice available with both, and there's a handful of extra things someone having phalloplasty will need to consider (eg, what type of implants (if any) to go for to be able to get it up, like whether to have a pump (which will replace one ball) or a flexible rod, whether to have medical tattooing or further surgery to shape it, etc.   I made a big list of all the pros and cons of everything, and tried to narrow down what's most important for me (eg, metoidioplasty has a shorter recovery time - but is usually small. Phalloplasty looks more like the average dick when it's finished, but takes more operations and has a higher risk of complications, etc)  The best way I can explain going on T is that it's like second puberty. Most of the changes were fairly slow and gradual, but it's made a massive difference to me. I've been on it over 5 years now, and am so much happier  Facial hair was one of the changes I was really looking forward to - and I'm very happy with it. It does annoy me when it gets too long though, mainly if it gets to the length that my moustache goes in my mouth or if my beard gets too bushy.	NULL

What existed before the universe existed? You can’t say atoms because atoms are a thing. If atoms existed then how did they get there. It is way more believable that if there is a design, there is a designer. You don’t look at a TV and say “ ah yes, this created itself and powered itself on” you would say the Koreans designed and build it together. Atoms rubbing each other and then 14 billions years later we have life and consciousness? Will never make sense to me idc what angle you come at it with. Give me 1 example in the real world (since Atheists only believe in “real”) that has a design but no designer. Just one example.   Also God didn’t come from nothing he always existed.

I heard once a really good quote. God is the picture of higher consciousness while the devil is higher ego and you have to overcome your ego to become more conscious and essentially this says that people will always seek this higher consciousness or be consumed by their ego and whether that is god or science is completely meaningless. The god that most people believe in is not a thing its an idea and i just have a different idea on higher goals than those	NULL

The story reads like this to me:  Mom and Dad use condoms.  Child finds an unused condom, plays with it, throws it away.  Dad hasn't had sex with a condom with Mom recently.  Dad sees used condom in the trash.  Dad knows he hasn't used a condom recently.  Accuses Mom of cheating.  Trust is now broken even though no one cheated.  Divorce.	NULL

That thought process fundamentally misunderstands what theism(or at least traditional monotheism) asserts about the cosmological role of a god, and the philosophical subject that theism or atheism is debated within.  A god is suggested as an explanation for contingent phenomena, not as a superfluous thing that also happens to exist in addition to an atheistic system.   Saying there is a god is like saying a table is held up by its legs. Talking about a flying spaghetti monster is talking about something that exist on or adjacent to that table and is completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand about what is, or is not, holding up the table.

I have a perfect analogy for gender dysphoria if you care to read.  Imagine that you are wearing a really tight sweater from a material you hate. You can never take this sweater off, and the only thing that makes it less unbearable is to wash yourself off, try to use deodorant, etc. (That would be using the right pronouns, wearing binders, and so on). HOWEVER there is a way to get the shirt off one day, but it's a lengthy process. At first you have to get the sleeves off (hormones and/or top surgery) and then finally you can get the whole shirt off (bottom surgery). Now just imagine the RELIEF you feel when the shirt is finally off. That is gender dysphoria and gender euphoria in a nutshell.  (Sorry for the long text)	NULL

Living with my girlfriend in college (we're married now). We had a studio apartment 2 blocks from the university. She was away at class and I was home. Decided to masturbate to some bukkake porn. I'm doing the deed then all of a sudden I hear the door rattle. I panic and pull up my shorts and turn the monitor off. She walks in and I play it cool. Before I can stop her she gets on the computer and tells me she forgot to print a paper. Then, "why is the monitor off." Before I could think of something to say she hits the power button then lone and behold the screen is of a woman with runny mascara and dicks jizzing on her face. The look she gave me was priceless. She x'd out and printed her paper and scornfully told me we'd be talking about that later.	NULL

I was the victim in this story. It’s was 1st or 2nd grade and our la teacher got us a pizza party and some cheap disposable water bottles.

it was 2006 and i was in grade school at that time, at that time there was a war between israel forces and terroirst groups in lebanon near the border.     i lived in the north of israel so we had to go to our shelters every 1-3 hours everyday when this war was going.     one day the alarm was going off when i was in my home and my mother rushed to my room to take me to the shelter,but i decided that there were even more importent things to do at that time then to try and protect my life.     little me which was probablly around 10 years old made a decision, i told my mother i wasnt coming with her to the shelter since there is a more pressing matter which i have no choice but to see it thrugh till the end.     my mother was shocked and then my father came as well and just grabbed me and took me to the shelter by force.     even though i was interrupted in the middle, that moment was probably what shaped me to be what i am today and why my priorities are organized the way they are now.          oh yea, i should probably say what was the reason i didnt want to go to the shelter.            pretty simple, i was playing sonic adventure and i was in the middle of twinkle part with sonic.                 i decided videogames are more importent then my life.......yap	NULL
ADHD is basically a self regulation issue due to wonky brain chemicals. For example, youll commonly see people with ADHD who struggle with maintaining normal sleep schedules: either sleep way too long or too short, or stay up way too late. Another example is that people with ADHD either will forget to eat OR binge eat.   This regulation issue leads to procrastination, hyper focus, inability to maintain routines, etc. etc. Theres more to it, and theres a lot of overlap with ASD, but the core ADHD issue is fundamentally the physical inability to self regulate on a subconscious level.

Had this happen when working at a mall as a teen. After the incident the store started getting calls from the guy saying super creepy shit and asking about me. One night he called and told the manager he wanted to keep my head on his nightstand. Mall people talk to each other and we found out the same creeper was doing this to a girl in another store, too. Nobody was allowed to leave after closing without security escorting us as a group for a solid month. This was in the early 90’s and a lot easier to be anonymous.

There’s literally no discussion to be had here.   Your POV is that we cannot trust government for ANYTHING, so fundamentally, we must rely on the market to correct itself. But that doesn’t work in reality because corporations will use their money, and their market share to control political outcomes and rather than admit that there is no easy peasy solution, you’d just rather defer to a pro-corporation system that we already have first hand evidence wouldn’t work.   Facebook was involved in the genocides in multiple nations over the last decade, and you seemingly believe that we have no other choice but to let them do WHATEVER the hell they want, because anything else is government tyranny.  Is there a world where you might acknowledge that the alternative you want is just as fucking dark as the shit you’re fear mongering about?

I'm sure he is, gotta be, but in doing so he has avoided the best the broad category of "hip-hop" has to offer across the board.  Most of the newer dudes do sound basically the same (with enough differences we could boil it down to idk like 5 genres still, but) and everything I mentioned is pretty old, or underground if new. The new dudes for the most part are trash by comparison but there's still the UG, Aesop and Blockhead released a new album like 2mo ago for instance, and Run The Jewels, Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Odd Future, and a few other popular dudes are pretty good. Hell some like RTJ are *damn* good and if you're sleeping on *those* dudes, fix it, EL-P and Killer Mike. The OG old town rd without Miley's dad on it was a goddamn work of art until billy ray fucked it up, Bad Bunny and Archangel are pretty good if Spanish counts, new good stuff is harder to find and "Hip-hop" is in a bad way, but it is still alive for sure.  Not to mention that by discounting the "typical subject matter" he overlooks even classics like Gangstarr, Wu-Tang, Spice 1, RBL posse, NAS, Snoop Doggy Dogg(specified on purpose), NWA, Easy E, DJ Quik, MC Eight, etc.   "That boy ain't right," imo.

At a party of a mutual friend group. I was hanging out when he walked in. I knew this group for a couple years, but never met *this* guy. Turned out he lived in the next state over while he was in school. We were introduced and started talking. We ended up talking all night. It was the easiest conversation I ever had. It all felt so natural.  Side note: There were many times when we should have met but didn't. When he lived in my state we worked next store to each other and he used to come in to my work all the time (coffee shop). And he was at several parties that I didn't attend. It's for the best because I had a boyfriend at the time and he was still in his "bad boy" phase.  A couple weeks later I get a message on Myspace from the guy. We start talking and decide to meet at the  halfway point for a date. The rest, as they say, is history. Been in love ever since.	NULL

I consider myself a conservative independent. I do support the idea of universal healthcare, better pay for workers, and cheaper college/trade schools. I also firmly believe that every able bodied adult needs to work and contribute to make those things possible. I don’t have any issue with people making more money if they are willing to work harder for it, but I don’t agree ceos should make millions per year while laying off workers to save money. I realize it will take some sort of legislation to get companies to pay workers fairly and keep inflation from swallowing all the extra pay they receive, but I am completely against big government because ultimately it’ll be owned and controlled by the elites. I always find myself at odds with the talking heads because they seem to constantly choose to be too far to the right or left. 🤷🏻‍♂️	NULL
>It completely is, you could also replace the tiger with a tiger god that created the universe if you like or the flying spaghetti monster. I don't see how it is incomprehensible that in regards to logical reasoning the type of argument is the same.  Again nope. There's a reason why simulation hypothesis is gaining lots of traction. If I replace this higher power/deistic god/some necessary being with a super-intelligent civilization able to create simulated universes, for some reason lots of rationalists accept this, even if its just as unfalsifiable and imho, less conceivable and more science-fictiony. I'm completely agnostic about any "first cause" of the universe, if one exists in the first place. It's unknowable, but I take a more atheistic leaning. I still wouldn't make the comparison, "tiger gods" and "FSM" are incredibly infantile arguments.   Your comparison only works when it comes to obviously mythological and manmade conceptions of deities *including* the Abrahamic one, before you accuse me of being a believer. Not only because of logic, but because of historical evidence pointing to their conceptions, including YHWH/Allah/Abrahamic god. The argument is just really shit philosophy, if you get into the deeper arguments for existence of a necessary being and whatnot. Instead, talk about the historical origins of these gods if you want to make a point. YHWH/Judaism emerged from Canaanite polytheistic belief systems and later syncretism of other religions and mythologies propagated in the region. Just one out of thousands of mythological characters that got lucky enough to be respected more than the others, resulting in a henotheistic/monolatric religion before monotheism.   >I assume you mean if I am convinced that we do or can know if alien life exists.   Life does exist on earth, therefore we do know that there is a chance for life in the universe. Now the only question is if the universes infinity is countable or uncountable, the modern understanding in astrophysics is that is is countable and therefore the chance for life could be lower than the amount of planets in the universe, therefore we have to assume that there is no alien life until we find evidence for it.   On the same note I want to preemptively disarm any appeal to authority argument. This is logical reasoning, many of the more popular astrophysicists believe in the existence of aliens though due to them assuming that the chance of life is higher than the amount of planets in the universe. While this could be likely, it is not based on evidence and therefore we have to assume that there is none.  I used to love astronomy as a kid. I was convinced aliens do exist, based on the same logic you're using. Now, I would say they might be probable but we have no direct evidence for their existence. I brought them up as an analogy to the existence of some higher power. We could make logical arguments for their existence, but we have no empirical evidence for either phenomenon. But you wouldn't say believing in the existence of aliens is equivalent to believing in the FSM.	NULL

Okay, so I’m a university student studying musical science, and something that’s always followed by a heated discussion, is that I really don’t like Prince’s music.  I can appreciate what he did for the music scene and culture in general, helping normalizing some aspects of the LGBTQIA+ culture and such. But I still don’t like most of the Prince songs I’ve heard. There’s a few exceptions like Kiss and Soft & Wet, and to some degree When Doves Cry, but besides tho I really dislike every other Prince song I’ve ever heard. I think Purple Rain is a giant snoozefest, (even tho the solo at the end is pretty good) and would never listen to it by myself.	NULL

While working construction right out of high school I nearly had my foot torn off by a rebar inserter on a concrete paver.   The bars we were using were the maximum that the machine could use but often required a kick to drop in place so it could be picked up by the hydraulic cylinder to be stuck into the slab. I would then flip a switch which would activate the hydraulic system and move to the next inserter. One of the switches was not right and when I kicked the bar it activated grabbed my foot and the bar and started to ram it into the slab. At the bottom there was a bar welded on that would have acted like a guillotine and would have removed my foot and caused a ton of damage. The operator heard me yell and thankfully shut it all down in a flash. My foot was on the bar that was going to remove it but not caught. A little wiggling and a lot of pulling and my foot was out of the concrete. The operator triggered the inserter's manually the rest of the day and the switch was fixed before the next job.   Scared the crap out of me and I honestly can not imagine the pain I was about to feel but I know I don't ever want to find out either.	NULL

I live in the Los Angeles area and whenever I go online and talk to people in red states they apologize that my city must be so hard to live in and make jokes about all the people fleeing California because it's so awful... um no I live 2 blocks from the beach in Santa Monica and it's absolutely lovely. We live here because we like it and the only reason people are fleeing is because they can buy houses 2.5X as big in other places. We actually like our democratic liberal government, that's why the *majority* voted for it. If California were truly the hell hole the alt-right media portrayed it to be then people would really leave and the housing prices would go down. The only people unhappy are the minority right wing conservatives who act like they are being held hostage, while enjoying the historically low crime rate, cheap labor, and beautiful weather.	NULL
For me it’s not an anti-religion thing. I actually find religion to be a good force in many ways. I know tons of people who have found comfort in sorrow or death, felt guided in life, etc because of their religion. It certainly has its problems, but I genuinely believe that religion is just a tool people use to express their hatred or carry out evil deeds that they would have otherwise done without religion. We’re humans who rationalize our actions.  The reason I don’t believe in God is because of the Big Bang. Astrophysicists don’t claim to know or even claim to be able to ever know what came before the Big Bang. It was the start of this universe, and all the physics that we understand the world to operate under. Whether or not we’re the only universe that exists, this is likely the only universe we will ever know.   The story of our start to me is an exercise in metaphysics. In the beginning, there was no mass, only a singularity (a mathematically immeasurable and infinitesimally small unit) of energy that exploded. For a brief period following that we had a series of brief periods where the rules of physics changed and evolved, and then the period of inflation where the universe expanded dramatically to a size much closer to where we are today.   At those points, the physics of the universe were not governed by the rules of physics today as we understand them.  So when people talk about God, they’re really talking about an otherworldly being or force that is not governed by the rules of physics of our universe as we understand them - heaven and hell, an omnipotent omniscience force or being that created and guides our world.   So by that logic, to me, God is the Big Bang. Not in the sense that a being started the Big Bang - but in the sense that if god is an all powerful creator that does not operate by the functions of the universe as we understand them today, then God and the pre-Big Bang leading to the Big Bang are one in the same. Just a catch all for something that created us, that we on earth can never understand and never will understand because it’s a state of being and operated under rules we could never exist in.  So that’s why I don’t believe in a God. In the same way we’ll never know what came before the Big Bang, we’ll never know God. So how is it any different?	NULL

I'm agnostic but religion is a philosophy to me more than an actual religion, I see the people who wrote these books have created some extremely good quotes and there's a lot to be learned from them, theirs also some beautiful sentiments about seeing your loved ones again but in reality I think any specific human made religions are likely false. If their is a divine power lording over the universe we are probably very insignificant of all his (their, it probably doesn't have a sex) creations unless this god only lords over our galaxy, but I've had some conundrums in the past with paradoxes I created along with near-death experiences I had that made me confused on if an afterlife exists or not.   My issue with believing is from studying psychology including evolutionary psychology I know how likely civilizations are to of faked religions to try to find their purpose and control others, so my educated perspective has me very skeptical of anything man has touched.

I had a group of jehovah's witnesses (however it's spelled) come to my door when I was 27, they asked me to come outside and pray with them. I declined and told them "I don't pray because I don't believe in it; the last time I prayed and really believed, it failed me."  The lady starts to tell me "maybe what you prayed for, you didn't believe strongly enough in."   I stopped her and asked "so you mean to tell me a 12 year old boy didn't believe strongly enough that I wanted my grandmother to live?!?"   Just as she went to respond, I said "get that shit off my fuckin porch," and slammed the door in their faces.	NULL

The physical sensation is difficult to describe if you don’t have the same equipment, but the glans is about as sensitive as a guy’s lips and a woman’s vagina is a warm, slick, textured surface that squeezes in each thrust.  I’d imagine it’s a feeling not too dissimilar from a woman’s sensation of being filled while her clit is getting stroked.  I’d imagine the non-genital sensation of sex isn’t terribly different between men and women.  We have erogenous areas and as arousal builds the feeling of being touched or grabbed becomes more sensitive and generally enjoyable, to the point where it can overwhelm other senses.  Actual orgasm is kind of like a song that ends at a crescendo: everything builds up to a fevered pitch, and then it suddenly ends and you’re acutely aware of how tired and sore you are, and doing anything else (at least as far as the penis is concerned) feels like it’d ruin the moment.  How a guy acts post-nut is not too dissimilar to playing music, for that matter: postplay could either be trying to ride the high for a while or trying to see if there’s enough in him for an encore performance, and some guys are ready to pack up their instrument and get off stage because their set is *done*.  Emotionally speaking…well, we all have our motivations.    For me, I like the feeling of closeness and I generally prefer sex to be fun and somewhat playful.  To me, there’s nothing more beautiful than a woman *truly* enjoying herself, so even if I’m not particularly attached to her emotionally, I can get lost in the details.  The way her breath catches if I brush across her nipples the right way and time, the feel of her writhing under me, the toss of her hair, the arch of her back, the way she pulls or pushes at me to get me to where it feels best for her…I don’t know how to describe that beyond enjoying the closeness of it—but *that* feeling of enjoyment is more addictive than anything else.

I simply never believed. My family is Hindu and religious - have a little God house at home where prayers happen every morning and evening. When I was around 7-8 years old, I asked my mum to get me the books she read in English. I read them. No complaints whatsoever. Great books. But I still had no proof of God existing. I’ve never seen a God and I just can’t understand the concept of everything in this universe being a puppet of someone/somethings creation.   I also want to know what happened before the Big Bang. Was there a nothing that turned into something or what was that something that turned into so much. But the existing concept of God being that something just doesn’t make sense to me. It always felt like an easy way out. People wanting hope and something to rely on. Something to blame even. It’s too much meaning attached to simple and natural happenings.	NULL

Downside: All the tourists attractions get boring after the 10th visit, even the beach. In the summer it takes an extra 30 minutes to get anywhere because roads are packed, no one knows where they're going, and people are going 10 under the speed limit so they can stare at the ocean instead of the road. You make as much money as you can in the summer because you're gonna be living paycheck to paycheck in the winter. Also, random things are extremely overpriced, ex: local candy store sells fudge for like $18/pound. We're not metropolitan, so doing non-tourist things (shopping mall, concerts, etc) requires 1+ hour of driving one way.   Upside: I live in a really beautiful area (hence why people summer here) and meet a lot of interesting people.	NULL

It technically doesn't. The parties are independent of the government, and who picks the speaker or whathaveyou is all a function of how many people are caucusing together. Angus King, for example, is an independent - he doesn't belong to either party - but he caucuses with the Democrats. For years Bernie Sanders was, too.  Party identification in the USA is more of a shorthand these days for who you caucus with. It's not an official government assignment.  If you wanted to, you could consider the tea party as it's own party which caucuses republican. Or the justice democrats as their own party which caucuses with the democrats. And so forth.	NULL

Thx for the honest opening for discussion. I kind of was making a provocative statement but lowkey believe in it. I just think that if people don’t understand how there’s rap for every type of person and that when it’s brilliant, it’s as brilliant as some of the most highly revered art in”high” culture. People who don’t like it don’t understand the context of it, and/or haven’t delved deeply into it. It’s a culmination of hundreds of years of oppression into a form of expression that’s on par with any other genre. And with any genre there’s shit that sucks, but there’s a lot of shit that’s incredible.    I know that all sounds kind of heady and ethereal but maybe lmk what bands/artists you’re super into and I can recommend some rap I find just as aesthetically/intellectually/emotionally/etc. stimulating and discuss why.

I only like singing in musics if it has a musucal quality. I don't care AT ALL about lyrics, only that the sounds the voice makes are musically appealing and adding something to the music. That's why I mostly listen to intrumental musics, with little to no singing and usually it's mostly choirs or something similar.  My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and the singing there is just amazing even if you just care about how it sounds. Of course the lyrics bring something too but for me that's secondary.  I despise most popular music because it primarily relies on singing with often poor instrumental (get that lame ass three chords guitar with whashed out lyrics out of here please).	NULL

Let me give you an example: Walmart. When I worked there, you had to work there over a year and be full time for a vacation and it was less than a week. Most places have it where you have to be full time and work there over a year, then you get a few days a year. Which must be approved by higher management. Not that it matters, not many people actually use vacation time for vacations. For starters, you can't afford an actual vacation. They also use it for hospital trips if a loved one is sick (or themselves) or if there is a family emergency or some slow time coming up. Like when I worked at Big Lots DC, they told us to save all our PTO for when there wasn't much to be done. Problem was, you often didn't know until you came in and you had to be there over a year. I worked there a year and didn't earn any PTO. I became eligible to earn it but I didn't actually earn any.	NULL

As a man closer to 40 than 30 now I think back to all time times I nearly died from drinking and it makes me sick to my stomach, especially since I have sons. The closest I probably came was one time I legit puked in my sleep. I was at a friends house and there was a few of us drinking. I woke up on the floor, all of my clothes were floating in the cooler for some reason, and my hair, which was semi-long back then was completely covered in puke. I remember getting my step-dad to give me and another friend a ride home and as we were driving down the road he just says "what the fuck is that smell?" and I just replied "you don't want to know" and he didn't press further. I wasn't the only one that puked that night either.

That would eliminate the human population in about 244 years. Assuming the rate could be kept up. Coronavirus is have a positive test result of 1.5 million per day.

My dad has never learned to stabilise his mood and emotions. He overreacts to everything and wastes so much time arguing and getting upset over trivial matters that I wouldn't even give a thought to. Sometimes I wonder how he doesn't tire himself out....surely it must be exhausting to let every little thing affect you like it is the end of the world. He also has a strong victim complex. And zero self-awareness. When I tell him these things, it's like I am speaking Greek. It simply doesn't compute in his mind.   I've always known he was hot tempered but discovering the complex nuances of his character was unsettling. His mother wasn't present during his formative years and he grew up with an aggressive asshole for a father. His mother didn't abandon the family, she was just sent back to her home country by said asshole for years. Perhaps if she was there he would have learned how to be self aware.  I am not perfect...I have a bad temper and I am prone of self-pity and manipulation just like everyone else but self-awareness made me change my ways. Observing how other people react to my bullshit made me be less of a jerk. But my dad simply doesn't have that ability; he would blame other people for reacting badly instead of thinking about what he did/said to make them react that way. It's too late now...he is in his 60s....there is no changing him.	NULL

I'm not arguing against rap, I love all subgenres of rap. I am stating that gangster rap (a small subgenre specifically in the category of gang activities ie hard drugs, guns, violent crimes, killing, human trafficking, rape , etc) LITERALLY DOES glorify those acts. It would make perfect sense that a racist would MISREPRESENT that fact to demean those of a particular race that do partake in those activities or that rap about those activities. Also, it may be a "black created music genre" but not every gangster rap song is by a black person or group. It's good that you don't want to be like your racist dad, but if you think the message of gangster rap is "don't be like me" then you're kidding yourself.	NULL

How old? I'm asking because most of the "best" men are married by a certain age and out of the dating pool. The guy's I knew in high school who were in shape and oh trans and presidents of their clubs and got top grades weren't still dating by 35. The guy's I knew in high school who had their shit together were all married before 30. It started around 26 and by 30, they were all married. The truth is, the older a woman gets, the quality of available men goes down as the most desirable partners get married.	NULL

I was between the age of 10-13 and my mother and I went to another church with a group of other people from our church. Because of that I was paying more attention than usual.

The same guy who spoke earlier comes up and says “We’re $40 short of $500 we’re not continuing service until we get it!” And at that moment I knew church was a scam and my belief in god stopped.	NULL

Most of the things you mentioned are social issues, not legal. You can’t make a law that magically gets rid of racism. That just takes tome and effort and the enforcement of already existing policies which is bipartisan.   As far as the border issue is concerned, I agree. There is a huge humanitarian crisis happening there. We need to increase citizenship access and ease.   Human rights for people regarding orphans is an interesting point. If I decide that I want to start an orphanage, don’t you think I should have the right to help whoever I want to help with my own time and money? Forcing me to do otherwise would be against me right, wouldn’t you agree?  I don’t see what’s wrong with a married Jewish couple deciding to open an orphanage to raise and teach children in the ways of their God of that’s what THEY want to do with their lives, as long as the children are there on their own consent.   Lgbtq people are not allowed to be denied healthcare based on that info, so again, not a political or legal issue.	NULL
That was a "spiritual sequel" - a new franchise from one of the people who worked on the original (like Yooka-Laylee with Banjo-Kazooie, but fewer people from the original). It was unlikely to amount to anything good.  The original studio (Silicon Knights) had already gone bankrupt because of the idiot in charge of the "spiritual successor" - he decided to try and sue Epic Games due to poor support (they bought an early version of one of the engines and were warned it may not be suitable). The really dumb thing is that, due to this lawsuit, Epic discovered that the "propriety engine" that Silicon Knights ended up using instead for multiple games had loads of stolen code from the Unreal engine.   But, yeah, the lead developer of this "spiritual sequel" (which was unlikely to be finished anyway) was arrested for child porn.  Nintendo are the company in charge of Eternal Darkness. They also own the patent for the sanity system, so this "spiritual successor" would be lacking that.	NULL

This experience was especially creepy because before then, I had only seen that happen on movies. I was in primary school and my house was just a few blocks away so I usually walked home from school alone. On this particular day though, as I got out of the school gate a black car with all tinted windows (can't remember the make, maybe a Mercedes) parked very quickly, directly in front of me. Immediately, all the four doors opened and almost like a choreographed event four men, all in black suits, one or two of them in dark shades came out of the car. My heart almost jumped out of my mouth, I thought I was going to be kidnapped or something. The started walking towards my direction and then just walked past me into the school. I was so shocked I maybe stood for an extra minute or so before eventually moving again.  It was probably one of the "rich kids" whose parents were flexing their money just to pick up a primary school student from school rather than just a regular driver as other parents did, but that event was super creepy.

You should go for a few sessions to just see if there is anything you need to address, personally I think everyone should have a therapist as a third-party who is *paid* to help you navigate emotional baggage rather than just dumping it on friends & family.

Scientifically, There is absolutely no reason to believe. Morally, It disgusts me how many people have committed atrocities in the name of their God.

Making an imitation of an imitation of an imitation.  The further a meme strays from the original, the more likely it is to lose meaning.

Some have such a hollow personality that they will invariably get too attached and make *the thing* part of their persona, without having the required passion to do it well.   People will seek the experience at a cheaper price, with greater convenience, and companies are happy to oblige, while cutting every corner possible.  There are many factors to this degradation of something.	NULL

I carried 1 folded up piece of paper and a pencil 9/10ths were doodled on. I was bored as hell in school.After school I toiled in minimum wage hell, multiple jobs.   During school age from 12 to 17 I held a job from (half hour after school) 4:00 pm until 11pm at night and had to be on the bus stop by 5:45 am, I was exhausted and also worked on weekends against labor laws.  I assumed that I was just going to put money away and run away, it turns out I never had enough to live on.

Religious belief is not default. In fact, the default is disbelieving; we are not born with an inherent sense of the religious, let alone of the specific flavors of religion we currently have. So to me the real question is always, "Religious people: why do you believe?"  That sounds pretentious and I don't mean it to. I get why religion exists and wouldn't try to eradicate belief even if I could. I just don't believe because nothing compels me to, in terms of hard evidence of there being "higher powers." I don't believe that intelligent aliens have visited Earth for the same reason, though I recognize that there is a distinct difference in the worldviews argued by believers in God and believers in alien contact.  Beyond all of that, my parents aren't particularly religious, my mom eventually started describing herself as an atheist, and I've been to a church service I believe once in my life, for Christmas Mass as a child. I also read a lot of philosophy by atheists (NOT atheist philosophy), and the more anarchist I become the harder my atheism gets. That said, shoutouts to religious anarchists.	NULL

Id say the opposite, The Mandalorian is a show with like maybe 3 good episodes. Cobb Vanth, Bill Burr's second appearance and to a lesser degree the ahsoka episode.   The Child is a Macguffin and not even a character. Din has no personality at all and has so much plot armor and is so overpowered that there isn't a single moment of danger or tension regarding him in the entire show.  That's why the episodes focusing on other characters can actually be good because some of them are actual characters with personality and without ridiculous plot armor So it is exciting to see how they get out of danger.  Plus the main plot is barely developed at all. I thought gideon would be an interesting villain but he just kinda showed up and did nothing in season one and then was not present in the majority of season 2 before being effortlessly defeated.

As a 37 year old woman who doesn’t consider herself mature / adult yet… I have no idea.  But here is what I do know:  shit talk is for the ball field, and is all in good fun.  Intentional put downs/blame come from insecurity, and doesn’t put you in a better light.   Grow the fuck up and solve the issue if you want to succeed.  (I learned this in the lunchroom in 9th grade.  As much as those moments hurt at the time, it’s empowering when you stay strong, stick to yourself, walk away when necessary, AND never back down (within reason). )  Girls can be the shittiest of the shittiest.  Women help support the people, things, and causes they care about.  Honestly 14 year old me is my hero… hell so is 9 and 5 year old.   Because of that, I aspire to be their heros.  I can’t tell you what a mature woman is or isn’t..BUT what I can tell you is that goodness, childlike wonder, gumption/conviction, effort, and being able to find joy in spite of our world today is a start.

I don't disagree with that.  But that's a far cry from your original statement which was a black and white statement that anyone whose firearm is stolen and used in a crime is culpable for the crime.  I complete agree that when a firearm is stolen, it should be investigated and determined whether there was any negligence on the part of the owner.  If there was (such as any laws requiring securing the firearm not being followed), then I'm not against them being held partially responsible for any crime committed with it.  Same for a bartender being held partially responsible when over-serving a patron and knowingly allowing them to drive away or if someone knowingly lends their car to a drunk person whom then kills someone.  What I DON'T agree with is automatically assigning blame to a firearm owner just because their firearm was stolen and subsequently used in a crime when the owner had it locked up in accordance with all laws and due diligence but was stolen anyway.  Say a licensed concealed carrier needs to visit a federal building or school (where it is illegal to carry even when licensed), that means they have three choices:  1) Carry anyway (breaking the law) and risk getting caught and suffering the legal ramifications of that 2) Lock their firearm in a lockbox in their vehicle 3) Leave their firearm locked up at home.  Under your proposal, options 2 and 3 would both now carry the risk that they could be blamed for a murder if their car is stolen or home is burglarized while they are out, even though they are following all laws.  You're basically making them choose between being a criminal outright (carrying where it's illegal so their firearm is always in their possession) or risk being considered a criminal by being a victim (firearm is stolen).  That does not sit right with me at all.	NULL

Interesting. I don’t know much in detail about the eastern front. In what sense is it viewed as the most brutal? Because in the pacific the environment was easily the worst and there are accounts of the nips dismembering the bodies of captured soldiers and putting their own dicks in their mouths.  It’s difficult to get much more brutal than that imo. Not saying you are wrong at all because as I said I haven’t studied as much of the eastern front. Just curious as to what is sited as the reason(s) for it to be known as the most brutal front of any war in history.	NULL

This is me, too. I’ve been married almost 10 years now and it took me a lot of therapy and work to be able to communicate my feelings effectively and have an argument with my wife without (a) completely shutting down and being physically unable to say anything or (b) completely exploding and yelling at the top of my voice. It’s how I grew up, my dad used to shout at my mom so much he’d make her cry fairly regularly.  I’m still not perfect but I’m so much better than I was in my twenties. My wife and I regularly work through our feelings together without it turning into a shouting match. There is hope for people like us that grew up in similar households.	NULL

They really don't write music like they used to back then though. The process of writing music has literally changed. It was always changing, but it changed more rapidly in recent years because of computers. It's a lot easier to put out overproduced music. On top of that, it seems that musicians are afraid to deviate from the standard formula these days. One example of this is songs without choruses. You almost never see popular music without a chorus these days. When you do, it's almost always the same type of music (soft female vocals with very little accompanying instruments/sounds). Back in the classic rock era, there were plenty of songs with no chorus, and some of them were huge hits (ie. "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, "White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane, "Money" by Pink Floyd, etc...).  Sure, there is still plenty of good music made today, but to pretend like they still make music like they used to is just silly.	NULL
In reality it's 650 but you'll get shitty rates until you're 700+, which takes YEARS of perfect history to do. Any life event will completely fuck it up. Student loans will fuck it up. Getting a mortgage or any real debt will, too, as well as overutilizing your credit cards. Any downturn in the economy means credit card companies cancel cards on people and your score drops. You can't get a 700+ at 18. You probably can't get it at 30, either. You'll be 50+ before having a chance.	NULL

- As little sugar as possible in the drinks. -  Drink water before bed (not all the time as you are drinking as this tends to make the stomach floaty.  When you wake up, the feelings you feel is not a hangover, but a lil feeling of discomfort. The more you allow your attention towards the discomfort, the bigger the pain. Dying from a hangover is basically impossible. Calm the fuck down. If the hangover is worse than thought, then its a good idea to take a walk, or shower in cold water as this takes the attention away from the feelings, and might replace them with others.  From my own experience, only the weakest minds suffer the most from a hangover.	NULL
I lost mine after 15 years. Found him when I was 18 in my first apartment. I pretty much grew up with him so I didn't know how to live without him.

Agnosticism and atheism are not mutually exclusive in most uses of the terms. Gnosticism is about what you know or claim yo know and theism is about what you believe. You can be an agnostic atheist, ie someone who doesn’t believe there is a god but do not claim to know there isn’t one. Like me. I am very confident in my non-belief, but since I know I disprove all gods I can not claim to know.  Atheism is only the answer to the single question ”do you believe in god”. A no to that question is not the same as saying you have an active belief there is no god.	NULL

I once saw a bunch of interesting things through a telescope from a friend of my boyfriend, at night in the middle of a field.  He had his telescope out in the field behind his house, because of the Perseids meteor shower.   Me and my boyfriend were invited to this friend’s place, so we went there around 3-4 am at night (because that was supposed to be the best moment to see everything).   It was so freakin’ cool. Besides the meteors, we saw many other beautiful things that I had never seen with my own eyes like that before: Jupiter and it’s moons, Saturn with its rings, and a kind of blurry spot that is the Andromeda Nebula.   This may sound like something small to people who often look through a telescope, but as a person who doesn’t own a telescope, this was pretty amazing to actually see those things!	NULL

For the record, I'm not disputing that "sex as the ultimate form of acceptance" is natural. I'm certain that a large part of it is socialisation.

Many people are deeply insecure about sex in some way or another, and those who aren't are often shamed into keeping quiet about it.	NULL

I wouldn't consider myself on either side but my ideals are more towards the left but I am a strong advocate for the death penalty but only to those who have committed the most immoral crimes such as murder, pedophilia, rape and so on.   The big hang up is the judicial system in every country is not 100% infallible and people who have not committed a crime end up dying through a bad system.  I 100% would support the death penalty if it was run in a system that commits to proof of guilt and without a doubt that they have done it.   If you commit those crimes that takes a life or causes horrific life long trauma you have waved your right to living amongst us.	NULL

As no energy can be created or destroyed, just converted, my guess would be simply the heat. Your brain starts shutting down, but the body still generates some heat. Also, in case of "natural" death, people usually don't eat much so the overall energy decreases, so even the electric energy cannot be generated from the chemical processes.  In some. Iolent cases, harder to tell, but there is a shock, the tissue is broken, but chemical processess still goes on, converting the electric charge in the brain to other types of energy, which would be again, heat probably, baybe some kinetic energy as the body tries to do something….

It does, in the negative: religion, i.e. spirits, gods, and supernatural belief is just humanity reflecting our alienation back at ourselves, as thinking beings capable of giving ourselves freedom but not yet sure how to do so. Religion is the justification for conditions that cannot be justified, for warfare and oppression and horrors that are not part of our inherent nature, but nevertheless made by the rich and powerful and supported by their ideology, which is dominant. Religion is the promise that, while things suck here for you and yours now, maybe you’ll get a slice of the pie after you’re dead and buried, or that such can be achieved through individualistic, “spiritual” enlightenment.

A lot of back and knee issues can be completely fixed with the right exercises/technique/therapy. People think these are permanent issues, but that's looking like it's no longer the case.

I'm really hoping that the "trust the science" cult doesn't pull a complete 180 now that CDC director Walensky has come out and stated that over 75% of cove deaths had at least 4 comorbidities, that roughly 40% of people reported as "hospitalized for the cove" were actually "hospitalized *with* the cove" (hospitalized for something else, and only realizing they were infected when tested at said hospital.), and that the vaccine doesn't stop transmission, but only lessens the severity of our own symptoms.   Hopefully now that the authoritarian cult realizes those they slandered as "science deniers" had a more accurate take on this, they can get over their narcissism and let everyone get back to living and letting live. Especially now that it's been confirmed that people choosing for themselves whether or not to get vaccinated, will literally only impact themselves.   This whole experience has really taught us all how far neurotic types would go, for even a false and fleeting sense of momentary security. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering. We've seen a darkness come out in people, that will be hard to forget. Even now that we know who would've supported concentration camps in WW2 though, we've *got* the be willing to forgive them, should they ever possess the strength of character to sincerely apologize for all the damage they've advocated for (beyond the unavoidable damage imposed by the virus itself.)   We have to accept that many people lack the requisite mental facilities to see through bullshit. So they are essentially victims of fear mongering, and campaigns telling them their irrational hatred is somehow virtuous. We must be willing to forgive those transgressions, should they ever stop committing them. We only get one life to live, and it would be wasted at each others throats.	NULL

People using “whom” incorrectly. If you don’t know how to use it properly, don’t use it at all.  I don’t know why it bothers me so much. In most other cases, except when safety is an issue, I believe that people should try things even if they fail because that’s how you learn.  But people use “whom” to mean “erudite way of saying ‘who’” and that’s *not accurate at all.*  There are also some people who understand that “whom” is an object pronoun, but they don’t know whether to use object or subject in certain cases. “To whom it may concern” is correct, but it’s because of “concern”, not “to”. So people will say “To whomever wrote this note…” and that’s not correct.  Just say “who”. If anyone judges you for not saying “whom”, send them my way, and I will fight them.  ^(which reminds me of the other r/askreddit thread I saw today, which was your response to a petite woman saying they could take you in a fight.

No.  While people like to yell at the top of there lungs, if asked the question "what God or God's do you believe in?" Or better "do you believe in God or God's?" Anything but yes.... you're an atheist 100% no middle ground.  Honestly it's better to view theist and atheist as guilty and not guilty. Not guilty does not mean innocent.  If you do not believe God is guilty of existing, not guilty doesn't mean he does not exist. It means you haven't to yourself committed him guilty of existing.  It is a binary choice, but the answer is yes/no. It's yes/anything else.	NULL

Dismiss the concept of atheism for a second, and consider science.  Religion will see something that doesn't make sense, and tell a story about it.

All beliefs in dieties are beliefs in the unobserved, while 'belief' in atheism is the knowledge of the observed. Atheism is fundamentally discrete and isn't just 'another belief'.	NULL

This is just a dumb way of approaching music. Good music will always be good. By that logic, why do people still listen to and *love* Bohemian Rhapsody? It's from 1975, which is just a couple years after the Beatles. And yet, tonnes of young people like it, and Queen in general. Or then here's me, at 19, and I listen to the Beatles regularly, even though most of my favourites are from the last 10-15 years. They're just good and can be enjoyed by all ages. By that logic, nobody can listen to classical music from 100+ years ago?  And it's not even just "hipsters" who like older music. Just look at popular movies. They are full of licensed songs, and very often, old ones. And usually those become popular again while the film makes the rounds in the cinema. I mean, look at Guardians of the Galaxy (which probably started this trend), Suicide Squad (which copied the trend), Baby Driver and probably a whole lot of films I'm yet to have seen.  Or even look at fucking tiktok trends. It's a very common occurence that they find some old song, use it for videos and then the song becomes popular again. So all in all, the notion that young people don't and *can't* like old music is stupid.	NULL

I’m not an atheist, I’m a Pagan polytheist, but I have an answer for a similar question. That being why I don’t believe in God or a singular higher power, and instead believe in many gods. I can’t believe in an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God who lets his people suffer to test their faith or to enact some secret plan. To me that suffering cannot exist alongside a loving God who has the power to stop that suffering.  I don’t count normal sadness as true suffering in this case—heartbreak and loss, for example, are just natural repercussions of free will and life. Sadness must exist for happiness to exist.  But to allow some of the truly fucked up shit to happen in our world, if God has the power to stop it, or to punish those who act evilly so they can’t do so again—I can’t reconcile that with love. I also can’t except condemning non-believers to hell as loving, to me it’s narcissistic.  I find it much more believable to think that there are many different gods, all with their own personalities, powers, and plans, simultaneously influencing the world. I feel no obligation to worship every single one, or to worship at all—my respect must be earned. I don’t consider myself/mortals as equal to the gods, but I don’t consider myself/mortals as nothing in this world, either. I think our personal feelings and beliefs are valuable and shouldn’t be cast aside in blind faith. I prefer cooperation and gratitude over worship.  I could say a lot more on the subject, but then I’d be here all day. Those are the major points that solidify my polytheistic beliefs, though.	NULL

Reddit can be extremely helpful, but it can also be extremely toxic. It depends mostly on how you use it. I get a lot of shopping advice for niche things on Reddit because it's hard to find as good of reviews anywhere else, and there are tons of incredibly helpful and interesting communities for whatever interests you have or whatever you might need to learn.  On the other hand, the people that run Reddit really suck. I think Reddit really lost its soul after Aaron Swartz died. For as long as I've been on Reddit, it has had its fair share of bitter, miserable people. There are some subreddits that are filled with them and some that have fewer, but most of the default subs have always been filled with vitriol. The biggest problem for me personally is that it can be a massive timesink if you allow it. I don't browse it as much now, but when I was in high school in the earlier days of reddit, I was on for several hours per day. Of course my bad time management isn't reddit's fault, but it's also designed to make you want to keep scrolling.  I think it's fair to criticize Reddit, but I'd also say the good outweighs the bad for me and I'm certainly glad that it exists. I've learned a ton from Reddit and it's also been a jumping off point for several interests of mine. You've just got to use it responsibly.	NULL

I always knew I was poor, but after visiting a friend who had to collect creek and rain water, I was very grateful for my family's well with an electric pump providing us with indoor plumbing.	NULL
Les makes a show with long but edited episodes to cover the key points but also touch on the reality of the survival scenario and putting knowledge into practice. He had to take a recoup break.

There are two main concepts that seal my opinion on this topic. The first is that god is either incompetent or uncaring. If you see all of the bad things in the world: natural disasters, plagues, the needless suffering, and awful unfair ways terrible people thrive; you can only come to two conclusions. Either god is unable to stop them, and thus incompetent, or god just doesn’t care. Either of those leaves me thinking that whoever god may be, they’re pointless to pray to or worship.  The second concept is the idea of the afterlife. Almost all theistic religions have an idea that “we go to good place, everyone else goes to bad place” in their core texts. Even if you lead an awful and horrible life killing and hurting others, you can still go to the good place when you die as long as you believe in the right guy at the end and feel regretful (which almost every person does on their deathbed). Vice versa, if a good person who spends their life helping others and always trying to do the right thing doesn’t believe, then they get some shade of eternal damnation and suffering.  If god is real, and if they are some perfect being, they wouldn’t be so petty and self-obsessed to the point of sending good people who just didn’t believe the right thing to hell while saving monsters that picked correctly. If religious people truly believed that anyone who doesn’t believe in their god is damned for eternity, they would be frantically trying to save every person they know and living as desperate missionaries. The fact that they don’t tells me that they know deep down it’s not true.  In summary: if god is real, too much bad happens in the world and thus god either can’t do anything about it or they don’t care; both tell me they aren’t worth worshiping. In addition, if god is real they wouldn’t be petty enough to send good and virtuous people to hell for not believing the right thing while sending monsters to heaven for picking the right choice.  If there is a Heaven, I’ll get in for being a good man and doing the best to help those around me and leading a positive life. If god sends me to hell with that, then he’s evil and undeserving of praise.	NULL
I hope you live in America one of the least racist locations on the planet. Although the causal racism is larger here than other places.   I’m not fully convinced that some form of prejudice against the unknown is not hardwired into mammals. Sure humanity should evolve past it. But give it time and I suspect we will to a large degree. Don’t hold your breath on geographic populations not having statistical differences that people can point out.	NULL

A lot of people commenting lack the intelligence level to appropriately engage this discussion, therefore any comment in here I see as abundant.   Egocentrism causes a lot of “opinions” and “views” to be illegitimate. Your ego doesn’t have anything to do with religion. There are scientists that do believe in JHWH, there is just basically no evidence, if there was a god, it wouldn’t be in any human sense, if a god created us, there is no chance he made us intelligent enough to even understand the concept of a god. A higher power is more believable, but a higher power could be anything. We as humans don’t even know 90% of our existence, why listen to some strangers on the internet or value their religious opinions? If you have an intelligence above a certain threshold, you are able to comprehend most question based on a higher power, you do understand then that most religions are based on nothing but stories.   It’s the unexplainable that makes people believe in something that cannot the proven, because the unproven is unexplainable. A human brain always searches for an answer to a specific answer (the reason we got here in the first place). Sometimes there is no answer and faith is the only fuel that moves the vehicle.	NULL

The beginning had to start somewhere, the energy we have in our universe had to have some beginning. No one can say what that is at this point. I'm spiritual in nature, but I can't say exactly what's there. I focus more on our interconnectedness than anything, believing our energy can interact across dimensions.   Jesus is a fact. He was at least a man that catapulted a movement and helped create something far greater than Himself. So I believe in His power, without knowing for sure the extent of who He is/was.	NULL

Its a Sin and Pose spring to mind, lots of great gay/trans characters, and although they're "gay shows" their homosexuality or transness is treated in the same way that heterosexuality in most other media - as in, its just there. Its not the defining trait of the character, its just the trait that got them into that particular situation. And unusually for gay shows they don't play into the writer's obvious coming-of-age-my-straight-crush-is-actually-gay fantasy that is utterly done to death.   Outside of gay shows:  Ian Gallagher from Shameless (though I've only seen the UK version), at least in the early seasons. The show as a whole went pretty downhill towards the end.   Eric from Sex Education. Initially he does come across as this cliché, I spent the first few episodes rolling my eyes but he quickly becomes fleshed out. Especially his relationship with Adam, which is a fantastically done gay character (masc, closeted and confused).  Willow from Buffy the Vampire slayer, though I've heard a few gripes from bi/lesbian women. It was still pretty massive for the time and her sexuality was just an aspect of her as a whole.   The leading males from Brokeback Mountain, the film that broke my soul for several days.   Controversial, but I actually like Mitchell and Cameron from Modern Family. They're right on the border of parody (as is the nature of the show) but I've known far too many gay men like that. And out of all I've listed, I'm actually (sadly) very like Mitchell.   Bill Potts from Dr. Who. Her seasons were awfully written as far as stories go, but I really liked her as a character.   On the really bad side:  Ace Ventura - Pet Detective. I watched that movie as a kid with my Dad, my god that was an awkward conversation. Looking back at it, its pretty horrific.   Boat Trip was just endless cringe with a couple of funny jokes. I don't remember any of the gay characters there existing beyond the purpose of being gay for comedic effect.   Jack Harkness, Dr Who. He was much better in Torchwood, but in Dr Who it just felt like his entire purpose was to make innuendo and provide queer shock value. He never felt like a person.   Kurt from Glee, at least the first few seasons. It never felt like he existed as anything beyond being a homosexual and reminding everyone about it.   Daffyd from Little Britain. Although the character is purposefully parody, and written and played by a gay man, there was nothing to the character but their homosexuality and was actually quite damaging at the time. It gave straights quips to bully gay people with.   Marty from Independence Day is straight (hah) example of token gay played for laughs. If he was cut from the movie nothing would change.   Gil from Fraiser. I don't think I even need to explain this one.   Sam from the Dynasty reboot. I just can't even find the words.   I'm sure there are more modern ones on the bad side but I've been specifically advised to avoid particular shows so I can't say for sure. My partner watches more "trashy" shows and tells me horror stories.	NULL

I had the off and on church parents. The ones that would take you a few months then not go for a few months kind of thing. I remember asking a lot of religion questions throughout the years and never felt like they were really answered or get generic answers like its the lessons learned in the stories (basically ignore all the off the wall crazy shit). So I don’t think I ever really believed. When I was in my mid twenties I had a kid with some pretty major health issues and it took years until my kid stabilized. Pretty much my kid went through some major shit. I sat with my mom one day and she said god made it so my kid is at this point.  I just said nah I didn’t pray at all to a god that would have my kid go through all this pain in the first place and I think that fucked my mom up.	NULL

YES THEY ARE given the choice..  They go through rumspringa, which gives them a chance to see the outside world.

In life, don't assume things as fact about other cultures unless you know about them completely.   All the the (as of now) 52 upvotes you have is based on false presumption.  It's not fair nor right.  That's any religions right (including Jews & Muslims) to call homosexuality a sin.  That is the Amish stance and their right.  Stating bias number 2 towards them  (they don't approve of gay people) with an incorrect statement about women is not right.  They treasure everybody in their churches.  Period.	NULL

Ok. Great. Do you know anything or are you simply repeating what so many other think is the solution too? I guess what I mean is, for example, do you know if this will be cheaper or better? It'll cover everyone, obviously, but quality matters too.  This issue is close to my heart. It matters a lot to me. We have a crappy system and we are paying way too much for it. It's inhumane to not cover everyone. I would be very happy is the intelligent people on the right got with the intelligent people on the left and together worked, in good faith, to create something that worked and had the flexibility to adjust to things that don't work after implemented.  I mean no disrespect in my first paragraph. I've watched too many people get too upset (back in the days when the right cared about actual issues and not BS like 'stolen' elections, 'lost freedoms' because of mask mandates, and whatnot) about, for example, tax rates on the rich. When you ask people arguing this what the proper and fair rate on the rich should be, the lib says 'I dunno, but it should be higher' and the con says 'I dunno, but it should be lower.' I cannot fathom taking a position that ignorant. I at least admit I don't know shit, which allows me to hear you (and be skeptical of you too!) I won't take a stance that I think single payer that covers everything with a flat rate is the answer, because I have no idea even that the alternatives are. I have thoughts and ideas and would be happy to discuss, but I'd like to know if you actually know anything about the subject? Why, for example, is single payer better than government run?	NULL

The last person to get the message and tells it, was a completely different message than the original as it was wrongly interpreted.  I can understand why people centuries ago believed. Majority were uneducated. They were brutal times where a toothache/infection would kill you. Times have changed, we now know there is no god yet you will still try blast at me there is.

There isn't a strong reason really, it mostly has to do with my personality more than anything else.  In essence I lost my faith while in my teen years, I was somewhat depressed, combined with a rather strong analytical mind, when I was presented with the concept of athiesm and scientific inconsistinties in the holy book it was only logical to say it doesn't make sense. The depressed part has to do with the presentation of the Abrahamic god, to put it mildly, he's a dick. Mostly faith had enoughs cons and not many pros if at all.  Now to the part of no pros, because a lot of people do state the pros of faith. This is the part that has to do with my personality, I believe in my ability to survive and adapt, to chart my own course and thrive, in esssence I believe in my agency over my own fate all the while accepting the inherint randomness of life and that the good comes with the bad.  These tend to be the things that people flok to the faith to get, I just don't really need the faith to provide them so it has no real selling points to me.	NULL

Ohhh boy some discussions in here are gonna start some big arguements 😅  I saw someone talking about mythology, and strangely I see mythology and religion in a different way because I think the ancient societies that supported mythologies knew to some extent that their myths were no more than myths, and at the end of the day should be labelled as no greater than such. Modern(er) religions are taken so literally by comparison, when I think they’re supposed to teach moral lessons, not history lessons.

Very community based and Actually solving community problems. Same God though? Both sects get into Heaven?   Finally in college when I learned about the different religions. Why did one god make more sense than multiple gods? How do Christians, Muslim, and Jews all worship the same god, but would kill each other?   The final straw for me leaning about privilege. I went to a Catholic Church as a kid because of where I was born, to the parents i was born to, and the grand parents I had. None of that is in my control.

Maybe if you can prove negligence (such as the case of the parents in the case you are referring to).  But outside of negligence, where do we draw the line on putting blame on others?  Why would this be specific to just guns and not other property subsequently used in crimes?  Say someone's car is stolen and the joyriding thief hits and kills a pedestrian with it - do we hold the owner of the car partially accountable since they let their car get stolen and if it hadn't been, the pedestrian likely wouldn't have been hit?  Should a bartender that served a patron a few shots be held responsible when that person leaves and kills someone driving home since if the person wasn't served alcohol, the accident probably wouldn't have happened?  Say someone fails to properly maintain their home and their dryer catches fire due to a build up of lint and a firefighter dies fighting the fire, should the homeowner be held responsible for the fire fighter's death since the fire was caused by the owner's poor maintenance?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for hold people accountable if they are negligent with their firearms (or any property or duty for that matter), such as leaving a firearm unlocked and a child getting ahold of it or a straw purchase.  But I struggle to add blame to someone just because someone stole their property which was not negligently easy to acquire and then did something bad with it.  That's just a very slippery slope in my mind.  It's too easy to go from blaming the owner, to blaming the seller, to blaming the manufacturer.  Then why don't we blame bartenders, bars, and alcohol producers for drunk driving deaths, or car manufacturers for vehicle collisions deaths?  It starts getting into fuzzy arbitrary lines as to who's really to blame beyond the person directly responsible.	NULL

Personally I don't think it's unhealthy to accept reality for what it is.

Death on the other hand is fairly simple, think of dreamless sleep. Who cares about something that you can't even perceive. And if you don't think death is *the* end then make up ur own theory and hopefully one that'll have you excited for death (not too excited tho we don't wanna "jump the gun")	NULL

A few things.  One is the environmental regulation and labor laws to building, whether it be houses or infrastructure to those houses.  Take for example high speed rail.  A high speed rail from Stockton to the Bay Area could alleviate some housing woes.  But the cost are tremendous, and some people blame democrats for it (whether you or I blame them or not is not the point).  Or that new houses need solar roofs and energy efficiency or just impact fees, making new homes cost a lot.  And when homes cost a lot to make, they need fat margins, like big single family homes.    Another are such regulations like rent control that disincentivizes improvements and building, and low income/senior housing requirements which essentially take away homes that would be used to alleviate the general supply crunch and instead require new houses to essentially subsidize lottery winners of new housing.  And the other is that Democrats are running most of the state and are enacting the zoning regulations.    Also other things.  Democrats are less likely to build massive freeways (which connects a lot of suburbs together).  As traffic gets worse, local housing gets more expensive.  Now, no one is fully blaming the Democrats, and everyone is aware of the NIMBYs, the increased labor force cost of just living in an expensive state, Prop 13, increased influx of people, limited coastal land, aging infrastructure, are all apart of the situation.

That's my family with me, sometimes I wish to have a conversation about something, and then they get silent out of nowhere.

I cheated on my wife. I did tell her though because of the guilt. No excuse is really sufficient enough for what I did but there were factors and I was forgiven. We are still together but one time my wife did bring it up and said, "At least you didn't get her pregnant." Well I did. She planned on getting an abortion from the start and she even tried different herbal remedies to miscarry. And it was a fluke of a pregnancy. She had an IUD implanted just 6 months before but the doctor didn't "set" it correctly so it didn't function as intended.	NULL

indeed you could ask, and I could answer, explaining that it's in my holy book written by god himself that since ancient times people named qwertyuiop9876543321 are hellspawn sent from the farthest pits of hell, and we must contain this beast under any circumstances, so they must be jailed for life immediately after having been birthed.  Look it's on page 355 of my holy book and I could read the scripture aloud.  So now that I've explained why I believe that, do you now respect my beliefs?

Fun fact: Your fingers  do not become prunelike when they get wet because of your skin absorbing water and swelling. They do this via a reflex which causes the blood vessels In the skin to narrow. If you sever the nerve that innervates the blood vessels in the skin of the fingers, they won’t become prunelike, although the epidermis will still absorb water and swell.  This is theorized to give your hands and feet better grip on slippery surfaces when they are wet.

So... Michael Schur (showrunner of The Good Place) created Parks & Rec with Greg Daniels.   Daniels made "Upload", which released on Amazon last year. I'd recommend it. It's a very similar premise to The Good Place, though in this case a digital afterlife. It's not as funny - but it's definitely interesting and does scratch the itch.   Miracle Workers is pretty similar as well. Daniel Radcliffe is an angel, Steve Buscemi is God - and they sort of.. wager a bet, regarding humans. Humor is more slapstick. Every season is completely different though - with a different cast, different characters, different plot. S1 and S3 are the best.   If you want something a little more surreal, "Russian Doll" is brilliant. Only one season so far. Natasha Lyonne is stuck in a time loop and keeps dying everyday. She meets another person, also stuck in the loop. Very dark, very funny, very witty.   There's also "Made for Love", which has one season on HBO. Comedy about a woman who escapes an abusive marriage from a tech-billionaire, but with a tracking device inside her brain. The billionaire lives in a sort of 'Good Place' of his own design and it's pretty wild.   Good Omens, Pushing Daises, Dead Like Me. All good shows to check out.	NULL

I had sex in a fire truck. It was a very small town and we were not fully staffed. On call basis. I met a girl while on a call at a nursing home for a medical. (She was a CNA)  She somehow found me social media, added me and straight up said she wanted to fu*k. She asked for a tour of the fire station, So…that’s what I did. Showed her one of the fire trucks, next thing I know she’s doing to dirty dirty on me and things progressed from there. Most definitely a once in a lifetime thing. I ended things very quickly after I found out she was also having sex with my best friend at the time who was the one and only police officer in that same town. She ended up keying both my personal car and the officers personal car. She was crazy. Like legitimately psycho.	NULL

Admitting wrongdoing is a sign of maturity. You act as if that’s a downside and you infer she’s in the right. She’s not, so clearly not,  You’re basing your opinions off complete red herrings. Women calling their men batshit, which isnt what is happening here. Its a third party making that judgement.  Oh and people judging others? Welcome to the internet. Look in the mirror and guess what you’re doing right now.  I am assessing what happened based on what was spoken, and of course called her batshit. Yet you took personal offense as if you were the other party. Your actual implication is that he’s wrong for admitting the tiniest amount of guilt— which frankly is confirming his fear.  Frankly, you mirror the behavior if the woman he complains about in that sense, because admitting guilt, admitting weakness makes him unforgivable.  The facts are when someone behaves in the fashion the woman does as described by the man here, when they’re unable to discern right from wrong, when they lack empathy and self awareness , it means they’re batty. They’ve got mental disorders.   Do I want to be nice to these kinds of people? fuck no. They don’t deserve it.  Yes this is the internet and a public forum. Expect to be judged, especially when you are, in fact, displaying signs of being batty.	NULL

And now I'm a robot, detached from pleasure and without interests. My friends moved on and I changed from years of physical, emotional, and mental abuse that led me to desire isolation more than anything.  Three tennets of advice here:   Never let an SO hit you once, because it will happen again, and it will become increasingly violent and frequent.  Never let an SO split you from your friends by guilting you. This is different if your friends are actually manipulating or taking advantage of you.  Never let an SO make you feel like an aggressor for calmly and rationally trying to talk out your concerns with their behavior toward you. Their insecurity will make them hostile, and you may doubt yourself, but pay close attention to this pattern. If every time you raise an objection, or need to have a talk, and they get defensively offensive ("are you saying I'm a bad gf?? Fuck u small dick!") then just be rid of the person.  I assure you it does not get better until someone treats them worse than they treat you.	NULL

As all of this was about depression and suicide:  It also holds true for other things.  Mental health changes usually do not come fast or drastic, unless a medication is really kicking in.  I have ADHD and social anxiety, the first warranted psychiatrist visits.  If my social anxiety would have suddenly got a lot better, something would have been **really** wrong. Either my mental state was altered, or I would have stopped giving a fuck about anything. Even when not suicidal, the latter is usually not good.  With ADHD it's similar.  I had bad times when everything was shitty. Even when they stopped and I came back from them, it took me weeks to get into calm waters again because bad times are exhausting. And you have to pick up routines again.  If I'm suddenly much better, that means I'm either burning through what little energy I have at high speed, or that something in my brain clicked into very right places. However, those do not last in my experience. And that's a moment when things get super complicated. Because if everything aligned and worked out for 2 weeks and the suddenly crumbles, that is just horrible.  Furthermore and ADHD specific: my symptoms become a lot less / less meaningful when I am **slumped** with work. I work amazing under extremely high pressure.  That is not healthy at all.	NULL

Well I already fucking do that with plumbers when I have a busted toilet, or roofers when I have a leaky roof. Both of these services show up at your house and do the work, then bill you for services rendered. How is the service of putting out a fire in my house any different than these services? They should just show up at your house and do the work (i.e. putting out the fire) and then bill you for services rendered. Just like a plumber or a roofer would.	NULL

I live in Southern California, where Mexican families that have lived here for generations live alongside people who have been fighting for their citizenship for 20+ years, trying to take all the necessary steps, paying taxes with a fake SS card for benefits they will never receive, and working harder than almost every natural born citizen I've ever known with little exception. What's funny is the same people around here who share your opinions have no issues hiring illegals to clean their toilets or watch their children.	NULL

I'm a left-leaning atheist because I don't believe in a deity.  I don't hate religion, I was never traumatised, I'm not rebelling against anything, and I grew up in a city where a majority of the population is made up of left-leaning christians.    The UK (where I'm from) uses a two-party system but, based on what I've heard, the British conservative party isn't nearly as conservative as the republicans. We also don't mix religion and politics to the same extent that americans do, so that might be  part of the reason why I don't hate religion.	NULL

How do you lose a friend if you start dating them? Doesn't the relationship just change from less attached to more attached & trusting? I believe that's the only difference between friends and dating partners (other than potential happyFunTimes.. and sometimes not even that).  Also, I never understood why can't people remain/ return to friends after "peaceful" separation.	NULL

I was raised Catholic, but as I grew the more I learned in Sunday church school thing, and about history, the more became obvious to me, that humans made that shit up. I think the Bible has some nice messages, and it can be very contradictory.  Few examples: Noah's ark, the belief that Earth was at the center of the solar system, until Galileo proved them wrong, and they tried to kill the guy..  Meanwhile I believe the Bible to have been translated from older more mininful texts leaving behind or adjusting the content of the information to suite the new made up religion.  I believe that Sumerians started it all, and they knew about the solar system with sun in the center. Some people say I would be inclined to believe, and there is a lot to support the idea the Sumerians was a extraterrestrial race that looked like us but taller, the annunaki	NULL

I don’t miss my ex but our first date came to mind, we walked around the lake by her place drinking beer and ended up spending like 6 hours together because we lost track of time just chatting.  My buddy’s 17th birthday party was wild (well for a bunch of introverts anyway) we had a huge bonfire and one of his friends threw a full cab of axe body spray into it and we all had to run and duck to avoid the explosion, which burned the camping chair I was in and destroyed another one.

How is that a faulty premise? The quote simply states that the scientific facts wouldn't change and we would in fact discover all of it again. The pace of it isn't relevant here. Religious institutions such as the Roman Catholic Church have also been "fighting" against ideas that conflicted with their teachings. Ask Galileo about it.	NULL

But baseball isn’t the only sport. And if you’re molested by a coach, that trauma might make you not want to play anymore (or to encourage others to play either.) So you might play a different sport.  Your original claim was based on the idea that you “enjoyed baseball.” If you were traumatized by a sexual assault from a baseball coach as a child, you likely won’t enjoy baseball as much afterwards. So why encourage others to play if you don’t enjoy it?  If you take issue with OP’s grandpa removing themselves from something they associated with sexual trauma, and think they should have “gotten over it” and given it another shot, I’m not sure what to tell you other than “no.”	NULL

If you genuinely are convicted of something heinous or there is significant evidence of it, it's completely warranted in my opinion. Otherwise, I think people should withhold judgement and not try to ruin someone's career.	NULL

No I wouldn’t. Those sociopathic empire builders don’t represent me. Nor are they interested in anything resembling a social harmony and cohesion.

I was at a restaurant in a town known for being a little tourist trappy focused on my appetizer and felt a presence next to me. I look up to see a neckbeard standing next to me with a camera and all he says to me is “cuddle.” I look at my fiancé and she is quickly trying to finish her bite. Then he snaps a picture of her, our two kids and myself. After he leaves I’m like WTF WAS THAT?! She says that they will be back to try and sell us a photo. She was sorta ok with it but I’m freaking flabbergasted that some rando just took a pic of my kids without asking. When he circles back the picture is already printed, framed and of the shitiest quality. We refuse to buy it for $20 and I’m really hoping that picture got deleted.	NULL
Christianity is literally a religion where you can commit any sin, ask for forgiveness, and be accepted into heaven. Most Christians are not Constantine thinking about how to be better, as evidenced by... I mean I hate to make it political, but have you seen literally any religious conservative party in the world?  Religion is not the only valid source of morality. In fact, one could argue that morality for fear of God's wrath is not morality -  it's self interest. No one becomes an atheist because they don't want to listen to God. People become atheist because they don't believe. Many would love to believe, but it feels too much like a lie.	NULL

I'm the exact opposite (left but I support the death penalty).
