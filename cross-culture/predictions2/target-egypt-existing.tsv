People's culture is just to throw in the street,  as If the street is a large garbage can. When we were kids, the bus supervisor used to tell us if we have garbage throw it in the street from the window as to not get the bus dirty, this could have been easily solved by a plastic bag in the bus!I have seen a very nice lady this year getting out of her car emptying her pockets in the street after parking underneath her house, which she could have just thrown away the trash in the garbage can infront of the house, or in her apartment, but no she had to be a lazy loser and throw it in the street.

To solve it, there should be a dumpster for every street with daily maintaining and collecting. In reality, there is few dumpsters and they are barely one in every neighborhood.  People usually select an empty spot and go throw their trash there which can make a mound of shit when it piles up.	NULL

What? How does telling somebody merry christmas as a respectful gesture equate to me celebrating the holiday? I agree that their religion is completely wrong in my perspective but at the same time that does not mean we should not wish people who celebrate the holiday a merry Christmas, it's even hypocritical that you insist that my gesture is only on my behalf, that's very same as insisting that the gesture is on behalf of all Muslims, if I cannot say "on behalf of Muslims" neither should you insist that it is only on my behalf and not other Muslims, neither of us control our brothers and sisters, you telling me common knowledge about Christianity is insulting in of itself	NULL

Fun fact: Egypt has never been a rich country. However, in the 60s, cairo was labelled the cleanest and most beautiful city in the world.  It's not about the economy or the country it's about the people. The older generation is hygienic and clean, thus the country was clean during their time. The newer generations (late 80s and 90s kids) are mostly dirty and throw their garbage anywhere thus the country became dirty during their time	NULL

It is not a problem of any religion per se. It specifically is a problem with religions that denounce the material world in the favor of a heaven.   The Ancient Egyptians religion was their land. Their heaven was to take care of the reeds and the golden wheat fields they sowed in life. Their religion incentivised treating the land and the people as blessings given to you by the Gods to keep them safe and happy. Thats why they built wonders and created wonders. Because they loved themselves and their lands. Even if life was much much much more difficult physically, economically and politicaly.   The modern religion though that incentivises ditching the material world for the sake of the immaterial, and not just ditching but actively constraining everything on everybody and creating bad conditions to leverage their political support with the need of Egyptians to go to "jannah". Well, you can see the results of a thousand years of that religion right now. You can look into all the other different countries that use it and you can find it more or less the same.  I am not hear to debate religions though. I've said my mind and if you have a problem with what I said then I am sorry about that but I am not willinh to discuss further.	NULL

Avoid store bought pasta sauce, they never taste good due to all the preservatives and excessive sodium. Here's a simple recipe you can use, I've tried it before.      You can make extra and store it in the freezer, just be sure to fill only 75% of the jar or it will explode.      You can use balsamic vinegar instead of white wine:     [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11966/best-marinara-sauce-yet/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11966/best-marinara-sauce-yet/)	NULL
You are absolving people of any personal responsibility and enabling bad behaviour. I was born in Egypt . I was raised in Egypt. I was educated by the Egyptian system and I am a product of the Egyptian culture.  Yet, I believe in personal responsibility and I have a duty to my community to make it better. I try to make it in time. I don't  throw shit on the streets. I don't do many of the bad behaviours of the Egyptians. Why cant people have the same basic principles as any cultured individual ?      If you keep treating people as children and keep giving them excuses for everything then don't complain when they abuse you and your community. People need to stop and think of consequences to their actions. But why would they ? They want to go to Jannah not live in Jannah. The material world can go screw itself we all want to fast Ramadan and go to Jannah where we get free shit.	NULL
Do you give a shit about how YOU look? Because throwing things in the streets is not a good look… this sounds like an excuse because you’re too lazy to throw things in the garbage or keep it with you until you find one.

1. There are no regulation from the government. 2. No harsh fines to make ppl fear littering. 3.

Most cities are crowded so when they stop collecting garbage for even a day, it gets pretty bad quickly.	NULL

Sounds nice. How much did you engage with them to become friends with them?  I mean - today I was just sitting on a bench on the boardwalk, and a guy comes sitting next to me. After some general introductions he asks if I want to come to his shop for some tea...  Now I've had negative experiences before where going to someone's shop for tea ended up with them nagging me to buy something from their shop, in a way of "here is a free gift!... Now give me money!" - and their "hospitality" is just a trick to try to get me to buy something - so I say no. I'm just chilling here in the sun, I don't want tea, or go anywhere.  He's chatting with me for about half an hour, gives me his number "in case I need anything" like a taxi, or food for "non-tourist prices that he'll get for me"  After that he asks if I like beer and whether I want to go buy some beers and go to his apartment (I'm also a guy btw)... Of course I'm like yea no thanks (seemed kinda weird)  But anyway, I don't know how I'll make friends with anyone if my default assumption is that they'll probably scam me - but, so far 100% of the time those kinda interactions end up as some kinda scam.  How do you interact with them and become friends and not just get scammed?	NULL

No problem, if you're new to cooking start small;      \-Use a large pot, fill with water and wait for it to boil, add 6 - 8 tbsp of salt. If you add salt first it will take much longer to boil. Add the pasta and stir frequently to prevent it from sticking. Spaghetti takes around 7 - 8 mins.       \-Strain the pasta under cold water to stop it from cooking.      \-Drizzle with olive oil and a dash of pepper.

People work hard there unlike a huge number of people here.  >And Egypt’s military today is much stronger than the one in 67.  I know I'm talking about financial losses.

India was under colonial war for hundreds of years, not a conflict for 6 days. Yeah I’m sure Egypt has suffered economic losses, but 55 yrs later very unlikely the 67 war has much impact (economically). In fact i think that may be hard to argue as economic trade between Israel and Egypt is at the highest levels ever today.	NULL
Education is a good start, as long as Egyptians actually learn to abandon their old ways and build on that education so we all benefit.	NULL
Yeah but we need to be more strict I think the main reason why we are like this is (this is just a theory ....

Been in a relationship for almost 3 years. Her family was much wealthier than mine. When it came to marriage arrangements she insisted -thanks to her family of course- to live in some fancy apartment that I can afford but will cost me all my money and some of my family's too that was unacceptable for me I felt like I'm being used. so it didn't work out for us.  After years of break up I concluded that she didn't hate me she hated my life. She loved the THINGS I DO not the WAY I'M and money was behind it all.  I hope you don't fall in this hole. calculatinos are critical for any project's success. but when it comes to relationships calculations are not applicable because we're human not an excel sheet.

wtf dude, your point of view is all screwed up, I will start with this thing of religion. I no longer consider myself Muslim but you can't blame this on religion! This thing with  people "ditching the material work for the sake of the immaterial" is screwed up. What do u think of European people who are christian do they throw their shit in the streets on behalf of your sick argument! Egyptian houses are clean, you can't deny it , are they agnostic in their houses and Muslims in the street. Egyptians trying to get rid of their shit properly, their religion: ohhhh boo wait you have to sacrifice the material world for the immaterial world, Egyptian ahh I would go to pray then instead of wasting my time trying to get rid of it properly! Fu_ that dude. Where are those billions that were dumped into solutions for this problem! The government doesn't even believe in approaching any problem in a scientific manner, you can tell this from the way it acted towards the pandemic, I was taking my thanwyaa Amma exams during corona, there was zero regulation to take us safe, who is now to blame on this the religion, the resources! Using those tablets we were given since our first way of hs would be damn convenient, but instead we didn't use them, as what would happen in case of an electricity outage, seriously! If you invested money in people instead of treating them like that, the situation would be different	NULL

No mate, your words exposed you, and you are making it worse now, lel.   It's like you are saying Egypt is a Christian country. What's the difference between you and someone who claims that Egypt is an Islamic country? You are both clowns.  Then you explain your BS with a comment that totally contradicts your actions. Look at this  >I love this image because it represents the fact that Christianity is an undeniable part of the fabric of this nation.  Who is denying that? and how does this image represent that? You are literally modifying the Egyptian flag to put a symbol of your religion there. What a bad joke. It's also safe to assume that your image is denying the rest of the fabric of this nation.  >what is more important is for all of us to fight ignorance and hatred when ever it rears its ugly head.  Your post is the definition of ignorance and hatred. **No wonder you don't  want this conversation to go back and forth**. It's amazing how many clowns are supporting you.  These kind of posts gives reasons to extremists to raise their voices. The only thing you are making by posting a picture like this here is an attempt to trigger people. Congratulations, it worked. **Next,** we will find a random Muslim guy posting a similar post after modifying the Egyptian flag and putting an Islamic symbol there. :kappa:  How do moderators allow this?

Well, there's Cairo, Georgia in the United States, Lebanon, New Hampshire, and actually Cairo, Illinois also. So yeah, sometimes Americans do give things Arab/Egyptian names. That said. I think you are misusing the word Cuck. I think you mean to say that Egyptians lately have a colonized mentality. Well, that can change but it has to start with Universities. We have to develop the language in such a way that the higher sciences, like Medicine, Physics, and Engineering, can be taught in Arabic, with Arabic texts, and Arabic instruction. As long as English is a barrier to higher achievement and higher learning, people will associate it with privilige and exceptionalism.	NULL

I will tell you why :  1.We were invaded many times in history and were always a colony for someone till 1952 and at that time it was a militarist dictatorship that treated the people shit and doesn't give them a meaning, till today, so egyptians as a society never had a real feeling of being independent and powerful, we are raised on the mentality of the herd and who tries opposing it gets excluded and either flees or gets arrested or discriminated, and that's everywhere in the streets and media and social media  2.Our government profits a lot from foreign investments and they play a big role, that's why they let foreign investors have their own names and symbols or so as a form of thanking them and saying without you we would be nothing, because our economy truly depends on the gulf, and you might say they could have made egypt socially and economically independent, well no shit when you have corrupt leaders everywhere with the not so educated people that live under inferiority influence all those centuries, you never get dignity for the country  But overall I think we have much bigger problems to solve and if we solved them we wouldn't have had this problem, education, life quality of the average egyptian, freedom of expression. Dictatorships either make their country too independent and ignorant or too dependent with feeling of inferiority, and we don't want any of those we just want independence and dignity as you metioned  But I like how you say in the title we cucks then go on and say you cucks excluding yourself ;)	NULL

Invaded many times? You think Germany and England weren't invaded too? When they build something in England do they name after Romans or build it in Roman architecture? Imagine if we called it the French Canal because the french helped build it?? How embarrassing would that be! We still call it the AMERICAN uni of cairo even 100 years later!! WHY? Because the  CEO alone is american and has to be american by law?! Imagine in 500 years, 90% of our best unis are named after other countries!! Imagine El Azhar was called the Frankish University 900 years ago or smthn. Its embarrassing man. And your 2nd point is very true, thats exactly what I said with the whole 'roz' reference, but even still, when we build things on our own look at the inferiority complex. In the new capital and new alamein for example, the luxurious higher class neighbourhoods are all done in European style and named european things (completely our choice and no foreign investors involved), meanwhile the middle and lower class areas are done in Islamic/Middle Eastern style. If you yourself believe you are inferior to Europeans, then why do you think Europeans will respect you when you cant even respect yourself??

How certain are you that we'll be able to maintain a serviceable amount of debt? This debt is in dollars. Which means, that we can't print our way out of it. Which means that we must pay them back in dollars. How to get these dollars? By increasing our exports. But our exports are trash. Entire private sector is trash. What should we do?

Having a CS degree helps, but it's not a must. Some companies require a CS degree, mostly medium to big sized corporations. But I think companies are slowly dropping this requirement, because hiring good SWE is brutaly hard. Overall, I'd recommend getting the degree if you can and try to land a job while studying.  If you're feeling bold, you can try and take a CS degree equivalent online via OSSU CS or sth similar.  Source: I work as a remote SWE and don't have a CS degree.	NULL

These are just names. Take a look at the curriculum and judge for yourself. Most unis only offer one of these and not both.

if you're talking about luxor/aswan trip, I was there mid November, and the food was good most of the time - great at times. Defiantly go for the food option because there are few places that would make food that taste as good as the cruise's + it will be easier for you and your friends to follow along the trip's program without worrying if they will start moving without you.      Plus, you could still try the cuisine at night when you go out. The first night at Luxor we went to Light and Sound, which was not a part of the trip's program; so most of the nights you will find yourself free to do or go wherever you want. Just return early the night your cruise departs from Luxor.	NULL

There's not that many jobs that you can do remotely.  And even the jobs you can do remotely, software engineering still probably pays much more on average than those jobs.  And no, 75k+ EGP is on the low end of the spectrum, really. (for software engineering)	NULL

It's a huge field man, you gotta find something you'll tolerate doing + be good at for the rest of your life. Being good at what you do > than picking a good career path.  If you're a crappy SWE, it'll be super hard for you to find a job even in a hot market right now.  Generally, software jobs are easier to find because of the simple fact that humans build more software than hardware. But software isn't just one thing. You'll have to do your own research about this, outside of Reddit. Best of luck	NULL
What did you expect?	NULL
It isn't a bad generalization. Computer Science in general is a subset of Computer Engineering. If you study Computer Engineering you study everything a Computer Scientist studies, and extra hardware stuff on top.  The idea that CS is more software focused while CE is more hardware focused is a myth because it puts CS and CE as "same but different", when the relationship is actually not symmetric at all. In reality, CS is "software focused" because really you only ever study software. CE isn't hardware focused at all. There's still just as much software as in CS.

Well, it depends on your position obviously. I'm speaking of junior-mid level positions. To net 75k (after tax) will definitely put you in the high end of this bracket. Especially if you're hired outside of the US and under the payroll of a company based in the EU. The taxes will eat a considerable chunk of your base income which itself is atleast 20% less than in the US.  Remote software engineering is just the most popular. Especially on Reddit et al. But the difference isn't that huge if you work in digital marketing or design.	NULL

75K EGP is around 3-3.5k EUR, which is pretty much the lowest you can get paid in Europe as a Software Engineer. I am sure it's much higher for the US (U.S. salaries are typically higher).  And if you are hired as a "contractor" you pay no taxes anyways.	NULL

Fair point. I remember that in the AUC, CS used to be a subset of CE. CS usually takes you 4 years and with CE, you're required to complete 5 years 3ashan nekabet el mohandeseen. I'm not sure if other unis in Egypt follow the same pattern. Imo, it should just be a single degree, where students pick the credit hours they see fit for their intended careers.	NULL
Supply and demand. You get paid more, you must also spend more.	NULL
I went to CU and it is (obviously) different, as CS is its own faculty while CE is just a department in the faculty of Engineering, so they aren't structured in the same way as the AUC (for example, most software courses in CE - CU were \*much\* better than equivalent courses in CS - CU)	NULL

Netting 3.5k a month in most of the EU is above average. An average gross salary is about 60k EUR. Net would be 40-45k depending on where you live. 45K/12 months is 3.75k  3.75k EUR is a little less than 70,000 EGP a month.  Being a contractor is a whole other story. Most contractors are either paid hourly or by project. So for the purpose of our argument, I'll only discuss hourly work. Hourly work is deceiving, because you don't get paid on vacations and sick days. Even the hours you're booked for are pretty unstable.  Also contractual work/freelance has it's cons. No health insurance, no stable income which means no unsecured credit line and overall it's a headache, unless.. you're a well paid contractor.	NULL

In every sense. Engineering professors more often than not had more integrity and also cared more for the "faculty's reputation", which had the convenient consequence of making even shitty teachers manage a course well enough for it to be useful and educational, even if it required more effort from the students' end.  Bema3na, even when a professor is a horrible teacher, they still put in place challenging assignments, projects and exams which puts pressure on the students to, through one way or another, learn the subject at hand both theoretically and practically. So students would leave "shitty" courses still having learned at least the baseline of what that course was about.  On the contrary, CS professors very rarely have integrity and the faculty has no reputation to fend for. This has the inconvenient consequence of making shitty professors practically kill every course they teach because they simply don't care. Assignments and projects are nonexistent, and if they do make some then they'll be either a- brain-numbingly easy, or, b- very weird and the opposite of educational/useful, just "difficult" (usually involves using very odd and discontinued technologies for example, and I use the word discontinued literally not figuratively). Even their exams are usually just recitations of the slides they stole, because they aren't good enough to come up with anything on their own most of the time. There's literally no pressure whatsoever on students to actually learn the subject at hand, they just start aggressively memorizing slides a couple of days before any exam and that's well more than enough to get satisfactory grades even.  So in practice, a student can "attend" a computer architecture class in CS, but if the professor is shitty then the course will go by and they will absolutely pass it without retaining a single piece of information about architecture.  So at the end of the day, in my experience, CE's "baseline" of competence is substantially higher than CS' baseline just because of that factor alone. If someone graduates CE, there are things you can more or less guarantee they know. If someone graduates CS, that person could literally be unable to write code to begin with.  I have CS graduate friends who can't write code. Again, literal and not figurative.  This is simply not something I have ever seen from CE CU. At all.	NULL

**I gotchu**  get a reasonably sized pot and fill it with water  add a few tablespoons of salt and turn the heat on  add your pasta of choice  let em cook for a few minutes, stir occasionally so they don't stick, easiest way to test for doneness is to just taste it, remember, you want it to be slightly less cooked than perfect, not raw, but has a little chew to it.  Drain the pasta in a strainer, but keep about a cup of the starchy pasta water aside, rinse the pasta with cold water to stop them from cooking further (optionally you can drizzle a little oil to keep em from sticking)  in the same pot you cooked the pasta in, add enough oil of your choice to coat the pan and go a little higher, chop an onion before you heat the oil (you don't want your oil to be too hot), and add your onions.  optionally you can add chopped green peppers and a chopped chili for an extra spicy kick with the onions as they're getting cooked.  when your veggies have softened and the onions have gotten darker (golden, not brown) add that cup of starchy water you put aside earlier.  now for the most controversial part of my recipe, add 3 tablespoons of tomato puree (معجون الطماطم) and stir, DON'T skimp on the puree that's 70% of the sauce!  You can now salt and spice your sauce, I go for around 2 teaspoons of salt and one tsp each of pepper and cumin, and maybe some garlic powder if I'm feeling like it.  you let the sauce cook for a while until it thickens, taste for seasoning and that's about it!  you now add your pasta and mix everything up and bon appetit!

Whh "should" we ? You can tax them as everyone else sure but why do we have to strong arm wealthy individuals to give us shit ? And judging the failure of the public sector in the last 70 years, I think we are better off incentivising bussinessmen and private sector to invest heavily in the country without fear of Nasser style nationalization and taxation.  Basically compare Egypts Nassir and Switzerland or US. Basically compare socialism and capitalism. The contrast is blinding and yet people always choose the flashy one and the " give us free moneh you corrupt millionaire piece of shit" route.	NULL

In your eskewed ideology and mind everyone is against rich people because you deserve their money more than they do. So when you meet someone who is willing to use their objective thinking to not follow the same shitty ideology as you, that person is either wrong or a rich guy.   The answer to your queation is I am upper middle class. My father created his business from scratch and now we enjoy the life of moderate wealth. We are not a 1% by any means but we are not poor either. I guess that makes me and enemy of the proles right ?  And I do know lots about socialism. No need for "re-education" thank you. I ve read economoc books, economoc theories peddled around by socialist wannabes and partisans, I ve seen socialism live in every failed socialist state in the last 30 years and I ve read about failed socialist states starting from the Lenin red revolution.   Btw, European countries are capitalist not socialist. They employ socialist concepts as public healthcare, education and transport. But their economy is based around capital ownership by individuals. And certain countries you perceive as "socialist havens" as the nordic three are literally oil countries. They have billiona in assets of oil and they use these billiona to fund programs for a handful of citizens. The three countries I think have a pop of 60 million or so. Like half Egypt's pop. Flip that around and I guarantee you these countries would go venezuela route very quickly.   Anyway good luck arguing with people online with your theories. Maybe if you put the same time into economic education and businesses you would have been the millionaire you whole heartedly want to rob.   You can also check various ideology subreddits and go spend your time there and stop using cheap gimmicks to win the upvotes of poor hungry no brainers. Bye bye.	NULL

TIL they removed SATs from Egypt. Honestly I (and a few tens of millions others) saw it coming a mile away. It probably has to do with the brain dead rich retards who buy the leaked exam every exam period. If it's not because of that then they're still brain dead rich retards (I only mentioned those who buy the exams, as for the others I honestly feel sorry that you have to go through this shit over and over and over again with no change in sight).  Basically the situation with SATs in Egypt from what I keep hearing every few months is that people leak the exams and then for a few dollars they give the exam to their students and these students having then do the exam exactly as taught causing an unrealistic grade imbalance which in turn causes the board to get annoyed and punish the country for the offense. I guess this is a straw that broke the camel's back situation in which they got annoyed and decided to just ruin the lives of every Egyptian who is studying in the American system as punishment for what those rich idiots did.  This is coming though from someone who studied the British curriculum abroad so I don't know much information about the situation as I only read the rants of people.	NULL

We can't all agree that Egypt has some of the best Software Engineers. Define "some"? I would argue that we have a really horrible ratio of talented engineers / subpar engineers compared to the West.  And to answer your question, it's very simple - AAA game development is expensive as fuck and will necessitate serious money. IIRC a AAA game is estimated to cost on average around 60-80 million USD to make. These numbers go much higher for specific genres, like MMORPGs.  So yes, the budget is predominantly the reason. And if you think the majority of Egyptian gamers will pay $60+ for a locally made game then you are just a very optimistic person. Facebook pages begging people not to crack the game doesn't mean people won't do it.	NULL

Not an artist or a software engineer, but I’ve got a pretty valid reason as to why this is so. You say you refuse to believe that it’s budgetary reasons but not believing it doesn’t make it disappear. Even when making an indie game, it’s still pretty expensive let alone having to find and pay for a team, location, assets, licensing, equipment, and the list goes on. Believe it or not tho, budget is the boring answer so I’ll try to indulge you with a better one.   Look at a country like India for example, and look at the amount of tech GENIUSES that country produces. There is a REALLY good amount of Indian gaming studios, a lot of which are just branches of western studios, but otherwise there is a pretty hefty amount of them, so why aren’t any of their games famous? 2 things, societal advocacy of the gaming community and EDUCATION in the creation of games. There’s a HUGE difference between software engineering, programming, and writing code and actually learning how to develop and design a video game. Just because someone can operate a camera really well, doesn’t make them a good movie director. You gotta learn how to form a story, tell the difference between a good actor and a bad one, and most of all having the fundamental knowledge of what makes a good movie. You can say the exact same thing when it comes to video game development. Hell, Ubisoft is opening a branch in Dubai because there’s a pretty good amount of students graduating out of game development and design programs in the region.  I can’t guarantee this, seeing that there aren’t exactly studies on the matter, but if Egypt had (and encouraged) game development programs, I feel like there’d be a pretty good chance of seeing some proper indie and AAA titles. Also cmon man, people thrive on video game piracy here, I don’t think a game being Egyptian would really change much.  However I do agree that this isn’t a reason for a lack of AAA titles.   TLDR; Budget, actually learning to make a video game, and not just studying programming are why we don’t have AAA titles or any good indie titles made in Egypt.	NULL

If you’re a software engineer you have basic understanding of programming that helps you in any field related to programming. Doesn’t mean you’re gonna jump on the game development train without learning the technology but it’s gonna help.  There’s actually a lot of studios in Egypt but most of them don’t reach production level and the one that did RPG released it too early that people found too many bugs and refunded their money.   I think all you need is at least 5 experienced people to develop a successful indie game (gonna take years but still) because look at a game like Bright Memories. It’s made by a single developer who used stolen assets but due to how awesome the game is I think Epic helped him into buying the assets and he recreated some other assets or something like that but they solved the stolen assets issue. it’s made by a single developer. No funding, no huge budget.	NULL

We rank on HackerRank as from the top 40 countries to provide software engineers for example.   All we lack is awareness, a lot of people don’t even know what software engineering is but most people steal courses anyway so lack of education is not a reason. I am graduating from CS this year in all the four years i have been teacher assistants have always recommended courses. And if someone is feeling a little bit hungry for the field there’s OSSU on github which is the best place to learn CS in my opinion along with harvard and mit courses that are free.   Now that was my mistake all I meant is a big game as in scale and in quality turns out AAA meant huge studios with huge fundings (sorry ig). But budget is not an excuse. Looking at a game like Bright Memories, the game is developed by one developer and the assets are stolen. One developer, no funding whatsoever.   And the no cracking games on Facebook pages I think it already happened once with a game but it didn’t get famous or anything due to how much bugs in it. The CEO released the game without any beta testing so people refunded their money bc of how many bugs are in the game.   But the main reason of me posting this is if someone can make a game like Bright Memories alone surely we can make something like it with a team ? And it doesn’t have to be a game that’s massive. Look at Hellblade it’s a linear game with a story no exploring or anything good old walk this path fight monsters and listen to the story. Or Rocket league, try to score with your flying car. Or even Little Nightmares, brilliance in the game design and the mechanics of the game but it’s not massive or anything.	NULL

I'm software developer, I agree. Lack of education results in low-quality programming courses for beginners, we have the WORST and the BEST programmers, but either they travel abroad and possibly never come back, or get exploited by the National Security, so there's no effort in advancing CS students level.

It’s simple, really. Most, if not all, Egyptians with the proper skills and talent work abroad. There are no AAA game studios in studios in Egypt so any Egyptian devs find work and opportunities abroad. Budget is also an incredibly important factor that we shouldn’t underestimate, though many other comments mentioned that.  You’d be surprised at how many Egyptians work in studios such as Ubisoft, for example. For every AAA game you’ve played, there was likely an Egyptian dev or two involved in creating it. Though not exactly a game dev, one of the lead producers at Ubisoft, Youssef Maguid, is Egyptian.   It’s also not just relegated to AAA gaming. There are a lot of indies, too. Rami Ismail is a great example of this. He’s a half-Egyptian and an industry veteran who worked on a lot of really good indie titles with the now defunct Vlambeer at the Netherlands.	NULL

I am not sure how the problem advanced to the current stage but the real issue right now is that people became desensitized to the sight of garbage or the abused stray animals or the vandalized public places. basically the streets of Egypt look like a place where you would find Egyptians. if we remove the garbage and clean the whole country then people will distaste the cleanliness and find it odd. I am sorry for what I am about to say and I hope no one gets offended but asking why Egypt is dirty is like asking why garbage cans have garbage in them. it's supposed to be like that otherwise why would it be one the shittiest countries to live in?

Not to mention animation and usage of game engines. All these things require skills. I think we can have a small studio develop an I die game since the sale is smaller and it's doable. But there is the issue of marketing it as well. Not to mention that most people don't find the idea lucrative and a bit of a gamble. It's safer to try to work in fields like web development, Mobile App development, networking etc... Than to pursue a career in video games in a developing country. People want money especially in current climate, the former are much safer options to go for than the latter. Kinda like someone who wants to be a singer, the vast majority would tell him/her that it's a stupid dream and only 1 in a million realise it. And push them to something more "serious".	NULL

I am not a radical leftist, I’m more of a centre left. My surroundings (Egyptian society) are more on the conservative side ik that. But I don’t have to be part of it, nor does Mohamed Salah.   This society is toxic because it rejects any kind of change or anything new to it basically, you can stay conservative all you want, you have the freedom to do so, but I want the freedom to be different and I don’t want this society to keep trying to bring people like me back the societal and cultural norms. You be you and I’ll be me, except I can’t be me when everyone keeps oppressing people like me this way, that’s on the society part.   Anywho, this is Reddit, you can say your opinion, like I just said mine, but irl we’d have more peace if there was actual freedom of speech and criticism.   And yeah non binaries exist and also genderqueers, my views on that part of the far left are mixed tbh but either way, I let them be who they wanna be, freely, and I expect them to do the same for me.

1. that was a bad joke, sorry 2.

That's perfectly fine, I just find pvp games to be much more toxic than pve ones so I thought I might throw the suggestion out there.

The only battle royale I play is Apex Legends but it's to troll my high ranking friend and that's about it so, I'm not the best to ask about that genre of games haha 😅 Do note the players in Apex are pretty toxic though so I don't suggest it.

*To be fair* yes, Cyberpunk is glitchy, but my point is this: It sold the 13 million despite its shortcoming and the hype prior combined show that interest for single player games is high.  In addition, in my opinion, a lot gems get released, the only problem is that they get overshadowed a lot by more mainstream appeal and, unfortunately, much of the spoilable parts get spoilt very easily due to how accessible everyone's comment on anything is nowadays, making spoilers much less lenient than they were back in the day, but still, as someone who looks for games continually to play, I find it easy to pick something to play that I like, especially if obscure thanks to the aforementioned reasons.

You can choose to be a bit of a leftists, conservative, liberal, communist, capitalist, feminist, whatever it is that you want to shove in there as well: because we have brains to chose and judge as opposed to stick to a frame of thoughts outlined by others.

Ok so my father was just like this took first dose in KSA and second dose in Egypt. First of all if you took the first dose in KSA then you know there is an app like an online health passport. My father took his second dose and got the certificate with the QR code on it and emailed them. Two days and the certificate got accepted and he was fully vaccinated.but because he took his second dose outside the kingdom he was still now allowed to enter without quarantine in another country.this was like November 202. He travelled to Jordan to take 15 days quarantine there and then go to the kingdom but 2 or 3 days before his end of the quarantine the ban was lifted and he travelled right away.so as long as i know if the app says you are fully vaccinated you will be allowed in.

There are extreme people on both sides. Same type of people on the opposition side that see everything bad and hate and undersell everything the country does. All the same shit as those that support the gov and never criticize. I could write this same paragraphs on the other side. And how anyone praising the gov for anything just gets called m3aras.   There isnt freedom of speech and that sucks and has never changed since, well like forever. Its stupid.   About the parades, those are good investments for tourism like our most important sector, very smart, lots of coverage online for relatively cheap. The mo2tamarat are really good too. The defence egx mo2tamar thing for weapons was great and helps develop and showcase our home made weapons, world youth forum is good too, gives youth a chance and shows their innovation and shit, its great too. Dont see the issue with those. And all the projects that were opened in upper egypt recently are important as fuck, not useless by any means, electricity and water Projects. Also good.  If the point of this post was a word against those that support the gov blindly and take any opposition to be enemys and evil. Then yea fuck those ppl and anyone one sided like that in general. But i disagree with trying to say the shit the gov is doing is useless or all for show to give the illusion of progress. More work is being put into Egypt in the past few years than the last 50 years combined. Thats a fact. All the investments in roads,tunnels,bridges,slum removals,monorail,metros,LRT,BRT,HSR,unis, haya karima, water projects, agricultural projects, all the projects that gave us self sufficiency, prison reform, military strengthening, cities, sinai development, upper egypt projects, and on and on. Its exactly what i want to see the country doing.   Thats not to say there isnt bad shit to be criticized, like lack of freedom of speech and opposition, tiran amd sanafir, need for more education spending/reform again cause last one sucked i hear, better urban planning, too much involvement from public sector.   Overall though, i see more bad than good and am pretty hopeful so much so that i think i plan on actually staying in Egypt rather than trying to leave. Wanna be part of the positive change.	NULL

On the contrary this game design is more focused to be played casually , on daily basis it doesn't require any grinding just max 10-15 min a day is more than enough to collect all you need and that's the problem that many hardcore players and endgame players complain that ths game is so easy cause it's focused on casual players but i think you have a point that any new player will find it overwhelming cause you will find lots of content to be played ,so if you are not rushing and grinding through the whole game to reach high levels ,you will enjoy the experience. As i said there is no point in grinding in this game cause endgame is not that hard and the game is not PVP .	NULL

If you're planning to visit the fancy hotels abd have some type of tour guide with you, you're okay. However, if you're going alone, just like the above comments, I'd recommend you to befriend an Egyptian before hand and do ALOT of research on us. You'd be surprised how different our cultures differ, so many things that you guys are A-OKAY with is frowned upon here. For example, public display of affection which is typically kissing your gf/bf would be frowned upon here. I acknowledge that you're coming alone, but I'm just giving you an example. One more thing, when buying something from the local marketplaces in Egypt, always bargain with the prices, even if it looks like they're giving you a great deal they're most likely ripping you off.  Sending love from Cairo. Always wanted to go to Canada. (speaking of which, be ready to face Egypt's moderate/hot whether conditions, could be bearable cuz it's winter though).	NULL

The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile, which begins at Jinja, Lake Victoria,[11] and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins from Uganda Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[12] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[13] The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, where Cairo is located on its large delta and the river flows into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times and its annual flooding. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. - Wiki	NULL

His funeral in Cairo was attended by millions of people[7] – more than any funeral in the history of the Middle East, other than that of President Nasser.[27] Halim was reported to have had many more dreams and goals that he wanted to achieve, though his early death prevented him from doing so.[19] In the wake of Halim's passing, it was documented people committed suicide, including at least four women committing suicide by jumping off a balcony during his funeral march.[1][7] He was buried in Al Bassatin Cemetery in Cairo. - wiki	NULL

Minecraft is one of the best games I've ever played, I even still play it to this day ( not much rn cuz school ) unlike what most people would think, you have unlimited possibilities from plugins to mods to servers. Im currently taking a break from Hypixel Skyblock, it's a really fun remake of the og Skyblock it took Skyblock to a whole new level with custom armours, bosses, mobs, game mechanics in vanilla. About Roblox tho .. it used to be a great until they started making the same games with different names and when they removed events 2018 had one 2 of the best events ever the RPO event and the Egg hunt, also the deletion of one of my favourite games was upsetting kinda why I left ( Pokemon Brick Bronze ).

The top companies I can recommend in no particular order:   Orascom   Palm Hills   Talaat Mustafa   Mountain View   WaterWay   Beverly Hills   Hassan Allam  Sodic  Al Futtam (Cairo Festival City)   etc.     Most are large and really good.     A budget of 500K can be a decent 20% Downpayment (most require 10%, some now take 0%).     I'd suggest looking at:   Mountain View icity / Hyde Park   Palm Hills Badya (6th october)   Zed East / West  EastTown (Sodic)  Hyde Park  &#x200B;  These are pretty decently priced and many will offer long payment plans and decent down payments.

Do not ask about things which, if they are shown to you, will distress you [Qur'an 5: 101].   “Do not delve into these matters or ask about matters on which Allah kept silent.” al-Taftazani  “Truly, the gravest sinner amongst Muslims is he who asks about something and probes into it and it becomes prohibited due to his insistent questions” (Muslim).   … and He (Allah) kept silent about certain matters out of mercy, not forgetfulness, so do not delve into them" [Reported by al-Darqatni and others through Abu Tha'laba al-Khushni.

Context: I like to get hyperfixated on Google Maps alot. So after looking at rural Argentina, I was decided to look at the desert Cairo-Aswan highway. Interestingly, I found an exit near Asiut that takes you southwest and I thought this would take you to Al Wahat (for some reason). After a couple hundred kilometers, I found out that it takes you to Al Kharga, which after a few kilometers, you'll find yourself in the beautiful costal city of Port Said /s then you will arrive at your final destination, the city of love.  Apparently it contains the ancient Egyptian temple of Dosh.	NULL

As a UK resident and having stayed in Egypt for a while, I can categorically say that Egypt has the best fruit. I used to go out just to buy bags of fruits, Omg the strawberries, oranges even tiny bananas. My only disappointment was the mangoes there was a huge variety but they were either too sweet or too mushy hard pass. And that cactus fruit you guys eat, pass. If I go back to Egypt one of the reasons will be for the fruit, and it’s so cheap (this maybe because if the GBP exchange rate and I understand for citizens they are probably expensive). The imported strawberries from Egypt just don’t hit the spot!	NULL

هم صح وانت صح بس اولا لازم نفرق بين الشرائع وبين المحرمات الاخلاقيه المطلقه زى الزنا والقتل والسرقه دول حرام للابد بدون سبب او بسبب وده من اهم اعمده الاديان وتسمى الاخلاق المطلقه وده بيمنعنا من اننا نتوه فى متاهات حاجه اسمها النسبيه الاخلاقيه اللى ممكن تحلل قتل مئات الالاف مثلا لحفظ ملايين زى النازيه والشيوعيه دول لو كانوا بيؤمنوا بالاخلاق الدينيه كانوا مستحيل يستحلوا الجرائم اللى مارسوها حتى لو الجرايم دى ليها مبرراتها المنطقيه العمليه  فبالتالى  الخلط عند بعض الشيوخ انهم بيعاملوا كل ما جاء بالقرآن او السنه على انه من الاخلاقيات العليا اللى ما ينفعش نتفاوض فيها.. الاحكام والشرائع دى قواعد تم وضعها فى زمن لتحقيق غايات عليا معينه لكنها قاصره محدوده بتغير الحال والزمان والمكان حتى لو ذكرت فى القرآن فدى اللى ممكن نتفاوض فيها والموسيقى منهم لو كانت محرمه كان فى زمن معين لظرف معين غير كده هى صوت من اصوات الطبيعه حلالها حلال وحرامها حرام	other

r/Islam	religion
To my very humble understanding, faith requires it.  The believing process for me does not necessarily require/start with knowing the logic behind every single detail. An everyday example of this: some of us can not wrap their head around/do not have enough knowledge when it comes to medical practices for example, yet we do believe in modern medicine without necessarily understanding all of its details, our believe in it is based mostly on the fundamentals and methodology it's based on.  Moving back to religion, some details/divine orders/etc may have a revealed or none revealed wisdom behind it I end up believing in those based on the rest of what I know and understand.  I came across this saying a while back in one book  وقد لخّص هذا الحال؛ ابن عمر رضي الله عنه لمّا قال: " لَقَدْ عِشْنَا بُرْهَةً مِنْ دَهْرِنَا وَإِنَّ أَحْدَثَنَا يُؤْتَى الْإِيمَانَ قَبْلَ الْقُرْآنِ، وَتَنْزِلُ السُّورَةُ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فَيَتَعَلَّمُ حَلَالَهَا وَحَرَامَهَا، وَمَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يُوقَفَ عِنْدَهُ فِيهَا كَمَا تَعْلَمُونَ أَنْتُمُ الْقُرْآنَ ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: لَقَدْ رَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا يُؤْتَى أَحَدُهُمُ الْقُرْآنَ فَيَقْرَأُ مَا بَيْنَ فَاتِحَتِهِ إِلَى خَاتِمَتِهِ مَا يَدْرِي مَا أَمْرُهُ وَلَا زَاجِرُهُ، وَلَا مَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يُوقَفَ عِنْدَهُ مِنْهُ يَنْثُرُهُ نَثْرَ الدَّقَلِ "  Referring to how the companions of the prophet PBUH had strong base of faith first that led them to understand the more detailed articles  PS I'm not a sheikh and not learned enough to give an informed opinion, I'm just trying to describe my Personal  understanding of the matter	NULL
Yup, it's back now	NULL
هو فيه اسئلة كتير معقده اكتر من ان ليه الموسيقى حرام بس طبعا مع الانفتاح و النتفليكس و الضغط المجتمعى اللى الاسلام نفسه اتكلم عنه من اكتر من الف سنة هيحصل و بيحصل فعلا.   الفكرة كلها انه الموسيقى لو بتثيرك تبقى حرام ١٠٠٪؜ هتقولى ما انا مش حيحان اوى كده علشان الموسيقى تهيجنى هقولك  يا عم ناس تانيه بتهيج حاجه زى مزمار عبد السلام ده شوف الناس بترقص عليها ازاى و فعلا مش بتقدر تمسك نفسها، هتقولى ناس هايفه و انا مليش دعوه بيهم، يبقى انت زى الفل بس غيرك لا و الاسلام بيتكلم فى العموم يعنى حاجه فيها و فيها فى معظم الحالات علشان نقطع الجدال يبقى لا	NULL
في فرق بين الاغاني والماتشات.  من اسباب حرمانية الاغاني في كتر سماعها لان مداومة سماعها بتخليها تعلق في راسك وهتلاقي نفسك بتغني وانتي قاعد فاضي، ثانيا الاغاني اللي فيها حرمانية برضة اللي كلها غزل لانها بتفتح مداخل للشيطان لتفكيرك.   لكن مش حرمانيتها لانها بتلهي عن الذكر بس لان من النظرية دي فأي حاجة هتاخدك من الفروض فهي حرام. حتى لو قعدة صحاب بتتفرج على مسرحية لمحمد صبحي.  فمش كل الاغاني حرام و مش دايما الاغاني حرام.  الدين يسر.	other

خلينا نفرق بين الدين و الافراد. لا أحد يمثل الدين. أي شيخ لا يمثل الا نفسه و رأيه دا رأي شخصي تبعه. ممكن شيخ لا يعرف سبب حكم معين و لا يحب ان يبحث و يبذل مجهود و بالتالي رده بيكون هي كدا عشان ربنا قال كدا. مش معني كدا ان هو صح او ان هو دا الدين. الموضوع كبير و متشعب جدا و صعب/غلط اغتزاله في "ليه الاغاني حرام". انت كمسلم أو كإنسان ربنا أمرك انك تفكر و تتدبر و تبحث في كل الامور. سيدنا ابراهيم (و انبياء كتير) تناقشوا مع الله و طلبوا دليل علي الوهيته و ربنا تحاور معهم عادي و اعطاهم دليل.   الفكرة هي تسليمك لأمر الله رغم عدم معرفتك للحكمة. و هذا ليس معناه انك لا تبحث عن السبب. المفروض انك تبحث و تحاول تفهم لكن في حالة انك موصلتش لسبب مقنع هل ستظل علي الايمان و تثق ان الله خالق الكون و واضع القوانين له حكمة حتي و إن لم تعرفها ولا ستفقد ايمانك؟ و انت صعب توصل للثقة بالله دي غير لما إيمانك نفسه يكون نتيجة بحث و تفكير في الخلق و الكون و الحياة.   لو حابب ممكن تتفرج علي فاضل سليمان علي يوتيوب هو عنده علم غزير و بيتكلم في مسائل العقيدة بشكل جميل و في الشبهات حول الاسلام و هكذا و اعتقد ممكن تلاقي عنده اجابات لأسئلتك.	other

You're playing a blame game rn, the one thing that you don't know is that i was there lmao 🤣 june 2009, you shouldn't be faking facts or lying which is kinda stupid and even my fellow Egyptians who were there will say so, the fans  didn't even bring weapons carrying weapons is prohibited in our stadiums a minority of them flooded the stadium on the first game most were adolescents from school to celebrate with the players it was after the final whistle, 2nd the reception was with roses and at our best hotel at the time and even shahata and the players thanked them for the good conditions, 3rd you only mentioned those and didn't mention when our players got thrown rocks at while being on the bus 4th the match in sudan most of guys who went from algeria to sudan were ex prisoners and thugs as they felt Egyptians would do smth to us and never paid them sudanese thugs cuz they were thugs themselves even tho not even a single egyptian nor algerian was injured or touched in that match and you can provide me with a proof if you want, i can provide you with a thousand if you want, just stop the blame game and lying to yourself before lying to me and everyone else, you're making yourself hate algeria it's not that you hate, it's football that made you hate us but sir if you're gonna fake some facts that even some Egyptians confirmed then I'm sorry i completely disagree but wouldn't care less tbh or change your mind, you're one Egyptian in 100millions or so	NULL

هو عمومًا الدين معظمه انت بتورثه فعلًا و لان افكاره بتتغرس فيك فا انت لما بتكبر و تلاقي حاجة مش عقلانية في الدنيا بتبدأ تدور على طريقة تثبت عقلانية الحاجة دي حتى لو طريقة البحث نفسها مش عقلانية. يعني انت مثلًا شايف ان الموسيقى حاجة عادية بس الدين بيقول عكس ذلك؟ مش لازم تبدأ تدور على حاجة تثبتلك ان الدين لان كدا كدا هتلاقي ناس تحاول تقنعك مهما حصل. نصيحة بسيطة اعمل اللي انت شايفه صح حتى لو بيتعارض مع المجتمع او الدين لان في حاجات في الدين نفسه مفروض مفروض تتعمل و مبتتعملش لانها غير مقبولة في المجتمع.

Have you even watched a game in our stadiums?! Most are holding a darbouka and singing derps lol, are you being forreal rn... THE MEDIA?!!

HELL NO. I admitted that the ones went to sudan were thugs mostly but didn't do any hostilities in sudan yet they're innocent told you to give me one news that if you believe YOUR MEDIA that any Egyptian got attacked in sudan in the stadium in 2009, yes they insulted shahata and sang a song on him but i Guess that happened even in the premier league on arsenal stands against wenger 😂, i won't argue any further tbh or justify cuz I'm kinda tired of all this you and us chat lol, your first reply made it look like you hated algeria, people already said that football is the reason of the hate but either it's us or you who's wrong we needed to forget not dig into it as you did.

انا شايف أنك سألت كذا سؤال داخلين في بعض.  أولا، عشان تبقى مسلم فأنت محتاج حاجتين، أنك تؤمن بوجود إله واحد أحد و أنك تؤمن أن سيدنا محمد عليه الصلاة و السلام هو رسول من الله و خاتم المرسلين.  هل الإيمان ده عمياني؟  بالنسبة لشوية ناس ربنا هديها، اه عادي و بالنسبة لناس تانية، لأ لازم تثبتلي الكلام ده  سريعا كده، بتستدل على وجود إله من أن الكون ده مستحيل يكون عشوائي و أن في تصميم و نظام في كل حاجة و العشوائية مش بتنتج نظم و مافيش حتجو عشوائية، في نقص معلومات عندنا.  و بتستدل على أن سيدنا محمد عليه الصلاة و السلام رسول الله، عن طريق أنك بتشوف هو أيه الأدعاء بتاعه (أنه كان في الغار و جاله ملك و قاله أنه رسول رب العالمين) ، أيه هي الأحتمالات؟ عندك هنا ٤ نقط:  - بيكذب - بيخرف - الشيطان هو ألي ساعده  - بيقول الحقيقة اول ٣ أحتمالات ديه تقدر تستبعدها بالمنطق و بمعرفة الأحداث وقتها ،  فيتبقى أنه بيقول الحقيقة، يبقى لازم تتبعه، عشان ده كلام كبير.  ثانيا، بعد ما بتقتنع بالنقط ألي فوق، تبدأ بقى تتعلم الدين نفسه و أيه الأوامر و النواهي و كده.  ممكن تتعلم عن طريق حد تعرفه، و ساعتها فانت محدود بعلم الشخص ده و ممكن تتعلم عن طريق الدراسة و القراية.   هل في حاجة أسمها هو كده؟  لأ في علوم إسلامية ذي الفقه و علم الأحاديث و فيه مذاهب و حاجات كتير. هل أنت مستعد تدرس كل ده؟ بالتوفيق  و ذي ما حد في تعليقات هنا قال، في قنوات دعوة على youtube ذي EFDawah, Hamza's Dean , One Message Foundation و غيرهم قناه EFDawah بالتحديد بيعملوا streams مختلفة و بيسمحولك أنك تjoin الstream و وسأل أو تجادل و بيحاولوا يجاوبوك، فا هو ده ألي أنت بتدور عليه  EFDawah Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/EFDawah They do the following streams: - 'The Dawah Clinic': (For Muslims and reverts) If you have difficulty in answering certain questions or need help in responding to polemics towards Islam and Muslims. - 'The Open Forum': Where Christians can join and discuss. - 'The Perfect Storm': For anyone that would like to have their belief system challenged.	other

A small advice. If you are living in Egypt, take medicine even if it doesn't interest you that much for simple 2 reasons   1- you can study to become SWE during your holidays if you really feel about, most of IT employers don't require you to have a major in CS as long as you have the needed skills, study CS at college seems like a waste of time    2- just in case that you fail to find a job outside egypt (which is a high possibility)being doctor will definitely serve you better here in Egypt  I know what I said is kinda harsh but I am trying to stay realistic	NULL
you already knew it's because of football , and you also know the reasons , for me i don't care about the hate egypt gets , we get a lot more hate from other african countries like ethiopia , and we dont know their reasons so it's not a massive issue to me	NULL
Great photo - I love the sleeping dog in the foreground.   This is the Metropolitan dig house used by the Polish Mission working at the Hatshepsut Temple. It is just south-east of the temple by the tombs in the North Asasif.	NULL
To each their own, there's an Algerian saying that i used to love "i back my brother on my cousin and i back my cousin on the outsider" i wanted to know how Egyptians think about it not necessarily the specific reason or the real one that's what a discussion is about i guess but fair enough thank you for your opinion.

Everything is catastrophic, the last one organised in Egypt was phenomenal but this one should've been cancelled for real. bad stadiums, matches organised at 2pm in the heat, and the bad referees, it's a complete disaster. Our belmadi screwed the starting formation a bit and many chances missed but it's understandable by me at least, i watched Egypt match and the only struggle is passing the ball in Nigeria's half and getting them to salah which shouldn't have been played as a cf at all. Best of luck on the next one let's hope we both win and recover.	NULL

Your best and only option is sending it with someone you know coming from the uk to egypt.   I faced the exact same problem except my bank account is in saudi, i cancelled my card because it got hacked and issued a new one and they delivered it to my family. I tried to make them send it through post but aramex said egypt doesn’t accept receiving bank cards through post mail, i called dhl and they said they accept it but they must send it to the central banks for assessment which is completely unnecessary and it will costs 3,000 pounds. I had to wait for a week until my friend came to egypt for a vacation and brought it with her.   The whole thing is utterly stupid and i advice you not to waste your times with companies because they will just piss you off.   Good luck	NULL

إنت بتعمل الحاحة من غير ما تفهمم سببها بعد ما تتأكد إنها من أوامر رينا اللي بلغهالك الرسول الصادق فبالتالي محتاح تكون عديت علي المرحلتين دول الأول وإتأكدت من وجود ربنا وإنه بعتلك رسول .. الدين بيشرحلك إزاي تعمل الحاجة .. لكن الحكمة منها زي ليه بعملها .. أظن دي مش لازم أعرفها .. في حاجات ربنا وضح الحكمة منها وفي حاجات لأ.. ساعتها حيبقي مطلوب أتأكد من حكمها وبس .. طيب هل غير المسلم حيدخل الإسلام علشان فهم إيه سبب إن أكل الخنزير حرام ؟ في رأيي المفروض لأ .. لأن ده حيخليه لو مفهمش الحكمة مينفذش زي الذهب ليه حلال للستات وحرام للرجالة .. وكمان لو حد اجتهد وقال الحكمة كذا والعلم قال دي غلط ساعتها حتلاقي ناس تقول الدين ده غلط ..  غير المسلم بيدخل الإسلام لما يقتنع اولا بوجود إله واحد أرسل رسل بدين واحد وأجابهم علي أهم الأسئلة الوجودية زي بداية الخلق ونهايته والهدف من الحياة .. الرسول قعد في مكة ١٣ سنة بيعلم الناس التوحيد بس .. الأحكام والتشريعات كانت قليلة وقتها فمكانشخول الإسلام بالضرورة معتمد علي فهم الأحكام أكيد ..

On the long-term, practicing being social is the way to go buddy. Here’s why:  Your first time sexing is gonna be weird. Guaranteed. Even if it’s with your soulmate, wife, partner, whatever. It’s like… going to a cafe for the first time Vs after you’ve become friends with all the staff there. So, one time isn’t gonna be enough for you to experience sex cuz you’re mind is still getting used to the new sensations and the positions n shit.  Sex isn’t simple dick in vagina. Sex is a very complex act that ties in emotions and physical touch and sometimes it’s spiritual as hell. A sex worker does this for living. It’s like the waiter who’s nice to you but you know it’s cuz they just want the tip (lol). A friend or a girlfriend or a one night stand even is just a much deeper experience, esp during the first time cuz it’s a lot nicer when you feel comfortable and safe with the person.   I know you just wanted the name of a place and not a lecture or whatever, so I’m sorry about that and here’s a cool trick: If you can speak good English, go to a hotel and ask the concierge in English but be smart about it. He’ll refer you to a place/person and you might even get a high-end sex worker/escort.   Anyway, I just thought you had to know the difference between f*cking and sex because we already have so many misconceptions about sex in this country that it’s been ruined for us so hard (lol again). I wouldn’t want it to be ruined for you too if you go in with unrealistic expectations.  Good luck on your journey my friend. And remember, tinder is always an option.	NULL

late reply but I've been wanting to rant about this game for ages  before i start i wanna make it clear i love this game and its one of my faves as someone who has played every AC game except valhalla, liberation and those mobile game ones   as usual with ubisoft games they do an amazing job with the world and the setting and the general ambiance like you could just stand there, raise the volume and you'll feel like you're really standing in Ptolemaic Egypt  another thing ubisoft is good at is bringing the real life history into the game and adding their twist into it where it becomes a bit more fantasy-like but not in a bullshit way  (tho i didn't like how they went with the stereotype of cleopatra being some kind of a prostitute queen)  however I noticed they tried a bit hard to push the whole "ancient egyptians were black" thing by making the egyptians black with african voice actors   also i noticed some names in the game, like Aya, are modern Arabic names and not ancient egyptians tho i might cut them some slack cuz we probably don't know that many ancient egyptian names   the story isn't quite up to the AC standard we see in the first few games (especially AC2) but it's not bad its not as bad as the games that came after lol  i might be a bit biased cuz it's set in where im from and im the kinda gamer who likes exploring in open world games but i did like this game a lot	NULL

أولًا خليك عارف كويس أن مافيش مشكلة في تربيتك أنت اللي صح وهم اللي نفسهم يبقوا زيك علشان كدا بيرخموا عليك.  ثانيًا أنت مش لوحدك لأن فيه ناس كتير متربية في بيئة زي اللي أنت اتربيت فيها أغلبهم هتلاقيهم جايين من الخليج.  ثالثًا هقول لك نفس الكلام اللي الناس هنا قايلاه واللي بقوله لأي حد قريبي داخل جامعة: في الجامعة هتلاقي من كل الأشكال، استنضف الأشكال اللي تبقى حواليك وابعد عن أي حد مش محترم تمامًا وحط مسافة بينك وبين أي حد لغاية ما تقرر أنت عايز تصاحب مين.  غير كدا أنت اعتبر أن المرحلة دي تدريب لذكائك الاجتماعي في حاجات كتير زي أنك تعرف توقف الناس عند حدها لو تجاوزته وازاي تاخد حقك بأدب لأن دي مهارات هتحتاجها في المستقبل أكتر من احتياجك ليها دلوقتي سواء في مصر أو برة مصر. وربنا يوفقك.	other

Bank in Egypt suck. Period. It's like they are doing a favor by allowing you to give them your money.  I dealt with QNB and CIB. Both are decent, I prefer CIB more. I was with QNB since it was NSGB.  I'd consider EG Bank, just because they went through a make over and actually look pretty decent, and the employees are not stuck up assholes. CIB only really cares about you once you surpass a certain savings amount, then all of a sudden you are assigned a personal assistant and a direct number to call and a bunch of ass kissing.  QNB was great cause I had a lot of friends working there, like I would literally not even take a ticket and walk in and get shit done while having coffee. They also had decent online options.  Gov banks are better for the CDs and interest rate, but you said you don't care.  Chargebacks in Egypt suck, they treat each case as suspicious that you are trying to rip them off. Thankfully I never had to deal with that. Only card that interests me is the EgyptAir Credit card cause it gives me miles I can use to upgrade my status there (I don't even care about redeeming them at this point).	NULL
كنت بقعد علي السطح بالليل في البلد اتفرج علي السما و الشهب و كده، المناظر كانت جامدة عشان مفيش دخان ولا نور بقي و السما واضحة.  المهم في اوقات كنت بشوف حاجات عاملة زي النجوم بس بتتحرك ببطء، مش كده و بس، حركتها غير منتظمة و اوقات اتجاه الحركة بيتغير، و كل مرة اشوف النجم/الجسم ده كانت اخر حاجة بتحصل انه يتحرك بسرعة مرة واحدة و يختفي.  مرت السنين و انا مش فاهم حاجة (و لفترة كنت مفكر انها كائنات فضائية، جايز...) لحد السنة الي فاتت لما عملت بحث في الفلك تبع المدرسة و اخيرا وصلت لتفسير.  عشان الخص الموضوع الجسم الي شوفته ده (غالبا) كان ثابت، بس بيحصل انحرافات في الضوء الي جاي منه ممكن تكون لسبب من اتنين، او الاتنين مع بعض يعني الله اعلم، و هما ان الضوء في طريقة بيقرب لثقب اسود(غالبا بيتحرك بسرعة و الا الضوء كان هيبقي ليه مسار واحد) او ان الضوء بيتاثر بالمادة المظلمة، او الطاقة مش فاكر... المهم يعني ان الدحيح كمان اتكلم عن الموضوع في احدي حلقاته فياريت الي فاكرها يحط اللينك في كومنت و انا هحاول اجيب المصدر برده.

There's nothing called it's meant to be like that. Devlepement of Politics and social dynamics changes everything throughout history. And you sre talking as if unity means letting the others occupy us, each nation has sovereignty that they protect, however it will be one united sovereignty instead of 2 different.  Take the USSR as an example, the Moscow russians, ukranians, baltics, central asia turkics, armenians, mongolians, each had their own culture identity heritage and most had a long history. However one day they became one nation. Yea it didn't go so well for its beginning especially they just got out of a civil war and then ww2, but you can't doubt they were afrerwards a very stable and strong unified state of different nations together.  If we united with some nations in means of uniting as one state without giving up your own identity and history then I don't see the problem? Algerians fought the french for independence as we fought the brits, not only that but they lost and suffered way more, 5.6M during the entire colonial era and 1-1.5M during their Independence War. We also had casualties but were never high like that.	NULL

>how much percentage of the Egyptian population use banking transactions daily  [67% of Egyptians](https://enterprise.press/stories/2021/03/18/we-still-banknotes-35647/) are unbaked and so only 33% have a bank account.   >Do Egyptians pay taxes? And how much does the black market contribute to the economy?  Taxes most of the time is taken automatically from the people without doing much, so the taxes are deducted from the peoples salary and taken without the people having to do anything or the Capital Gains Tax that was implemented this year where people who have less than 5,000,000 EGP invested in stock, won't have to open a tax file but their profits will be taken from the brokerage account by the Misr for Central Clearing and Depository. Also if you go to any supermarket or restaurant you more than likely paid a value add tax.  >Why do Egyptians not have a governmental payment system where every citizen has an identifier like the one in US & Europe (Social Security number) or barcode rather  Egyptians have a national ID number which I assume is the equivalent to the Social Security Number but I am not exactly sure.  >includes the private sector and all small businesses.  I believe every business has to open a tax file before it can open.   All of the stuff you mentioned is a problem the government is trying to handle and they definitely trying to increase the revenues they get from taxes, by promoting financial inclusion. While some of the new taxes are good others in my opinion are bad, and most of the time they delay implementing taxes if they are really unpopular, which is sometimes a bad thing.	NULL

Light can be bent under the influence of gravity. Doesn't have to be a black hole, but any planet or body dense enough would have the same effect.

WTF didn't know that 67% of Egyptians do not have bank accounts. That damaged my mind.    This means that Egyptians have billions of $$ in economic circulation that is not reported to the taxation institutions across the governorates halls and the Presidential government.    Given this premise, our GDP should be exceeded $500B or so like Italy, Brazil, Etc. Italy, for example, about 15% of its GDP is in the shadow.    Regarding your conclusion, Yes, I agree with you. Egyptians do not pay their fair share of taxes, and there are always many ways to cheat. There are tons of ppl making tens of millions of pounds and paying virtually nothing.

Most Egyptians, whether lower middle class or properly poor are part of the working class, so I don't see the point in making it seem like that's not a huge portion of the population? Those people with no access to basic life necessities are similarly struggling, and they most likely are working class too just in the "unofficial" market. Economic strife is omnipresent in Egypt and it's all for the same reasons: the large, long-term projects ur praising require serious austerity measures that continue to suffocate ppl for the long periods of time that they take to actually make profit. Even when they do (see IMF loans taken out during Sadat era, running into Mubarak era), these ppl never live to see the fruits of such projects, it's usually a select few who do and the rest just eat shit. So I don't particularly appreciate me criticising your take that is honestly demoralising of public grievances as "me lacking vision" when YOU'RE the one refusing to hear people out!	NULL

Youre grossly underselling the extent of the projects being done. "Shwayet masharee3 bent a7ba". The amount of projects in pretty much every sector is crazy. You never see this work being put in mubaraks rule. And we're not drowning in debt from these projects. Our debt is at very good levels and is said to be manageable. (https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/10/despite-reaching-all-time-high-egypts-external-debt-within-safe-levels)  You need to be patient. Proper Work is being put into the country, its not being left to crumble and just trying to keep yourself as a ruler popular by making things cheap and shit like allowing slums to flourish. Its been 7 years. Its not enough time for you to feel it. We are the generation that will have to feel the bullshit of the past 40 years this country faced.	NULL

That's exactly the whole point we are talking about.  What is sold locally is of a much lower quality than what is sold abroad.  You argument is that it should be so since locally it is cheaper? (Even though that's not quite the case, food in Germany is comparable to the prices in Egypt, especially when it comes to things they produce locally like apples for example)   In the end the government (Ministry of Agriculture) is responsible for providing the local market with good quality food (comparable to the exported quality).  >Unless you want the farmers work for you for free  They are already being paid pennies btw. That's why labour intensive produce like strawberries (since there are no machines that reliably pick strawberries) are being farmed in low labour cost countries like Egypt.	NULL
Actually he's right, the fruits and vegetables that are made to be exported are of higher quality and are not sold locally, there are specific farms in Egypt that make fruits and vegetables for export only, yes you can find the same types of fruits and vegetables in local markets obviously but they're not the same as the ones that are exported.  Source: my uncle works in the agricultural sector with the army Another source: he got me some fruits from the export only farms that are mostly managed by the army and I bought some from local vendors and the export only ones are much much better and tastier	NULL

Being educated is knowing where the value of money comes from. Knowing how government policies affect everyday life.   If the average person on the street understood that inflation is the government printing money, wouldn't they dislike the government less? If they knew that tariffs and customs hurts them but are only for the military production and such... who in egypt would be fine with any of this shit?  You would have riots 24/7 until they stopped this crap. That's what education means.	NULL

Because the rest of the world has secularized while we were demonizing secularism and restoring the prestige of a thousand year old set of rules and ideologies.  And because of lack of education and lack of authority that challenges islamism due to fear of the people.  &#x200B;  And this has been persistent and it has many reasons. It's not linked to 1 govt or 1 entity.  I may even say it's linked to the people themselves. My friends in the uni cheat and get full marks coz their parents are professors.     And supervisors stage it among themselves that they'd help each others' relatives in exchange for the same.  Professors or teachers are unqualified or are lazy and just content with their fixed salary and don't care about bettering themselves etc.  &#x200B;  So please dont just ignore all of this and tie down the lack of education to the govt. Nasser for example has actually been way better than any of his predecessors in this field particularly.	NULL

Long gone are the days of the single income family, back in the day everything was cheap in comparison and your salary could sustain your whole family.

Well when someone like mo who is a Muslim, doesn't even say happy new year or anything about the new lunar year which is more important to a Muslim but then he celebrates Christmas is just weird especially that he is a public figure, but tbh i never saw or heard anyone tell a Christian your religion is false or anything bad for Christmas i even have some christian friends and they never told anything bad that happened to them from Muslims like that is a bit rare and i would also find it weird and inappropriate to say to attack someone's religion unless they attack yours so i am kinda with you in that point. But the one with girls dressing inappropriately this is more of a cultural approach bec we aren't a society in which people can wear anything, you must wear appropriate clothes wether you are a girl or a guy while it happens more often with girls still some boys dress inappropriately and they too should be attacked for doing so like you can't walk in the street wearing an open shirt exposing your belly (which i have seen people do personally) you might not agree with me on this and say that in America or whatever they can wear anything but you have to realize that this isn't America and we have a different culture.

Yeah it’s definitely not as bad but the thing is, there are times where the secular, even atheistic side in certain arguments just drown out the more representative, more conservative and Islamic (or actually, just religious in fact) opinion.

That you don't incite or encourage bigotry, racism, sexism or violence.  2. That you do not intrude on other people's freedom of **not** wanting to listen to you by shoving your messages down their throats or invading their space. 3. That you accept the possibility of someone firing back at you with **their** freedom of speech be it as jokes, taunts or outright dissing.  Generally speaking, people in egypt intrude on other people's lives as in they force there ideals down others' throats because they were raised that way. They weren't allowed to be different in thought or action and every deflection away from the societal norm was met with harsh and sometimes inhumane punishments from their families and in particular, their parents. As a result they grow up with the mentality of "you're either with us or you must be destroyed".  That being said, the example OP provided doesn't really belong in this situation because it's a video that was posted publicly on social media. If you post something to the "people" then you must be prepared for, and accept, the fact that you'll be met with opposing views and beliefs (which is completely fine unless they break the 3 rules stated above). If you aren't comfortable with criticism then keep your posts to your private circle.  TLDR, the comments on the video while not pertaining to some people's tastes are a representation of freedom of speech, and shouldn't be removed because it offends a bunch of sensitive snowflakes.

Hello, iam currently living in Egypt and one of the newer generations, and would like to put out some points.  1. I like that you are critizing our society, that usually would lead to a better solution than the current one, but, you currently aren't living in Egypt and probably haven't gone to high school in Egypt and seen what the mentality of kids are, kids are the future and more important than your "friendly" neighbor that cussed out my mother for wishing her Christian friends a merry Christmas, extremely toxic people exist in Egypt and I can agree on that.  I have seen hundreds of adults who hate atheists and lgtbq, people of other religions and nationalities, it's sad but true.  However the newer generations have been exposed to so much foreign cultures by tiktok and other social networks that they have imprinted the open minded mentality on them, myself included. My school is full of Christians and Muslims we are together in harmony, one of my friends is in fact Christian and I don't hate atheists at all, however when it comes to lgbtq I haven't really decided an opinion yet as iam very conflicted with whether it's right or wrong, but nonetheless whenever iam online I treat them with respect.  I have seen so many kids who support LGBTQ and are very open minded in our generation, however I can confirm that the middle classes who are brought up in uneducated families aren't as open minded.  Lastly what I wish to add is that it 100% depended on the person, my grandma tells me tales of when they were living in isolated villages, Muslims celebrated Christmas and Christians celebrated Ramadan, it's truly a how educated your family was when bringing you up.

Egypt just replaced 25% of its prisons with wady al natrun correctional facility. Its destroying the old ones that are in the middle of cities. This new facility gives them proper treatment, proper sunlight, libraries, sports, classrooms, teaches them agriculture, solar power, hand crafted products, proper visits, proper space, actually rehabilitates, following Norwegian models. And work is already being done to make more of these facilities to replace the old hell. We working on it	NULL

While the concept is right there are 2 differences; a) English breakfast tea is a blend of multiple black teas, in Egypt it’s just 1 kind of tea, also the tea bag is not the only way to make tea here, tea can be used without a bag, either you use what is called tea infuser https://www.google.com/search?q=tea+infuser&client=firefox-b-m&prmd=sivxn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj22qaAhrL1AhWJ2aQKHfKCAVcQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&biw=375&bih=638&dpr=3#imgrc=1CG0eVn5i6azBM for example or you leave the tea to settle at the bottom of the cup, you don’t eat it or consume it in any way after drinking the tea, that’s the minor difference, the major difference is b) the peppermint used is in the form of fresh peppermint leaves not the one in the bag, and that makes a noticeable difference in the final output https://www.gourmetegypt.com/fresh-fruits-vegetables-herbs/herbs/mint good luck, hope they will like it	NULL
I have met idiots from Sweden and Norway who are living a million times better than a genius in Egypt. How is that possible in your opinion?	NULL
Thank you for your input. You are correct that I’m not as knowledgeable because I haven’t lived in Egypt for a long time, but I have kept in touch with friends I made in school while in Egypt and we often compare our lives, so I’d like to think that I’m a little more knowledgeable than others who live outside Egypt. I do agree with you that the younger generation is more open minded, however a lot of them are still prone to the same behavior. When I dated an Egyptian girl (I’m also a girl) her friends who lived in Egypt went after me on social media and would spam all my posts with hateful insults. I still think the younger generation is definitely more open minded than those before us, but I think the amount that accept LGBT or even just tolerate us are still very little. Nonetheless, I’m still holding out a little hope that one day I’ll be able to come back and not be worried someone will find out I’m gay and get me arrested.	NULL

I don't think that's a fair conclusion to reach. Being gay or atheist is, yes, legal in some countries but that doesn't mean that the people can't still judge them or snitch on them to their parents. In other words, yes, there is no legal action that can be taken towards these people but that doesn't mean that the disgusting intrinsic human qualities, of which we have been talking about, judging, snitching or any other, do not exist in these societies or that people don't act upon it. These qualities exist there as much they exist in Egypt. The government regiment legalizing or criminalizing is a whole different thing.    Also, that "judging" can manifest itself in other things. For instance, you can judge a person based on their political beliefs, it doesn't have to be sexaulilty, religion or what someone dresses only.    Likewise, thank you for having a civil discussion.

مش لازم نعمل حاجة .. ده رأيي وده رأيك عادي .. مش مطلوب يكون رأيي أو رأيك هو الصح المطلق ..  بس موضوع الحشرية والتدخل اللي أنا بتكلم عنه مختلف عن موضوع قلع ابحجاب والكريسماس والكلام ده .. لأن ببساطة الحاجات دي مش منتشرة في الدول الإسلامية بالدرجة اللي تسمح لأن اىناس تتدخل فيها .. يعني مثلا صلاح هو اللي حط صور الكريسماس علي العلن فإيه المشكلة لما الناس تقول رأيها سلبا أو إيجابا .. البنت اللي بتقلع الحجاب برضه اللي حيتكلم معاها هو حد كان يعرفها قبل وبعد فبالتالي ليه كلام معاها ..  في الحالات اللي زي دي الكلام لو خرج بره دايرة النصيحة يبقي غلط وده اعتقد مختلف عن الموضوع اللي بنتكلم فيه دلوقتي .. حديك مثال .. أنا سيبت دقني تطول شوية وأنا عايش في إيطاليا .. زمايلي في الشغل (اغلبهم إيطاليين والشركة مالتيناشيونال) أغلبهم كلمني إني أحلقها وإني مش عاجبهم كده ..  أنا بعتبر ده نوع من التدخل الغلط لأن ولا فيه نصيحة ولا دين ولا أي حاجة .. تايز أقول إيه؟ إني مؤيد لفكرة النصيحة والأمر بالمعروف كمان طالما في إطاره .. لكن التدخل في الخصوصيات زي حتخلفوا امتي والتدخلات في التربية والحاجات اللي شبه دي هي اللي بحسها زيادة في مصر عشان بنكمل اللي ناقصنا عند الناس .. وده في رايي في النهاية لا ينطبق علي اللي بيحط صورة ليه في مكان عام .. وفي الآخر ده رأيي	other

But is the rate of violence against LGBT in the US the same as Egypt? Definitely not. If Egyptians accept or hate LGBT at the same rate as Americans, why do people seek asylum to the US to avoid discrimination for being queer? Why did Sarah Hegazi need to go to Canada?   Why would my mom threaten to send me back to Egypt when she found out I was gay? because she knew I would not have the same freedoms I have in the US.   Also, why do people in this sub always tell queer people not to visit or not show their queerness?

This happens everywhere not just in Egypt and not just regarding religion. People nowadays believe that what they think is the only right thing and everybody has to follow it. For those who say freedom of speech tho, there’s a difference between saying what’s on your mind and giving your opinion, and just insulting the others or forcing your ideology on people simply because they have a different view. Let people live their lives and you live your own. I would say tho that in Egypt this problem is amplified specially with religion, and the problem is the people who understand religion the least, are the ones who believe that doing anything slightly different than what they’re doing is wrong.

First of all, props for genuinely asking for my reasons without attacking me- and I have to say that I still met 2 or 3 people who I still have fond feelings of.   That being said, I was ostracised from all social circles because I didn’t speak the language. It was like I wasn’t worth getting to know, simply because I wasn’t Turkish and didn’t understand Turkish. Nobody ever paid me the common courtesy of speaking a language I actually understand (English), which I know for a fact that the guys at work were fluent at. My boss and supervisor were both some of the most humourless, slave-driving fuckers I’ve ever met; which may sound like more of an issue with the company I worked for, but it was 100% an issue with toxic Turkish work culture where you’re expected to work nonstop like a donkey and be questioned when you’re 10 minutes late.  Add to that some people’s mindless fetishisation of Ataturk (most Turks I met were pretty much pleasuring themselves to his pictures) and the weird hostility towards anything of remotely Arab or Islamic identity; or even the barest suggestion that we have some words in common, and you might understand why I have these feelings.  Again; I know generalisations are wrong, and there is a very good chance that the people around me were just assholes- which there are millions of in every country. However, that was my experience, unfortunately.	NULL

Yeah I get you. It's called victim mentality. I agree with you but the point still stands, we can't suppress other people's freedom to express their opinions (within reason) and then expect ourselves to be able to do so.

Usually, I'm a lurker and just comment on something only when I'm comfortable or when I feel like it, but this will be my first comment posted out of rage.  I REALLY hate how you approached the situation, how you started the topic "Most of the Egyptians", and the way you're debating in the comments. No one is denying anything, dear. We're only saying that this happens to ALL of the societies around the world.  It may seem that this is a usual occurrence and that most of the Egyptians are nosey and filled with hatred, but if you think about it, people who usually see something neutral/like they wouldn't really react or give a positive comment, only people who have filthy shit to say will comment, hence you seeing a post with only negative comments and all that.  This is not just in Egypt, this is EVERYWHERE. You remember when Abo Treka (a famous Egyptian football player) went out and publicly complained about how he's against LGBTQ after its flag was displayed before some football match in the English league which his daughter was watching. EVERYONE wanted to cancel him ALTHOUGH he approached the matter in a respectful manner. Yet when some fricking christian priest publicly insulted OUR prophet, no one raised a finger.  I don't know how old you are, but you're clearly fragile enough to see that Egypt is the "bad guy" while everyone is a saint. Each country and society has its different cultures, different people, the good and the bad. Hell, I'd say Egypt is the best country in the world, displaying the good Christian/Muslim relationship, especially during wartime. Christians would cover the muslims' back when they were praying el gom'aa prayer, and the Muslims would do the same to Christians.  Still believe we're just the worst? What about THE NEGATIVE comments that female American-Muslims face for covering up their heads, or how FRANCE, AN ENTIRE COUNTRY, banned hijab for the girls under 18 years. The same country that claims freedom and embraces everyone.  If I could, I'd list the defects of every country but even that would take about a day worth of writing. You're too naive to think that an entire country is responsible for a few pieces of shits' comments. We don't all think the same, and I agree with you about throwing those with negative comments to hell. If it doesn't affect you and you don't have anything nice to say, then shut up.	NULL

This ⬆️ And also don't stress over having a paid internship in a big agency from the start, such good opportunities are super rare unless you know someone who will get you the job/internship and this means that most people don't have this someone but they figure things out and start their career anyway and progress until they get whatever the job they want or have the connections that can actually help them Finding a job can be frustrating especially for people just starting off, but this is the standard situation, it's super normal but you have to try and stay patient  For the skills part, it also happens a lot, it's mainly skills and memory, not magical creativity, so you don't really totally forget you just need some time, practice, and inspiration (from practising, browsing artwork, and hanging out with communities that share your interest if possible) and it can also happen to you when you're perfectly fine, "Creative Block" is not a well-known term among artists for no reason  You're confused and frustrated but you're young and just starting your adult life so don't think of it as the end of the road when it's actually just the beginning Beginnings can be really tough but they don't define our entire future, it can always get better	NULL

It's deep in thr culture and kind of related to religion. Unfortunately after the cutlural changes in the 70's and 80's (gulf countries mass work migration) people were exposed to a culture where it's completely ok to judge and even punish someone if their religious "appearance" does not match society's taste.  With the effect of money as well, people started to inconciously relate the reason for wealth to being extrs religious -in appearance of course- and throughout the year, you have a society that is completely ok with judging.  Also in other cities in Egypt where more closed societies have always been terrified by norms and FEMALE's "honor" and demonizing anything sexual like it's something unnatural...this created a sexually frustrated society with fear of any appearance or act that they may find outside their forced norms. No awarness of the fact that people can be different and have different norms/beliefs/religions/values.	NULL

Honestly half of what he's saying doesn't make sense and we're only trying to speculate what he means, the point I think he's making is that these countries interfere with out business and call us out for human rights while they themselves are one of the main reasons the arab world is mostly fucked up, and he's right, but this isn't really a response to how little our country cares about human rights, and I don't think he has one so he'll always resolve to these half assed responses and his m3rsen will keep on sucking his tits calling it an "ouch response".

Honestly its not about Atatürk himself; I’m just not a fan of cults of personality in general. I hate it with Abdelnasser in my own country, and when Americans do it with George Washington. It’s just super weird to me that someone picks this random dude in their past and derive that their whole personality from loving him.  Regarding your first point- I do agree that the language barrier would be an issue everywhere, but I think you may have missed my point. I’m not saying it pisses me off that people CAN’T speak English; but rather that they’re fluent and choose not to- even in my presence. My supervisor at work threw me a surprise birthday party and the entire work gang spent the whole “party” chatting with each other in Turkish in the corner while I stood next to the cake twiddling my thumbs. That is my issue.  To address your second point, let me tell you that I’ve worked in 4 different countries (other than Egypt) and have had upwards of 13 bosses from at least 8-9 nationalities by now, and by far and away the least empathetic, most arrogant and emotionless asshole I’ve ever had the misfortune of working under was Turkish… not only that, but the Turkish supervisor he placed me under was the second worst boss I’ve ever had. You can make of that what you will; my personal theory is that Turkish work culture in general is toxic, much like Italian and Pakistani work cultures, where’s you’re expected to give 100% of your time to your job for nothing in return. The reason I think it’s part of the culture is because it wasn’t just me- all the other expats at the office also hated their bosses and thought they were slave driving assholes. However, I do concede that I may have just had bad luck with my bosses in Turkey.  Thank you for acknowledging that last point; I believe that was my biggest problem, personally- and it was the main reason I never felt welcomed.	NULL

Those were not colonies.

I'm neither an Islamist nor an Egyptian (my daughter is half Egyptian).  But I feel the term Islamist seems to be most commonly used now as a term by which to discredit others and dismiss their opinions.  I know older people (50+) who had high regard for the MB in the past,  but most of them seem to feel that group become largely ineffective and is not well led.  However, no one seems to regard it as a "terrorist group" except the U.S., Israel, Gulf leaders, some other Arab leaders, and those who have been influenced by them.  I've noticed that over the past 20 years, there has been a plethora of (fictional) films featuring "Islamists" who commit terrorism and that crimes/heinous acts are often attributed to them as red herrings.  (This has been  proven true in many instances).  Of course, the da'esh (Isis) and that ilk are an entirely different matter.  We should all condemn actual terrorism.  I wish we could have civil discourse and real conversations without labeling or dismissing those with conflicting views;  and without conflating the issues at hand.	NULL

He's absolutely right about everything he said and you have to realize that human rights issues could have gone much worse if things didn't get stabilized anytime soon. Sure, Egypt is not perfect about human rights at all and they keep censoring things that ago against "the image of Egypt" or "the morality of the Egyptian society" but at least we're not Saudi Arabia level of authoritarianism.  The next step is for the Egyptian people themselves to build a healthy progressive society that treats everyone equally with dignity and respect no matter who they are since we can't demand a government to enforce human rights when the society they govern themselves isn't even tolerant to any ideas that go against their traditions or beliefs to the point of violence and ruination of people's lives.

Sure:  - people are much warmer and friendlier. They actually take care about each other here. - Egypt actually treats Muslims and Christians in a much more equal and rightful manner than western countries. Discrimination on the country scale is almost non-existent. That’s the total opposite of big countries like France who are actively pissing Muslims off. - it’s a developing country with so many MEGA projects being built at once, whether these are the new 22 cities or the new means of transportation like the monorail and high speed train. These all create opportunities and promote the country to a much better rate of development than any other developed country.  Here you go.  PS: I know the last point is very debatable, but that’s how I see it. It’s always much easier and future-proof to build anew instead of upgrading and improving already established infrastructures. It’s also more costly believe it or not	NULL

We were all born in a racist world and we should actively educate ourselves against it but the problem is when people don't have exposure with other cultures they remain ignorant about the problem and their own bias.  It can be little things where people don't mean any harm by it but when pointed out by a black person after being surrounded by so many people who validate them and don't see an issue with it then they would get defensive and blame the other person for being sensitive... For example, you mentioned 'blacks' in your post, something that is considered insensitive/ dehumanising by people of color in Western spaces and is kind of erased from the language to the extent that if you say it it sounds like an insult. People around the world are going to be offended by different things so it's important to just listen to what the other side has to say withoyt attaching them to a stereotype.	NULL
The west has zero right to lecture about human rights while they continue to kill millions around the world, either through military action like the US did in Iraq, or by ruining the world for everyone else by stealing every possible natural resource and ruining the climate so hard civilization may never recover.  That said though, I believe there are legitimate places where you can take the conversation around human rights in a responsible way and make the case for why certain minorities or classes of people need more rights or why you need better life standards and how you believe all of those come around. Those things inherently can't come about through war or violence but through legal and cultural struggle and a dialogue that will last for decades. Whatever it is you want to see, for the love of God remember that these crackers never have your best interest at heart.	NULL

There are many more options to get cheap treatment and medicine, a lot of expenses (even including healthcare) were subsidized for everyone (now it's only poorer families), government treatment of refugees has also been considerably better than what some European countries do, jobs here have a required paid maternity leave.   Current Arab republic of Egypt's roots are socialist in nature, something some westerners would kill for their country to adapt to, but our purchasing power isn't nearly as big as the US (5% of it actually) so we can't do as much as they have the potential to do. If we had more (to simplify, started more businesses ---> paid more taxes) we would do more but relative to the US, but comparing capability, we are doing more effort financially to sustain less fortunate people.  I have had several family members who had terminal illnesses, none of them had to sell their house or work 3 extra jobs for treatment, they paid what they could and the government handled the rest.

If you share your own images or videos on social media, you are making it public. You don't expect every single member of the public to have the same mindset, culture, education or perception of the other. People are different and not everyone will give you a nice or a satisfying comment. I am not saying that it is right and i know it's depressing but it's just the way it is.  You said there were nice comments, i would focus on that and not pay attention to the negatives or let it get under my skin. My suggestion would be, keep your private moments to yourself and don't make public, social media is full of unsteady people and sociopaths.  Generalizing few comments to the entire country or public is a generalization and biased way of thinking. These people are everywhere. Anywhere you go, there will be people who pick on you because you look different in away. I live in europe and it's worse here than egypt in that aspect.	NULL

Mansoura is a small city compared to Cairo so anything that's not essential is hard to get here unless you order it online.  The road from Cairo to Mansoura takes around 3 hours more or less so make sure you have a comfortable ride please especially if you have motion sickness.  Hotels in Mansoura aren't really good but they will do. Restaurants and cafes are plenty though. Don't take a taxi here if you don't know the specific fare. You should't pay more than 40 pounds to get from the bus stop in the east quarter to the university gates in the west quarter. Just use uber but pay with your debit/credit card.   Mansoura used to be a beautiful city but sadly it's deteriorating very fast and changing to boxes of concrete,  glass and steel.  I wish you a safe trip and enjoy your stay.	NULL

I don’t think it’s just Egyptians, it’s more so just coming from Muslims online in general. And by Muslims, I don’t mean all Muslims, it’s usually people who take it way too seriously saying nasty comments to younger Muslims online.   As a revert I can’t even tell you how much confusion this brings to the religion. And it scares people off, if someone was thinking of becoming Muslim or becoming closer to the religion but sees comments like “you might as well not wear a hijab at all since you wear bring colors and makeup” 🤦‍♀️   Everyone is on their own journey, these keyboard warriors gotta take a break.

> persecuted for being gay and converting to Christianity is plausible.   Since he is Canadian he would've been released years ago not serve the whole 15 years.

In the early 2000s a French company called Onyx was contracted by the government to take care of garbage in Alexandria and that their payment would be the recyclables in the garbage they collect.  They put a garbage bin in front of every house. And a street sweeper truck would sweep the streets every night.  For the first couple of months, it was a huge success. I've never seen Alexandria cleaner.  Later, people started complaining that the smell from the bins was going up to their houses and that they don't want them in front of their houses.  Then the bins were stolen and used for god knows what.  Then scavengers appeared and there were no more recyclables in the garbage for Onyx.  Onyx complained, and the government's response was to pay them by adding garbage collection fees to the monthly electricity bill.   After a while Onyx was ike "Fuck this shit, I'm out of here." And they were gone.  I believe a similar scenario happened in Cairo around the same time but with an Italian company,  I guess.	NULL

I heard about the international companies but didn’t get much detail! Is it that they would leave the bins in the like gated area of their house or would they leave it outside in the street?

I read an article about Jordan having a similar issue to Egypt and they did a survey to see what motivates people to not throw their trash in the street.

People will not throw trash if the streets start fresh and are clean?	NULL

We need to change our mentality. Having spent a lot of time outside of Egypt, I don’t throw trash even when there’s already some one the ground. If there’s no trash bin then I just hold on to it till I find one, it’s not that hard. Maybe the government should install more trash bins, but even then I still see trash surrounding it and when there’s high wind well, you can guess what happens. We just need to change.	NULL

Well, I'd say consistency is the key here. Where I live we pay around 50 pounds fees for garbage collection but the garbage truck pass only once a week,  so the trash always accumulates.

I think you should start step by step  Firstly apply for SAT exam and get a Good score for it and then do the same for Toefl or ILETS.  Although it can be alittle expensive for these 2 eamss, but If you have good scores on them you are mostly ready.   Secondly Picking up any online courses for programing will help you greatly in applying as you would seem like a passionate person.  And the third thing is doing charity work which is important to show that you are a contributing person to society.   Given if you have all of the following, you can apply to any exchange program or college abroad easily fully funded.   All of these things seem alot, but can be done parallel to each other in 8 to 9 months if you are serious.   then apply in the last 4 months or 3 to your college or exchange problem, as most of these open for registration around September and October.  For the essays it is really important, so starting on them is pretty important. So for that you have to look for the college you want to go, or the program you want to attend, then see the required essays for it and starting writing on them from now, then start working on them and editing them all year.  You don't have to limit applying yourself to one college or program, but apply for multiple, so that if you don't get accepted into one you will hopefully إن شاء الله get accepted into another.  I have to say again that the essays are the most important, you have to really really really focus on it, as it is the most important part of the application.	NULL

Suicide Prevention Assistance: 0220816831 [More info](https://egyptianstreets.com/2019/12/16/suicide-prevention-assistance-the-road-to-recovery-in-egypt/)  [Online therapy](https://www.shezlong.com/en/)  [Backup hotline](https://befrienderscairo.com/)  If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, you are not alone. Many people experience similar struggles, and there are resources available to help. During a crisis, you might feel like things will never change. Contacting a mental health crisis hotline is a good way to begin reaching out for much-needed support. But if you are afraid that you or someone you know might hurt   themselves or someone else, please call 122/123 immediately. If you have, or believe you may have, a mental health problem, it is helpful to talk about these issues with others. Should you call the hotline?  It is normal to feel nervous before calling someone you don’t know on a mental help hotline, but the people staff at mental health hotlines have extensive experience talking to people just like you. Everything you say to them is private and confidential—you don’t even have to give them your name if you don’t want to. Please remember, The strongest people are not those who show strength in front of the world, but it’s those who fight the battle you have no idea about. You are not your illness, you have a  name, a history, and a story to tell. Staying yourself is just a part of the battle. Mental illness doesn’t change you. You are still who you were, you are not alone.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The very problem of trash in the streets is that it’s a continuous problem. Even if you manage to clean all the streets in one night, people will still trash the streets and they’ll come back as they were.

I personally believe it’s also our individual responsibility to educate people around us, cuz I swear I know a lot of “educated people” who still throw trash in the streets. So it’s more about awareness than education.  What the government can do though is to fine the arse off of people if they catch them doing it. It worked abroad, and it will work in Egypt too	NULL

I'd suggest hiring a driver for your duration. He will have his car, will drive you around, will (hopefully) not rip you off, and can run errands and tell you where to go if you need something.  The difference between Cairo and any city is usually huge (in terms of modernization) and it will be tough navigating. If cost is not a huge issue that would be my suggestion.  Else you can use Careem or Uber, I'd recommend keeping your UK account for uber while in Egypt. Egypt's uber support is ..... lacking, and having an international ones means if issues happen the ones who fix it for you are your countries branch.	NULL
Here is my suggestion for people (in general) who don't know where to start or what to do. Throw yourself with people who do.

People will come now scream about "whataboutism" and what's not. If those countries believe in those same standards they preach us why don't they adhere to it themselves? It's because they *know* they can't completely apply it. France preaches about human rights yet look at how they treat their muslims and look at how their police treats their citizens during protests i.e. The yellow vests protests. I don't even have to speak about the US and its countless grave human rights violations from Guantanamo Bay to their treatment of blacks to committing war crimes and collapsing entire countries for the protecting their interests.   You know what could be great? These countries facing some accountability for their violation of human rights. Otherwise, it's just hot air they say to satisfy their people on our expense. Even the utopic scandinavian countries harass and disrespect their refugees, muslims and Islamic symbols, if they tell us "well, you're no better with the way you treat atheists", will we then have the right of calling this "whataboutism" and avoid accountability like them? Not by any means.  Another dimension to this whole issue is the capability to withstand civil disobedience and crippled public services that results from crowding, if millions of french people did a demonstration, the country could afford it. On the other hand, if Egyptians exercised their right to protest forcibly the whole country will be paralyzed, especially with how dense Cairo is and especially how poor we are. That's without mentioning the whole Muslim Brotherhood issue. I personally know many protestors who organized demonstrations that got their demands met or at least had been listened to. But we don't respect the law of protest (which is taken from the french law by the way).	NULL
Hurgada is a full city, on the smaller side, but a complete city.   Sharm is a tourist city first and last.   Dahab is where the hipsters go.

You are a digital nomad I assume, what loss is there in trying Sharm and Dahab for a bit and seeing if you like it? If you don't just go back.

Short answer: Education and personality. What was said in the comments are right though, people will not throw trash if the street is clean, they will if it's already dirty.  Long(er) answer: People don't believe the country is "theirs" as they have before, or on a more deep level, they don't see any benefit of treating "public" assets well. People treat public places abroad as something that is shared and should be taken care of for the good of the people. This feeling / thought does not extend in Egypt any longer. People see it was a service being given for free (or cheap) that they will use till it is no longer usable then they will move on to the next. People don't see the public domain as "theirs" any more.  Rich areas basically afford to keep their areas clean, and can pay money to make sure it's kept spotless. Poorer ones can't, and one they fall into disarray, it keeps getting worse. A pile of trash only grows from that point.	NULL

Remember when the US retired from Afghanistan only for it to fall to the Talibans again immediately (lmao) ? I saw people from the Afghanistan subreddit wailing that "the world doesn't care about us". Bruh the US literally sank billions in aid to prevent Taliban from taking over again what are you talking about   Same for French intervention in the Sahel region against Boko Haram. Malians are irate at the French military presence as if we were White devils there to colonize them again.   Unironically I believe Trump was right ; we should keep our resources to ourselves instead of interfering with every country as if we were the world police. Ever since the Korean War the West keeps creating even bigger messes each time they want to "fix" a situation by force, but our leaders have yet to learn a lesson...   I also do believe there is a neocolonialist aspect in the idea that the West™️ has a moral obligation to "rescue" other countries ; we should just cut the cord clean and let y'all sort your shit out between yourselves, however bloody it might get. It worked out for ourselves decades ago.   Just to be clear again even if Arab countries do have recurring issues with Human rights on their own soil, I do agree with Sisi in regards to George W. Bush and French Georges W. Bush.	NULL

I was born in Canada and thank God my father brought us to live in Egypt for our teenage years before moving back. I learned good conservative values and the goodness of our deen. It’s too bad that you moved to the west for those critical years in which you were taught, and believed, that perverted lifestyles are cool and that there’s nothing wrong with them. It’s okay to deviate a little from the straight path and I can accept things like drinking, smoking up and having casual relationships with members of the opposite sex. But accepting full blown rainbow and other perverted lifestyles is where I draw the line. I’m too coolheaded to really speak out about it and so I sometimes appreciate hotheads who do. We need them to defend the faiths and culture of our land. That’s how I see it.	NULL

Atheists and LGBT deserve to be treated humanely but should not be allowed to be activists for their “cause”. Sometimes we need to take a harsh stance when there are people (enemies of the state) that are trying to spread perverted ideologies and poisoned our society.

Yes, he's evading the direct answer but sadly he isn't wrong. But ask yourself again, with all the corruption in this country, do you think Human Rights can survive?

LGBT and atheists don’t have a cause. They just want to be allowed to exist peacefully without being jailed or attacked. Nobody is trying to spread any ideology. If it was that easy to change people’s minds, why am I still gay after only being exposed to straight people most of my life? Because it doesn’t work that way. Atheists don’t care about converting people either.   It’s ridiculous that you think people with different ideas than you are “enemies of the state” (which I can’t really blame you for because that’s how you were raised) but don’t you think it would be more beneficial for us as a country to focus on improving our healthcare, education, quality of life, there are SO MANY THINGS we can focus and work on instead of what people like to do in their bedrooms and if they believe in God or not.   Just an FYI, ancient Egypt has a few records of gay relationships in royalty. Medieval Islamic Egypt was known to be a lot less strict than other Islamic countries, and they tolerated LGBT more than modern Egypt. Lastly, homoerotic narratives were popular across the Muslim world in the 8th century.

Bro this whole sub talking about "if we wuz hooman rites we would b developet and sheeitt" human rights are important, but for me fixing the economy/jobs/ridding of poverty and slums are 100x more important, Tunisia has been a democratic, free country for a decade, India is also free, and they are still flawed as hell, mainly because it is easy for corrupt politicans to take power in developing countries, and Egypt objectively is doing better than the previous 2 I mentioned.  What I am saying that "democracy" doesnt automatically solve our problems, infact it might cause more problems since it is easy to fool people like Egyptians to receive power, and even if we do 'democratic' elections right now then the military/Muslim Brotherhood will 200% win, which both you all hate and despise.

انا كنت جامعة عين شمس بس انا كنت نظام القديم بتاع ٦ سنين و سنة امتياز. دلوقتي النظام اتغير بقي ٥+٢ 'في عين شمس علي الاقل مش متأكد من القصر العيني'. من ناحية الامتحانات عين شمس اصعب من القصر العيني، بس الصعوبة دي جهزتني كويس لمذاكرة الامتحنات بتاعة المعادلة. بس لو هنتكلم بالحق القصر العيني اسم اكبر من عين شمس فليها prestige اكبر شوية صغيرة. بالنسبة لسكن الطلبة بتاع الجامعات الحكومية نصيحة بلاش، اكرملك اجري شقة مع نفسك قريب من الجامعة حتي لو معاكي roommate تعرفيها، سكن الطلبة عاما من صحابي/صحباتي اللي كانوا فيه كلهم طفشوا بعد سنة اولي و اجروا شقق مع نفسهم عشان معفن علي حسب كلامهم.  من الاخر لو بتفكري تكملي تعليم/شغل برا فمش هتفرق شهادة دي او دي مش معترف بيها و لازم تعملي معادلة حتي عشان تسافري الخليج	other

I was your age once. I was a badass kid who felt trapped in Egypt. Hated the fact that I couldn’t drink, smoke up, grow my hair long, etc and when I came back to Canada I was ecstatic. Finally I can do whatever I want. A year later, when the honeymoon was over I started to look around and realize that this was not what I wanted. We did bad things cuz we were kids with lots of energy and wanted to express ourselves. We realized what we were doing was wrong. That was the real appeal to be honest. It was fun to do because it was rebellious. But when you’re in Canada and all those things are the norm you realize that people are lost, living perverted lifestyles in a perverted society that is rotting and decaying with no structure or morals or ethics.

lol great analysis. It is called Tube Thinking. They narrow people in one direction repeating over and over same recipe  ( nationalism is bad, whataboutism , Human rights, no hope , Rabaa, Tiran.. ) keep killing hope in every one.

Like those who elected Morsi then stayed the night in tents calling him to resign before Muslim Brotherhood boys storm them killing, beating, robbing, assaulting them in Etehadeya to keep Morsi in chair. They were THE peaceful protesters. No body called for their blood  though because they are not part of the recipe.	NULL

النقطة الاولانية مش متفق معاك بصراحة - لأسباب تاريخية موضوعية يطول شرحها بس هحاول اختصر حاجات و اتجاوز غيرها :   اظن اننا مينفعش ننسى اننا ابناء و احفاد مباشرين ل ناس فعلا همومها مكانتش لا ديمقراطيه و لا تمثيل سياسي و لا تداول سلطات و لا احزاب و لا غيره . احنا اباءنا و اجدادنا المباشرين نفسهم ( الاب و الجد المباشر ، يعني الأب و اللي ربوه و الأم و اللى ربوها ) دول ناس عاشوا احتلال أشكال و الوان مرة من ده و مرة من ده و مرة هزيمة ع مرة انتصار ع مرة وعكة سياسية ع محاولة نهضة نجحت ف اولها بعدين اتعطلت على اضطراب مجتمعي و صراع احزاب و جماعات على السلطة و قايمة طويلة . مين ماسك الحكم و احزابنا ايه و توجهاتها ايه دي كانت آخر هموم اللي ربونا - ده لو كانت من همومهم . ف مش مفاجأة انهم ياخدوا المواقف دي ، انت كده بتحكم ع ابناء منظومة من عصر فات لكن بمعايير العصر الحالي ، و دى حسبة مش هتمشي .     >بس انا شخصيا بحس التعريص في مصر فريد من نوعه. الدفاع المستميت عن الحاكم من غير ما يكون في اي مصلحة راجعة للشخص، بتبقى مثيرة للاهتمام  دى برضك مظنش اتفق معك ، فيه بلاد لسه بيبوسوا ايادي الملك و بيقسموا الولاء للحاكم قبل ما يقسموا الولاء للعلم و الوطن ، و مش هقول لك ميقدروش يشتموا الحاكم ف جرنال انما حرفيا ميقدروش ينتقدوا و لو حتى قرار له . احنا بالنسبة لبلاد تانيه ( و مش قليله اوى كمان ) واحة لحرية التعبير و الحريات الفردية ، و اكيد مش هنختلف ان هامش الحرية عندنا ف تناول الشخصيات ذوي المناصب مش اعلى حاجة ف الدنيا يعني مش هتطلع تشتم وزير و لا رئيس ب اهله اه و مش هتعمل عليه كرتون ساخر ، لكن انتقاد القرارات و الاجراءات موجود عادي ف الشارع قبل النت حتى ، الخ .   عن نفسي شخصيا شايف ان ال1% اللى فعلا لهم مصلحة ف التعريص ( عشان لو معرصش هينضر جامد ) و ال1% التانيين اللى لهم مصلحة ف الشتيمة عالفاضي - اللي هو الوجه الآخر للتعريص طبعا و مش هياكلوا عيش من غير الشتيمة عالفاضي - مينفعش يلغوشوا علينا تفكيرنا ف انه فيه 98% من الناس فعلا ملهاش مصلحة عائدة عليهم ف اي رأي يقولوه . و إلا بكده نشتم اي حد معجب بالسيسي مثلا عشان اصل الاعلامي الفولاني كمان معجب بيه ، او نسب لأهالي اي حد مش معجب بيه لأنه اصل مناضل الفيسبوك فولان الفولاني اللى بيقبض من دولة اجنبيه مش معجب بالسيسي ف اكيد هؤلاء و اولئك و كل الناس لهم مصلحة ف انهم يقولوا الرأي س أو الرأي ص .    اللى اقصده : ابسط زيارة للقهاوي البلدي و الشارع العادي و مقابلة الناس العادية تماما اللي بتصحى م النوم تشتغل بعدين يروحوا البيت يناموا عشان يصحوا فايقين للشغل تاني و اراؤهم ملهاش اي توظيف محتمل دي ناس اغلبية كاسحة اكتر مما نتخيل . كل ما فيها ان ال2% المذكورين اعلاه صوتهم عالى و ظهورهم باين عن الناس ال98% العاديين .   أما بخصوص ال30 سنة حكم ، ف هتلاقي برضك ان اباءنا و امهاتنا و اللي ربوهم هم ناس عاشوا فترة كان حاكم مصر فيها بيورث السلطة و نظام الحكم اصلا بيشرعن انه يفضل على العرش لغايه ما يموت . ف دى جزئية مش بقدر اتجاوزها فعلا ، احنا بنتكلم ف امور مكانتش مطروحة اساسا على طاولة اي نقاشات للجيل اللي ربانا ( و ده كان مقبول ايامهم و كل الاعراف و منظومتهم القيمية متماشية مع ده و منسجمة معاه و بتفانكشن ف اطار حياتهم و افكارهم عادي ، مفيش اي عيب ف كده ) .   ف اه ، 30 سنة ف الحكم مش هتمثل لهم اي حاجة مدهشة .   &#x200B;  بخصوص نقطة النضافة اتفق معك ، اعلاء الذات ف ظل تجاهل المصلحة العامة آفة صعبة . بشوف مثال حي على ده ، يعنى مثلا فيه ناس مستاءة م العاصمة الجديدة فقط و **فقط** عشان مشتروش عقار ولا ارض هناك ف هو مش حاسس انه طلع ب فايدة ، و بالمنطق ده احنا بنبرر ان اللى ساكن ف ارقى مناطق العاصمة كذلك يحقد على اللى اخدوا الاقساط الميسرة ف مشاريع الاسكان الاجتماعي : ماهو ايش معنى هو اللى يسكن ببلاش بلابلابلاه و انا بدفع 6000 جنيه قسط او ايجار شقة ؟ سؤال منطقي جدا لو اعتمدنا الطريقة القاصرة دى م التفكير ، و ندخل بقى دايرة مفرغة من ال انا-مركز-المجموعة-الشمسية-كل-الكون-يدور-حواليا .	other

It's democracy, whether you agree or not with the outcome that the majority agrees with is totally irrelevant, misusing random terms doesn't change that fact.

Usually, there is no legal issue regarding any of this. The stray Dogs too are very adaptable and know well where to find food.  As for the problem that may actually rise is that those men may report you falsely as harassing people by raising Dogs in this particular area. There may have been problems before regarding rabid dog attacks in that area so in this case, the police may send City Hall to take the dogs away.  The latter scenario may actually come true if one of those men has what we call "wasta" to pull some favors with some officer.  But that's just my grim opinion. In most of the time, you can just be a good person and keep doing what you're doing.	NULL

Absolutely my pleasure. Maybe it will be worth it to ask in the Greek Community and maybe you can try to call the [local education administration](https://alex-edu.com/wast.html) (based on the school location I think they follow this administration) (+20 03-3925624) to confirm what will be needed to join high school and if there are any tests needed (this is a longshot tho because they only speak Arabic and they are genuinely stupid (from personal experience) but maybe they can help, just be patient and try to explain as slow as you can).  To confirm if you can go to college in Greece with Thanaweya Amma, I think it would be best to ask the university you're interested in directly and maybe the Egyptian consulate because they might have some students who try the same thing.  Good luck!	NULL

Hey, that's so exciting that you are thinking about traveling to Egypt!  Egypt is a place that is very hospitable to solo travelers, because local people are so kind and friendly, and other travelers usually are keen to meet others during their trip. I think you would enjoy your trip most if you stick to larger cities (Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria, Aswan) or go to smaller cities where there is a large backpacking community (Dahab) and you can meet people by staying in hostels/group hotels.  It does not matter if you do not read or write Arabic at all, and yes, you will definitely meet people in Egypt willing to show you around!  I have a YouTube channel with lots of free resources like how to take public transit in Egypt and where to go. You can check it out at [www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel) if you are interested!  Best of luck!	NULL

Hey there, you could continue with your trip as usual, as there have not been any announced restrictions or disruptions.

Have a wonderful trip!	NULL
Hey there! I entered Egypt in November, 2021, using just my proof of vaccination with a QR code. You can check out the video of the process here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u56fK2wtHLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u56fK2wtHLY)  I have clients as recently as January 2022 (beginning of this month) enter without a PCR. I still recommend having a PCR \*just in case\*, but if you do not mind taking a small risk, you should be fine to enter without one.	NULL
No QR code is needed to enter any restaurants or hotels in Egypt--great question!  When is your trip?	NULL

On a basic level, here is what I recommend. If you have any specific interests, let us know, and then we can make more cogent recommendations for you.  \-Take public transportation (metro, microbuses, public buses)  \-Go to a local ahwa in a local area, away from tourists  \-Go to a lesser-visited city, like Port Said, Damietta, Sohag, or Tanta (or others)  \-Stay at a local apartment instead of renting an Airbnb or doing a hotel  [I have a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel) that has lots of videos on taking public transportation, if you are interested. It saves a ton of money, but I do it mostly for the cultural experience.	NULL

Hey, so excited you are going to Egypt! Here are my responses, in italics. Also, I have a YouTube channel with tons of videos on travel to Egypt that you can check out: [www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel).   Is Uber reliable in the middle of the night? I will be arriving at Borg El Arab Airport in Alex around 3-4 am. Will I be able to find an Uber ride at this hour of the night? Is it safe?  *Yes it is safe, and yes, you will be able to find one.*   Would it be possible for me to purchase a sim card at the airport? Preferably with a good internet and calling plan. Can you guys suggest what the best plan is out there and by which provider?  *I always use Vodafone, but there is also Etisalat and Orange. I usually get a 30gb data package with some minutes for talking and texting, and it is usually about $20. I always get it at Cairo Airport; not sure about HBE, but they probably have it.*   Is tipping customary in Egypt? If yes, usually how much?  *Yes it is, and it totally depends on the scenario.* [I have a blog post that goes over how much to tip and when to tip (or not)](https://egyptadventurestravel.com/blog/tipping-culture-in-egypt)   Is Uber very safe in Egypt for solo travelers? Anything to look out for?  *Yes, Uber is safe. I would watch out for drivers who just drive around and around, never actually arriving to pick you up. If you wait long for a driver, just cancel the ride, pay the fee, and then dispute the fee to get the money back.*   Is google maps a good app to use for navigation? If not, what navigation apps would you recommend?  *Google maps is good, but it will not have the 100% most accurate data on how to get from place to place, especially in Alexandria. There isn't another good option, though, aside from asking locals for directions, which can sometimes be inaccurate!*   Is it better to exchange currency at the Alex Airport or are there better places to do so? Also, is Egypt a cash-based society? How much would be sufficient for a week and a half? Any examples in terms of cost of meals, etc. would do.  *Totally a cash-based society, and you can exchange a little at the airport and then just pull the rest out at ATMs. How much you should bring depends on your budget and travel style. What type of trip are we talking? Staying in hostels? Eating street food?*   Anyone know of a good place to get a COVID test in Cairo? I will have to receive the results within 1-day of departure back to the US. Preferably a facility with quick turnaround for these tests. They can be antigen or PCR tests. My friend mentioned an antigen test at some University in Cairo but we are not sure if it's only reserved for students.  *I have a great service I use--they come to your hotel or Airbnb, do the test, and hand-deliver the results within 6 hours.* [I talk about it in this YouTube video, and the Whatsapp contact info is there too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhXQBZ891tE)   Any experiences or tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!  *My tip is to enjoy Egypt with an open mind and heart! It is a magical place, but it is very different from anywhere else. Be prepared to have your expectations turned upside down, and get ready for some very friendly local Egyptian people.*	NULL

At our peak we had like 10 million tourists visit a year so I am sure you will find tons and tons of useful guides and videos form people who lived the experince that will prep you up to have a good time , I think the most annoying thing you will face is prices switching to dollars once they figure out you are a tourist because they will think that means you're filithy rich thats if you are visiting tourists sites at cairo luxor or aswan .  use uber because local taxis will haggle over price  If you are hitting the beach at the red sea you probably wont face any scammers since you will be mostly in a hotel .

Bro, having harder courses or just the same courses as abroad doesn't mean that the educational system is good. I can give you the very small example of the private tutoring and centers, wtf is going on with this country. Schools became nothing but places to take exams in, other than that, they are just empty buildings that no one goes to students or teacher because they get tutored or give tutors. The whole system is fucked in every way you could imagine. And the fault is on parents, teachers, and the government. No one is not guilty from this crime that the newer generation is paying the price for, and the country will continue paying its price until a person like مماليك kidnap children and send them about to study( I am not historically sure who did this), to come back and remake the whole educational system from inside out.

It was Muhammed Ali. I don't want to get down that rabbit hole but yes I do think having bigger syllables makes our education better (at least when compared to others in the global work market), in my humble unspecialized point of view most of our education problems are financial, the government can't hire enough teacher or build new schools to compensate for the population increase. Last year students increased by 3.8% while the number of teachers decreased by 1.8%, so having private tutors and teachers working more than 10 hours per day in private was inevitable. Besides this I think education is actually improving, students are asked to think about how to answer problems, they are encouraged to create their own algorithms and their exams are open-book so the whole memorizing = success thing is now almost gone. The same is happening in colleges (we still have to memorize shit tho), as now professors are asking us to figure out ways to implement knowledge with real businesses and create our own and they can even support you with money and connections (yes, national free college). So no, I don't think our education system is bad but just critically underfunded.	NULL

اولا اللي بيعارض من باب المعارضة ده لا يعتد برأيه بس اللي بيعترض هنا بيبقى من الواقع القذر اللي هم عايشين فيه.  يعني مش واحد مرتبه مش بياكله عيش حاف وانت تقول لا انت بلدك زي الفل طيب فين وفين تأثير ده عليا كمواطن غلبان؟ يعني من الاخر انا وأكد عايش في ضرائب كتير ورسوم كتير وفقر وجوع وبطالة وقلة صحة وتعليم ودعم بيترفع (ودي مش من علامات ضعف الاقتصاد خالص طبعا) وفلوسي بتروح في حاجات مالهاش اي تلاتين لازمة أو حتى مش أولوية على الاطلاق وتقول لي الارقام... طيب نشوف الارقام.  ثانيا بقى انك ت cherry pick الارقام اللي على مزاجك وتسيب البطالة اللي زادت والفقر اللي زاد والتعليم والصحة اللي لو شوفت اللي بيتصرف عليهم هتلاقيه أقل من النسبة المقرر عليها في الدستور والباقي بيتسرق والفساد وأكله زي ما واكل بلدنا كلها كده.  ازاي طيب الارقام بتقول حاجة وعيشة الناس بتقول حاجة تانية؟  طيب يا سيدي ليه مش بتقول ان الديون بفوائدها وصلت ٢٠٣ مليار دولار؟ والبلد بتدفع ٨٠٪ من إيراداتها على شكل فوائد واقساط الديون دي.  طيب مدخرات المصريين اللي قلت جدا؟  والفقر اللي نسيته عدت ٣٠٪ يعني اكتر من ٣٠ مليون مواطن مش عارفين يغطوا احتياجاتهم الأساسية من اكل وشرب ولبس ومواصلات ولا قدر الله بقى لو حد مرض.  البطالة زادت ٥٪ عن السنة اللي فاتت  التضخم زاد ٣٤٪ عن ٢٠٢٠  وغير الديون اللي بتزيد والضرائب والرسوم اللي بتزيد برضو لدرجة ان حوالي ٩٩٠ مليار جايين من الضرائب (اللي اغلبها من الناس العادية اللي زينا عشان رجال الأعمال أغلبهم متهرب من الضرائب)    وشيلنا الدعم وقللنا الانفاق على الصحة والتعليم والحماية الاجتماعية حتى وقت كورونا ما كانت بتاكل في الناس.   يعني الزيادة دي مش جاية من الإنتاج والتصدير وغيره (حجم الصادرات هو ٢٨ مليار مش زي ما رئيس الوزراء قال ٣٤ مليار ونص)  وأمثلة كتير عن تلاعب الحكومة في الارقام والمستندات وبيانات ناقصة وارقام مغلوطة وكدب كتير.  يعني موازنة جاية من الضرائب ورايحة في سداد القروض والشعب في النص من حفرة لدحديرة ويا قلبي لا تحزن.  يعني مش الارقام دي هي اللي هاتنسي الشعب الفقر والجوع واللي هو انت بتشتكي ليه الارقام بتقول... وانت اصلا مخبي ارقام تانية وحتى لو الوضع في مصر كويس مش تنسى إن تقريبا مافيش عندنا عدالة اجتماعية.

You can call out women for their bad behavior all you want, however you aren't helping yourself by tearing down an imaginary figure that has all the bad habits you project onto it.   I don't consider simping to be a valid term for things you consider to be bad, it's a very harmful word to use since it promotes a toxic environment between men and women. Things you would consider to be bad, others would consider them as being polite or civil, the word simp is too broad to tackle such problems. Just focus on the bad behaviors themselves and don't throw these words around.	NULL

Not needlessly. We slaughter animals for consumption and almost all of the animal goes to use.  Secondly, have you ever seen national geographic? Have you seen how hyenas hunt?. We are omnivorous creatures and saying that we should live solely off vegetables is quite stupid.  Oh and the Quran iand prophet Mohammed عليه الصلاة و السلام was one of the first people to defend animal rights, and if only you did a little search on sex slavery you'd be more educated about how Islam treated this subject and how the west did especially that Islam had laws to deal with this issue as it was prevelent at the time same with slavery and how Islam ended racism and slavery while the west only recently managed to get rid of that problem.

Maybe something related to the mini coup of central police forces that seized the camps and killes their officers. Upon knowing that the army went in and used heavy machine gun fire tonpacify all those inaurgents.   It happened because of the minister of interior at that time "Zaky Badr" who was so good that major crime mafias were helpless in smuggling drugs, weapons and other contraband. So by the help of multiple officials they spread some rumors that the central police forces conscripts would have to serve an extra 2 years as an obligation to finish their conscription period. So these conscripts went ahead and staged the mini coup I am talking about.   I don't have much more information. I googled it and apparently that happened in 1986 not the 70s. So if that's not what you mean then the only thing left that I know of is "The Bread Revolution" "ثورة الجياع" which happened 1977.   احداث الامن المركزى ١٩٨٦ - انتفاصة الخبز ١٩٧٧	NULL

Because someone promotes rape doesn’t mean they’re all promoting that.  I believe Incel usually means a man who dislikes women and their behaviour and doesnt get in relationships with them either by choice or not by choice due to women not being interested.  And no I wasn’t defending them.   But I believe being a simp feminist is just really bad.  At least incels have some self respect and have rejected women who don’t treat them kindly.  While I believe simps feminists are doormats who have caused a major social disorder when it comes to the dating world.	NULL

It's very limited and might not be as advanced as other countries. I would recommend going for computer engineering as it will enable you to get the best of both worlds. You will be able to work as a pure software engineer, or you can later shift for robotics if you wish. You will have some background about electronics and electrical systems, which you can extend upon if you want to work in that area in robotics. I believe most of the development currently taking place in the robotics field are directed towards computer vision and human-machine interaction, which are pure computer engineering. You will just miss the part about mechanical design.	NULL

>التضخم زاد ٣٤٪ عن ٢٠٢٠       يسطا ابوس....ايدك, قلي انت بتجيب معلوماتك دي من فين بس.  دي في تركيا دي مش في مصر. مصر اعلى نسبة تضخم في 2020 كان 5.7 باين. وفي 2021 كان 6.7 لما كانت عالية ونزلت ل 5.6 في نفس السنه وده اصلا في عز ازمات التضخم وازمة الحاويات واسعار النفط في العالم كله الخ ومع ذلك اصلا البلد كانت مستعدة والحكومة خدت احتياطاتها عشان الناس كده كده هتلوم الحكومة على اي حاجه. شوف سبحان الله حتى لو خدوا احتياطاتهم برضو هيلاموا.  &#x200B;  middleeasteye محجوبة في مصر ف مش هفتحها.  المقال بتاع الباحث ده مقال متدني. كنت رايح ارد عليه ف مره بس هكتفي واقولك انه مذكرش ان مصر في ازمة كورونا انقذت قطاع السياحة وانقذت عمالة بانها دفعت مرتباتهم واعطت قروض للقطاع السياحي عشان مينهارش خلال الازمة. ومرة تاني. هو بيتكلم عن قطع الدعم و"رفع تكلفة الخدمات" -مش بتترفع. هي كانت مخفضة والدولة كانت شايلة التكلفة ودلوقتي الدولة بتشيل التخفيض ده- وبيقول ان الدولة بتبني ال "واو بروجكتس" وسايبه المواطن الغلبان ياعيني. وكأن مثلا سياسات الدعم او تموين وتمويل الارانب اللي عندنا في البلد دي, سياسات مستدامة.  زي ما قلت. نمو الصين كان قريب من نمو مصر. السبب ان المصريين لسه في فقر مدقع هو انهم بيخلفوا بغباء ويقولك كل طفل بيجي برزقه.  &#x200B;  وبالمناسبة حتى القطاع الاقتصادي غير الرسمي استفاد من الحكومة خلال كورونا. الحكومة كانت بتدفع فلوس للناس اللي عندها عدم استقرار وظيفي وغيره وجهزت حزم دعم. الناس قدمت عليها ولالا معرفش. بس هي حقيقي واللي كان بيقدم كان بيسلتم.

مصر فقيرة ومن زمان فقيرة ومن يوم حروب عبد الناصر وتدمير الاقتصاد ثم تقديم سياسة التموين والدعم للشعب عشان يرضيهم ويقعد في الكرسي -سياسة السادات فشل في سحبها ومبارك زود فيها كمان- والاقتصاد المصري خربان. https://www.mei.edu/blog/egypts-sizeable-informal-economy-complicates-its-pandemic-response   https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/egypts-informal-economy-ongoing-cause-unrest	NULL

Listen buddy, i didn't do my IGCSE in Egypt but i know how it stressful it can be. I didn't do well in my first run and had to retake 2 subjects a year later. It has been 6 years since i finished these tests and let me tell you all of this is just a small part of your life.  I'm not trying to give you negative vibes but rather as the kind people above have mentioned, rabna yeyaserlek inshallah and you do amazing in them but even if u didn't, mosh moshkelah it's not the end of the world.

Most Egyptians on this sub (or online in general) are either High-Middle class and above or don't even live in the Middle east let alone Egypt, don't base any of your information about what the average Egyptian thinks from people on this sub.  Walk in a street in Egypt and say Egyptians are not Arabic, or that Palestinians are foreigners (like what some racist nationalist "Pharonists" on this sub say), you'd be laughed at and ridiculed into oblivion.

The police probably wont do anything to you, but feeding stray dogs and helping them bring even more dogs to also live as stray dogs in the streets is not a good thing to do, you are actually helping hurt the dogs on the long run when their numbers are too many and they either starve or fight each other over the food.  A better solution would be taking them to a shelter.	NULL

One time a guy called me and insisted that i'm manal (or was it mona?) the guy was always drunk and used to call me over 40 times a day, at first i thought it was a prank played by my friends but the sheer persistence he had told me he wasn't simply a troll.  I've had a pretty deep voice back then and there's no way anyone would confuse me for a woman, as a matter of fact, when i tried to pretend to be a woman for the lolz he'd insult me and ask me to get manal back on the phone, after a week of him being annoying and me costing him hours (i used to answer and leave the phone, he'd never end the call) i had the bright idea of telling him i changed my number, then i gave him the number of a guy i didn't like.  He repeated pretty much the same exact scenario with the guy, always calling, leaving him 40+ missed calls a day, eventually he passed him on to another dude, we have no idea who the hell he was, "true caller" didn't exist back then, he's probably someone who was obsessed with a manal and he just hung onto whomever he thought was "manal", never got closure on that.  Or he was a bored troll with a LOT of money.	NULL

Not sure what happens but what i do know is that you will not be allowed to board the plane with a positive test period. They check the pcr test in the baggage counter and again right before boarding the plane. Also i dont think anyone has tried to fly with a positive test in hand cause that will get you in trouble since you would have been supposed to be isolating and not going to the airport. I think that if you are found to have covid at the airport itself they will isolate you in the airport hotel "le meridien" not sure if you will pay for it or nah.	NULL

Or rather, too big to be allowed to fail?"  الدول العظمي مش هتسمح لمصر انها تنهار اصلا. تبعات حاجه زي دي هتبقى كارثية لدرجة ان احتلالنا ممكن تكون تبعياته للغرب والاتحاد الاوروبي اهون من سقوطنا.  >حاضر احنا نقفل مصانع ونبطل نصرف على صحة أو تعليم ونغلي الاسعار ونرفع الضرائب والرسوم عشان البنية التحتية اللي انا مش شايفها دي يعني اسكندرية لسة غرقانة من شهر والاسمرات برضو ولا ده مش تبع البنية التحتية؟       المصانع بتتبني عادي جدا والصادرات المصرية بتزيد كل سنة. وبتتنوع كمان.   ده غير طبعا الدعم الحكومي للصناعات [https://enterprise.press/stories/2019/12/05/egypt-launches-egp-100-bn-program-to-boost-local-industry-7831/](https://enterprise.press/stories/2019/12/05/egypt-launches-egp-100-bn-program-to-boost-local-industry-7831/)  \+ الدعم اللي الحكومة قدمته في فترة الكورونا وده تقدر تقرأ عنه في المقالات اللي انا بعتها قبل كده عن تجربة التعافي الاقتصادي المصرية.  البنية التحتية اه لازم نستثمر فيها وقلتلك ان الاستثمار في الصحة والتعليم بيزيد. السكان ببساطة كتير فشخ ومحتاجين اكتر من كده بكتير. وانت متقدرش تزود الاستثمارات بالحجم المطلوب ده. اقولك ايه تاني؟ انا لو عليا فانا عاوز الحكومة تخصخص كل الدنيا دي كلها وتشيل الضرايب اللي بتتاخد عشان القطاعات دي وتبقى الحكومة بتبنى الطرق وتدافع عن البلد وبس كده. عشان الناس تريحها شويتين وتبطل ام جو نظريات المؤامرة ده وتتحمل عواقب افعالها. واللي معاه فلوس ياخد خدمة يدفع. اللي ممعهوش ميدفعش ومياخدش. ومش بيدفع للحكومة ضرايب على القطاعات دي عشان يسألها على حاجة.  &#x200B;  >حضرتك مش مستفيد منه انت حر بس في ناس حرفيا عايشة على شوية العيش والتموين وياريتهم كفاية اصلا.   انا مالي بيهم اصلا؟ انا واحد مرتبي مش هيعدي ال3000 جنيه وهدفع مواصلات وتأمين وخرا وهجيب اكلي وشربي ومش عاوز ادفع ضرايب تروح للناس دي في تموين ولا في حاجة. انا مليش دعوة بيهم. انا مرتبي يادوب اد كده. والناس كلها على الحال ده يعتبر والدولة نفسها اصلا كده. وحتى ايام ما كان في تموين ودعم كاملين كان برضو في فقر.  رفع الدعم او التموين مش هم سبب الفقر. في فقرا كتير في مصر عشان ركود اقتصادي وعشان البلد فقيره. تروح انت منطور فلوس البلد على عيش وزيت مجاني؟ طب ما تعمل بنية تحتية وتبني طرق ومدارس وغيرها وتوظف الناس دي وتدفعلهم مرتبات وهم بيبنوها؟ -زي ما بيحصل دلوقتي بالفعل رغم ان لسه التموين والدعم ما اترفعوش-  &#x200B;  >    الصين رجعت شجعت السكان انهم يخلفوا تاني وبعدين ما عندك اليابان مثال. دولة منهارة طالعة من حرب وقنبلتين نوويتين وتعدادها تضاعف ودولة متطورة وده كله في كام سنة بس. دولة عايشة على ٣٪ من مساحتها وعندها كنوز في الأرض عكس اليابان.        شوف لو دول كلهم اتعلموا واشتغلوا ايه اللي هايحصل.  اليابان من اول الستينات كان معدل نمو سكانها اقل من 1.3% لحد السبعينات كان في سنه او سنتين وصل 2% وبعد كده قعد ينزل لحد ما بقى تحت ال 1% سنة 1977 وفضل في النازل كل سنه على اخر التمانينات كان 0.4 واخر التسعينات كان 0.183 وعلى 2009 كان النمو بالسالب. نمو السكان.  الصين رجعت تشجع الناس على الولاده بعد ما كانت خلاص رفعت مستوى معيشتهم. مش اثناء ما كانوا لسه فقراء.  يا سيدي الفاضل انا متفهم موقفك المتفائل من حوار ان عندك سكان كتير وقوة عاملة وبتاع إلخ. بس ده مش حقيقي. ده كله وهم. لازم الناس دي تكون متعلمة وعندها مبادئ وعندها وطنية. مش ناس اصلا متربية على ان البلد سارقاها ومتربية على خدمة اقاربها ولا ناس قريتها وان المواطن التاني ميعرفوهوش. الفساد في البلد دي في كل حارة وشارع وبيت. اي حد عنده منصب يقدر يجامل من خلاله معارفه, بيجاملهم على حساب المواطن التاني الغرب. والاغلبية العظمى من السكان شايفين البلد سارقاهم وده مش حاجه غلط بنسبة 100% لان في فساد ومحسوبية طبعا وناس بتنهب فلوس البلد. لكن ده مش السبب الرئيسي فضياع البلد والسبب ده اصلا الشعب كله مشارك فيه لإن الشعب كله من غير وعي بيمارس نوع من انواع الفساد.  &#x200B;  بالنسبة للهند اللي هي شبهنا جدا جدا جدا, الهند ما طبقتش سياسة فرض اجهاض مثلا زي الصين. ومعدل سكانها فضل زي ما هو طبيعي. وادي الهند النهارده افقر من مصر اصلا. اما الصين لما اجبرت الناس تخلف طفل واحد بس -وده كان غلط على المدى البعيد. المفروض كانوا يبقوا طفلين مع خيار طفل اضافي-, بقى الاباء عندهم وقت فاضي يشتغلوا فيه اكتر او يدرسوا فيه اكتر وبالتالي انتاجية الفرد زادت وعدد الموظفين زادوا.  اما انت هنا في مصر اقل من 40% من الشعب اصلا بيعمل. الباقي عيال او ربات بيوت او عواطلية. انت متخيل ان 40% من الشعب بس بيصرف على بقية الشعب؟ والعجائز نسبتهم قليله وتكاد لا تذكر في مصر. ونسبة البطالة اقل من 10% يعني اقل من نص الشعب بيصرف على الشعب كله.  المانيا عندها بتاع 78% والولايات المتحدة بتاع 60%.  &#x200B;  >    حبيبي؟ طيب        انا قلت لك اللي قاله الوزير للناس والارقام الحقيقية اللي في الموازنة (وايه اللي مش بتتلاعب؟ اجيب لك ارقام كورونا من جوة؟ لما كانوا بيكتبوا وفيات كورونا حاجات تانية)        وأنه إنفاق اللي زاد ما تصلي على النبي الفصول مش فيه تخت والمستشفيات مش فيها سراير ومافيش تعيين يبقى الانفاق رايح فين بقى؟        وجايب فاروق الباز واليوم السابع طيب ما تجيب البرادعي اللي واخد نوبل؟        انا مش كاره بس لنا تجيب كلام متناقض مع الواقع يبقى المشكلة مش عندي  حوار التعيين ده بالاتفاق مع البنك الدولي. ان يتم وقف سياسة التعيين لبعض الوقت. ودي سياسة شابوه جدا الصراحه. موظفين الدولة دول كلهم خرا.  ده مش معناه ان مفيش انفاق زيادة. في مئات المدارس والمستشفيات الجديدة اللي اتبنت وتقدر تشوف كام من دول اتبنوا في محافظتك. انا عندي في حجات كتير جديدة اتبنت وفي مركز بحث علمي كمان بيتبني وانا شايفه بنفسي كل ما اروح الجامعة.  ولما طلع صورة لمدرسة كان فيها تكدس او كده الحكومة تدخلت وشافت حل. ومرة تاني بقولك ان موظفين الحكومة دول اصلا ناس مش كفاءة وزيادة عن اللازم. الحكومة المفروض تسرحهم اصلا وتخصخص الحاجات دي والقطاع الخاص يوظف الناس بناء على الكفاءة واللي يكسل ولا يهمل يتطرد ويجي مكانه واحد يستحق المكان.	other

AFAIK, it's a mix of both. There's a bit of Monopoly when it comes to car importing and distribution.  I don't see why the government should intervene at all with that whole scheme, people are STILL buying cars at ridiculous prices, the government gets taxes/fees on every car sold, and the distributors/importers make money which then the government taxes.   The only losers here imo are the people, but we also lack the willpower to boycott the car market, so nothing will be changed for now.	NULL

Ita alright, I will be researching myself anyhow,just wanted to see if anyone had a concise and short answer to my questions.  Anyways, I participated in my school's awa el al talaba last year and plan on doing that this year too,you can get national recognition there if you go hard enough.  You could also see if any cultural centers around you host activities for you(I know the french culture center in my city hosts language activities) Also,volunteer work is on the table if you want something for your college cv. So basically: 1-Languge courses by universities near you 2-awa el el talaba 3-activities in your local cultural center 4-volunteer work  Also make sure to generally read high caliber books and mature your personality and social abilities as to generally be able to leave good impressions,I unironically practice my conversation abilities on taxi drivers when I sit with them.

As far as I know most 5-4 star hotels do provide local guides so that's your first issue solved.  Trying to find your self a local guide might just result in you being scammed. To be fair that would happen in any country.   Imagine going down the street talking to strangers and asking them to be your local guide might end up good or might end up bad. Its a 50/50 worldwide.  I suggest you can take a cruise over the nile. From Cairo to Luxor. Luxor is the best place if you are looking for visiting ancient artifacts.   Also you should visit the Egyptian museum in Tahrir you will love it.  Then I am sure you will love to visit Sharm El Sheikh or Hurghada the hotels and oceans there are very cool.  Conclusion: 5 - 4 star Hotels are your best supply of local guides and the stay there would be enjoyable than trying to walk around the country finding local businesses and they are much cheaper than most countries.

 فيييييييييييين اللي بيقول ان 80% من ايراداتنا رايحة للديون؟!  وبالمناسبة ال80% اللي جايه من الضرايب جزء كبير جايه من نشاطات البيزنس والصناعة والشركات والفلوس اللي داخله البلد وخارجه والضرايب عالاستثمارات الخ. مش كلها "فلوسي" اللي بدفعها في الضرايب. نص الشعب اصلا او اكتر من النص شغال في قطاع غير رسمي ومش بيدفعوا ضرايب خالص والحكومة بالمناسبة لسه برضو بتتيح لهم التقديم على مستحقات وظائف غير مستقرة وبتتيح لهم تموين ودعم إلخ. والناس دي برضو يقدروا يقدموا على ديون بفوائد اقل زي اي اسرة مصرية تاني وده اللي الصفحة بتاعتك بتاعت مبادرة الحقوق الشخصية بتقوله   [https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/egypts-informal-economy-ongoing-cause-unrest](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/egypts-informal-economy-ongoing-cause-unrest)  &#x200B;

 >    وآخرهم مصنع الحديد والصلب في حلوان ومصانع الأسمدة والغزل والنسيج طيب واللي بتتبني دي مملوكة لمين بالظبط؟        ثم انت كده عايزها غابة مش دولة.        كل الدول بتاخد ضرائب بس عشان يرجع لهم تاني.        يعني انا لما ادفع ضرائب بس في المقابل عارف فلوسي رايحة فين وان انا مستفيد من الفلوس اللي دفعتها دي يبقى اهلا وسهلا.  مملوكة للجيش لان القطاع الخاص مش بيجندل حاجه. وشركات الجيش هيتم طرحها في السوق للقطاع الخاص عادي جدا بعد ما الدنيا تسلك.  الجيش فعلا بيخلص الدنيا بدري ومش بيقعد يتلكك ومفيش بيروقراطية او فساد حكومي بيعطله. لأن هو نفسه اصلا نوعا ما فوق القانون. مصر من اسوأ الدول في انك تبدأ فيها بيزنس. ف صعب القطاع الخاص من نفسه يعمل مشاريع بالضخامة اللي الجيش بيعملها.  لكن هل القطاع الخاص بيعمل مشاريع؟ اه بيعملوا مشاريع برضو. بس المشاريع الضخمة اغلبها الجيش اللي بيعملها. والجيش مش بيسرق المشاريع دي. الدولة بتقدمهاله. لو في شركة خاصة عاوزة تعملها وتقدر, الدولة هتكلفها عادي. ما هو السيسي كان بيطرح مشاريع في مزايدة من كام اسبوع. حوار الحج سعيد ده. ناسي؟      [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-17/egypt-could-see-military-owned-firms-list-on-bourse-in-2022?utm\_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm\_source=twitter&utm\_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm\_content=business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-17/egypt-could-see-military-owned-firms-list-on-bourse-in-2022?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business) شركات الجيش هيتم طرحها في السوق  وده اللي قاله مدبولي امبارح مع BBC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AfVJJ7W\_RI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AfVJJ7W_RI)   تقدر تskip لفقرة الكلام عن مشاريع الجيش لو مش مهتم بالباقي بس هو مدبولي رد وقال الكفاية.  &#x200B;

No im not talking as if we were starving. But we were getting robbed for 40 years and he left the country to rot, slums to flourish, Infrastructure to get destroyed. He just stayed and kept the stability, kept the ppl happy with subsidies and letting ppl do whatever, build whatever wherever, projects would take decades if they even see the light of day. Mubarak days were probably easier than right now after 2 revolutions, and tourism would also be slightly more than in 2019 in terms of number of tourists (tho 2019 reported highest earnings in tourism in our history). But even that peak of mubaraks number of tourists isnt even 10 percent of what Egypt should have. Now so many projects and so much work is on place to get these numbers to where they should be. About debt, i urge you and anyone reading this to learn more about debt and not just take it as some arbitrary number as if bigger is worse. Look at it as a ratio to the gdp and youll see that that ratio is decreasing. If you look at debt in japan or the usa youll think omg theyre the worst economy in the world.

He suddenly implemented a new system that could've been successful had he trained the teachers more, took longer time to prepare for such a leap in education systems, took a slower approach, and generally just thought more about the execution instead of trying to implement good but raw ideas into an environment that's not seen change in a long while  Such huge changes can't just come suddenly. The previous system might've had its flaws but at least it kept the students studying. Now the whole idea of"don't memorise, don't refer to one source, you shouldn't even know what the exam would looks like" made the students believe that completely abandoning the older studying methods is the solution while all that does is make them much less prepared. Keep in mind that I didn't even mention the flaws in the system itself. The servers failing, problems in marking the exam and grades, the utter confusion both students and teachers are in due to lack of information, and the increased rates of cheating, all are huge issues that arised with the new education method but let's just focus on the idea's core for now	NULL

The term is offensive not because of its origins but because of its use. Christians call themselves مسيحيين I.e related to Christ. This is how they identify themselves, why would anybody challenge that? Besides the word نصراني and نصارى is used by Salafists and ultra orthodox Muslims as a pejorative term that’s why it’s offensive.  P.S Before 9/11 Muslims were all over the world called Mohammedans (related to Mohamed) but this is not used anymore.	NULL
Most sensible Egyptian..	NULL
These are such obscenely horrible ideas that you have to be really young. If so, let me help correct your perspective a little. I'll respond to them one by one I guess: 1. "Stop teaching useless facts": what's a useless fact? Who decides what is and isn't a useless fact? Is Egyptian history "useless facts"? Is the pythagorean theorem "useless facts"? What about Geography? There is very little that we can objectively label as "useless facts" and I have a feeling most of what you think is useless is, in fact, not useless.  2. "He forces schools to teach in better ways" how? Does he just flip a switch and schools suddenly get better? Schools being bad is a problem I am not sure the ministry of education can even solve alone even if it tried its absolute hardest. Schools are bad because they are poor as fuck. Schools are bad because teachers have been undertrained for generations. Schools are bad because they are usually overcrowded. These are issues that would take at least a decade (a generation) to solve if schools were a high priority for the entire government.  3. "He removes all the memorizing stuff" I will never understand where the Egyptian myth of memorization being bad and being the opposite of intelligence comes from. This is one of the strongest forms of cope I have ever seen. Memorization is an integral aspect of intelligence and the science we have backs this one up pretty strongly. Memorization just requires effort and it's easier to say it's unintelligent than to admit that people are just lazy. Memorization is good, and it should never go away, and it is natural that memorization is dominant. Is it too dominant? Maybe, but "removing it all" is probably worse.  4. "Teach us how to pay taxes" fam this isn't the U.S., we don't do our own taxes (most of the time). This is straight up you just absorbing American culture without having the slightest idea how your own country works.  Anything I didn't respond to I consider a blatant joke and I HOPE none of them was actually serious.	NULL

It's not a slur, that's for sure. Actually, it's how Christians are referred to in the Quran, so I'd go as far as saying it's the correct terminology.  BUT, some do think of it as offensive and if someone doesn't like me calling them X, then I won't call them X 🤷🏻‍♀️	NULL
I think it's a stereotypical thing. Most of the time the term نصراني is used by the الشيوخ اللي بذقن طويلة دي. Which are unfortunately also are stereotyped to be an extremist. The same goes to the term مسيحي which mostly used as a day to day term. However, both are basically the same thing. So some may find it offensive because of the stereotype o just mentioned earlier, and some won't because they understand that they are the same.	NULL

The term is an Arabic word that is used numerous times in the Quran to delineate Christians. Its origins go back to the city of Naserah in Palestine where Isa (pbuh) lived.  Your argument of how a perfectly normal word becomes offensive when used by some people in an offensive way, is just flawed. The term "bitch" is only offensive if you use it to insult a person, however, it's perfectly normal to use when describing a female dog, fox, or wolf).   Thank you.	NULL

While the word نصرانى itself isn't offensive, it has been used to associate Christian with Israel and in a way to garner hatred towards them (at least that's what my friend was told in a seminar during his time in the navy).

I would say I agree with most of your argument, except for one thing: your view of the previous system. Nah, bro. The previous system was utter sh!t. So any step away from it, is a huge leap forward.

It's definitely one of the reasons I believe. However, in my humble opinion, it's not a fix. Big egyptian cities are car-centric as the public transportation doesn't cover nearly enough routes nor is it reliable enough (for other reasons) to be a proper car replacement. Increasing taxes on cars without properly fixing the public transportation sector is just draining the middle/lower class citizens even more.

Don't take it the wrong way, but I hate the Eagle-on-flag thing at all, and if there is ever going to be a redesign, the eagle has to be removed.  There is an entire science about flags called "Vexillology", which outlines the best ways to design a flag.

Until the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the Kingdom was only nominally independent, as the United Kingdom retained control of foreign relations, communications, the military, and Sudan.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Egypt/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	NULL

The first French-medium schools in Egypt were established in 1836. By the end of the nineteenth century it had become the dominant foreign language in Egypt and the lingua franca of foreigners; this was especially the case in Cairo.[12]  French became the primary foreign language in media during the rule of Ibrahim Pasha.[13] During the period of the British influence, French was actually the medium of communication among foreigners and between foreigners and Egyptians;[14] the mixed French-Egyptian civil courts operated in French, and government notices from the Egyptian Sultan, taxi stand information, timetables of trains, and other legal documents were issued in French.[15] In addition the usage of French in the media was at the greatest extent in this period.[13] This was partly because some Egyptians had French education and partly because of cultural influence from France.[14] Despite efforts from British legal personnel, English was never adopted as a language of the Egyptian civil courts during the period of British influence.[16]  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Egypt  Due to social and political reasons, the role of French in Egypt began to decline in the 1920s.[12] There are still two newspapers published in the French language.  You can actually see some remnants of this nowadays with like old street signs in old neighbourhoods written in both arabic and french "rue ....."	NULL

If you have the ability to teach, you can easily find a job here, but the salary will depend on the "level" of the school, it can start around 3-4000 to 5x to 10 times more. But you should know and its logic that high paying positions are very rare.  You also have the call center option, if you speak French/German, the salary compared to the average salary is good (7k to 12K), but the shift is hard, and the rotations are crazy. So it's just a position to make some money to start a potential career here.  I also met an Egyptian who had studied in the UK, he was working as an engineer in the new capital, he seems to get a very good salary, so check the construction company, they may be hiring foreign staff.  And about cost of life it will depend on how you lived,  but you should understand that to have quiet and cool life in Cairo, will cost a pretty amount f money, so if you dont get high salary, it will be hard to have decent life.

Mostly Europeans and turks were enslaved.  2) black Americans were used as an expendable farm workers, imported by the millions from thier native land and completely dehumanized.   Slaves in the Arab/ islamic world were mostly house hold slaves, many enjoyed high ranks and good living, and many eventually become sultans and leaders (the mamlukes). They had rights and could buy their own freedom. They mostly didn't work in plantations.	NULL

In my experience, i started with a random therapist off shezlong and she herself recommended me a person more suited to my issue a psychiatrist.      The psychiatrist set a plan for me that I was supposed to follow with therapists and consult the psychiatrist again every now and then.   So just whoever you meet, if they didn't suit you, feel free to ask them for recommendations for a person who is experienced in your particular issue, they'd probably know.   DM me if you wanna discuss the therapists i've contacted, but there is no right answer there. Also, I think the best thing you can do is look for therapists online and copy their names to look up their social media pages and judge for yourself.

>It could be a baseless opinion and still counts as an opinion even though it is very likely to be dismissed  Just gonna throw my two cents on the matter here.  The entire point of opinions is to have different takes and offering new perspectives on subjective matters that doesn't have one correct answer.  If you try to apply them to objective matters the word  loses all its value for example if person a said: 1+1=2 and person b said:1+1=3, person b is objectively wrong his opinion doesn't have any value to it.  You can come to two conclusions here:  1 some opinions can be wrong 2 opinions can't be applied to objective matters  And the first conclusion defeats the point of opinions, why have them when some of them is just wrong, meaningless and have no value?  Therefore i see the second conclusion to be the most suitable.	NULL

Moreover, it used to be a falcon, namely, Quraish's falcon صقر قريش, which is meaningless, since that name was the nickname of Abdulrahman Aldakhel AlOmawi عبدالرحمن الداخل الأموي but there was never in history a falcon motif for him, or for Quraish.  فشكلها كدا افتكاسة واحد مثقف دولة زرطها أما اتسأل و اتزنق، و من ساعتها الناس لبستها و بتكررها كدا و خلاص و بقيت رواية رسمية للجمهورية المهلبية.  Its shape was slightly changed sometime in the seventies, after the change of the name of the state.  On another note, most people now mix up نسر which is "vulture" with عُقاب which is "eagle". For Arabs, the eagle represented daring, fearlessness and strength. Ancient Egyptians also saw falcons as graceful and strong. But the vulture is usually associated with opportunism. The Egyptian Mut was a vulture, and she was scary for different reasons.  Now all the birds and their totemic significance is mixed up. ماحدّش فاهم .حاجة	NULL

I see that some people in the comments are discussing whether زنجي is equivalent to the N-word or not. Some even claim that it’s just a term that refers to black people! I understand why this might be confusing for many of us. After all, our education system is so poor when it comes to discussions of race and racism.  What people may not be aware of is that زنجي translates to “negro” or the “negroid race,” both of which are part of the race theory that divides humans into groups based on their phenotypes (physical features). More importantly, this theory argued that those groups were not only different physically, but also differed in their mental and behavioral capabilities. Thus, it entailed a certificate hierarchy among those groups with the Whites (Caucasian race) on top and the Blacks (Negroid race) at the bottom.  This controversial theory was long used by colonial powers and slave traders to justify their activities. By seeing black people as members of a sub-human race, they could get away with whatever they did. In other words, you are not eligible for human rights if you’re not considered as such.  This theory has been long disapproved by the scientific community and social scientists for its obvious lack of scientific evidence. It’s such a shame that it’s still taught in school.	NULL

Are you asking about the wedding cost only ? Or the mahr+shabka ?   Cause it can depend wildly. Some families dont care about the finances much as long as their daughter is in good hands. Others focus more on the financials. Shabka alone can cost between 10k-200k "can be less or more" according to the gold/diamonds the bride chooses. mahr as well depends on  what the bride's family requires of ya.  Another thing you have to worry about is the engagement venue and the wedding venue. While traditionally the bride's family pays for the engagement venue and the husband pays for the wedding venue. Some families agree to a 50/50 split for both. Now said venues depend you can get a venue for as cheap as 10k or do your wedding on a street, or you can do it at a 5* hotel which can cost up to 100k depending on the location.  Also the furniture and electronics of the house has a traditional split between the bride and groom "bride buys the kitchen and electronics and the husband buys the bedroom furniture, or sth close to that cant remember the exact details" however that can change as well some bride's families ask the groom to buy everything, others want to buy everything themselves.  Now for the rented apartment also depends is it a small apartment or a big one ? Furnished or unfurnished ? Some families flat out refuse their daughters to live in a rented apartment and demand the groom to buy one, others "if you're lucky" actually buy apartments for their brides to marry in. However furnishing a lets say 1 bedroom apartment can cost between 10k to maybe 50k depending on how expensive you want it to be   Gonna need more details to help ya out friend	NULL

Yh, so , it is logical that the probability of finding a corrupt judge who is holding the case is higher. On the other hand, less women commit murder, so the probability of finding a bad judge holding the case is so much lower.  Let's say you bought 10 t-shirts from the men section. Then you bought 10000 t-shirts from the same company from the female section. The probability is that you will find atleast a couple of the 10000 t-shirts have manufacturing defect. But the 10, it's almost impossible to find a defect in them, because you don't have enough t-shirts to find the error of the manufacture.    This argument aside, your comment is actually extremely counter intuitive, and i believe that some common sense can make you think in another, more reasonable way. Believe me, it's super easy, try it.	NULL

Well depending on where you live but i'll be talking as a cairene/from cairo. Medium wedding party and im gonna assume like maybe 50-100 guests with a set menu and not an open buffet ? There are 4 tiers to wedding venues nowadays   Tier 0 : on the street, cheapest but not the most "pleasant" https://youtu.be/Eu187cwC58w similar to this.  Tier 1 : wedding venues in lower middle class-middle class areas or in like نادي المعلمين/القضاة/الاطباء etc etc, they are a big step above the street  weddings and they are decent but you wont find any luxuries . Probably around 10-35k  Tier 2 : military wedding venues. دار مناسبات المدفعية، المشاة، دار القوات الجوية etc etc. Middle range and good especially if ya have someone in the military in your family they can get ya a big discount . 20k-50k    Tier 3 : hotels now thems the bougie weddings these can cost up to 150k  There are some boats on the nile that do weddings as well but they range from the aforementioned tier 1 to the top bougie tier 3 stuff so i cant give ya an accurate estimate   Of course it depends on the amount of guests and as i said the open buffet/set menu deal you are planning to have   Also how many performers are you planning to bring ? And belly dancers ? Last i checked the top tier belly dancers cost a significant sum "gawhara's wedding performance fee is about 25k-30k " however you can get normal belly dancers for waaay cheaper. A relative of mine got the belly dancer ghazal (RIP) and mahmoud elleithy for about 25k at his wedding.  Now all of this is assuming you're in cairo which is way more expensive than if you were in el fellahin.	NULL

Short answer: no  Long answer:  It largely depends on how big the conflict turns out to be( if there will be a conflict in the first place)  Firstly, my short take on Egypt's (sisi) current foreign policy is that it's trying to increase its influence throughout the middle-east without making any unnecessary enemies out of other regional prowers (Isreal, Iran ,etc..) or superpowers. Egypt has also been very keen on modernizing and bolstering the millitary since sisi took over. This doesn't sit well with the USA who gives everybody in the region nice toys to play with except egypt(QME),  so since then we've expanded our market largely to France ,Russia, China and even Italy. Basically we're playing on all sides but without angering anyone (too much)  Back to the conflict, If it's only scaled to a Russian invasion of Ukraine where the west supplies the Ukrainian millitary and resistance groups with arms and sanctions Russia, which they have hinted will be there move, then there won't be really any effect on egypts foreign policy regarding Russia (business deals,  buying weapons etc...).   However, if this somehow turns into a world conflict between nato and russia ( my bet is China being the reason) then things would be very different.  We still won't join the war but our policy would have to change or atleast be very very cautious because the sides that you are playing on consider themselves enemy's now and will most probably be pissed about you making deals with their enemy   Last time an egyptian president  tried to be friendly and make deals with both USA and Russia during a conflict, it started something we know today as the the suez crisis (العدوان الثلاثي )  Regardless, at the end,  our golden rule will be simple:  [ملناش دعوة يا موهي](https://youtu.be/-sg7IGLUy20)	NULL

You are just getting carried away, that's not in Egypt only it's a male dominant career as i said ,and it's like that cause (if i remember correctly) researchers said that women in general have a tendency to go with their emotions rather than men, so it will probably be male dominant for a longgg time, but there's change and it's for the better, can't forget that this was a couple of months ago so you shouldn't make a fuss about it they just started and didn't finish yet.  Yeah a lot of women need their rights but being extreme just destroys your guy's argument instead of focusing on actual problems you guys jump at the first argument u see to tell literally everyone how this society is sexist and how we should kill all men, and well you guys just look bad with 0 argument. a couple of months ago a bunch of wives killed their husbands and all social media did was to make jokes about it, you didn't see anyone screaming for male rights lol.  Our society is filled with problems but we just complain instead of trying to fix anything and that's really what's holding us back, anyway thx for coming to my ted talk have a nice day :).	NULL

When did I say that? This equals here to me saying that men get less death sentences than women and that they're being in an inequality situation. U are the one complaining not me. I am the one saying that it doesn't really matter how many oranges or apples are sold When apples exist, more poeple will be apples, when oranges are less, there are less chances people will be oranges. Therefore I can use ur 'counter' in my favour as well, saying the following There could be a bigger percentage of women sentences to death, because the amount of women participating in crimes are less, and the amount of men in crimes are higher so thats why more men are sentences to death. Basically this is all non sense, it is all about the : 'death sentence/number of suspects ratio. It doesn't come in anyones favour, it is just overwhelming to the whole society rather than targeting one group The difference here is that I am trying to bring them to an equal state while u are trying to create the inequality out of small differences.

مهو ده مش هيحصل احنا مش هنعمل تارجت عايزين نقفل ١٠٠٠ قاضية السنادي عشان الايكوالتي و خلاص لما يكون في دلايل واضحة و تجارب من نساء اتظلموا و كانوا المفروض يبقوا قضاة و بسبب الذكورية معرفوش ابقي اتكلم انت ، و لو كده ال١٢ ولا ال١٥ قضاة النساء الي فمصر دول اتعينوا ازاي و اشمعني هم ؟	other
Lol	NULL
I was thinking about that but the rocks underneath had another opinion	NULL
القضاة اصلا بيتعينوا ذكور بس بسبب تحيز. انت ازاي مش شايف حاجه زي دي اصلا؟!  هم مش ممتنعين عن تعيين الستات كقضاة عشان الستات كلهم اللي جربوهم فشلوا. ايه الفكر الغريب اللي عندك ده؟  وانا مش بقول نعين 1000 قاضية بكره. لكن المشكلة دي مش بتتحل. ووجودها اصلا من زمان دليل واضح على ذكورية المجتمع.  انت بقى بتنكر الكلام ده على اي اساس؟	other
Why are you pulling shit from your ass 😭😭😭 man was literally just talking about how humans have constructive capabilities and destructive capabilities. Where did you get global warming from ?	NULL
Well I don't see a problem here, the word (زنجي) is used in an educational context to determine the multiple races of human beings, not in a racist way. In that same book you will find that they also included (Caucasians and Yellow-skined), so what's all this fuss about?	NULL
مهو المجتمع الذكوري ده فالقضاء بس ليه ؟ لو ده اتجاه المجتمع ليه ميمشيش علي كل المجالات الي بالالاف امال الستات الي شغالة في مصر دي كلها ايه ؟ اشمعني القضاء الي فيه تحيز يعني ؟ انت مش شايف ان نسبة كبيرة من نساء مصر شغالين عادي فوظايف مختلفة ولا انا مثلا كليتي حرفيا كلها سواء دكاترة و معيدين نساء هل كده كليتي او التعليم النسوية دايسة فيه ؟	other
طيب يعني شفتها في سياق اثار قديمة بجانب رموز تانية بتاعة الفراعنة بس دا كلام آثار ايه اللي يخليه بذات الأهمية أنه يمثل الدولة بالكامل  يعني ممكن التلفزيون المصري يتحط عليه هرم رمز للقناة مفهومة بس ايه أهمية الرمز دا بالذات أنه يمثل كل الدولة وهيبتها على العلم؟ النسر احسن	NULL

المجتمع ذكوري وده واضح في حاجات تاني كتير لول. مفيش رئيسة مصرية. مفيش رئيسة وزراء مصرية. أغلب الوزراء على مر الرؤساء كانوا ذكور. الستات اللي حكموا مصر على مر التاريخ يتعدوا على صوابع الايد. لما ست بتفشل في حاجة الناس بتقعد تقولها عالمطبخ ومين اللي طلعك من بيتك إلخ. عبدالله خرا يطلع يقول الست مكانها في بيتها مع أسرتها مش بناء طموحها في مهنة ومش عارف ايه. عندك اغلب مدراء الشركات ذكور. أغلب مناصب السلطة ذكور. مثلا, اغلب المحافظين, ذكور. أغلب رؤساء الاحياء او عمد المدن, ذكور.  عاوز ايه تاني؟  ولا اقولك خد تعالى لسه. الذكور بياخدوا اجور اعلى من النساء بنسبة 12.9% وده الجهاز المركزي للإحصاء.  لسه عندك إنكار؟ ولا خلصت؟	origin

انا معنديش اعتراض ان المجتمع فعلا اتجاهه ذكوري كل الي قلته ان فكرة ان القضاء مفهوش نساء كتير دي مش بسبب الذكورية و قولت اسبابي فوق..   و عارف ان الستات مفشوخة في حاجات كتير منها التحرش الي هو جريمة بس فالكومنت التاني الي رديت عليك هو أنه الراجل بردو بيتفشخ في حاجات كتير و ذكرتها ، منها مثلا الجواز في رأيي في مصر هو فشخة للراجل لو فهمت و عرفت تقاليده و فكرة القايمة و الي بيحصل بسببها مستقبلا للراجل بعد الجواز.  كل الفكرة ان الحياة مش جحيم للست و وردي للراجل في مصر احنا مش في افغانستان يعني.  ده غير ان مثلا البوست طب ما نلوم الام الي تنازلت يعني ست تنازلت عن القضية نروح نلوم الذكورية ؟ ايه العلاقة مش فاهم ده غير القاضي مهما كان هو مش في برنامج المسامح كريم عشان يدي حكم زي ده من غير ما يكون له استناداته الي انا مش عارفها بصراحة	NULL

You're getting carried away still.

That's in lower court, supreme court is still male dominant lol , it takes a lot more than being just a male to be a judge but u won't understand that.    Yeah and a couple of months ago it was 0% so they're making a change maybe you should  stop making a fuss for no reason and be happy about it.	NULL

Most of the Alexandrians here use a transportation vehicle called (microbus ) it's the most efficient in terms of saving money and time as well, u can still use taxes though with a trick that i personally use to avoid scammers which is that i use Uber only to know the cost of the ride then i try to negotiate with the taxi driver  based on this cost, rent prices can really vary depending on a lot of things but u can check " olx " website as my buddies said , and of course don't forget to negotiate with the landlords to get the best price possible, and finally Vodafone unfortunately doesn't have the best coverage as far as I know so u better go with " orange ", And of course if u can DM me any time if u need any help.

Overnominalization will be the disestablishment of our society's pseudogrammatical normalization of correct speech, intertransculturalism between semicultural patriarchocapitalist structures, and pre-prefixial decommercialization. It normalizes over-prefixation and nominalization of said pseudogrammatical establishments, tearing down the nomenclatural foundation of our transneural ideologies with its overcomplications of traditionalized semifacial communications, which is why سيد الوجود has constructive capabilities and destructive capabilities that lead to global warming of the planet Earth.

And to clear it up. You're a misogynist because first of all, you don't see the problem in the fact that only 1% of the judges are women. You think that's totally normal. That it doesn't reflect men privilege or misogyny in this society.  You think I "hate my own gender" because I call men privileged in a society where most women have at least once experienced sexual harassment and most of the time, it goes unpunished.  You keep deflecting and call men "discriminated against in this society actually like in marriage" when we all know how family abuse is rampant in Egypt and how multiple men actually dodge spending on their children after divorce. Which leads us back to the fact that men are paid 12.9% more in wages than men are per the central bureau of statistics in Egypt.     And you deflected the fact that women are very underrepresented in almost anywhere of authority or power like governors or ministers or prime ministers or presidents or mayors etc, by saying "so what? if my professors in a certain section in uni are 90% females does that mean men are oppressed?" When in fact, 3m more women are illiterate than men. Also when it's proven that in Egypt, girls simply study more and get higher marks when boys are typically more "living it" or are given more freedom by their parents.  &#x200B;  You're a terrible misogynist and I hope you change.

I'll try to simplify it, but I recommend checking the website for more details. UWC consists of 18 schools in different countries. They follow the IB system which is an internationally recognized system just like IG and American. If you apply through the Egyptian national committee, you can take a full or partial scholarship depending on your family's financial state. Or you can apply through the global system, if you're able to cover all expenses but it can be very expensive. Like thousands of dollars expensive. If you're interested, you should go and apply since the application will close on the 28th of January.	NULL

And if I may offer even more critique, the face is poorly drawn with no regard to either historical or anatomical accuracy, the skin tone is not only inaccurate but also extremely dull.

Just checked thier website and its all fine and dandy until they asked for my preparatory school shahada,I do have it but the problem is I got a pitiful grade due to me not having enough time in the math exam,however Normally I always 100% my math exams.

So the plant is called hyphaene, it's native to Africa and the Middle East. It has been used for medicinal purposes but nothing on the lab level. Just purely tradition passed on in upper Egypt (where I suspect you probably got it) and people have been doing it for a while now. So take it to a lab and let us know if our ancestors are full of shit or not.	NULL

African americans don't claim to have built the pyramids. They simply defend the fact that african people built the pyramids because Americans in general (read white people) generally refuse to believe 1) that Egypt is in Africa now or ever was, 2) that Egypt is or ever was inhabited by african people or people of african descent, and 3) that African people have contributed anything of substance to human history. The history classes taught in American schools tend to treat human history as though Greece, Rome, the European renaissance, and the founding of America are the ONLY significant occurrences, and that no one else ever did anything of note. Hollywood produced a movie called the Gods of Egypt, wherein the gods of egypt were literally depicted as white. Egypt is to black culture as Greece is to white culture. White Americans do not claim to have built the Colosseum and black americans do not claim to have built the pyramids.	NULL

Im not alexandrian but i do have a couple of tips for you other than what you asked!   1- Even tho the weather in alexandria is much cooler than in cairo, just remember you are still on the edges of the sahara desert! Our summers can be brutal and the sun is not forgiving so get a large amount of sunscreen with you and hydrate!   2- as a foreigner expect to be ripped off if you are shopping by yourself. So i suggest that when you get to know some of your local classmates and you guys become friends. Ask him/her to come with ya when you are shopping. I have done this with many of my foreign friends and the price difference for items is no joke.  3- the weekend here in egypt is friday/saturday so thursday is our version of friday night. Expect high uber/taxi fares and traffic jams. Expect traffic jams in egypt in general so always try to manage your time and account for the out of left field traffic jam  4- dont drink tap water and always carry a water bottle with you.   5- egyptian food needs some getting used to but you'll love it   6- google maps is your best friend and alexandria isnt that big   7- always carry some cash/change with you. Especially for lets say a taxi ride that has cost ya like 35egp and the only cash you have on ya is a 200egp note. Yeah you're gonna be scrambling for change to pay the taxi driver who 99% will say he doesnt have change haha  8- a lot of egyptians know english or at least a very basic level of english that can help you if you get in a pickle and dont know the right word in arabic in a situation	NULL

But Egypt isn't an extension of Europe, except for the old "Pharaohnism" movement that wanted to disassociate itself or put some distance between it and Africa. But what kind of idiot would claim Egypt isn't African? It is African and shares history in Africa because surprise surprise it's in Africa. Do you know of specific Right wing nationalists that promote this as of late?	NULL
True, Egypt's carbon footprint on the world is miniscule compared to China, India, and the West. But we produce some of the highest carbon emissions in Africa.  And just because there are others worse than us, doesn't mean we should continue doing something that's inherently bad. We should try to be better.  There is no excuse for fossil fuels in Egypt. Our efforts should be transitioning QUICKLY to solar and wind power. We should focus on energy efficiency and waste management and sustainability. Our homes and cities can totally run on renewable energy in less than a decade.  Fossil fuels are not profitable or efficient in the long run. We'll eventually collapse economically if we continue down that path. Protecting nature and biodiversity and ushering in a Green Industrial Revolution will bring more value and prosperity in the long run. Not to mention help Egypt become a developed country.	NULL

Even without war, they desecrate holy sites of the 2 most followed religions in the world, roam through Palestinian villages and say "Death to Arabs" and invest exorbitant amounts in foreign media to make us look like shit. They don't want peace, they want Co-existence for the time being.	NULL
Look at u/madara707 comments in this post. He literally said "Egyptian history is not African history." Quite surreal that any barely conscious lucid human could say that.  I believe the Pharaohnist movement was to distance Egyptian identity from the Arabs.  Yes Egypt is not an extension of Europe, but many Egyptians have internalised the racism and imperialism we've experienced since the French invaded. There is a lot of self hatred which fuels this idea that Egypt is a European country and Ancient Egypt was a European civilisation. This is why there is still horrific racism towards black people in Egypt.  This idea was imprinted onto Egyptians from European who refused to believe that there was a complex and advanced civilisation outside of Europe older than the Romans and the Greeks.  That is why there are a significant number of Egyptians who become incensed at the idea of there being any association between Egypt and Africa.	NULL

People that talk like this are usually rich enough to cover their own asses and are quick to judge others. Start thinking about the others that barely have anything to eat some days, sleep on the streets, die from curable diseases, all because of our resilience to mining and reaping the treasures that our land has to offer. This is a weak excuse made by "1st world countries" trying to act all environmentally friendly, when they were the first to ruin the climate. So now we should just not use our fuel reserves when we have a crisis in fuel prices all over the world cause "the climate you know?" and "we will already be at 0 green house gas emissions by 2375." So rather than using the gift you have now when it is worth a lot and is in a very high demand, just keep it in the ground until it's worthless. Well thought out isn't it?	NULL

>Been working fine for a very large number of countries.  Clearly you're poorly informed and haven't got the slightest clue what you're talking about. Follow the news and current affairs and the most talked about topics in the world today and you'll see that fossil fuel-based economic activity will lead us to ruin. And please don't take it up with me. Take it up with all temperature records being broken and catastrophic weather events happening worldwide and with climate scientists.  Take it up with the economists and the World Economic Forum and the IMF too. And just about every credible economic think tank in the world.

Again you haven't a clue what you're talking about and clearly don't know anything about climate change and how it works. It's not something sudden. It's something that's happening now and accelerating every year and if we continue business-as-usual, the planet will be uninhabitable by the end of century. That's best case scenario.  >How do you think all of the currently developed countries developed hmm?  Slavery, colonialism, imperialism, and global domination and destruction. Is that what you want Egypt to do? And when nature is destroyed, where are we going to get our food, air, and water from?  As for your last paragraph, I can safely assume you're not really in tune with the real world and instead live inside a small internet bubble. Like study after study and real-life example after real-life example shows, there is much more value from building a sustainable circular green economy. That will lift millions of Egyptians out of poverty. Not polluting our land and oceans. That will make us poorer.

No its not a coincidence. This is done to kind of bother you for not serving in the military. What happens is, between the age of 29 and 30, you will be stuck with an expired passport with no way to renew. You will have two options, either to go back to Egypt and serve (if you cant stay that year wherever you are) OR you can just stay where you are till you reach 30 and go back to the embassy to pay a fine for not serving. After paying the fine, you can then renew your passport normally and be able to visit Egypt with no problems	NULL

It is absolutely no problem since I myself already have many friends around the world,one of my best online friends is a Polish transwoman for example.

I wanted to ask if you have info about that,and generally a comprehensive view into what exactly the application process is,the criteria besides some creativity and learning jargon,and what I can expect and what I need to know moving forward, It feels like information is rare and they are reliant on me just pulling the trigger and organically applying, which would fit the theme they are going with,which goes against what I prefer for potentially life changing choices.

For accommodation, I recommend looking through Facebook—there are groups for people offering/looking for flats, rooms, and so on. Try to look through groups where English is used as often, or more than, Arabic to ensure a higher quality and less scammers—something I learned from looking for accommodation here before (not from Alexandria, but currently staying here for college).  Uber can be a way to go around, but I would say you should try to use the tram, and microbuses (مشاريع as Alexandrines like to call them) if you’re with an Egyptian. Also, SWVL is very good too!

Bro you don’t get it we’re fucking tired, especially when african amercans are the FIRST TO JUMP on some white’s throat whenever a white person has braids, or is wearing anything related to african fashion (whatever that is) and you yell “CULTURAL APPRECIATION NOT APPROPRIATION” so how about YOU appreciate our culture and just shut the f up already. It’s getting offensive and rude, white washing celebrities and you getting mad about it? SAME exact frustration happens when you darken the features of our egyptian heritage and make them look like african american.  You even claimed buddha? What’s the goal here? Controlling every historic figure and then claiming “WhItE PeOplE NevEr EvEn exIstEd”??? Literally shut up. Thank you.	NULL
it isn't stupid cultural shit. You can't expect every country in the world to follow the same culture as other countries, and you have to respect that but also call out when you feel something is wrong.

Sounds like the entire retail industry to me. I’m in customer service too, and often get blamed for everything I don’t do, just because you’re representing that company.   You’ll almost always have to deal with nose-up-to the sky clients with an shit load of ego.   Get your experience in and work for someone who’ll appreciate your dedication and hard work, not enslave you.	NULL
No, of course you don't deserve to be treated this way. Working in customer service is unfortunately mentally exhausting everywhere, not just here. I'm sorry you have to endure the ugly side of humanity as part of your job.   If this is a temp career for you, I hope you'll find another job pursuing your passion soon. If this is what you want to do though, look into ways to get promoted into positions where you won't have as much direct contact with customers.	NULL

I completely understand your frustration. I believe that the main issue here is the policies of these companies. I haven't seen a single store in Egypt with a good customer based policies. This obviously get customers mad, however, it's not your fault, you didn't make these policies.  How about you try this, next time a customer is mad about a policy let them know that you completely understand them and that it's mot fair and that you would love to help them but it's simply not possible for you to go against the policy, and offer them to speak to the manager.  This will take the heat off of you and since your manager doesn't step in on their own, it's now their problem.	NULL

هي كل الحكاية إن و الضباط الاحرار و هم مجموعة صغيرة واحد منهم (عبدالحكيم عامر)  كان شغال تحت اللواء محمد نجيب. فمحمد نجيب وقتها كان معروف بشجاعته، قوته، تمسكه بالحق، و قصص كتيرة عنه في حرب فلسطين إلي أخد فيها حوالي 7 طلقات ( مش فاكر الصراحة الرقم بالظبط بس في الحدود دي) اثناء محاربته هناك. فعبد الحكيم عامر عرض علي جمال عبد الناصر إن محمد نجيب ينضم ليهم، فوافق و راح عرض عليه. سرعان ما وافق اللواء محمد نجيب، من هناك أي حد كان يعرف إن محمد نجيب فجماعة الضباط الاحرار كان ينضم ليها بسرعة.  ومن هناك بدأت جماعة الضباط الاحرار تكبر، و اتخذوا محمد نجيب قائد ليهم بالاجماع. و بدأوا يجهزوا بالانقلاب بمحمد نجيب رأيسا و جمال عبدالناصر، و عبدالحكيم عامر، و السادات من القواد العليا في الضباط الاحرار و غيرهم القليل.  المهم لما حصل النقلاب، أصبح اللواء محمد نجيب الرئيس الجديد كان من جمال عبد الناصر و محمد نجيب ليهم وجهة نظر مختلفة في الحكم، و بدأت تحصل مشاكل وتكبر. بعدها بسنة حصلت محاولة اغتيال لجمال عبدالناصر، و وجه عبدالناصر اللوم علي اللواء محمد نجيب مع اتهمات أخري ( مثل التعاون مع الاخوان المسلمين و غير ذلك) ، وعرف ينزعه من الحكم، علشان كان مقرب علاقاته ومصالح كل القيادات العليا منه وقتها.  أتحكم علي اللواء محمد نجيب بالسجن المنزلي من وقتها و بدأ جمال عبد الناصر يمحي كل اثر لمحمد نجيب، لدرجة إن الشعب كان فاكر إن جمال عبد الناصر هو الحاكم الأول لمصر والحوار ده  مشافش النور لغاية سنة 1971 لما السادات مسك و رفع عنه الحذر وبدأ الحوار يتعرف شوية من هناك.    و أهي   [صورة ](https://ibb.co/c2YrCz5) فيها جمال عبد الناصر و اللواء محمد نجيب	other

This probably means that ex-muslims / atheists are overrepresented in r/Egypt \- or that ex-muslims are substantially more inclined to join communities around that identity while muslims (on reddit at least) typically don't care.  My best guess would be that it's both, actually. Overrepresentation of ex-muslims + a stronger inclination to find an online community surrounding that identity since it's hard to do so IRL, which isn't the case for muslims.  There are a few more factors that I can think of but I'd consider these two the most probable / impactful	religion

And lots of non-Egyptians know much more about the rest of Egypt's history than you do. Just because you're Egyptian, doesn't mean you automatically have a monopoly on all knowledge and information pertaining to Egypt. That's quite frankly extremely stupid and juvenile.

Solar panels in Sahara desert can generate clean energy. I also read your other comments about climate change and you are right. Yet there is still a way to produce fossil fuels and limit their effect on climate change. This is easier with natural gas than it is with oil. It involves a process that produces “Blue Hydrogen” called “Steam Reforming”. The carbon is then captured and sent back to the oil well in a process called “CCAS - carbon capture and sequestration”. Search the “keywords” on google if you are interested in more info.	NULL

All Egyptians are black and no Egyptians are white.  All African Americans come from Egypt. All Egyptians know that. Blanket statements tend to be rediculous.  In all fairness Egypt has loads of black people especially Upper Egypt, in the Delta, in the west like in Siwa, oh yeah and in Cairo. They didn't come here from anywhere. Black Arabs in Egypt are as old as the old testament.  African Americans see black people as a spectrum of color including mixed black people. On the African continent people mix but less often from other cultures. Africa defines blackness differently than the u.s. What America defines as black people is different than how most Egyptians define it. Since we are operating on different understandings of what blackness is, we run into disagreement about whether to the ancient Egyptians were black.   At the end of the day, black identity is a modern political identity that the ancient Egyptians did not have use for, in the way that democracies use it today. Ergo, politically/ ethnically black was not how ancient Egyptians saw themselves. But they sure as hell were not white. They definitely had dark skin. We've all seen the typical upper Egyptians. They're brown. They were not west Africans nor were they Ethiopians, but we know what upper Egyptians look like and we don't need to have this debate.	NULL

Did you want him to name it "الهررة المتفجرة"?	NULL
Yes most certainly. One renewable energy expert (can't remember who) said that if you divide Egypt's western desert into hundreds of small squares, a solar farm as big as just one of those squares would generate enough electricity for all of Europe.  I've not seen evidence and it might be far fetched but the potentials for solar energy are limitless.  I am somewhat familiar with blue hydrogen but I know there's an alternative called green hydrogen. I believe blue hydrogen's critics say it is still a fossil fuel, it is still depleting a finite resource, and there's always potential for leakages. Green hydrogen is a completely renewable alternative and doesn't deplete any fossil fuel or finite resource.  CCAS is also a great idea but it's currently still very expensive and requires a lot of energy. It's still not economical but it will eventually become important in the fight to decarbonise the planet.	NULL

Came here to say this	NULL
You are beating around the bush, Egyptians were not white, but they were not black either. pretty much as they are today.  and same as today, we know for a fact that Egyptian skin color graded from dark to pale.  when trying to cast doubt on the geneolgy of a population, you shouldn't be speaking in speculation and conjecture. and basing what you're saying on your whims and personal observations.  the fact is that king tut himself was depicted in multiple colors. and Egyptian women were typically depicted pale compared to men, who were depicted reddish to reflect working in the field. this is a PROVEN fact, repeated by Egyptologists who studied Egypt more than you ever will.    There is no trace of doubt that modern Egyptians (ALL OF THEM) are related to Ancient Egyptians. https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/  if you think other wise bring a study supporting your claim or grace us with your silence.

It's true that the Ancient Egyptians had more interaction with Assyrians, Abyssinians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, Hittites and people like than, but at the same time, their gold came from the Land of Punt, which is modern day Somalia, so they must have had control over much of North East Africa, all the way up to the roots of the Nile. It's clear that natural land barriers, such as mountains and desert, prevent them from being accessed by other parts of Africa, as easily as they were accessed by Greeks, Romans, and so on. Yes, we also know that Cleopatra was Greek and part of the Ptolemaic dynasty. She wasn't Ethnically Egyptian. but there was an ancient Egypt before the Greeks and romans arrived and you can know without doubt that they had dark brown skin. Call it what you want, but if you can see paintings in mountain tombs in West Aswan, I saw them myself, and the people were painted dark brown. Egypt was never cut off from immigration, not since they had boats for sure. So we can expect that Egyptians intermarried with other ethnic groups and were not purely anything. The Nubian society was more protected than the other Ancient Egyptians. But we know if we go to Luxor and Aswan today, you'll see a lot of people with dark skin, and they sure didn't come from Sudan. Lets not pretend there's only one Egyptian look when clearly there's so much diversity, from Nubians, to Upper Egyptians, to Berbers, Greeks, Romans, Bedowins, People from el Sham, Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Semites, and some Europeans no doubt, in our gene pool. We have been basically hosting foreign guests since the beginning of time.	NULL

I already made all the points you are making. I explained that upper Egyptians are the same now as ancient Egyptians. I explained that you can reference ancient Egyptian art, but ancient Egyptian art spans 4000 years, so you're going to find huge differences in how people art depicted depending on the example and the time.      I know more about this than you do. You don't have the temperament to have this discussion with me. you are too immature for this debate. You actually wasted time ridiculing someone's artwork because of your racism. It's pathetic.     I am just explaining that in the states race is defined differently than in Egypt. There for, an American would consider the typical upper Egyptian to be black, but an Arab Egyptian would not. Stop talking about what skin color the Ancient Egyptians were depicted as, as if there's a singular reference. How Ancient Egyptians depict themselves changed with time and tells us nothing. Yes, we can just simply look at upper Egyptians today, and frankly, what you call black is different than what an American calls black that's why I'm trying to say that the debate about race is dumb and it's totally dumb for Egyptians to get all butt hurt every time someone says Ancient Egyptians are black or African. Obviously they're in Africa, so they're African. Obviously, lots of Egyptians are black, get over it. Just because you aren't big deal. and what's defined as black is different here than there, and there was really no meaning to the word 5,000 years ago, so this is just a really stupid conversation.

Right but this post doesn't make any of those extremist afrocentric claims. Akala at no point in that lecture says that Ancient Egyptians were a black race. He doesn't for one moment say that modern Egyptians aren't related to ancient Egyptians. He in fact says (and presents evidence researched by other scholars) that ancient Egyptians were mixed race, just like modern Egyptians. He even complains that when western scholars try to create depictions of what ancient Egyptians might have looked like, they make them look western and don't bother to look at how modern Egyptians look to help inform their depictions.  I just find it wild that so many Egyptian redditors are enraged by such a small niche fringe group who make a small minority of African Americans (they're just ignorant internet trolls really) and don't spare a thought for how white people ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY LITERALLY robbed Egyptian heritage	NULL

Suez crisis didn't start due to USA and soviets. It started out because Britain was a little shit head who was that over the canal it had lost, and saw a kind of dictator similar to Hitler and musilini, with that it started waging  war on Egypt.  Egypt was on very good terms with Soviet union at that time, and also a decent term with the USA.  The soviet union even straight out said that if this was to escalate more, then it would use its nuclear option on Britain, and before that Egypt made a large weapon deal with USSR.    USA feared that Egypt's unavoidable loss would make it fall to communism and later the USSR, effectively initiating a domino effect where all the region would fall and be a communist regime.  thus also threatened Britain and its    USA fearing that, starting pressuring Britain, France and Isreal to go back, and under all of that influence, it went retreated.  So in essence, gamal abdelnaser was a good political manipulator, able to get both the support of the USSR and the USA to stop a war, which was unimaginable with all of the stuff happening there.

No, this has always been the case. The military conscription is compulsory. Once you become 16, you are required to provide an excuse as to why you cant do the service right away and traveling becomes difficult because every time you want to travel you have to get permission from the military. So usually when you get enrolled in college, your excuse is that you are currently enrolled and studying, so they let you be till you are done. Some guys during that period (as a student) travel out of Egypt and stay out till they hit 30, since that's the only way to escape the service. To kind of stop this, they dont renew your passport after the age of 29 to force you to come back to Egypt and serve your one-year conscription (if you are unable to stay where you are, you are out of options because your passport is expired).

Dude it had to be done, imagine overthrowing the king and the Britains, ofcourse everyone would be in chaos, and Britain would try to reclaim so it had to look for a solution.  At the same time, the CIA had knowlage of a revolt that would occur soon, so to stop it, it wanted to pressure king Farouk to do reforms, be it wasn't successful.  With the revolt now being unavoidable, then the best case scenario is for Egypt to not be communist for them.  At the same time they met gamal abdelnasser, they agreed on two main things things  1-the revolt should not make Egypt communist. 2- if the Britains were to interfere, then USA would stop them.

Some are more competent than others but usually there are people who have been in it for years, making them "experts" but even so called experts can be wrong, and your post is a good example of a professor or doctor being arrogant and falling for a common, tribal bias. There was actually a video from Lex Fridman which shed light on this: https://youtu.be/lOz3wDhGA3Y  You'd be surprised how a bunch of them are in it for status only and not the pursuit of science.

'' copying this from a reply I made above''   Dude it had to be done, imagine overthrowing the king and the Britains, ofcourse everyone would be in chaos, and Britain would try to reclaim so it had to look for a solution.  At the same time, the CIA had knowlage of a revolt that would occur soon, so to stop it, it wanted to pressure king Farouk to do reforms, be it wasn't successful.  With the revolt now being unavoidable, then the best case scenario is for Egypt to not be communist for them.  At the same time they met gamal abdelnasser, they agreed on two main things things  1-the revolt should not make Egypt communist. 2- if the Britains were to interfere, then USA would stop them.  That for them was a win-win situation, because gamal abdelnasser hated communism, and also wanted the help in their revolt.  That was all that occurred in project FF I believe.	NULL

You just said that there is a variety of skin colors in Egypt. We all have noticed, there's nothing wrong with discussing it, and we are talking about black people and what different people define as black.   Upper Egyptians constantly claim they're related to arab tribes, and you provided articles that suggest that they aren't, so who is to decide really. Are you contradicting the article you gave us in Egypt Independent or what?   Black and Brown Egyptians aren't considered black in Egypt, well, sometimes, and sometimes they are discriminated against, called black by lighter skinned Egyptians, called Sudanese, and so on, and again, America defines blackness differently because of political context.

Big populations and especially dense populations can be a very valuable asset to any country if it's managed right. Overpopulation is largely a classist and racist myth. Capitalism produces far more than what we actually consume and we consume more than what we need. At the same time, we are destroying the environment and gradually making the planet an uninhabitable place for humans.  This is especially the case when you take into account that the world's richest 10% produce more than 50% of the world's carbon emissions, while the poorest 50% produce 10% of all carbon emissions. This is according to an Oxfam study conducted a couple of years ago.  Study after study shows that people aren't poor because they have many children. Poor people have more children because they are poor. All statistics show that when people are economically empowered and have access to social protections and basic services, they tend to have less children. Poor people have more children because it's their only method of social protection. The children grow up to all work low-paying jobs to support the whole family.  In Egypt, the statistics show that the poorer and the more rural the region is, the higher the birth rate. More urban regions with higher numbers of working class and middle class famillies have lower birth rates.	NULL

It's just that I have seen dozens of videos like these in all its forms. From the extreme 'black is superior, take back Egypt from the 'Arabs', cut off the African Nile from the non-Africans, kill the 'Arabs' in Egypt...etc. etc.', to the milder versions like this video that try to sound reasonable while adding a little Afrocentric agenda in between. He's saying that early historians were being racists, and yes I also agree, but he's adding some statements like "the Arab invasion and other invasions significantly changed Egypt's demographics" while saying other statements like 'Egyptians were black with flat nose and wholly hair', adding both statements together is indirectly giving the idea to the public that Ancient Egypt was ethnically similar/identical to west Africans (which is what the public usually associates the word "black with").   I have debated this topic for years with dozens of black supremacists, and I'm really not willing to go through the same vortex again...sorry.	NULL

Imo, its almost like a loop. People have lots of kids, so they can support them when they grow old, because the government could not. And the government could not offer services to support the people because they are too many. In other words, with how the government is moving towards privatization and more taxes, people with limited income are fucked, so they have kids that can take care of them when they get older which in turn will lead to more privatization and even more taxes.  From my personal experience for example, my father is a retired doctor, retired public hospital doctors make around 2,000 egp per month as pension, which of course isn't enough, So my father in his 70s decided to continue working in his private clinic despite our objections. This work led him to get Corona. He got corona so bad that he has been suffering for the past 6 months and spent the past month in the ICU. The ICU stay alone has cost him all his savings. So all 5 sons and daughters, who are working outside Egypt, are luckily able to send our parents money to make ends meet and make sure he is getting the best treatment and to take care of our mother. I cant even afford to visit them, because of my military status.   Now in Germany, because of the strong social government. My father would have been only working in a public hospital with a very decent salary and a decent pension. And working only 8 hours a day, would have made my father in much better shape and he would have enjoyed his 60s. Treatment to covid would have been excellent and for free. So people here never regret not having 4-5 kids since there is no benefit in that whatsoever.   Culturally it is expected of kids to support their parents in the best way possible because without this support they will be victims of the harsh and inadequate government services.	NULL

In my opinion. I would take a brutal approach. Everyone had to pull his weight.

Ok , what does everyone sees here that I don’t?	NULL
I would really advise against doing the service. I already did it, and wouldnt really recommend it. I do not know what you can do, but if you could stay put where you are till that year passes and then pay the fine, that would be much better, unless you have a wasta. Because if you do go back and you dont have a good enough excuse as to why you did not serve so far, your 14-month service could be extended 6 more months as punishment. So if I were you, I would either contact someone, to make sure it will go smoothly, or just stay put.   You could also stay in Egypt for a year without serving, as long as you don't travel and don't apply for anything related to the government and just stay low. Tamer Hosny tried to do that but someone checked and he got imprisoned for a year. So definitely consider all options.	NULL

I think if you folks had a better population growth it would’ve helped. You guys had a fast population boom and covered a lot of arable land with houses to keep up, and now the government spends quite a bit importing food to keep the population alive. So more farming land could help the country grow, or more industry and business for a higher GDP so you can import food without it being too much of a burden.

Personally, I’m against serving. I view it as modern day slavery because we’re a 100m+ so we’re not exactly lacking in terms of troops since the number of people who willingly work for the military is already high enough. If they want troops, they can expand their capabilities in military universities to take in more people and make military more attractive to work for by providing more pay and benefits.  Now for me personally, as I said, a valid passport in my line of work comes before everything and let’s just say there will be far more career and personal life  consequences to my particular case at the age of 29 than there will be right now so while I’m against the whole idea, I have to serve 🤷🏻‍♂️  As far as wasta is concerned, best I can do is get it to be more like a job where I go back home everyday after finishing the first 6 weeks of bootcamp.

It's a loop. Conditions are bad. Low income families have a lot of children so they can benefit from as a manpower in labour as soon as they physically able rather than investing in their education and wellbeing. Without a lot of kids, they may not be able to live as they age due to their basic type of work that mainly depends on physical ability + those type of jobs don't have security/insurance/pension..etc.  On the other hand, the goverment over the years did nothing to improve the living conditions of these people so they could have better jobs with more security and basic living standards that they would need less kids and focus on their quality of living rather than the number of kids.  This loop took years to form. So let's see how this will work in the next few years after the government started to acknowledge it.	NULL

Considering that unemployment rates in 2011-2015 was around 14%, and now it's 7%, I would say that before the current leadership, we didn't have much job opportunities being created, and now it's increasing but, just like you said, not enough to accommodate the increasing manpower.   So that we don't lose track, From what I have seen in your comments, you seem to dislike the fact that the government is raising public awareness for overpopulation, so I think your main argument here is that 'Overpopulation is manageable, and the government/leadership shouldn't be raising public awareness to overpopulation as it's their job to find use for all of those people'.   My argument was, how can you manage all those people with the resources you have now? You ARE increasing your resources, but slowly (as job opportunities are being created since the stabilized Egypt of today attracted investors back again). The economy is getting fixed slowly, but the population is also increasing RAPIDLY. It's increasing way faster than what you can accommodate -right now-. So I think it IS logical to raise public awareness to overpopulation. That was my whole point...	NULL

Lydia's current population is 6 million (which is almost the population of the city of Giza), Sudan has 43 million (and has enough agriculture land and water to support them and a few more), Saudi Arabia has a population of 34 million and have enough money from the oil they discovered in the 60s to accommodate the large population of its people and still has enough oil money to burn through to keep its people fed. (note that Saudi Arabia had a population of 4 mil when they jumpstarted their economy with oil)  Turkey has enough water and resources, and was already a major economic hub before they got to become overpopulated (meaning they already had enough infrastructure and wealth to support the coming populations).   Iran's population (83mil) was increasing slowly, meaning that they could prepare easily enough for the coming population of each year. Iran also has a major upstream nation that has multiple rivers (just like Turkey) AND they have enough oil money as well (just like Saudi Arabia).  For Egypt's case:   Current population 100million, unlike Lybia  Doesn't have enough water and agriculture lands, unlike Sudan (+ it has double the population of Sudan)  Doesn't have the riches of oil to burn through, unlike Saudi Arabia.  Isn't an upstream nation, and only has 55b cubic meters of water (poor in water), and its infrastructure wasn't prepared for the coming population, Unlike Turkey.

There is no such thing as lack of resources, the private sector could always chip in when need be except for the government makes it one hell of a hrs job for them to do so as they do cut off large chunks of their revenue and they find themselves not having much to go with at length so they essentially don’t even bother. It’s got to do with greed and resource allocation.	NULL

The way your making out investors to be only a handful of people that’ve left some while ago, or, people that have got over a billion dollars in liquified cash is completely bullshit, if you will. An investor doesn’t have to be mad rich to contribute to the country’s burgeoning, you know you could build an entire condominium of 2-4 stories with multiple apartments on each floor if you had a million pounds, granted your not gonna be garnishing them with any amenities though, this is just how much money it costs to set up a structure and have it registered. But, still, that’s enough walls to accomodate up to some 70-80 people and get them off the streets. I think what we lack is awareness of entrepreneurial culture and that it doesn’t have to a 9-5 job that has you coming back home with enough money to support your family along with yourself, that it might as well be a business venture that is benefiting you along with the country as a whole, but, people are not that trusting of the government nor are they trusting of one another for there to be that many people establishing their own businesses.

Germany's population grew with economic growth,here it grows regardless Germany has had enough economic growth to educate their population as they increased,here its impossible to do that  Also no government can just, make a 4trillion economy from what is literally just some farmland in a huge desert  Also also,germany had the US pumping billions into it to get rebuilt,while germany had a massive educated workforce and good industry that only needed some money to restart.  This is not a fair comparison.	NULL

If its managed right,capitalism,whatever  This is pure bullshit,now, yes it is infact always good to have a big,educated and utilized workforce.  Thing is this is impossible in Egypt's case. Workforce means knowledge,available machinery and capital We have none of those,you are supposed to have a small birthrate as you grow your economy and then have a population boom where your newly acquired wealth can help the new people get education while you start projects that employ them and cause more employments through ripple affects. This is what happened in germany,france,the UK, the US,Japan and China,and Note they spent the last 300 years acquiring resources,knowledge and infrastructure before the economic booms they had.  Lets look at Egypt,by 2019 we had 34 million 0-15 year olds in our country,for the government to educate them fully to highschool,lets say each kid needs 100k EGP(this is by taking each school year as 15k,which is close to what most private schools charge) that is a whopping 3.4 trillion EGP(224,bl USD),which is a payment that has to be done yearly. Not to mention the projects that would need to be done alongside the education to let the students who graduate work on,and this is when they only have a highschool diploma,imagine if we took it up to college level. Now lets compare this number to a developed country with a good education system that is generally accepted as a good example,they have 80million people and a laughably low birthrate yet spend 160bl USD every year on public education to the highschool level,note that they also have a bigger urban population and that lessens education costs and more people go to private schools there.  Do you know how much our government revenue every year is? 86bl USD every year  Now tell me how the fuck the government is supposed to pay 224bl every year just to educate this population,it cant Thats why the correct path is to increase school budget but strategically try to lower it as much as possible,while doing projects that can quickly make money for the government to slowly be able to field the needed education budget. Now look at what the government is doing,they may be doing a lot wrong here and there and you may dislike alot of what is being done but we have to stay realistic,its probably impossible to exploit and utilize this population,especially with our already scarce direct needs(water,farmland,land to build on,etc)	NULL

You're hearing what you want to hear and interpreting it in a way that suits your agenda and that's intellectually dishonest. You WANT this lecture to be afrocentric and labelling it as such by splitting hairs.  For example:  >saying other statements like 'Egyptians were black with flat nose and wholly hair'  You took this out of context. He said this was what was reported in a primary source written by a traveller and historian who lived during the time of Ancient Egypt and met Egyptians. At no point whatsoever was it said that all ancient Egyptians were black and had sub-saharan African features. All that was said that SOME of them had those features and it was also said that the evidence points to ancient Egyptians being a mix of skin colours and ethnicities, just like today.  I'm doubting you watched the whole video because a huge part of it was dedicated to other complex advanced civilisations that existed in East Africa, West Africa, central Africa and South Africa. Ancient history that's completely missing from popular knowledge. He's challenging the notion that Ancient Egypt was the only advanced civilisation in Africa and the rest of the continent were just barbaric mud hut dwelling nomads and hunter-gatherers.	NULL

This is what happened in    germany,france,the UK, the US,Japan and China,and Note they spent the    last 300 years acquiring resources,knowledge and infrastructure before    the economic booms they had.  This is mostly wrong and inaccurate. European countries had slavery and colonialism which helped enriched them. Japan had an empire and was trying to compete with Europe and then got hit with 2 atomic bombs. China became a totalitarian state and nuclear power. The US became an economic and military superpower through WW2. Egypt is none of these. Egypt is a formerly colonised country and so isn't comparable to any of these other examples you mentioned. And neither of them developed along the trajectory you described.  >more people go to private schools there.  No they don't. The vast majority of people in developed countries go to government schools.  As for everything else you've said, I don't think you understand how macroeconomics, public spending, and government budgets work. It's not as simple as the way you described it. There are dozens of other factors to take into account but I honestly don't have the time or the energy to explain all that. I'll just leave with the point that any spending on education and skills and human development is not a cost, it's an investment that reaps very profitable returns in the long run.	NULL

Atheist here  This guy was absolutely right  I'm against him socially/culturally and probably against him.even economically but when it comes to the revolution was absolutely correct  This wasn't about Mubarak being corrupt. It wasn't about one person, it was systemic. It's the military and he knew it was the military   As much as I would hate an Islamic as president I wouldn't have minded having him for the first 4 years as president as he probably would have been more competent in dealing with the فلول and the remains of the regime better than morsi. Morsi was too kind.   After that first 4 years we could have thought about getting a more secular president no problem but you need to stabilize first and make sure you don't give up the revolution and you don't give up your democracy	NULL

Try convincing yourself that the policies aren't fair, cause they aren't, not for the customers and not for you as you'll have to deal with angry customers! That way when you're talking to a customer you're not trying to calm them down, you're actually getting angry for them and with them.  You can't control what strangers do, but you can try to change how you deal with them so it wouldn't hurt you as much. Try to have an "I don't give a fuck" attitude with a smile. That's the only way to survive without hurting yourself. And for the law, let's be clear, there's no law that protects you or the customers,even if there's one, it's not being enforced. Try your best not to lose yourself until you can find a better job, or a different career.	NULL

for people who r saying look at china, it's laughable to compare china and Egypt. China has way more water, land, and resources in general. They have the ability to sustain tons of people. Egypt on the other hand is a small green valley in the middle of the desert. Egypt has approximately 53.7 km\^3 of renewable water resources while china has 2,840km\^3.

You can't stop a person from aging because he will be less capable  Growth is such a natural thing that you can't fix or sit down and blame your problems on it Like you can't just sit and plame your failure on being in a desert or having bad weather  Personally I think we don't have a problem because we can really use these hands to strengthen our overall system  Egyptian people are willing to work for so little in comparison to other It's a big issue to discuss in a few words but let me give you an example A nurse has 36 hours of official work hours, she/he is most times abused to work over night and all day 12 hour shifts that are over the official hours reaching easily 70 hours and she has no choice but to attend these extra hours which she gets paid some ridiculous amount for like 12 pounds or something for the 12 hour shifts Compare that to a nurse in a normal country and ask why is this happening and why if they do this we don't have a great healthcare system instead there is shortage of nurses in almost every hospital  So why don't we train more nurses instead of abusing them for extra hours and make them end up not giving a shit about patients in the end  There is so many examples like this  Our issue is the lack of management we don't know how to make use of our human resources  Even the simple act of not being in the way without no help doesn't happen every where business suffer from governmental obstacles that is the reason for so many ideas to just not be possible  If you're willing to spend billions in the desert building new cities why didn't you come up with a system that will cultivate a great economy around it and enable so many small businesses to start and maintain itself in the future making construction both affordable and accessible and allowing competitive private market to be porn, Instead you killed all the market and only a few select companies can still remain because they are connected enough and rich enough to still exist in the picture making the sector even less accessible and corrupt  People are the problem because we don't have a capable regime we have bitches who make everything worse	NULL

It’s not about population its about bad management, a country with all those resources and still in poverty is just bad management issue. One of the main sources of income is tourism and we have one of the worst reviews. At least 4 out of the top 10 diving spot in the world are Egypt, and my German friends won’t think to come again to Egypt because of the bad experience starting by how the immigration officer treated them.  Bad managers or “ government” will blame anyone but themselves. How difficult is to make the pyramids area tourist friendly and safe without harassment?  But population is the main reason of poverty, they just want us to feel guilty about our poverty.  A president of a poor country “as they want to convince us” won’t buy new presidential airplane and build presidential palaces.  But let’s blame it on the population 🤷🏼‍♂️	NULL

Apart from your first paragraph. I don't disagree with the events you discribed however all this is irrelevant to my statement . I studied the suez crisis and know it in detail.   To understand my statement you have to go back to before the the crisis itself.  The suez crisis started due to nasser nationalizing the canal right.   Why did he nationalize the canal ? To fund the construction of the Aswan dam?    Was the canal initially nassers scource of funding for the dam? No, nassers initial scource of funding was the UK and the US who he was on good terms with till then.   What happened to this funding?The US and UK cut it off and didn't even tell nasser. He had to know from the news like the rest of Egypt which was a national embarrassment for him till his nationalization speech.   What did nasser do to recieve such a harsh response from the west? He made a weapons deals with the Soviet union through Czechoslovakia even though he had initially went to the US first and they refused to give him any arms.  Nasser out of anger of what happened and the way it happened decided to nationalize the suez canal. Hence my point.  Nasser didn't see a problem in dealing with the Soviets since he went to the Americans first however they didn't see it that way and dealing with the Soviets was enough for nasser to be punished in their view . Whether one sees this as a blunder by nasser in calculating the consequences of such actions in a time where the world was heavily divided or whether you see it as bullying by the west where nasser wasn't at fault,  it's not the point. The point is when the world is at war, cold or not, your part of it even if your not fighting so you have to tread carefully.	NULL

Take care now. The millitant "animal rights" activists are on their way. They would prefer you and your beloved dog to just die than admit that stray dogs are pack animals that are dangerous to everyone.   No kidding, there was a post about a guy who wanted to kill a dog for mutilating his little child and the smooth brains argued that the world does not revolve around the human, their cities or their children and dogs should be left attacking people and that trying to defend your life or your kid's is animal cruelty and humans should be jailed and killed for it.   It reminds me of a case when a hunter who hunts elk for food in a nordic country got attacked by a bear and survived his face being torn out after killing the bear. The millitants wanted death on the hunter as he had no right to defend himself or go hunting for his own food.   Humanity has forgotten its roots. Animals are playing pretend they are not animals. We are ready for a great reset anytime now.	NULL

I don't know how accurate this text was, but it was taken from wiki  '' Although Dulles believed that Nasser was only bluffing and that the USSR would not aid Nasser, he was wrong: the USSR promised Nasser a quantity of arms in exchange for a deferred payment of Egyptian grain and cotton. On 27 September 1955, Nasser announced an arms deal, with Czechoslovakia acting as a middleman for the Soviet support.[9] Instead of attacking Nasser for turning to the Soviets, Dulles sought to improve relations with him. In December 1955, the US and the UK pledged $56 and $14 million, respectively, toward construction of the High Aswan Dam.[10]''  It is said later on, that actually nasser's naturality was the thing that angered the US later on denying him his money.  Also not sure, but I think not anger was the contributing force for the nationalization of the Suez canal, but the fact that he had just made a huge arms deal, and the fact that he knew that the soviets were backing him up.  But I have to agree it wasn't well thought of.	NULL

Egypt can have a well educated population if we spend money on education instead of fancy castles and parades, ots completely doable, in the matter if fact, egypt is only working right now because of the population it has, that allows the government to have oversaturation in every field allowing then to underpay them and use then as much as possible.

Could you describe what you mean by "attack"? Baladi dogs very rarely ever attack humans. It's not in their nature. If you just mean that they bark then that's all they're ever going to do. Just ignore the barking and keep walking on. When a dog is barking at you or growling at you, it's not about to "attack" you. It's only trying to scare you off or tell you to keep your distance. It's based on fear. Since baladis live freely on the streets, 99% of them will run away if you chase them. Biting is an extreme last resort when the dog is cornered and has no way of escaping. When you run away and the pack chases you, it's only ever going to chase you so you can go away. If you were to stop in your tracks, so will they. Baladis are not dangerous dogs.  Also, dogs are never born aggressive. Humans make dogs aggressive. In order for a dog to develop a habit of aggressively biting people, the dog will have had to have been raised by a human that was cruel to it and suppressed the dog's natural warning system. The dog then learns that barking and growling are useless so it will just skip straight to biting.  And dogs, especially baladis, always remember who was an asshole to them. They will remember who threw stones at them. Who kicked them. Who sprayed water at them. That's why the bark at certain people. All you have to be is nice to them. Feed them. Bring them water. Pet them. They will love you instantly and be fiercely loyal to you. Take my word. Everywhere I have lived and stayed in Egypt, even while just walking through, I befriended the local packs and baladis. I even rescued and adopted one myself.  As for your dog, my suggestion would be to avoid the areas where the pack roams to begin with. Go alone to bring them food and befriend them so they can start to associate you with some positive. Slowly start introducing your dog from a distance and gradually reduce that distance while always having food and treats for both your dog and the pack. Over time, eventually they'll become friends or at least just indifferent. They'll no longer perceive your dog as a threat.  And TNR. A million times TNR. See if you have a local TNR programme and help raise funds for them to come in, vaccinate and neuter the dogs so the pack doesn't increase in size. Moving packs away doesn't work because another pack is going to come along anyway. Keeping the pack where it is will ensure that no new packs move in.  Baladi dogs are an asset to any community. They're not pests. I wish pure breed dogs were banned in Egypt anyway and the only dogs people could get are baladis. They're the best dogs!	NULL

Well, I have been almost attacked like twice without walking my pet, I was walking around in the compound where I live and I was walking near a dog which had given birth (I didn't know there was a dog or that it had even gave birth), I froze and me and the dog kept looking at each other for like 3 seconds, the dog got up and started running at me, I honestly just ran away and it didn't really chase me but it could still be dangerous for anyone else walking by. And for the second time I've almost been attacked, it's a bit complicated to explain if you don't live where I live since you don't know the layout, there's this empty space in the compound where a group of the dogs stay, me and my friend were going there from the back instead of the front they started barking then running over to us, we didn't want to take any chances since they were a very big group of dogs and just booked it.  My sister was once walking my dog, according to her (I wasn't there), one of the dogs did get onto him and sat on him and was going to bite him, now the same dog and some other almost attacked him again, luckily there were people around who got the dogs away.  My friends have also been almost attacked multiple times by these dogs, I really don't think it's safe to have them around	NULL
Hi I love you	NULL
alot of animals go through shit and are not unnecessarily aggressive. By your logic people shouldn't defend themselves, so if someone comes and tries to murder me I should let them murder me because if I fight back that's apparently way more messed up	NULL
I define "attacking" as literally jumping on top of you and biting you and holding you in a lock jaw. Tearing at your skin and flesh etc. If they're just barking then that's all they're going to do. It's not going to escalate beyond that. Barking and chasing is not attacking. Befriend them like I said. Prove to them you're not an enemy.  If you fail to do that and that ends up in the dogs getting poisoned or captured and dumped in the desert (which will kill them either way), that will be on you and their blood and souls will be on your hands. I'm not religious but if you are, god will hold you to account for that.	NULL

I mean, if they're not aggressive to people they are definitely aggressive to pets, befriending them will work however it won't fix the issue with the rest of the pets. I really do not want to kill them honestly but if my dog does get bit or if anything happens to him, I will do something about it.

I am also a footballer and i can relate to what you want. I played in 4th tier and was in Ahly my whole childhood.  Actually your level decides everything.   Were you playing in a professional or semi professional or amateur?  Which tier league were you playing in England?  Do you have videos and that stuff?  Here in Egypt there are four tiers, The First and second are professional tiers and third and fourth are the semi and amateur ones.  If you are professional i think finding an agent is the first step to take and he will do the rest. (please find a good one)  If you are semi or amateur you have to get to know coaches from Facebook Groups of 3rd and 4th tiers. they make trials every now and then. And if you know friends here who can help that would be good.  In 4th tier, 80% of teams there will want you to pay for your expenses the whole season. (Thats the bad part here).  In 3rd tier, like 30% do same thing.  Pm me if you want any time	NULL

Well I will call you a disgusting person if you do something to those dogs, even if they were to bite your dog. They're animals. They're following their instincts. It's not like they want to be a dick to your dog. They were there first and their ancestors roamed Egypt for thousands of years. It's their home and their environment. Nobody forced you to get a dog and you'e not entitled to your area being free of baladis.  If you don't want your dog to get bitten then follow my advice or avoid their territory. And contact your closest TNR organisation to at least get them neutered so they don't increase in number.	NULL

I used to work as a junior orthopedic surgeon at a  governmental hospital and we were told by ours seniors that scans and X-rays done in emergency settings were property of the hospital and were not to be printed or given to the patient on discharge. “If they want a printed scan then they should do it in a different place”. I never asked why or looked for where in the “lay7a” it says so but that is some weird rule imho. My only guess is, given that governmental hospitals do these scans for free, you cannot obtain them (people might want to go to the ER with fake symptoms just to get a printed CT which is very expensive) and they were done for diagnostic purposes and are accessed exclusively by the medical team in that hospital. However, if you paid for them, then legally you have the right to take a print of it. I hope this gives some insight.	NULL

الله يفك عنك الهم و الزعل. الله يقويك و يصبرك. I too have gone through a mentally tough time and I felt that the only thing that helped get rid of the black thoughts were 3 main things:  - Trying to focus on the present moment. I stopped thinking about tomorrow completely. Didn’t try to expect anything. I just lived with today in mind and nothing else. It sure lifted a lot of black thoughts and anxiety related to the unknown future. - Trying to focus on the positives. There sure are a lot of negative things in this world, but you can chose to avoid them and navigate your way through them by always staying positive and keeping your focus on what you have, not what you don’t. Be grateful every little thing. - trying to keep myself busy. Often, we find ourselves sad and depressed when we have the time to analyze the situation and think about all the bad. Sometimes even, we overthink to the point where we start to make up negatives that don’t even exist (that’s an extreme). So just keep yourself busy, and don’t let your brain have time to dwell on the difficulties and the sad parts.   Finally, remember that everything is only momentarily present. It all has an end. One day, you’ll look back and realize that it was indeed, all short	other

Thank you for your reply.  The emergency was for a suspected heart attack, everything seems to point at that, i had and currently am still having symptoms matching with this condition.  he ordered a CT scan, after finishing the test and waiting for results, he comes to me, telling me i don't have a heart attack and when i and dad ask about the scan, he mentions he "didn't" ask for it, and goes to "see" it and debrief us, he does some things with his hands and stethoscope, then tells me the same thing, adding that i "**probably**" have inflammation in the pleura around the lungs or some muscles.  When we asked to merely see the scan results, he said **no**.  Given me diclofenac, and was sent home.  I took it at night and stayed up for some time, my hands got uncomfortably cold, it is cold in Egypt but my fingers never got this much, and after this long uncomfortable coldness i get a **severe** spike in pain and fingers in my left hand start tingling, like it doesn't have oxygen because of hyperventilating.  I check, and diclofenac increases risk of heart attacks for **normal** people... Let alone me.  I am taking blood tests to confirm this myself today.  What are your thoughts about this whole situation?	NULL
Can confirm, but I used to give it to patients anyways. I think you might be able to get it if you ask some one who is kind or you can ask to take a picture of it on your mobile. A high quality picture is very sufficient for diagnosis.	NULL

It is just not a good movie. Away from the cast and everything, a really really bad “Netflix” movie just like almost all their originals. I also think they tried going for the “Netflix” vibe and the movie became x10 time worse as it became weirder to watch than sex education. I’m not sure if they thought being open and sexual made the movie international and/or cool but some things just felt like it was pressured.  I was against filtered movies because they don’t properly portray reality but while the movie had a good spark of showing friends realistically on what they’d do together, it just lost it and I’m not an expert to tell you how and why exactly but it just felt pressured in some aspects and is just a bad movie imo.

Brother, I hope you get well soon. Usually diagnosing a heart attack (and any medical condition) is best done by a physician who has taken your medical history (asked questions about your condition) + examined you + did tests (including labs and imaging).  If you are not comfortable with your doctors management then you have every right to find a different doctor/hospital’s consultation. I really hope you feel better soon.  And please know that the first thing a doctor will try his/her best to exclude in a patient with chest pain is a heart attack, and you are allowed to ask him on what basis was this diagnosis excluded and on what basis did his diagnosis made.  Finally, I want you to know that nearly 100% of doctors working in governmental hospitals are Burned out and are being crushed by the unimaginable amount of patients that they have to care for everyday. So getting time to actually explain what is going on to a patient with all the details of your condition is very difficult.  P.S: I still insist that understanding your condition from your doctor is your right 100%. And your experience in this hospital makes me feel sad for anyone who has to go through this.  Lots of love, brother.	NULL

What kind of improvement layman like me enjoys? Or made his life better?  Since his unblessed coming virtually everything is getting much worse. 1- No opposition to his grand holy commands (i.e there is absolutely no way to correct the path except him deciding otherwise). I liked to follow some highly educated successful mannered businessman called omar elshinqity, but because he had opinions (even tho didn't attack sisi namely, but anyone coming near to government performance must be silenced even tho it's both HIS OWN county and HIS DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE)  2- fuel which is literally everything is dependant upon gets unclear raises in prices with no clear explanation, which makes everything hell more expensive from transportation to food, so any errands or regular commute is now expensive  3- education is well-known for developing countries. I saw and appreciate the initiative that ICT is providing, but they are really limited in numbers and only targeting CS and engineering majors  4- the amount of insane taxes on pretty much everything. I fear that they know that people shit regularly and they well introduce shit tax  Each day passes with me in that country I lose hope, when I see mosg of the brightest minds no longer stand being in that shit hole and it's becoming more and more difficult to get a good education to excel in whatever area you are studying.

Well in between 15 years and 2050, Alexandria, half the Nile Delta, Port Said, Port Fouad, and many parts of the north coast are going to be under the sea. 40% of Egyptian industry is in the governorate of Alexandria. Over 40 million people live in the Nile Delta which is also home to many industries and has some of the country's most productive arable lands. Many of the coral reefs in Dahab have already died or have bleached. Our winters are getting shorter. Our summers are getting longer and hotter and more humid. Sea temperatures are rising. Bird and insect populations are collapsing (and they're very important for our survival). The mango season in Ismailia last year failed before it even started. Changing climate is already putting many stresses on Egyptian agriculture. More extreme weather events are becoming more frequent.  So sooner or later, the climate is going to force you to "shut the fuck up" whether you like it or not.  And enjoy suspension ;)	NULL

Currency is 1$=15.6 EGPs so nothing really that big and inflation is bad here but not to the point that were dying and political we are politically Excellent we achieved everything we wanted last year except shooting the Ethiopia dam(until now we dunno what's the gov wanting to do with the dam but I trust the gov so it doesn't look that bad) and for enemies our only enemy was always Israel and sometimes turkey and Qatar tho thankfully we are tied with Israel in some gas exports so we are both making money together and we did help with making peace between them so we good and turkey and Qatar as expected fell wanting us to help them as turkey is failing financially and Qatar is failing politically and militarily and overall life here is better than ever getting better everyday and the government launching human rights programs and increasing rightful laws and giving people the freedom of religion finally and ofc overall they are replacing the whole county's rotten infrastructure and replacing with new pipes, cables,internet cables all and all and they are making a data center here to drastically increase internet speeds, ofc we are working in all sides, in health we are spending a lot on health and building new clean modern hospitals for rural areas+adding every basic need and extra need to rural areas, banning unsafe unauthorized vehicles that had been used in the streets and was the cause of death of hundreds of people over the years eg:tuktuks, and overall everything and I mean everything is improving, ofc police and law enforcement only had shitty old Chevrolet and Isuzu trucks and some weird Honda bikes, now upgraded to mercedes vans, Toyota land cruiser 70LX, and jeeps and overall better law enforcement gadgets tools and they are more responsive now and are starting to be more easy going and to become more human and ofc now you have privacy rights and property rights and not anyone could scare you anymore, and unemployment rates dropped Skyfalling from 40% to 6% probably those 6% are unregistered jobs or Uber drivers, taxi drivers and some actual unemployed ppl, anyway if you look at Egypt we are working everywhere to fix everything because centuries of colonials and corrupt leaders have really made this place a mess but everything is being fixed and ofc our army has drastically improved to the point that we are becoming an elite power in every military branch and basically there are no situations in Egypt not many or there is no problem that isn't being improved so if you ask me what is the problem here?

I liked to follow some highly educated successful mannered businessman called omar elshinqity, but because he had opinions (even tho didn't attack sisi namely, but anyone coming near to government performance must be silenced even tho it's both HIS OWN county and HIS DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE)  That's a huge overstatement. If you follow news about the parliament, you'd find MPs trashing ministers in every session and calling them for questioning even Kamel el Wazir. Sisi also has an [advisory council](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A_%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1) made from world renowned experts in each field plus his own personal advisors. Even on media, there was this economics expert who appeared on al qahira w nas who kept trashing government's economic performance even though he was using incorrect metrics out of context (he was later corrected). He wasn't touched. There many like him. Watch MP ضياء الدين داوود on el Hekaya and look how he criticized the government and the parliament with Amr Adeeb trying to swerve the conversation. Look up the video of the youth who disrespected the governor of Aswan of being a liar in front of Sisi and then Sisi took this guy and the governor to check if he's truly being lied to.  I don't know about Omar el Shinqity but if he's anything similar in accomplishments and experience to those then please tell me what he's done to compare. I'd like to learn.  &#x200B;  >2- fuel which is literally everything is dependant upon gets unclear raises in prices with no clear explanation, which makes everything hell more expensive from transportation to food, so any errands or regular commute is now expensive  Fuel is raised [according to](https://www.petroleum.gov.eg/ar-eg/media-center/news/news-pages/Pages/mop_08102021_01.aspx) international oil prices and climate. This is done by using some sort of equation or algorithm that's internationally agreed upon as far as I know.  &#x200B;  >3- education is well-known for developing countries. I saw and appreciate the initiative that ICT is providing, but they are really limited in numbers and only targeting CS and engineering majors        4- the amount of insane taxes on pretty much everything. I fear that they know that people shit regularly and they well introduce shit tax  That's because the ICT sector including CS, Data Science, Engineering, Digital Marketing, etc. is the future and the world is facing a shortage of those majors due to its sudden boom so it's actually a pretty good step especially in preparing independent freelancers since freelancing curriculum is included in the initiative. That will help immensely in job creation especially for those who can't find work.  Taxes aren't out of the ordinary when considering any other country. We're just used to get a service much cheaper than what it's worth and that contributed to the unsustainability of our public services and it's the reason why they're old and dilapidated.  I don't get your comparison with the occupation. Those people although I hate to say but they work hard and smart from the moment they occupied Palestine. They built their economy right. They have the full support of the US. They put aside any internal differences for the sake of their state. The opposite of us. We wanted the state to feed us and educate us, and that's what Mubarak did. We didn't care about how the country was faring as long as we were fed and clothed. That's what brought us to this point in the first place.  Most people lose hope before even checking if what they know are facts or just misinformation. The country is experiencing genuine change. In the end, it's up to you to believe in it or not.	NULL

Will try my best to answer this as simply and as concisely as possible.  So in 1250, the Mamluks (a caste of slave soldiers) overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk Sultanate.  This lasted until 1517 when Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. However, the Mamluks remained a powerful group that still retained control over much of political, social, and cultural life in Egypt.  Then the French invaded in 1789 and occupied the country until 1801. Along the military campaign was also a French scientific expedition who were the ones that rediscovered many of the first ancient Egyptian antiquities, most significantly the Rosetta Stone. It was them who took a particular interest in all the ancient monuments and temples. It was during these years that the field of Egyptology was born. Ancient Egypt was a completely forgotten civilisation before this, even by Egyptians.  Muhammed Ali Pasha was an Albanian-Ottoman general brought in to help expel the French. In 1801, this was achieved with help from the British Empire. This was how the Rosetto Stone (and many other Egyptian antiquities) changed hands from the French to the British and is why it now stands in the British Museum, along with the rest of the Egyptian exhibition.  The French occupation weakened the Mamluks and there was a power vacuum in Egypt. Muhammed Ali Pasha seized this as an opportunity to take Egypt for himself and engaged in a power struggle with the Mamluks. He was appointed as "Wali" (or viceroy) of Egypt in 1805.  Then in 1811, Muhammed Ali Pasha consolidated his power by inviting all the Mamuk leaders to the Cairo Citadel for a celebration dinner and slaughtered them all.  He then pretty much broke Egypt away from the Ottoman Empire and ruled it independently as his own kingdom and established his own hereditary dynasty which lasted until 1952. He is regarded as the founder of Modern Egypt due to the political, economic, and military reforms he pursued. This was when the modern Egyptian military as we know it today was first established. It was also the beginning of military conscription of Egyptian men.  During his rule, he conquered Sudan, the Levant, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He died in 1848.  The Egyptian military officer corps was restricted to native Egyptians and Sudanese and was only accessible to Egyptians of Turkish and Circassian origins. This changed during the rule of Khedive Ismail Pasha (1863-1879) when he opened the military's ranks to all Egyptians and Sudanese.  This paved the way for Ahmed Orabi, an Egyptian officer of peasant origins, to rise through the ranks to become colonel.  A combination of factors including the Suez Canal, the Egyptian-Ethiopian War, and the massive amounts of debt that Ismail Pasha owed to major European powers led to increasing British and French influence in the country. This culminated in his removal in 1879 by the British, being replaced with Tewfik Pasha.  Orabi opposed this and launched an uprising that became known as the Orabi Revolt which lasted until 1882. This led to the Anglo-Egyptian War which led to the British conquest of Egypt. The British would occupy Egypt in one way or another until 1956.  Actually, I'm kind of tired now. I'll continue this later.	NULL

We do have a chance, even if Queiroz is still there (hopefully he’s not there somehow) but senegal has been awful in the AFCON so if we hopefully get a nice lead in advantage in Egypt we can go to Dakar and defend this lead. To do this we need a real winning spirit from the players and we need to swtich back to 4231 and get back TAREK HAMED. Those are not the type of games you want to be going into without Tarek.

اول حاجه انا بقولك جيشي كان في رفح لو عايز تعرف حاجه اسأل و انا هاجوبك علي قد ما قدر .  تاني حاجه العملية سيرلي علي حسب كلام المجلة هو ان مصر استخدمت طائرة استطلاع فرنسيه حديثه غير متوافر مثيل لها في مصر وقتها في عملية استطلاع علي الحدود الليبية و المجلة بتقول ان مصر استخدمت المعلومات دي في استهداف " المهربين " ده اللفظ الي استخدموه لوصفهم قالوا عليهم  المهربين المدنيين و الي كانوا جايين من ليبيا وقت انهيار الدولة هناك و سيطرة متطرفين علي درنة و بعض مناطق بنغازي و بالمناسبه المتحدث العسكري كان بيعلن عن قصف عربيات المهربين و كان بينزل فيدوهات قصفهم .  يعني هما مش " مدنيين" و لا اللفظ المضحك بتاع "مهربين مدنيين" زي ما المجلة كتبت انما هما مهربين بس	other

قصة الفيلم واضح انها حاجة متاح انها تتعمل من اكتر من دولة بدليل انها اتعملت بالنسخ دي:  2016 - اليونان \\ 2017 - اسبانيا \\ 2018 - تركيا \\ 2018 - الهند \\ 2018 - فرنسا \\ 2018 - كوريا \\ 2018 - هنجاريا \\ 2018 - المكسيك \\ 2018 - الصين \\ 2019 - روسيا \\ 2019 - ارمينيا \\ 2019 - بولدنا \\ 2019 - المانيا \\ 2020 - فييتنام \\ 2021 - اليابان \\ 2021 - رومانيا \\ 2021 - هولندا \\ 2021 - اسرائيل \\ 2021 - التشيك \\ 2021 - سلوفيكيا \\ 2022 - العربي بتاعنا. و لسة في نسخ في الانتاج منها الامريكية. المصدر: [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfetti\_sconosciuti](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfetti_sconosciuti)  اللي شاف الفيلم بأي نسخة تانية غير العربي قبل ما يشوف دا مش حيعجبه اوي زي ما اي حد حيشوف فيلم معمول بنسختين عشان حيكون عارف القصة مسبقاً و غصب عنه حيكون بيقارن.  ممكن اتفق في ان تنفيذ النسخة العربي ما كانش فيه ابداع من ناحية عمل و تنفيذ الافكار نفسها بس بنكهة عربية او قضايا عربية اكتر. دا مش معناه ان القضايا اللي بيناقشها الفيلم مش موجودة عندنا او في كل مكان عموما.  الفكرة ان تسليط الضوء على مشاكل او حاجات موجودة بس متدارية او بنتعامل معاها بنظام: بص الناحية التانية و تجاهل الموضوع, دا بيخلي الناس تتضايق و تهجم و احتمال كبير تنكر المشكلة من اساسها.  في فيلم اسمه Old Boy ليه كمان نسختين, امريكية و كورية (الاصلية), نفس المشكلة حتكون موجودة لو شفت واحدة قبل التانية (انصح بالنسخة الكورية عشان افضل و اقوى) و الفيلم كمان بيطرح افكار و مشاكل ممكن تكون "فجة" او "مش مقبولة" مثلا.  خلاصة الموضوع: اللي حياخد فيلم كمرجع ليه في الحياة و يطلع منه باسلوب حياة حيكون غلطان عشان الافلام دي بطبيعتها هي قصة متلمعة و متصورة كويس و بتطلع بالشكل دا عشان ناس عاوزاها تطلع بالشكل دا. في افلام بتخلينا نفكر, في افلام بتخلينا نتضايق و نفرح. الفيلم لو عرف يفصلك لمدة ثانية عن انه فيلم و يخليك تتعاطف مع اي شخصية او قصة فيه بيكون نجح. بس القصة الأهم و اللي مافيش فيلم اتعملها هي: قصتك انت, اللي انت عايشها, اللي انت بتكتبها و بتكمل فيها (كليشيه شوية بس دا الواقع)	other

You should work on not only your physical art but also you should "electronize" it. Learn designing methods on computer and gradually you'll be able to apply your art there. If you master both it will help you find a job. Not only Egypt, but everywhere else this would apply. The future needs this.  My cousin graduated from fine arts. She had incredible drawing skills. But throughout uni she studied a lot of graphic designing and took tens of courses, now she's a senior 3D designer at a social media company. She uses her art skills to brainstorm ideas on paper then applies it to 3D designing program. So that's the experience is saw.	NULL

Best advice I got while spending my military service , especially if the leave policy is shit and you don’t get to see home for a long time ..is to try not to remember anything about your life outside of your unit. What this does is basically get you to find other ways to pass the time, you can go ahead and try to talk to other recruits ( idk if you’re a reserve officer or a conscripted soldier) but I’ll assume you’re a conscript , try to start conversations by lending someone a cigarette or inviting another recruit to enjoy a snack with you get to know where they’re from & what they do for a living and start sharing stories during your free time or when you’re on guard duty.. you’ll build relationships and those can be helpful , let’s say you make friends with a driver and when you  have a long distance walk they can offer you a ride, or let’s say they work in the mess hall (kitchen), they can pick the freshest bread for you when it’s you’re meal break.  Some units allow books and it gets easier to let things pass through inspection the more familiar and senior you get, reading can be a great pass time and an opportunity to learn new skills when you have a lot of free time.  If your unit is large and has agricultural fields you can take a nice walk around and start exploring locations and places where you can find fresh vegetables... my friends and I used to walk around and we discovered some fields that grow tomatoes and peppers we picked some and grabbed some basil leaves from a garden nearby and asked a friend of ours that worked in the mess hall to give us two uncooked chickens and we had nice bbq party in a secluded area away from the eyes of the military police and guards, we used to run across fig trees as well.  Just try to find ways to entertain yourself but whatever you do , don’t start calling your friends, girlfriend/fiancée all the time and be clingy because that way it won’t be fun you’ll just feel and sound lonelier and they will just feel sorry for you.

أنا مش عايز اقول رأيي الشخصي علشان حضرتك عايز كلام موضوعي. فأهم و أول معيار لقياس النمو الاقتصادي هو اجمالي الناتج المحلي GDP. و ده في مصر حاليا بيزيد حوالين ٥% سنويا. يعني زي الدول العظمى. لكن الرقم ده ممكن جدا يكون خادع لأن فيه معايير تانية بتأثر في اقتصاد الدول و مستوى المعيشة للأفراد.  ممكن حضرتك تبص بصة هنا https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032515/what-are-best-measurements-economic-growth.asp و لو راجعنا معايير زي مستوى التضخم و حجم الانفاق و الدين العام بالاضافة لمعاير التنمية البشرية HDI هتلاقي اجابة سؤالك. اللي هي لا احنا مش عالطريق الأفضل لينا للأسف.	other

اسمع منى يا شنب 😅  طبعا بعد ما نتفق انه اه و لا زى تعليق هنا عجبنى.   مبدئيا كده بعد تشغيل مخك و حياديه تامة عندك احد الحاجات و اهمها هو التاريخ و حرفيا التاريخ بيعيد نفسه و زى ما الناس و المؤرخين اخدوا على هتلر و نابليون عدم مراجعه التاريخ و الاستفاده منه. فالمختصر المفيد :  مصر حاليا مش ماشيه صح ابدا و لكن فى نفس الوقت هى من اكتر الدول الواعده فى المنطقة و هتبقى عاجلا ام اجلا احد اهم الدول المحورية فى العالم، الفكرة بقى و ده بالتاريخ برضوا ان و لا انا و لا انت هنحضر الفترة القوية بتاعت مصر غالبا كده بنتكلم فى ٥٠-٧٠ سنة و ده فى تاريخ الشعوب يعتبر قليل و لكن بالنسبة لينا احفادنا بقى ان شاء الله يبقى يحضروا الكلام ده.   زى من المؤكد برضوا ان دول الخليج عاجلا ام اجلا هتقع  و هتبقى مصر هى اللى بتسلفهم زى زمان بالظبط و ايران هتظهر تانى على الساحة و هتغطى على المنطقة ديه كلها و مش شرط من خلال حرب بس كفايه اقتصاديا و شكرا على كده	other
هو الناس على الانترنت مش مقياس (أو اتمنى) بس انا متفق معاك.  الموضوع بيبدأ بصدمة وتلاقي ناس رافضة وبتهاجم ومع توالي الصدمات الناس المؤيدة بتزيد واللي كان رافض بدأ يتعود على كده ويتعمل عليه ميمز ويطلع في التليفزيون وحرفيا  "إِنَّ لِلَّهِ عِبَادًا يُمِيتُونَ الْبَاطِلَ بِهَجْرِهِ، وَيُحْيُونَ الْحَقَّ بِذِكْرِهِ" جملة حكيمة جدا وانا لية واخد بالي اني عملت العكس.  المهم احنا دلوقتي عايشين في دنيا مزفلطة كده... الصح والغلط معروفين بس الناس بتدافع عن الغلط بطريقة غريبة والصح بيتهاجم وبيتقال عليه انه غلط وحاجة اخر قلة أدب.  حتى لو افترضنا ان في الجيل بتاعنا (أو بعضنا) طلعنا عارفين الصح والغلط وبنحاول يعني احنا مش ملائكة بس بنحاول... انت متخيل الاجيال القادمة التي ستنشأ وسط القرف ده هايحصل فيها ايه؟	other

لا بجد انت استحالة تكون فوق ال ١٨ و هقولك ليه، فيه حاجة اسمها leverage دى كدا حاجة زى لما واحد فقير يقدم على شغلانة بيلبس بدلة ايجار مع انه مش عارف هيتقبل ولا لا بس بيدفع فلوسها ، بس على الدول بقى، فى المفاوضات كم الاسلحة و تطورها بيعكس قوة الدولة فى الصمود و وضعها السياسى، امريكا كله بيسمعلها عشان حاجتين، الميزانية فى الجيش و صندوق النقد العام اللى بيحصل فيه استثمارات الدول كلها، ردا على البوست بتاعك من اسبوع فى نفس الكومت خد بالك، الدين بتاعك غير الدول لأن الدول مش زيك، انا معايا ٣٠ جنيه و فيه موبايل عاوز اجيبه ب ٥٠ جنيه ف كدا انا فقير مقدرش اجيبه، الدول بتبقى معاها ٣ جنيه و بتشترى تليفون ب الف جنيه لأن مش هى اللى بتدفع اصلا، واحد صاحبه بياخد نسبة من التليفون و واحد تانى بياخد نسبة تانية و هكذا، دا ردا على البوست الاول  لما دول تدخل البحر المتوسط و تفرد دفاعها البحرى دا بيبين ضعفك و بيبين للمستثمرين عدم قدرتك فى انك تبقى مستقر، الاسلحة انت مش ناوى تستخدمها بس عالاقل لازم تبين للى جاى حاطط فلوسه انك تمام و لو حاربت مش هيأثر لأن دفاعك قوى و لو الحرب طولت عندك قابلية تكمل و مش هتأثر على اقتصاد دولتك تشترى اسلحة و بكدا الخطط المالية بتبقى ثابتة فى الحالات الطارئة   قعد كدا متفكرش فى الدولة زى المصروف بتاعك	NULL

رأيي الشخصي اولا مصر دوله فقيره اقتصاديا مفيش الموارد اللي تخليها تقدم نظام تعليمي وصحي زي اوروبا مثلا ولكن فيه بداية تغيير علي قد الامكانيات .. واظن طارق شوقي كوزير تعليم ماشي في الطريق السليم مش وحش ابدا رغم مقاومة الناس الشديده للتغيير ده .. بالنسبه للصحه فهي مازالت مضروبه بالصرمه ثانيا مصر عندها المقومات انها تتغير وتكبر اقتصاديا لو لجأت لانها تصنع وتنتج تكنولوجيا .. تصدير المنتجات الغذائيه ودخل قناة السويس والسياحه غير كافيين ابدا انها تعيش دوله تعداد سكانها ١٠٥ مليون عيشة اوروبا .. وفي النقطه دي فيها حاجه مهمه ناقصانا وهي العماله الفنيه المدربه وده عائق امام انشاء مصانع علي مستوي تكنولوجي متقدم وده بيرجعنا تاني لنقطة التعليم.  ثالثا اعتقد ان مصر دلوقتي بيتعمل فيها شغل كويس من ناحية البنيه التحتيه والتوجه الرقمي والتوسع الافقي بإنشاء مدن جديده بدلا من التكدس في وادي النيل اللي اكل الرقعه الزراعيه تماما ولكن ده احنا مش هنحس بالتغيير ده دلوقتي فيها علي الاقل ١٠ سنين كمان او جايز اكتر رابعا التطور اللي بيشهده الجيش المصري دلوقتي مهم جدا وبيبرز مصر كقوه في المنطقه قادره علي حماية اقتصادهاوامنها القومي واظن ده بالفعل اتي بثماره وبدانا نحس بيه في الصراع علي غاز شرق المتوسط وترسيم الحدود البحريه اللي طلعت منها تركيا من غير حاجه وتامين الحدود الغربيه مع ليبيا والسيطره علي الوضع في سيناء خامسا محدش يقولي انت بتطبل للنظام عشان مفتحش كرشه .. دي مجرد وجهة نظر	NULL

من المفارقات المضحكة أن المجتمع المصري بطبعة متدين أو يحب أن يعتقد أنه متدين وبالتالي لستة حقوق الإنسان الي الغرب كل شوية بيحبو يطالبوا بيها التي لن تخلو من حقوق الشواذ و للمثليين و المتحولين جنسياً لن تتقبلها جموع الناس أضف أن مجتمع ولاطول فترة كان أقصي علاقته بالسياسة أنه ياخد زجاجة زيت بعد ما يصوت مش هيهتم بحاجة زي الحقوقيين و النشطاء السياسيين .  ملحوظة: بريطانيا اية من شعر تقريبا مسلمة صاحب موقع ويكيليك لأمريكا تسليم أهالي عشان يترزع حكم فوق الميت سنة . نفس الدول الراعية لحقوق الإنسان هي أكثر الدول انتهاكا لها . ده مش دفاع عن السيسي ولكن الواقع الي احنا عايشين فيه	NULL

No dude. Don't worry. You have lived in the GCC all your life which means you're not "moqeem" in Egypt. When you go back to Egypt, you can leave again without any military papers for 6 months. All they have to see in your passport when you're departing is the date of the last entry stamp. If it's less than 6 months, they won't ask for ta2geel or izn safar. You can renew your passport and then go back to the GCC. Just remember to take your old passport to the airport. Just do not under any circumstances stay in Egypt for more than 6 months, otherwise you will need to go to the military to process your paperwork.  However, being 28, it's pretty much a 97% chance of you getting another ta2geel anyway. Although, freak incidents do happen. But the 6 month scenario I'm talking about is bullet proof.	NULL

هي في الطريق الصحيح. مش هنبقي اوروبا في ١٠ سنين بس هنبقي احسن كتير من الاحنا كنا فيه. مفروض فيه نظام تامين صحي يتم العمل عليه لكل المواطنين و دي خطوة اجابية جدا و الحكومة معتمدة علي القطاع الخاص لانشاء المستشفيات و العيادات و  يقدر المواطن يتعالج بتامين الصحي المعمول ليه. كل مؤشرات الاقتصادية بتقول ان مصر ماشية في الطريق الصحيح و ان مصر من اكتر الدول الattractive للمستثمرين في العالم. الحاجة الناقصة من وجهة نظري ان الحكومة تمكن القطاع الخاص بدل ما هي بتعتمد بشكل كبير علي الشركات الحكومية و الجيش و الحكومة عندها توجه بانها تدعم القطاع الخاص بانها تغير قوانين و تقلل البيروقراطية. بالنسبة للمواطن انا شايف ان موضوع الحد ادني للمرتبات في القطاع الخاص و مبادرة الحياة الكريمة جزء مهم اوي لتحسين الوضع. الحاجة الي مش هتختلف  كتير هي حقوق حرية الراي	other

Dude , it's almost impossible to prove martial rape , especially that most women who report it are lying to get revenge or get leverage in divorce . As for harrasment you can't prove it because it depends on witnesses , even if the woman convinced the strangers on the street to come with here to testify in the police station , they can just pay another witness to cancel the others , the same goes for any crime that depends on witnesses . We didn't have these problems before the wave degeneracy hit us in the 70s. , Women are walking around in tight and revealing clothes , sexually provoking men and teens , then they complain when some of them react .

هو من اللي شفته الناس متضايقة لأنه جديد عليهم انه الافكار و المواضيع دي بتتعرض بالعربي لأنه تعودنا انه الحاجات دي بتبقى معروضة عادي في افلام الغرب بسبب اختلاف الثقافات و العادات و كدة.  اللي اقصده انه الحاجات دي مع انها فعلا بتحصل في مجتماعاتنا على عكس ما بعض الناس فاكرة الا انه اكثر انتشارا في الغرب و اكثر انتشارا انه الواحد يقدر يتكلم عنهم عادي جدا، و ده اللي من وجهة نظري مضايق الناس لأنهم ضد الافكار دي و مش عاوزينها تتنشر في مجتماعاتنا فبالتالي بيحاربوها.  حاجات زي مثلا المثلية مثلا اللي منتشرة على Netflix اللي بيتعرض عليها الفيلم و ده من الحاجات اللي معروفة انه ناس كثيرة من الوطن العربي ضده، نفس الكلام مع الالحاد، اما موضوع الخمور فده موضوع تاني لأنه اصلا موجود عادي في افلامنا و مسلسلاتنا من زمان لحد دلوقتي، دي الافكار اللي سمعت انها موجودة في الفيلم، انا اصلا متفرجتش عليه ولا عاوز اتفرج عليه  اللي بقى استغربته من صياح بعض الناس انه في ناس من اللي بيتكلموا عاملين اشتراك من زمان على نتفليكس لحد ما الفيلم ده نزل و لغوه، اللي هو يعني انت سبت sex education و elite و غيرهم و جيت عند الفيلم ده و وقفت سواء اتفرجت على الحاجات التانية او لا، انا اقصد هنا اللي بيتكلموا على اساس انه فاتح Netflix علشان يتفرج على احمد ديدات	NULL

صباح الخير ده مقال نشرته امبارح عن الفيلم —/——————————————————- عندما يمد طفلك الصغير يده ليمسك بشئ ملوث أو قذر من على الأرض على الفور تقول له "يع" أو "كخ" وهي بالمناسبة من كلمات اللغة العربية الفصحى وتستخدم لزجر الصبي عن أمر خاطئ ..ويبدو أن الفنانة منى زكى تحتاج حاليا إلى من يقول لها ذلك بعد أن تصاغرت فنيا و قررت أن تشارك فى عمل ملوث من انتاج شبكة "نت فليكس"..الفيلم انطلق يوم 20 يناير الماضى تحت اسم "أصحاب ولا أعز" وكان الاسم المناسب للفيلم هو "أصحاب ولا أع " لأن كل أبطال الفيلم المفترض أنهم أصدقاء العمر يرتكبون أفعال شائنة لا يسعك ألا أن تقول عليها سوى "أع" و "يع" وكل ما نقوله على تلك الأشياء التي تثير الشعور بالقرف من تلك العلاقات الغير سوية التي اجتمعت جميعها بين مجموعة صغيرة من الأصدقاء الذين يعيشون في لبنان ..        منى زكي تخرج علينا بدور زوجة سكيرة تخون زوجها على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعى وصديقهم الآخر يخون زوجته مع زوجة أعز اصدقائه وابنة الصديقة الأخرى ذات الـ18 عاما تكتشف الأم أنها على علاقة جنسية بشاب آخر وعندما تخبر زوجها بالأمر يرفض الأب تعنيف الابنة بدعوى أنها حرة تفعل ما تشاء واخيرا يظهر علينا صديقهم الشاذ جنسيا ويتم تقديمه على أساس أنه ضحية المجتمع العربي الرافض لفكرة شذوذه ويتعرض بسببه للظلم والطرد من عمله وسخرية من حوله أما صديقه المصرى"إياد نصار" فيقف الى جانبه ويدعمه .. بالطبع لايخفى على أحد أن نشر ثقافة الشذوذ الجنسي وتقبله فى المجتمعات البشرية هو أحد الأهداف الواضحة لمنصة "نت فليكس" منذ انطلاقها عام 1997        ..العام الماضى صرحت منى زكى أنها اكتشفت انه لا يوجد ما يسمى بـ سينما نظيفة وسينما «مبقعة» وأن هذا المصطلح أطلقه المنتجون وكانت هى صغيرة وقتها واقتنعت به ولكنها اكتشفت بعد ذلك أنه مفهوم خاطئ مؤكدة أن مصطلح السينما النظيفة عطلها فنيا كثيرا وجعلها ترفض أدوارا جيدة ستكون علامة فارقة في مشوارها..انتهت تصريحات منى زكي وهى فنانة مميزة بلا شك لكن مشاركتها فى هذا العمل لا أعتقد أنه سيكون علامة فارقة فى مشوارها الفنى بل هى وصمة سيئة لتقديمها عملا فنيا فى اعتقادى هو أسوأ من أفلام المقاولات التى كان يتم إنتاجها وتصويرها في لبنان خلال ستينيات القرن الماضى من أجل المال ..        نحن لا ننتقد منى زكي لأنها تجردت من براءتها المعهودة في أعمالها الفنية السابقة و لا لأنها قدمت الشخصية بجرأة في الصورة وفي الألفاظ ولكن لأن الأفكار الخاطئة و المنبوذة في المجتمع العربي مثل الشذوذ الجنسي وحرية ممارسة الجنس خارج إطار الزواج تم تقديمها فى فيلمها بشكل يدعم ويشجع تلك الأفكار بدلا من إنكارها ونبذها وتلك السينما ليس هنا هدفها تقديم فن راقى أو حل مشكلة ما أو طرح الواقع ولكنها هنا سينما لتغيير الأفكار حول أمور هى مدمرة فى الأساس للمجتمعات البشرية ..        بالطبع لمنى زكى الحق فى تقديم سينما نظيفة أو "مبقعة" لكن عندما تشارك فى أعمال فنية هدفها تمرير عادات ملوثة وسيئة والدفاع عنها تحت باب الحرية الفنية هنا يجب أن نقف أمامها ونقول لها "كخ" يا منى و "يع" يا منى.        خارج المقال        ما يحدث من نقاش وجدال يحقق نجاح شبكة نت فليكس فى تحقيق اهدافها وهو جعل المجتمعات تتقبل اشياء لم تكن تتقبلها        نزّلها بكثافة في الأفلام والمسلسلات،        هيحصل normalization للشئ ده،        وشوية المجتمع هيقل رفضه للشئ ده وهيبدأ يتقبّله،        الأفلام والمسلسلات مش بتعكس الواقع،        الأفلام والمسلسلات بتشكّل الواقع،	other

انا مش هناقش محتوى الفيلم ولا هتكلم عن انه عادي او مش عادي  انا مل مشكلتي ان المصريين بيتعاملوا على ان الفيلم معمول ليهم هما بس و واخدين الموضوع بشكل شخصي جداً  الفيلم مافيهوش الا ممثلة واحدة مصرية. و القصة مش بتدور في مصر. و نتفلبكس مش منصة مصرية. و مقتبس من فيلم إيطالي. اغلبية صناع الفيلم مش مصريين.   و مع ذلك الناس زعلانه عشان ده ضد قيم الاسرة المصرية؟ ما كل سنة في الف فيلم بينزلوا فيهم بلاوي اكتر من كده. و في افلام عربية (مش مصرية) مليانة شذوذ و خرا كتير. اشمعنا ده اللي واخدينه على صدرهم كده زي مايكون إهانة ليهم؟ يعني عايز تزعل من منى زكي ازعل، هي عملت حاجة مثيرة للجدل في مجتمع زع مجتمعنا و تتحمل عواقب ده، انما ده في كلام عن رفع قضايا على الفيلم و مقاطعة الفيلم، ما تقاطعة يا اخي هو انت يعني بتشوف كل الافلام العالمية اللي بتنزل؟   كل الفكرة ان نتفليكس قرب الموضوع اكتر و قدروا يستفزوا ناس كتير بشكل الفيلم، انما اي حد عارف نتفليكس اكيد عارف ان في خرا اكتر من كده عليه، المشكلة ان دول بيتكلموا عربي بس.  الفيلم مش مصري. الفريق مش مصري. القصة مش في مجتمع مصري. خلينا في حالنا، مش هنكشي ننظر على اي فيلم فيه ممثل عربي و نشوف الفيلم ماشي مع مبادئنا ولا لت.

I once got some oranges from a grocery store near our home. Everything was fine, we ate all of them like they were normal oranges. I ate 1, but my mom loved them; so she ate 2 or 3.  The day after, my dad was hungry, and he went to eat. He saw the oranges in the kitchen, and because my mom thought they were great, my dad got them. He was eating his first one, when he saw random holes on the inside of the orange.  My dad paused, and looked inside it. He saw tens of very fat and disgusting, yellowish-white worms. My sad instantly threw the oranges in the trash, and warned everyone not to eat them again. He told my mom why (she instantly went tp the bathroom) but he didn't want to tell me.  I found out myself when I looked in the trash that the oranges were in, and saw hundreds of worms crawling on the oranges and the left over food that's in there.   That happend in 2010; its 2022 now, and I haven't had an orange since then.	NULL

المشكلة أننا بلد فقير بس اغبياء، عارف انت البلاد الفقيرة اللي بقت غنية في ٣٠ سنة زي ماليزيا و سنغافورة دول تتبعوا الدول الغنية في السياسات و  طرق التفكير، لكن مصر للاسف تعتقد أنها ام الدنيا و لذلك لا تريد تقليد الاخرين، يعني الاقتصاد بينتعش لو الجاليات المهاجرة لقت أحوالها احسن من البلد الام وده في أي نظام او بلد زي مثلا الجاليات الباكستانية والهندية في بريطانيا أو الجالية الصينية في امريكا، لأن ببساطة الجالية دي لتعبر عن حالة الانتعاش المعيشي في البلد و قوة اقتصادها لأنها استطاعت توفير حياة جيدة للمهاجرين وده بيجذب أي مستثمر، لكن الفقر عدو الذكاء و للاسف الاغبياء بيفكرو بطريقة ده هياخد شغلي، و عالعموم الدول الفقيرة مش فقيرة لندرة الموارد لكن لندرة الذكاء الاجتماعي، ولكن ام الدنيا طبعا هتبقى قد الدنيا اول ما المجرة كلها تنفجر و كلنا نبقى هباءا منثورا، تسلملي على عبناصر ابو كتاف عريضة و السادات ابو بايب يوحي بالحكمة ومبارك ابو علاء.

إجابة من واحد مش مصري (لكن هذا لا يعني الحياد):  مصر الآن قاعدة تطبق في برامج ومقترحات صندوق النقد الدولي، الي هي عادة تتمثل في تحرير المبادرة الاقتصادية الخاصة وتنقيص حجم القطاع العمومي، سواء كان هذا القطاع اجتماعي (يعني الدولة تصرف أقل على الحماية الاجتماعية للمواطنين) أو اقتصادي (يعني الدولة تخصخص شركاتها الأهلية).  عادة هذي البرامج تنتج نمو اقتصادي خاصة بفضل المستثمرين الأجانب (وهذا الي نشوفوه في مصر حاليا) ولكن في نفس الوقت تتسبب (على الأقل وقتيا) في تفقير المواطنين بسبب غلاء المعيشة وتناقص الحماية الاجتماعية. الفكر الاقتصادي الغالب يعتبر أن هذا الفقر مؤقت وأن النمو الاقتصادي هو الذي سيوفر الثراء للأمة.  يعني بهذه الرؤية مصر في الطريق الصحيح.   لكن بعض علماء الاقتصاد (خاصة التركي دارون آجام أغلو Daron Acemoglu) يعتبرون أن نموا اقتصاديا بهذا الشكل لا يمكن أن يتواصل مدة طويلة في ظل الإطار السياسي الحالي في مصر: حيث يؤدي التوزيع الغير عادل القوة السياسية لتوزيع غير عادل للقوة الاقتصادية، وتتكون طبقة قليلة من الفاعلين الاقتصاديين الذين يمنعون أي توزيع للثروة ويتنهون إلى تحاصص الاقتصاد ومقاومة أي تجديد فيه، وهو ما سينتهي بتعطيل عجلة النمو الاقتصادي. يعني لتلخيص الفكرة: الدكتاتورية يمكن تدفع وقتيا الاقتصاد في الاتجاه الصحيح، لكن الديموقراطيات هي وحدها التي تستطيع المحافظة على نموها على مدى العقود.  يعني بهذه الرؤية لن تواصل مصر في الطريق الصحيح إلا إذا تغير النظام السياسي في مصر.   Check out "why nations fail" and "the narrow corridor", two books by Daron Acemoglu.  You can check what the IMF and the World Bank think of Egypt on the internet, but in general: they are satisfied.	origin

Well You can call it tetra pentapolar. So an average egyptian wants :- 1- Sharia law and an all muslim society where people can only live with our “standards and values”. BUT not like taliban or saudi arabia because this will prevent him from doing in the dark his usual sins.  2- He profoundly despise minority groups in Egypt like gays, non theists (or basically anyone who is not muslim except christians with certain conditions) and sometimes even immigrants. BUT when he goes to live in the west he demands respect and appreciation for his culture and religion.  3- He doesn’t want to see on TV acts that insult the modesty and the morality of the arab culture. BUT He beats his dick 5 times a day instead of even praying.  4- He wants a democratic country and freedom of speech. BUT no one can criticize his religion, political direction and traditions. And no freewill for his children especially if he has girls.  5- He claims that we “arabs” are not great as in the middle ages because we are less muslim than before. BUT little does he know that in the islamic golden age it was much more secular than even now and people focused more on sciences and research and translation and cared less about who fucks who and which is the right way to pour the boiling water in a sink without demons coming out.  And so on.. infinite examples Maybe we as (most) egyptians we feel that we don’t have many achievements from our country and neither ourselves. So only religion and traditions that can give us a sense of identity that’s why when you criticize them you’re basically criticizing the whole identity.	NULL

If we had good education religion wouldn't even come to play.	NULL
I don't think that is what medical Bipolarity would look like. I'd say this is a product of bad education though. So you're raised with double standards as a kid, not fully religious and not fully irrelegious. I thank Allah that my Mother raised me with an understanding of both sides and why being religious is the right way in life. She even made me do my own research when it came to religion in order to find evidence based proof and all. So when it comes to my morality and my standards I derive those from Allah. And one of his verses in the Quran say بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم { ثُمَّ أَنتُمۡ هَـٰۤؤُلَاۤءِ تَقۡتُلُونَ أَنفُسَكُمۡ وَتُخۡرِجُونَ فَرِیقࣰا مِّنكُم مِّن دِیَـٰرِهِمۡ تَظَـٰهَرُونَ عَلَیۡهِم بِٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَٱلۡعُدۡوَ ٰ⁠نِ وَإِن یَأۡتُوكُمۡ أُسَـٰرَىٰ تُفَـٰدُوهُمۡ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَیۡكُمۡ إِخۡرَاجُهُمۡۚ أَفَتُؤۡمِنُونَ بِبَعۡضِ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبِ وَتَكۡفُرُونَ بِبَعۡضࣲۚ فَمَا جَزَاۤءُ مَن یَفۡعَلُ ذَ ٰ⁠لِكَ مِنكُمۡ إِلَّا خِزۡیࣱ فِی ٱلۡحَیَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡیَاۖ وَیَوۡمَ ٱلۡقِیَـٰمَةِ یُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰۤ أَشَدِّ ٱلۡعَذَابِۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعۡمَلُونَ } [Surah Al-Baqarah: 85]. So Egyptians tend to cherry pick whatever they want from religion whenever it suits their current agenda. Which as you can see is treated just like being a hypocrite. This is not a product of religion though, rather the lack of good education when it comes to religion.	NULL

انا اعتقد انه للأسف الشديد مصر بتتجه الى اقتصاد عالي فشخ، بكتر المشاريع زي اعادة لعمار غزة، و العراق. و في مشروع جديد زي ربط دول مصب النيل ببعضها عشان تسهل تصدير الفواكه و الخضار من الدول الأفريقية للعالم. كل المشاريع العملاااقة دي هتنقل مصر نقلة اقتصادية بنت لذينة ال٢٠ سنة الجايين و هتكون القوة المسيطرة ف افريقيا و الشرق الاوسط. لكن اللي بنشوفه مع مشاريع، للأيف مش بيتعمل ف التعليم و الصحة. بالعكس، التعليم كل يوم اسوء من اللي قبله، و نفس الكلام مع الصحة. و المشكلة الكبرى اللي مسببة للموضوعين هما الفساد و قلة الضمير، زائد عدم اهتمام الأهل بالتعليم، و انه من اخر الحاجات اللي الواحد يهتم بيها. انت لو شفت نسبة عمالة الأطفال اللي شغالين ف الورش، او تكاتك، او بيسرحوا يشحتوا ف الشوارع، هتعرف انا بتكلم ف ايه، ده غير طبعا ان اللي بيبان انه "ناجح" ف حياته، هما المغنيين و الممثلين ف الطفل بيشوف انه التعليم مالوش ٦٠ لازمة. هو فعلا الحكومة عليها مسؤولية ضخمة جدا ف حوار التعليم ده، لكن الشعب هو كمان من المسببات الرئيسية لتدهور التعليم في مصر. اما بالنسبة للصحة، المشكلة الأكبر هو الحكومة قلبا و قالبا، الطبيب ف مستشفى حكومي بياخد من ٢٠٠٠ جنيه ل٣٠٠٠. ف انا حقا اعترض، ف للأسف ده بيدي احساس للطبيب انه طب ما كتفم الناس، انا هسرق من المستشفى، و مش هراعي ربنا. المشكلتين دول بالتحديد زي الصحة و التعليم مشاكل معقدة لدرجة كبيرة جدا. مش سهل تصلحهم خالص. و للأسف اهملناهم لمدة اكتر من ٤٠ سنة، ف صباح الفل. انت محتاج مش اقل من ٤٠ سنة كمان عشان تحلهم. انا للأقتصاد، ف انا شايف اننا ماشيين صح، لكن ان الأقتصاد يتحسن هيصب ف ملصة الناس الفوق اكتر من مصلحة الشعب.	origin

You reducing software engineering to web or mobile development is the first mistake and it is the reason everything you just said is wrong. There is much more to software engineering than this (and yes, in Egypt too).

من وجهة النظر الدينية الخمور حرام والحشيش حلال لانة كثير منه لا بسكر ولا يذهب العقل، الحشيش له اضرار على المدى البعيد طبيا ممكن يسبب اكتئاب و جنون عظمة و مشاكل نفسية لكن كل ده بسبب سوء الاستعمال و طبيا ممكن يعالج امراض نفسيه كتير فا طبيا في جدل كبير لكن شرعا لا يعتبر مخدر او مسكر، انا كنت بستعمله وعمري ما ادمنته لكن لما كترت منه حسيت بانفصال عن الواقعية و جالي افكار غريبة بس عمري ما حسيت اني سكران او غايب عن الوعي، الخمور ممكن تسبب حالات هياج وعنف و اعتداءات وحوادث، المهم ان الحشيش ممنوع لاغراض تجارية و احتكارية و ليست اخلاقية او طبية، والخمور مسموح بيها لاغراض اجتماعية ثقافية يعني الخلاصة اننا مالناش معيار ولا قيم و ماشيين نخبط في الظلام.	other

Alcohol (wine) is taken in Christian rituals, so completely criminalizing it will be discriminatory. Putting a provisions for sacramental wine and medicinal alcohol will create a loophole to acquire it. Making it illegal will make it a desired commodity that will be traded untaxed in the black markets. It also means no regulation or control over distribution, so underaged kids could acquire it easily if they could get a dealer, and it will cause endemic addiction as people will more easily find it outside legal bounds, since black markets have no legal oversights and could sprout out anywhere.  Alcohol is here to stay, unfortunately, best thing we could do is make sure consuming it becomes socially unacceptable, arrest public drunkards and drunk drivers with harsh sentences, and advertise its bad effects on society like we do tobacco.  With all said, hasheesh is a much less dangerous drug and less addictive than alcohol, it makes no sense to keep alcohol perfectly legal while thousands of tons of hasheesh go untaxed. I seriously predict billions of pounds of income and reduced illegal use if hasheesh is legalized.	NULL

Options 1 and 2 are very expensive, exhausting and I don't recommend them. Idk what desert are planning to explore tbh.   Option 3 is doable.. but you will end up spending more money than the night train. I'd recommend exploring Al-Menia governorate.   The night train is what I'd recommend. Nile cruise is a great option as well. Might be a little bit expensive but it's worth it.  Finally, it's illegal to pay unlicensed tour guide. This will get them in trouble.

The idea isn't brittle, and it isn't based on its followers, it's a independent system of belief that will last as long as universe exists.  >impose them upon the film industry.  People have all the right to impose what they believe in on any type of media or content, because that type of media can be clashing with the fundamental ideas said people believe in. They're not stopping the content from being produced, they're stopping said content from being shown to the public because it's indecent.  >I absolutely do not. Faith is not a matter of intellect, but emotion.  That has to be one of the most wild claims I ever heard. One doesn't have faith in something just because one feels like it, your intellect has a main role in deciding whether something is logical and worthy of believing in or not. Your intellect judged something to be not worthy to believe in, someone else did, so by insulting what they believe in with such disturbing words, you are indirectly insulting their intellect, by which, you're putting yourself superior while you're no better than the one you're speaking to.  >The sun is way way way bigger than all planets combined, the solar system is way way way bigger than the sun, the galaxy is way way way bigger than the solar system and there are more galaxies than your mind can comprehend.  Looking at all this, one can only look an wonder how such vast and wide universe came to be, once you establish how and why, we can then speak about the narratives circling around the world. Until then, don't disrespect the belief, and never use such words to describe a prophet again.  Have a good one.	NULL

this is so wrong. get your facts straight instead of having uneducated takes.  British and French colonialism led to the increase of homophobia and misogyny. they came to Africa and the Levant to see women having rights and gays being accepted, so they thought we were "uncivilized" and they needed to civilize us.   if you had the bare amount of curiosity or respect for the fight against colonialism you could've at the very least opened the [wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Egypt) and read about LGBT history in Egypt, which is very vague in itself but still leads you to the direction that colonialism introduced extreme homophobia, the one you're practicing, in Egypt.   anyway, if you're denying the existence of homosexuality historically in Egypt pre-colonialism, you are wrong. Ever since the 17th century some of the British and French orientalists visiting Egypt and surrounding countries recorded their surprise and shock of the normality of homosexual occurances. i share with you the screenshots [(1/2)](https://ibb.co/1ZGmbHQ) and [(2/2)](https://ibb.co/X7DP70h) from the academic article [Homosexuality in the Middle East: An Agenda for Historical Research by Bruce W. Dunne](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41857885). these screenshots include commentary on homosexuality in our region by westerners who later colonized us, encouraged and instilled extreme homophobia in our culture. the screenshots represent less than a page of the whole article, which i recommend reading for understanding our history and struggle against colonialism better.  if you bothered to do further research and understood how Africans had their queer sexualities suppressed by colonialist forces, you will understand how the westerners viewed us.  you sound very ignorant "fighting" colonialism with the same justifications colonialists made. i hope this aggressive but educational critique encourages you and others to do your own research beyond what you see on social media and biased articles.  if you need more resources, let me know i am more than happy to share papers i've read and liked.	origin

I think all addictive and inebriating substances are bad, no matter if it's done excessively or in moderation. That said, we shouldn't interfere in people's liberty, even if what they are doing is dumb or sinful. Additionally, I think people will seek these no matter what, so that will create an underground black market, which will engage in criminal activity and will be a gateway to even more dangerous drugs.

No, you missed the point. Taxes are a sweet side effect, but the real benefit is regulation.  I am talking from several historical precedents, when prohibition (outlawing) alcohol was attempted in the US, every single person including the police, bribed or not, tried to completely ignore the law and drinking levels became much higher than before.  After the prohibition was lifted, regulations were put in place, you can't drink in public, you can't act drunk, you can't drive while drunk, you can't drink under the age of 21, you can't sell alcohol above a certain level in regular stores, you can't sell alcohol without a license which puts you under constant inspection, etc.   Same goes for child labor, which is also legal, but now children are forbidden from working in lung destroying collapse hazard coal mines. They have to work in less dangerous clerk jobs, have limited work time with a minimum wage, and they must not skip school or stay out at night. It wasn't made completely illegal since poor families rely on working family members of all ages, and making it illegal would doom them to hunger. But with regulation, you can at least guarantee your children won't get stuck in chimneys.  Even heroin and cocaine are legal as pain killers, which share the exact same chemical composition as the street drugs, but instead of people getting addicted while relieving pain with unregulated street drug, they could get a prescription that says they actually need pain killers, and go get legal drugs with a certain dosage and amounts that are less likely to result in addiction.   I won't go to marriage since it is not a commodity and it does not share the same characteristics that produce detectable income.	NULL

People need chill the fuck out the is not for tv or cinemas it's on Netflix which has lgbt influence in all of it's movies I don't get why they're so triggered by this one ignoring that the whole platform uses lgbt representation as a main criteria in thirty movies so you should be mad at the platform in general and work on banning it or monitoring the content it passes to the country instead of blaming one fucking movie while sponsoring the platform ,, also I'm like many people who didn't know about the movie i don't even have Netflix but now the movie is advertised everywhere and most people will now watch out of curiosity .

Question is why would you hypothetically speak Japanese as a first language? Were you raised in Japan your entire life? Do you have any connection to Egypt? At that point you'd be ethnically Egyptian. For example like some Pakistanis in England who had only been there for 2-3 generations but almost have no ties to Pakistan.  And that's just when the Japanese starts with you or your parents.  In reality it's like our parents (and the generations before them) spoke Japanese, developed Japanese culture, immigrated to and from Japan for 1200+ years, dominated Japanese media from music to movies and shows, and became the biggest Japanese speaking country. That when mentioned to citizens of other Japanese speaking countries is recognized as the biggest one and even bigger and more relevant than Japan itself.	NULL

مش محتاج مبلغ العقار كله للعلم.. لو معاك ٢٠% من مبلغ العقار البنك ممكن يديك ال٨٠% رهن عقاري تسدده على عشرين سنة، او تاخد ال ٨٠% من البنك و ١٠% رهن عقاري تاني تسدده للبائع بتاع العقا  على مدار ١٠ سنين مثلا و هو هيوافق لان بياخد فوايد فيعتبر بيستثمر و هو مش بيعمل حاجة. لو انت دارس العقار كويس و فاهم فالعقارات هتعرف تتصرف ازاي ولو مش فاهم متشتريش عقار لان ممكن ميبقاش مربح. الحكمة من كل دا انك *تدرس كويس الخطوة قبل ما تعمل حاجة*. العقارات مجال ممتاز لو انت عارف بتعمل ايه. هات كتب و كورسات و اتاكد من جودتها و جودة المعلومات الي فيها عن طريق الريفيوز. او اختار طريق تاني. المهم ان الفلوس مبنفعش تبقى نايمة لازم تتحرك علطول اعمل بيها حاجة تربحك منها لو الفلوس نامت التضخم هياكلها من الاخر.	other

السينما المصرية لحد قبل الثورة كانت سينما منفتحة (بغض النظر عن المشهد اللي في الصورة) و كانت اشبه بالسينما الغربية متحررة الافكار و الرؤى بس برضه كان فيه جانب اجتماعي مصري مشترك في اغلب الافلام  السينما من ٥٢ ل ٧٠ كانت اعظم فترات السينما المصرية الافلام كانت منوعة و كل حاجة حاجة كانت محترمة و ليها هدف حتى الكوميديا وراها هدف يا اما اجتماعي يا وطني حتى البوس مكنش مبتذل و السينما كانت خالية من الإيحاءات  السينما في السبعينات كانت اسوء مراحل السينما تقنيا و اجتماعيا ، بدأنا نشوف افلام كتير مالهاش لازمة حرفيا و اعتقد لولا يوسف شاهين كان من باب أولى نلغي الفترة دي من تاريخ السينما في مصر ، و شفنا انقلاب مش بس على الذوق العام لا على القيم كمان  السينما من ٨٠ ل ٢٠٠٠ كانت سينما اغلبها محافظ و اغلبها ناقش قضايا اجتماعية و شفنا افلام بنكهة سياسية كويسة اوي  السينما في الالفينات كانت اكثر تحررا لحد ما السينما بعد ٢٠١٥ تقريبا و السينما و التلفزيون اللي كان طول عمره محافظ بقوا فجأة لا يشبهون المجتمع المصري تماما ، بقت سينما كل همها مناقشة التابوهات عشان تكسر فكرة مناقشة او عرض حاجة غير مألوفة و خلاص مش عشان هدف او مورال معين.  بغض النظر عن مصطفى بكري اللي بيعر* على نفسه  فعلا احنا بقى عندنا كارثة اجتماعية اسمها سينما و تلفزيون و اعلانات كمان	other

الوسطاء و المحافظ الاستثمارية بياكلو معظم الربح بتاعك عن طريق الرسوم المخفية و الكلام دا يعني بعد عشرين سنة هتلاقي ان فلوسك معملتش يعتبر المبلغ الي كان في دماغك. في البورصة لازم تستثمر بنفسك عشان تحقق ربح كويس. غير كدة في البورصة الشركة ممكن تقفل بكرة او ممكن تخسر او ممكن يحصل كساد في السوق كله مرة واحدة انما العقارات هتفضل موجودة علطول الا لو حصل زلزال مثلا ولا حاجة. هتفضل تتأجر علطول خصوصا لو موقع في حلو و هتفضل تحققلك ارباح من هنا لمية سنة قدام و منين ما تحب تبيع هتلاقي مليون يشتري (خصوصا لو الموقع ممتاز). و البزنس عموما بيحققلك ارباح حسب البزنسن من ٢٠-٤٠% عشان كدة ريادة الاعمال دايما تنتصر على الاسهم و دا عشان الاسهم بتحققلك ربح من ٦-٨ % سنويا دا الطبيعي و دي ضريبة انك قاعد في البيت مبتتحركش عكس ريادة الاعمال. لذلك تعلم سكيل و تعلم ادارة الاعمال دايما هو الصح. لو شايف ان تعمل سكيل صعب هتتأكد بعدين ان عدم تعلم السكيل دي هيخلي حياتك اصعب و اصعب. في مليار طريقة لتحقيق المال و الفلوس على قفا من يشيل لكن الي يشيل دا لازم يكون فاهم و مبيرتاحش شغال علطول علشان كدة الفلوس تحب الحركة. بس كدة معنديش حاجة تاني اقولها. بالتوفيق لصاحب البوست و كل الي قرأ الثريد دا	NULL

Look, I think your getting it mixed up over here, i’m not saying we should go as far as get them up over on a scaffold and publicly decapitate them, but, i don’t have to subscribe to having you around that much nor am I obligated to like you or make friends outa you. That is not to say that they should get ostracized or shunned but don’t expect of people to be that much nice to them either. Actually this is the very kind of disposition that gets people repulsed away from even considering to embrace them in and have em be less looked down upon, they need to understand that this notion of same sex relationship is so foreign to them and had actually been regarded as freak behavior for the better part of humanity’s recorded history—that is putting religion aside, so for you to pop up and suddenly expect of them to be not only accepting and approving of your preference but also like and be afond of you is a bit of a reach, you have to compromise a bit to find common ground, unless you don’t and this is some personal vandetta and you deliberately are trying to make them out to be the worse party in this engagement.

Now that is a completely different topic from what i’m talking about right now and quite the abrupt transition on your side of this conversation but i’ll tag along, this is of course savage behavior that should be shunned and severely stricken off what we regard as normal, and while there are a lot of people doing this wicked practice, i don’t think they constitute as many as half the women. See, this sort of demeanor where you go on to throw in a gauge that is not even close to what is real is what gets people not wanting to do anything with you people, because you keep on antagonizing them and setting yourselves further apart over fear of being attributed with them when they could really use your take on other cruicial pressing issues but you’ve made yourself out to be this inaccessible imbecile who won’t offer up tangibe solution but go on and on and whine about every other thing to veneer your lack of worthy input, in due respect.

What do you believe if I may ask, hmm? Cause I can tell you that there are thousands upon thousands that accept Islam as the true religion of God everyday, and they're not specific to one race/region. So you're basically saying that these people are stupid, since they believe in what you believe to be stupid mythical old shit. And do you know why they accept it as the truth. Because the people that convey Islam to them are 1000x better at explaining it than any Islamic studies teacher we have in our "Islamic countries", and because they *seek* the truth. These people convey Islam with rationale and not with blind faith like most people in our own countries do, they answer any questions or criticism with evidence based knowledge. They do not oppose criticism, because if you are one to oppose criticism then you know that what you are conveying is already false. So tell me please, what do you believe in?	NULL

First of all, I'd like to apologize. I didn't know how much of ill reputation that Doctor had, he's an antivaxxer and downright scammer, now I know.  With that out of the way, I'd like to say that him being the the scammer he is, doesn't change the fact that Alcoholism does have those exact harmful effects. When comparing cancer rates in areas where Alcohol does most harm, Alcohol drinkers are much more likely to get cancer in the liver and the oropharynx (back of the throat).  I disagree with it being because of poor screening at all since it'll still show cancer rates metrics and studies (which it doesn't) unless you want to imply that both screening of Cancer and Alcoholism are both poor. My point still stands.  I'm not trying to prove a niche point or an unpopular opinion here. Alcohol is harmful period. What's harmful must be criminalized even if it has some "good uses". The harm drastically outweighs the good. We don't need a problem of drunkards in our country.	NULL

Legalising weed :   1- drug smugglers will go out of business   2- taxing said weed industry will get egypt millions in revenue  3- said revenue can be used to better the healthcare system or the education system  4- less people doing time and ruining their lives due to petty possession of hash/weed charges that will turn them into criminals later  5-police can focus more on the not talked about heroin epidemic we are in the middle in   6- medicinal marijuana has been shown to be very effective in combating certain long term diseases "under a doctor's strict supervision" like glaucoma , PTSD , an analgesic that is a better alternative than opioids     Just as it is with the alcohol industry, if ya dont want it dont buy it. But even if it's criminalised people will find a way to get it even if it carries the death penalty "like thailand" so if its already being consumed by everyone the government might as well just supervise the whole thing and make money off of it	NULL
A cloud engineer is basically an engineer who has knowledge of AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure or GCP (there are other providers like IBM and Oracle but they are not as popular). You can be a solution architect, devop, system admin, network and security, or a data scientist; you have to figure out where to start based on your preference. I’m an advocate for AWS, so you can explore their certs, I’d recommend solution architecture to know your way around their services before going for a specialty like machine learning or data science. On the other hand, tech support vacancies depend on how knowledgeable you are to be able to make some big bucks but you won’t go above 15k net, at least as far as I’ve seen.	NULL

Oh I don't disagree with you that alcoholism does have harmful effects. I don't know the details but I'd assume cancer metric reporting isn't as accurate in somewhere like Egypt, and I'd wager a lot dying before getting definitively diagnosed (e.g. Vomiting blood to death as someone with chronic liver failure with liver cancer). And I think we're discounting the other variables that contribute to cancer formation in our countries such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, smoking, obesity, etc. which are much higher compared to other countries in western Europe for example.   As for your other point I doubt criminalising alcohol will lead to lower usage. The only reason a lot of Egyptians aren't alcoholics is because they can't consistently get their hands on good alcohol because it's heavily taxed to death and is relatively expensive. Drinking a few beers in Egypt as a working class person would be financially unattainable. And I seriously have problems with criminalising substances because they're "harmful" as that could relatively grow to form an umbrella of substances that are relatively harmful.	NULL

Statistically, Egypt is among the top 10 countries with the highest porn consumption. A popular term searched is "lesbian".

Do African Americans call themselves Nigerian/Kenyan/Congolese?  Do Irish Americans call themselves Celtic?  It's already a given that we're Egyptian.   Arabic as a culture was developed far more by Egypt/Levant/Iraq/Maghreb than in the peninsula. Even culturally most of the terms we use and traditions we have today are very much localized (as is with the rest of the Arab world) so what exactly is there to change? Go back to Coptic? which was Egyptian localized Greek?  I can't find any reason for running from the word "Arab" other than to cave in for smooth brained idiots who claim Egyptians today aren't descendants from the ancient Egyptians. Even then, if enough idiots run the government and we change to "Coptic" identity, that'd still be Greek. They won't care no matter how much we change branding. They don't actually care about that.  And if you're upset that greasy brained Americans can't differentiate between you and an Iraqi or a Palestinian Arab then the fault's on them. But that doesn't mean we aren't Egyptian Arabs. The two terms aren't mutually exclusive.	NULL

> I'd assume cancer metric reporting isn't as accurate in somewhere like Egypt, and I'd wager a lot dying before getting definitively diagnosed (e.g. Vomiting blood to death as someone with chronic liver failure with liver cancer). And I think we're discounting the other variables that contribute to cancer formation in our countries such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, smoking, obesity, etc. which are much higher compared to other countries in western Europe for example.  The cases you mention are oddly specific and the huge difference in cancer rates between both regions can't only be justified on cancer reporting metrics. Having the Heptatitis family of viruses is all the more reason to consider criminalizing Alcohol we don't need more problems, even then it's such a small margin that can't offset the huge difference in cancer cases. We're talking about a difference of around x20 more excluding oropharynx cases iirc.   Criminalizing alcohol will definitely lead to lower usage. Assuming that a lot of Egyptians would like to get their hand on cheap liquor is quite the bold assumption. Don't underestimate the psychological factor when considering religion and the peer pressure the Egyptian society will place on someone who just started drinking alcohol especially if he's a Muslim.  Last, harmful substances should be criminalized regardless of how its consumers respond. If being taxed to death helped in averting alcoholism then criminalizing it would surely help as well. There are mechanisms that the state can put into place to curb consumption of such substances, coupled with raising public awareness and proper regulations of course.	NULL

Yes, they unironically starting to call themselves nigerians, moors, nubians, hoteps, etc. African Americans want to claim everything on the earth. Also, you are thinking in linguistic and cultural terms, we are not getting to a point of understanding. You see, an Egyptian who's first language is English, French, Chinese, Arabic, is still Egyptian. Because of his blood and genes. Our origins are all the same, no matter if we are called in the Greek or Arabic way. Egyptian = Copt = Masri = Kemetic. For example, is a German person Deutsch or Allemand? It's all the same because they all have the same meaning of someone with that heritage.	NULL

The way you feel is totally normal. You lost your fiancee and you are grieving. You lost her but also the future life you thought you would have with her.

With all due respect, we know homosexuality is considered immoral by most communities, in Egypt, but it shouldn't be considered immoral to discuss homosexuality openly and fairly. That means that movies should be allowed to deal with the issue of homosexuality without people getting up in arms. Discussing sexuality is also important for peoples sexual health, and that's why it shouldn't be offensive to discuss sexuality in the name of public health.    Also, tizak hamra.	NULL

Oh but it’s not just one post. Either you got way too much free time and trolling, or you truly despise it here.

There is literally no other option and trolling on an Egyptian reddit where people who grew up here and the others who are over 40 are eagerly waiting for Egypt to get back on it’s feet, you’re REALLY not helping.

I think i had a good piece of the story explained and i understand now still nothing too unusual fir Netflix if people are actually moral and worry fir thier children they shouldn't use the platform because they only accept movies if they support LGBT agenda that includes the ones made for arabs I heard Russia attempted to ban the platform but people watched thier movies anyway (i think Russian egybest or something)  . They failed to stop people from watching the movies and eventually gave up so the only solution for who considers it a problem is to either watch everything before thier kids to make sure it's safe or just stop using the platform because you know they'll represent things that are against our culture and morals , Alcohol , dating , homosexuality, دياثة   All these things are immoral here but there's almost zero movies on Netflix that doesn't contain every single one if those things i don't if they're trying to force a culture that isn't ours or they don't really care about the watcher as long as they get paid	NULL

Because the Egyptian/Arabic culture hate all the shades of LGBTQIA+ people and they consider being gay, lesbian .etc..  as a crime ,and they get arrested .  The government punish any films that they consider anti-culture , but they do not reward or give attention to the masterpieces that the Egyptian cinema brought out . This affects the collective outlook of films and art in our community the be seen as just entertainment material   I don't say that to have great art you have to put any thing that may seen as imprudence but if the government gonna "ban" bad art it has to give some attention to good art as making film analyitcs and discussions be more on TV and internet and somehow make art appreciation part of the culture	NULL

سبب المنع مش سوء الفيلم ، بل و انه بيخالف " المعتقدات " يبقي النقاش فى المعتقدات و الحريات مش سوء الفيلم . و سواء مقتنع انه بيخالف معتقدات او لاء فهو شئ موجود و متقدرش تتغاضى عنه . لو هتمشى بنفس طريقتك هتضطر تلغى السرقة و الكلام العنيف و تعمل بقى فيلم بيدور فى اليوتوبيا . حتى القصص اللى تقدر تتعلم منها قيم حلوة سواء دينية او غيرها موجود فيها حاجات غير اخلاقية بس هو مقالكش اعملها بالعكس هو بيقولك متعملهاش (سواء بشكل مباشر او غير مباشر) يعنى لو قلتلك "ان فادى شتم عادل و راح عادل علان زعل و انتحر ، متشتمش حد علشان دا بيسبب للناس أذى  " دى قصة فيها شئ غير اخلاقى (الشتيمة) لكن طريقة عرضه كانت بشكل سلبى يشجعك متعملهاش . و حتى لو قدمتها بشكل غير سلبى فمش شرط يكون اللى عامل القصة منحاز للشئ الغير اخلاقى يعنى لو عادل منتحرش و متأثرش دا مش معناه ان الشتيمة مش سلبية بل معناه ان عادل شخصيته قوية ، فأنك تشوف ان دايما الحاجة الغير اخلاقية لازم يكون ليها تأثير سلبى دى رؤية محدودة للحياة . ولو فعلا المؤلف منحاز للشئ الغير اخلاقى هتلاقي فيه ثغرات و حاجات مش راكبة فى القصة ، يعنى لو عادل شخصيته ضعيفة و متأثرش بالشتيمة دى ثغرة .  و فى حالة الفيلم ممكن ترمى كل الكلام اللى قلته دا فى الزبالة لأن سواء الفيلم بيشجع او مش بيشجع المثلية بطريقة مباشرة او غير مباشرة فى سياق سليم او فيه ثغرات فدا مش هيفيد ولا هيضر الناس فى حاجة لأن اي ميول (جنسي ، ديني ، سياسى ، اخلاقى ... ) هو شئ شخصى و غالبا انت ممكن تكون اتعاملت مع واحد مثلي الجنس قبل كدا او كلمت حد من يهودى قبل كدا او ساعدت واحد اخواني قبل كدا و ملاحظتش لأن مهما كانت ميولك فأنت مش مربوط بيك شريطة زى الهدايا و مكتوب عليها ميولك . و ممكن تقول انها ممكن تأثر على عقول الاطفال و كدا بس بيبقى فيه تصنيف عمري تقدر تحدد من عليه و قبل التصنيف فيه تربية عايز ابنك/بنتك متتأثرش بالأفكار اللى شايفها غلط علمها ازاى يميز/ تميز الصح من الغلط بحيث تقدر تواجهة موجة الافكار المتباينة اللى بنمر بيها فى العصور دى .	other

The big question here can we get weed?	NULL
> People can wear what they want and u have no right to touch anyone  Bullshit , that logic was debunked repeatedly by psychology , the primal reason for women wanting to expose flesh is to ask for sex , you can reframe it all you want , but that's your subconscious reason why you want to dress like that is that you want to seduce men , but you get made mad when harrased because this is not the type of attention you were looking for , basically they wear exposing clothes to seduce men on their terms , it's selfish and disrespectful , in a way it's also a subtle harrasment for men , not so different from a man trying to seduce a woman on his terms (both of them are not seduction by the way , both make them uncomfortable and annoyed)  Harrasment and rape are not the same , harrasment is a social issue , rap is a mental illness , any man can harras , but very few men can rape .The west is screaming from the rooftops about harrasment and rape , they are calling it rape culture , and also you are comparing a society where fornication is the norm with a religious society where poverty made the youth lost hope in marriage , despite that harrasment and rape is spread in the west way more in Egypt , add to that most of our harrasment is catcalling , the west doesn't even consider this harrasment , the comparison is not valid in anyway .

I know what a rape kit is , you are the one who don't know much about rape , not all rape happens by violence , the threat of violence can be enough , most women doesn't resist that much in fear of getting beaten , A lot of them freez in fear (that's a natural response for some types of danger , depends on genetics ) , there is also blackmail , drugs , he can also say that she likes sex rough ( masochism is more spread amongst women than in men , they are already married so she might fell comfortable about sharing kinks ) . General rape is really hard to prove , doesn't help that they have an established consent (the marriage contract ) , they are already having sex , almost impossible to prove that she didn't consent in a specific time .

انا المينور بتاعي كيمياء، اي حد قسم فيزياء في الكلية بياخد مينور كيمياء.   بالنسبة للدراسة في قسم فيزياء مثلا، بندرس اساسيات الفيزياء. سنة اولى بتكون رياضة وفيزياء، وكيمياء. الفيزياء في سنة اولى المنج بتاعها متاخد من كتاب اسمه serway، و بيشمل فيزياء المواد والبصريات والحرارة ومقدمة بسيطة في النظرية الكهرو مغناطيسية. بالنسبة للرياضة فا المنهج على مدار سنة اولى بيكون من كتاب اسمه calculus وفي الغالب بيبقى جزء كبير من الكتاب، ولكن مش كله، وبيكون تفاضل وتكامل و متجهات وجبر وهندسة تحليلية. بالنسبة لمنهج الكيمياء فا معرفش لاني معنديش اهتمام ب ٢ جنيه في الكيمياء. بعد كدة سنة تانية بقا بيبقا فيها مواد زيادة في الرياضة زي الجبر الخطي، الطرق العددية، المعادلات التفاضلية، complex analysis، و classical mechanics. بالنسبة لمواد الفيزياء في سنة تاني بتكون شوية كورسات بتعمل كمقدمة لبعض الموضوعات الاساسية في الفيزياء. مواد زي الفيزياء الحديثة والنسبية الخاصة، ديناميكا حرارية وفيزياء احصائية، مقدمة تاني في النظرية الكهرو مغناطسية(المفروض انها بتدرس من كتاب اتقل اسمه griffith، بس مبيحصلش عشان الدكاترة كسالى).  سنة تالتة بتبدا تاخد مواد اصعب زي ال quantum mechanics  بس لفل الكورس لا يتعدى كتاب quantum mechanics for dummies  عشان الي بيديه واحد اقل ما يقال عنه كسول، وحبشتكنات تانية بقا لغاية سنة رابعة ملهاش اي تلاتين لازمة في الحياة(حتى من الناحية الاكاديمية) بس ده عشان الي حاطت لايحة الكلية لقسم الفيزياء انسان retarded.  بالنسبة بقا للدروس الخصوصية، فا انا عندي مشاكل اخلاقية مع الفكرة ذات نفسها، فا مش عارف لو عايز امشي في السكة دي ولا لا. انا ممكن اشتغل في مدرسة بس مديش دروس.	other

Tbh, it depends on so many factors such as the   1_cultural background, if you live in the delta or upper Egypt they are more conservative, Than big cities like Cairo, alex are way more liberated in the way they think about these kind of stuff.   2_ religion factor which isn't coverned by geographical bordars, since there's no such a thing as "gf and bf" in islam "ولا متخذات اخدان", and you gotta bear in mind that most of Egyptian are innate religious people.   3_other personal factors like appearance, confidence to expess admiration, etc...	NULL
Haha جواز الصالونات isn’t my thing but thank you anyways. Seems like i should just give up on it for now.	NULL
بص على حسب القسم، قسم الفيزياء بيعدك انك تكون عواطلي، لا بتدرس مواد عملية ولا حتى النظري الي بتاخده يتقال عليه نظري، فا لو مشتغلتش على نفسك بنفسك مش هتلاقي شغل. الفكرة برضه انه الموضوع هنا مش انك تاخد كورسات زيادة تأهلك لمجال العمل. انت محتاج تشتغل على نفسك عشان تتعلم الي المفروض الكلية كانت تعلمهولك، وهنا بقا مفيش كورسات وكده، فا بتضطر في الغالب انك تذاكر لوحدك من مرجع مكتوب باسوء طريقة ممكنة وبلغة مش لغتك الأم. ان شاء الله بعد ما تخلص الأساسيات تبقى تشوف الكورسات الزيادة الي هتحتاجها عشان الشغل مثلا، ودي بتبقى المرحلة السهلة، لانها اغلبها حاجات ليها محتوى كتير على النت.  بس ده قسم الفيزياء، بالنسبة للكيماء، فا ممكن يكون النظري تعبان حبتين، بس المناهج مليانة ولو ركزت هتستفيد، والعملي فيها بيربط الي بتاخده في الكورس النظري بالعملي، قسم الكيمياء احسن بكتير في ناحية تأهيلك لسوق العمل، وفي الغالب هتشتغل في اي حاجة فيها تحضير مركبات او مراقبة جودة وكده يعني.

Just cause most 20 year olds now have exes doesn't mean you're missing out, I'm not a professional but what would be fun about just dating anyone for the sake of just wanting to date only to breakup soon after, in my opinion you're better off taking it slow, no need to rush into it just cause everyone else is, get to know some guys maybe be friends first and see how things go from there, you could always initiate the conversation or to ask to hang out if they're interested, lots of things you can do and figure out but don't just jump into it cause you feel like you're missing out it most likely won't end well	NULL

Good luck. I think it's just about taking a step out of the comfort zone and socializing. It's really hard and scary but that's possibly the only way to get a date. Or you can just wait for someone to approach you, but you gotta show people that you're approachable. Many can be very scared and worried of rejection or society looking down on them for doing such a thing.  That's really all I can say, not very experienced myself if you hadn't noticed lol.	NULL
It depends on the guy to be honest, but show interest in what he likes, ask him if he’s free to hang out somewhere, show him what you’re interested in, maybe flirt (if you can), get touch (if you’re comfortable) but don’t over do it	NULL

Right, I'll be frank, 10k isn't enough for 6 adults and one child.  from what I understand, that's the whole sum that you use for everything.  I live with 3 other adults, utilities alone cost about 1.1k which is split between us 4. (and 2 of us aren't home almost at all!)  if we talk about grocories, for myself, I spend about 800egp.  transportation (I don't go out much unless exams/work emergencies) ~240egp.  my phone bill is exetremly cheap (again, don't go out much) ~50egp   add in ~150 egp for god know's what cause that's how life is.  without rent, I'm paying about 1600egp a month for an exetremly low maintence needs.  So this is my barebones budget, I didn't count in anything extra that would usually be done on a whim.   Didn't include any tution, memberships, going out, eating out, food orders...etc	NULL

Maybe you don't have the sex education you need to understand HIV. Being gay doesn't cause AIDS. Straight people can get AIDS. HIV is transmitted during sex, so people have to use condoms to prevent it. Any person can transmit AIDS to another. HIV has nothing to do with morality, frequency of sexual activity, and it has nothing to do with Human rights for gay people.   You don't really understand statistics. You are misinterpreting the data to suit your narrative. You are ignoring large segments of the LGBT population who don't have high transmission rates, and the data shows higher transmission in minorities than in whites. Are you going to use the data to say that other races are more at risk because of their identity? of course not. Where in people are using protection, HIV transmission is low. Wherein people do not use protection, HIV is transmission is high. Only a fool would use the data to suggest that gays get aids and straight people don't.   And besides. So what. If a population segment is at risk of disease, does that mean they should be persecuted? Is that what you are arguing?   What about Lesbians? Are you advocating for Lesbians then? because HIV transmission among lesbians is practically unheard of. So go do more research maybe, but this time, in humanity and human rights rather than picking one statistic about vulnerability and using it to argue bigotry.	NULL

not a girl but, 19 year old here, my advice is simply as some others said; don't feel like it's a thing you 'must' do, whether it was out of FOMO or thinking you have shortcomings or so on. it's natural to get this feeling regarding the matter obviously, when you see so many surrounding you linking themselves to a particular experience like relationships or other things that they find joy within, but it shouldn't be the main deciding factor for you regarding anything   good relationships are bound on strong, mutual understanding of eachother. others may have a relationship for the fun of it, and others desire it just for the sake of it whether it was for reasons like self-worth, identity, status, so on--but a successful and long lasting relationship as far i know is when you can truly accept, know, and love a person on most facets they have for as long as you stay with them. this is why i think beginning a friendship and strengthening it is the most important thing before thinking of committing to a relationship; because there's a better chance of knowing if you want something deeper and closer with that person or not, while avoiding the risks that come with such commitments  i want you to also know that not all seemingly good relationships necessarily work entirely; started as online friends at first, i had an intiminate and loving bond with someone myself, but over time we knew it wouldn't work out due reasons we eventually accepted, and even if it did stung at first, we managed it without much hassle because we truly respected and understood eachother. she and i remained as close and good friends to this day who enjoy eachothers' company regardless. this is what i find is valuable; that even if such relationship didn't stick for you, you still have someone important in your life; a friend that you treasure.  so all in all, don't think it's some big task you necessarily have to do at this point in life just because you saw others doing it. focus on your growth and other priorities, expand your circle of friends, get to know the bads and goods in people, don't submit to expectations that might get pushed to you, and all should come in its time without forcing anything	NULL

you're still comitting yourself to expectations of marriage, whether it's between you and your partner, or other groups like your families, without letting it build naturally on itself   having a 'period' where you get try getting to know eachother with the premise of marriage itself has its risks  and it's not all shine-and-bright because there's always those toxic parents who abuse this concept regardless and force their children for marriage  it may work for conservative-minded people who want to keep this old tradition, but it doesn't work for everyone else   you can still do the 'getting to know eachother' part, without doing something as unnecessary as going to a parent and proposing for their daughter for a time period while not even knowing eachother well before it	NULL

I'm kind of in the same boat as you, but I'm in my mid 30s. For some reason, Egyptian men never approached me. However, when I lived in Europe, things happened much more naturally, and I never understood why it was so easy there, but almost impossible in Egypt.  Don't let it bother you. You do you. You have your entire life ahead of you that is packed with so many experiences and adventures.	NULL
Your entire post is written under the assumption that societal acceptance to homosexuality is not harmful. Others argue that it is. If the latter is true then it is in the public's interest not to allow for our movies to push for the agenda of acceptance, especially since there's pressure from Western media already.  Now onto the "we'll keep being backwards as long as we think like this" idea. I think that's complete BS to be honest. Acceptance of homosexuality has absolutely nothing to do with how successful a country is. You can see that across history and you have a literal case in point of that in China. The number 2 strongest economy in the world which is literally pushing for more "masculine" men in television because feminine looking ones "will harm society".  People seem to confuse the west's success with the rise in homosexual acceptance. Nope. Such acceptance happened long after the west has established itself. It is a byproduct, not a source. America has been a super power for all but 50 years and it's already going downhill fast. So don't try to tell me that a country's progress is reliant on a "I don't care as long as it's not me" attitude.	NULL

It is not about accepting homosexuality, it is about secularism, equal rights, social liberty and acceptance of people who are different from you. That is why the west is more progressive than the east and why the middle east is such a shit hole that is still living in medieval times. And the reason the US is going downhill fast, is due to the rise of conservatism and alt right movements (Trump).	NULL
معايا كانت بتبتدي بكيميا و صداقة و بعدين نرتبط.   مافيش حاجة غلط لما تصرحي باعجابك لحد. لو بادلك الشعور، تمام. لو مش بيبادلك نفس الشعور، ولا يهمك. مش كل الناس هتعجب بيكي و لا إنت هتعجبي بكل الناس. فعادي.   العلاقة هتيجي هتيجي حتى و لو كنتي بعين واحدة بس الأهم من إنك تخشي علاقة انك لازم يكون فيه ٣ حاجات مهمة:  ١- عندك standard عالي للشخص إللي عايزة ترتبطي بيه، مترتبطيش بأي حد لمجرد إنك عايزة ترتبطي و خلاص.  صدقيني المعفنين أضعاف أضعاف الكويسين.   ٢- لازم يكون عندك boundaries و إللي يحاول يتغاضى عنها أو يتعدى عليها، تسيبيه علطول. لما تسمعي نفسك بتديله أعذار لسلوكيات غريبة أو مش مريحة علشان تكملي معاه، اعرفي إنها علاقة سامة و مش هتكمل. يا إما هو هيسيبك فجأة يا إما انتي هتسيبيه علشان قرفتي منه.   ٣- لازم يكون عندك دايرة ثقة سواء أهل أو أصدقاء تقدري تتكلمي معاهم بكل راحة. مثلاً صحابك لما يقولولك دا معفن، أو هو ذات نفسه يشتكي لك و يقولك الناس بتقول عليه Toxic، اخلعي. صحابك معاهم حق و هو Toxic فعلا. متجادليش مع نفسك.  أنا كنت أتمنى ألخص لك الred flags كلها في كومنت علشان تقدري تدخلي علاقة آمنة و سعيدة بس نزلي كتاب "أحببت وغداً" هيلخص لك التجارب و الشخصيات الوسخة إللي كل البنات و السيدات تعرضوا لها.  اقرأي أو شوفي فيديوهات عن ال manipulation tactics علشان  بيجيبوا أثر نفسي بشع خصوصا لو إنت في علاقة قريبة مع حد.   الملخص طول ما إنت عندك standard معين للشخص و للعلاقة و عندك حدود قوية و مؤمنة بيها، كل ما ال هتكوني في أمان و سعادة أكتر.	other

You missed the entire point of my post. First of all, I was not talking about the country's progress. I'm talking about us as humans, and the way we treat each other. You can criticize homosexuality if you want, which is what I said, but don't attack them and say that Ahmed Helmy should get a divorce because of a role in a movie. If you don't want to accept homosexuality then dont watch a movie on NETFLIX, which preaches it in all their content.   As for China, imagine being the number 2 strongest economy in the world, yet people yearn to leave due to lack of freedom and basic human rights, and this is speaking from experience, as I lived there for 5 years. One of the biggest reasons people migrate to Europe and America, because humans are actually valued there, and given the freedom to be happy.  I really hope that one day you find out that one of your children is gay and see what you do then, and no I am not part of the LGBTQ+ community, but I am human, and we are all born equal and deserve to be treated with respect when it is reciprocated.   Take a good look at yourself and really think before judging someone for trying to be happy	NULL

  >بس لاحظ ان فيلم cuties كان بيعرض البيدوفيليا اللي مفيش حد ممكن يتقبل حاجه زي كدا لان ممارسه الجنس لازم تكون علاقة قايمه علي الرضا ف الطفل او الطفله مش في عقليه مناسبه تأهلهم للتفكير و مش في وضع يسمحلهم ب اتخاذ قرار في عمل شئ زي دا ف انت كدا بتفرض حاجه علي شخص لا حول له ولا قوه انه يرفض العمل المشين دا  كلام سليم بس هل الإرادة هي كل شيء؟ يعني لو احنا الاتنين موافقين يبقى نعمل اللي احنا عايزينه ولا المفروض عندنا قواعد نمشي عليها للمنفعة العامة.  يعني المثلية مثلا بتزود نسبة الإصابة بال STDs بأضعاف أضعاف المعدل الطبيعي وعشان معظمهم bi فده هاينقل الأمراض دي لل heteros.  ده غير انه حرام في كل الدين وكل الكتب اللي ربنا نزلها.  >انما المثليه الجنسيه بكل بساطه ان راجل حب راجل او ست حبت ست الاتنين اختارو دا بكامل قواهم العقليه محدش فرض سلطته علي التاني ولا فرض عضلاتو عليه و اجبره علي العلاقه دي و دا مش معتقد غربي يعني محدش يقدر يحتكره او يخصصه لعرق معين زي مثلا الفيتشز دي حاجات غريبه بتطلب في دماغ طرف في العلاقهرف بيحب يجربها هي حاجه غريبه بس بتبقي متوقفه علي موافقه الطرف التاني اللي هو بالغ و ناضج كفايه عشان يقدر يحدد هل هيحب حاجه زي كدا او لا ف وصاية المجتمع علي الناس تحب ايه و تكره ايه او انه يتقبلهم اصلا مش مطلوبه خالص دي مفروضه انت غصب عنك هتتقبله وتتقبل ميوله عشان هو مصري زيه زيك و مش بيضر اي حد ب اللي بيعمله و الا نقول انت بترفض المثليه و شايف انها حاجه عكس العاده و المفروض نثور عليها  عايز اقول لك ان البيدوفيليا في طريقها أنها تبقى عادي (اتمنى لا) في المجتمع الغربي المتحرر اللي كله فيه عادي مادام بالتراضي (that rhymed 😂) ولو شفت اللي حصل مع موضوع ال homo هتلاقيه بيحصل في البيدوفيليا [شوف ده](http://web.archive.org/web/20110307142802/http:/www.allamericanblogger.com/682/the-shadow-sexual-revolution-the-push-to-legalize-pedophilia/)  حاجة قذرة انا عارف.  > نثور عليها زي ما حصل في امريكا حقك بس هل انت ثورت زي ما ثارو علي جورج فلويد لما ظابط عمل اللي عمله؟ لما طلع شيخ بيعمل نفس اللي في الفيلم اللي الامريكان ثارو عليه مع طفله لحد ما جابلها نزيف و هددها انها تقول ل مامتها؟؟؟ هل ثورت لما راجل بالغ جرجر بنت صغيره لمدخل احد العماير و اتحرش بيها والله اعلم لولا الست اللي لحقت البنت الصغيره كان ايه اللي جرا؟ طيب هل طلعت نفس الموقف الاستنكاري دا من واحد دبح واحد في الشارع هل طلعت نفس الموقف مع ناس كل يوم بتسحل مراتاتهم في الشوارع؟ هل ثورت لما واحد ولع في اخته عشان الورث؟ هل ثورت لما محمد الامين رجل الاعمال كان مقضيها انتهاكات جنسيه في حق البنات الايتام في الدار هما و صغيرين و لما يكبرو يبعتهم الخليج او يشغلهم في شبكا دعاره؟؟ انت معندكش مشكله مع الواقع بس عندك مشكله مع تمثيله في فيلم ميتعداش الساعتين!!! احنا مشكلتنا اكبر من فيلم مشكلتنا في ثقافه الجتمع اللي يهيج الهوجه دي عشان فيلم و ميعملش ربعها قدم الواقع المذري اللي احنا فيه ف احنا وصلنا القاع والله ياجماعه ولو فيه ااقل ف احنا جواه   انت بتتكلم على أساس ان الحاجات دي عادي وبتحصل كل يوم مع كل الناس مش أنها حوادث فردية بتحصل لنسبة ضئيلة جدا من ال١٠٠ مليون.  واقول لك؟ انا جورج فلويد مش كان حاجة تخصني عشان اثور أو حتى اتكلم عشان ببساطة مصر يعتبر مش فيها عنصرية لا ضد لون ولا دين ولا حتى جنسية مختلفة (مش معناه اني عادي مع العنصرية واني مش اتضايقت) بس باقي المواضيع دي هزت الشعب كله حرفيا واتحداك تطلع أنسان سوي واحد طلع قال اغتصاب الأطفال أو دبح الشاب ده او الشباب اللي انتحروا أو حتى موضوع محمد الامين ده عادي لا كلنا اتكلمنا ولو مش كنا اتكلمنا مكانش محمد الامين اتحبس اصلا (كنت سمعت كلام أن وزارة التضامن كانت ساكتة وسايباه عامل جناح في دار الايتام بتاعته مع ان ده غير قانوني بس ده مش موضوعي دلوقتي) بس الناس كلها اتكلمت عن المواضيع دي وكل المجرمين دول بيتحاكموا دلوقتي.  الخلاصة ان الناس رافضة كل الكلام ده ورافضة برضو الhomosexuality مش تقول إن الناس سكتت عن الباقي.   >لو اللي حصل علي فيلم معداش ساعه ونص كان بيحصل قصاد القضايا المجتمعيه الكارثيه اللي بنقابلها كان زمانا احسن بكتير  تاني، اللي حصل قدام الفيلم ده بيحصل قدام اي فيلم هدفه اظهار الغلط أنه صح وإظهار الحق بالباطل وعشان هو فيلم بالعربي يعني موجه للعرب.  زي كل الافلام اللي كان هدفها كسر التابوه مش اول مرة ولا اخر مرة طول ما في ناس رافضة الغلط وبتقول ان ده غلط.	other
حضرتك عندك حق طبعا مافيش رشوة على مستوى الدول. لكن لازم برضه تعترف ان مصر اشترت طيارات من فرنسا و محطات كهربا من ألمانيا علشان "تحسين العلاقات" مش علشان أي حاجة تانية. و اكيد ان منظمات المجتمع المدني هناك عندها حرية اكتر في انها تنتقد حكوماتها و تفضل تتكلم عن أوضاع حقوق الانسان و غيره في مصر. حصل حظر تصدير سلاح للسعودية فقط بعد قضية اغتيال خاشقجي بسبب زيادة الضغط من المنظمات الحقوقية مش اكتر. أنا مش بردد كلام أي قنوات والله و مش معترض على حاجة غير ان حكومتنا المفروض تبقى زي حكومات الدول اللي حضرتك ذكرتها و تبقى بتشتغل لصالح مواطنيها مش علشان تكسب شرعية دولية يبقى من حقها تبعزق فلوس الدولة اللي هي فلوسي و فلوسك على حاجات واضح انها مش على قمة أولوياتنا كشعب مصر.	origin

Again, the idea that secularism is key to success is misguided at best. Israel is the polar opposite of secularism, can you say it isn't a successful country? There were empires that lasted for hundreds of years which were centered around religion. The idea that religion is the source of all that is bad is an overreaction to bad things that happened in the name of religion. Guess what? Bad things happen in the name of ANY ideogy, and the more widespread the ideology the more likely it is to be used as an excuse to do bad things. There's a growing number of academics that strongly argue against secularism as a result of what has happened in the last 50 years, they're actually starting to become a majority in their fields.  As for equality for all. It sounds good but the question is how equal is too equal? Surely there's a limit. I mean no one would ever push for equality for a murderer or a pedo. Now you're going to say "Ok but those people harm others". To which I'll reply "who says that harm can only be physical?". After all, the natural progression of homosexual acceptance is marriage and children (not allowing that goes against equality). Is it really fair on a child to cause them abandonment issues and identity crises due to not knowing why their biological parents didn't want them? Or even know who their biological parents are? And by the way, this is very real and every adoptee experiences it. Isn't it incredibly harmful and selfish to knowingly put a human being through that just because of your desires?   And no this is not why the west is more progressive than the east. I strongly disagree with that. The west you see today is built on an industrial revolution that enslaved their own poor in coal mines and colonised other countries for resources. The west you see today is built on a Christian foundation that was abandoned AFTER they became who they are. And Donald Trump is a symptom of a much larger societal problem, not the source of it.

* مش بقولك تعمل ايه ولا ايه اللي مفروض يتعمل مجرد رأيي الشخصي و نصايح شايفها ساعدتني كويس.   ١) هدفك الوقتي ميكونش انك تلاقي شغل. اسس نفسك كويس جدا. اللي انا عملته اني اتقنت البرمجه و بعدين دخلت مسابقتين تبع ال competitive programming و ذاكرتلهم الي حاد ما كويس. ال mind set بتاعتك اهم حاجه تتغير ل problem solver و دي مش لازم حل كتير و تزود صعوبه اللي بتحله كل فتره. لو قعدت ف نفس المستوي كتير كدا انت بقيت stuck ف ال comfort zone.   ٢) بعد م اسست نفسك ف البرمجه ابدا خش ف technology. مع sources كويسه و اجتهاد من ٦ شهور ل سنه هتلاقي نفسك بدات تطور فيها جامد و لازم لازم تعمل projects من نفسك. متدخلش ف ال tutorial hell زي م بيقولوا. انا بصراحه بزهق جدا من ال فيديوهات ف كنت باخد نص ال كورس عشان اساسياته و اكمل انا لوحدي عشان معايا ال content بتاع ال كورس و ادور ع ال topic. ال articles بتاعه Medium ياما ساعدتني الحقيقه و كنت ابص ع الكورس اشوفه سريعا عشان ببقا خلاص عارف التوبيك بس بيكون ساعات قايل حجات كويسه.  و لما ببقا مش لاقي حاجه باجي اسأل ف ال subreddits هنا. ال communities هنا لذيذه جدا و هتلاقي اللي بيرد عليك دايما.   ٣) دور ع تدريب براحتك بس متدورش ع شغل الا لو حاسس انك بقيت فاهم كويس ف ال technology بس متبقاش خايف يعني انت ف الاول و ف الاخر لسا ١) طالب ٢) معندكش experience بس تكون بتعمل projects كويسه و فاهم الكود بتاعك و عارف كل حاجه بتعمل ايه و لو عامل copy لحاجه من ع stack overflow او ايا كان افهمها الاول. كدا كدا ف الشغل هيقابلك حاجات كتير متعرفهاش دا عادي. و متضايقش لو معرفتش تكتب كود كتبته كتير قبل كدا ال seniors هتلاقي بلاوي ف ال search history xD اهم حاجه تكون فاهم ال كود شغال ازاي و ليه. و يريت كمان بقا لو كل حاجه بتتعلمها تدور ع ليه انا بستعملها اصلا. انت كدا هتبقا سابق ناس كتير ف ال technology.   ٤) متخافش تسال. في جروبات فيس كتير و هنا ع reddit في subreddits و ع stackoverflow. كان في Senior بيتكلم في event بيقول احنا بنتبسط اوي لما حد يجي يبعت ع الفيس او يبعت رساله يسال ف حاجه و كدا ف لو عايز تكلم حد Senior او جامد ف ال field ابعتله عادي. لو رد خير و بركه.   ٥) اقرا كتب. مش اجباري بس فعلا الكتب دايما فيها حاجات ازيد عن ال courses و ال فيديوهات و ال articles بمراحل.  في شركات مش هترضي انك تشتغل و انت طالب او تسألك لو هتعرف تشتغل عدد ساعات كذا ف الاسبوع لان ممكن تشتغل part time عادي.

If one of my kids is gay then so be it, I'll support them whatever way I know and try to navigate the world with them. I do not deny that they're human and like us in every way except one. What I disagree with is this idea of "what you're doing is completely fine and OK" no it isn't. It's important that we are able to identify what is wrong and what's right. Should they be treated normally? Yes. Should society accept what they do? I say no.	NULL

it's contradicting though in your logic  to what point should the line remain, between them being treated normally, yet not accepted?   you can't have both because the ones who don't accept them will so often treat them like absolute shit like any conservative society, even beyond egypt  so how do you see that line of safety for those minorities being maintained, without being accepted themselves?

Do you realize what you're saying? How can you deem them human, and then follow it up by "oh by the way you as a person, you're not normal and you should be oust from society." It's either they're human and accepted or they're not. It is not someone's choice of who they find to be sexually appealing. I don't understand why its so hard to just let someone be. If you have your beliefs then stick to it man, dont shit on someone else, and if you tell me oh but the kids, then if you raised them properly they wouldnt do such "horrible" things right?   Take Adel Emam, in most of his movies he's shown touching women inappropriately and sexualizing them, and yet he's called "El Za3eem." Why don't people say something then. Get a grip	NULL
هو ما قارن بين الفعلين هو قارن بين مبدئين انرفضو الاول من المجتمع الغربي و الثاني رفض مصري و عربي وقارن بين تفاعلات المجتمع و شركة الانتاج رفض الفكرة بين تسفيه الانتاج بالنسبة لكيوتيز وبين التقليل من المجتمع المصري و رايه  ولكن البيدوفيليا معناها اشتهاء الاطفال فحتى لو وصلو البلوغ حسب التعريف هيظلو بيدوفايلز و حتى لو كانو بالتراضي  لكن اذا كانت حجتك للتقبل الشيء هو البلوغ و التقبل فكمان علاقات المحارم مسموحة لانها بين اثنين بالغين عاقلين واذا مش مسموحة ما بتقدر تنتقدها حسب مبداك	NULL

No, it isn't a package deal, nor should it be.  I have friends that drink/smoke, they're good people that I like. Does that mean I think drinking/smoking is ok? No. And I have no problem telling them to their face that I think what they're doing is not right (in a friendly way). Would I push for the banning of these substances if I can? Yes, but that doesn't mean that we should yeet these people off society.   >Take Adel Emam, in most of his movies he's shown touching women inappropriately and sexualizing them, and yet he's called "El Za3eem."

أولا انت حقك تختار اللي انت تؤمن به و زي ما ربنا قال"لا إكراه في الدين قد تبين الرشد من الغي"...و طبيعي جدا الإنسان في زمننا ده يحتار و يتوه من كتر المعلومات و الأحداث و الشبهات اللي بترن على ودانه طول اليوم نتيجة للسوشيال ميديا اللي بتعرض علينا شبهات و بتعرفنا جوانب أكتر من قسوة العالم فبنحس بالضياع وسط ده كله...و أنا شايف ان المجتمع بيتعامل مع نقطة التوهان أو ان الواحد لسه عقله منضجش انه يجمع عوامل الإيمان كلها و تقر عينه بالإيمان بيتعامل مع الأفراد دول بغباء شديد و اللي معظمهم أو كلهم شباب في بداية العمر عدت عليهم شبهات مكانتش بتعدي على اللي قبلهم خالص أو كانت بتعدي عليهم بس بعد نضوج إيمانهم و تطور علمهم لرد الشبهات دي بكل سهولة بس زي ما قلت لك السوشيال ميديا و العولمة اللي مكانتش موجودة في أجيال آبائنا أتاحت لنا الفرصة بالاصطدام بالشبهات دي و احنا لسه نونو صغيرين ...و التعنت ده ميختلفش كتير عن تعنت أقوام الرسل مع رسلهم و يشبه أقوالهم بإن هذا ما كان يعبد آباؤنا مع اختلاف كبير جدا و هو أن الإسلام هو الحق المبين و لكن موقفهم من الاختلاف هو هو نفس موقف الكفار زمان و ده غلطهم و غلط المجتمع اللي مبقاش فيه تعليم ديني نهائيا بقى يطلع آباء لا يفقهون في دينهم شيئًا بيصلوا و يصوموا و محافظين على الأركان لكن معندهمش أدنى قدرة على تعليم أولادهم و تثقيفهم بما يقيهم شر الفتن ..قال الله تعالى "يا أيها الذين آمنوا قوا أنفسكم وأهليكم نارا"...ففيه جزء من المسئولية يقع على المجتمع و المسئولين عن التعليم الديني و جزء يقع على والدك و كل أب انه لو ملقاش نفسه فاهم الدنيا ماشية ازاي لازم يتعلم عشان يعرف يفهمك و يتعامل معاك ( و برضو رفقًا به و بكل الآباء بقوا بيجروا في ولا كأنهم في ساقية و باذلين كل طاقتهم ظنًا منهم ان ده الصح بس فهم مجبورين على أمرهم فارفق بأهلك و متبقاش انت و الظروف عليهم)لأني كنت زيك بالضبط و اتخانق معاهم ياما و بعدين كانوا بيصعبوا عليا اني قاعد فاضي ادور هنا و هناك و أبحث في مسألة و كده و هم خارجين يجروا عشان يصرفوا عليا ما هم برضو معذورين بل مشكورين و لو قعدت طول عمرك مش هتوفيهم حقهم فارفق بهم و التمس لهم العذر و حسابهم على الله و الله لو قصروا معاك...بالنسبة لانك مش مؤمن بالله فأولًا حافظ على أساسيات إسلامك و أمن نفسك و بالتوازي ابحث في المواضيع اللي انت شاكك فيها و خليها مجاهدة في سبيل الحق و خليك باحث حقيقي عن الحق و ليس التمرد و لا ضير من أن تستعين بالله كلم ربنا و قل له يا رب اهديني للحق و نور لي طريقي و ربنا هيفي بوعده مع كل المجاهدين فيه " و الذين جاهدوا فينا لنهدينهم سبلنا "..ربنا يهدينا جميعا	other
I don't buy into nationalistic bull. There are no western beliefs, and eastern ones. One may be more prevalent in one society over an other, but the inherent ideas are not the exclusive property of any one country, culture or geolocation.   Human history and human a culture are deeply iterative and very much a combination and amalgamation of different people's cultural influences. Find the beliefs that suit *you* the most, and embrace them. So long as you can defend your beliefs to yourself and follow them through conviction, then to hell with "western vs  middle eastern" comparisons. They only serve to popularize and normalize xenophobia and otherism.	NULL

Forget about مجلس النواب. They are just a bunch of corrupt money grabbing power hungry thieves. But when you talk about الأمر بالمعروف و النهي عن المنكر you gotta understand that this is an important part of the religion that 90% of the population follow. Also LGBT, alcohol, cheating and premarital sex are major sins in that religion. If you have a problem with Islam or you are not Muslim yourself then that’s another story and I totally respect you. But don’t blame Muslims (90% of the society) for getting mad at a movie that promotes all those majors sins. They have every right to get mad. In the end we live in a Muslim society whether you like it or not and we can’t just go disrespecting our beliefs and act like it’s nothing. We don’t need some minorities to push their corrupt beliefs on us. If minorities want us to respect them, they also have to respect the majority. Practice what you preach.	NULL

I think the concept of amer bel maaroof nahi an monkar is a great philosophy to follow in life, seriously. It’s just how you interpret. The core dilemma here, regardless of the matter listed above, movie or not, is that you want them to go towards individualistic approach, while to them it’s a religious societal matter. It’s true, if someone isn’t doing anything to you, then leave them the fuck alone- but not 100%, because the lgbtq views for example is against the Islamic believes, thus “we” won’t leave them alone. And so on. And this applies to everything.	NULL

> If minorities want us to respect them, they also have to respect the majority.   the minorities literally have no problem respecting the majority if they get the same respect, which they DON'T   everytime those minorities are minding their own businesses, being themselves and so on, all it takes is one hint to be heard of their difference and they'll almost always get harmed in some way even if they didn't do anything   the majority HAS to respect the minority first because the majority aren't even giving them any ounce of a chance to begin with. everytime there's a problem, it's nearly always the conservative majority starting it because they've never learned that people have privacy, they're the ones who start the bullshit because they've never learned not to leave people ALONE and that not everything is centered around them even outside the LGBT context   this is why there's activists and right-callers for queer people; because if they remained silent and let the conservative majority shit on them, they'll get harmed, persecuted, and even killed for just LIVING.  you're not doing good if you put values of any kind before your fellow human beings; you're just being a scumbag   i said it before; but there's a good reason why authoritarianism, conservatism, and religion go hand in hand so nicely together, and it's up to you to think about it	NULL

That is not their identity dude, they make it their identity. There's a difference. Your sexual preference shouldn't be your main source of being, and if it is then there's something deeply wrong with you sorry. People can live and die without doing lots of things, including sex.   I really empathise with those dealing with such desires. But I don't think the solution is to say that acting on those desires is ok. People develop desires for animals, inanimate objects, and even children. Does that mean that they should act on these desires? No, because you're not taking into account how that will play out down the road. I ultimately believe that allowing for that leads to allowing for marriages and children (otherwise it wouldn't be equality, right?). The last part is where it becomes really harmful, especially in a world where babies can be brought into the world not knowing who their biological parents are or why didn't want them, all just so these two people could feel normal. Isn't it cruel to doom someone with an existential crisis just because you want to feel normal?   To me this is all similar to the idea of communism in the 20th century. It sounded like a fantastic idea, the solution to all suffering, and you weren't considered a "muthaqaf" if you didn't adopt it. Until it was tried out, and everyone realised that to accomplish it you have to bend society and sacrifice so much more than it's worth.	NULL

What you are talking about here is about the narrow-minded people, who wouldn't give themselves and their brain any freedom to think logically or sometime to think at all..

طب المثلية الجنسية موجودة في الكثير من الحيوانات ايه السبب برده؟ الناس التعرفها ديه مثال كويس بس anecdote يعني مش حاجة ينفع تعميمها الي لو الحصل معاهم ده يقدر يطبق علي نطاق واسع و مثبت علميا فعاليته. ما في ناس برده قالت إنها "اتحسنت" لكن كانوا بيضحكوا علي نفسهم أو حوله يقنعه نفسهم لمدة علاشان محدش يديقهم. انا شايف أنه موضوع يستاهل يتعمل في أبحاث أكثر و مكثفة لكن برده نرجع نقول مفيش حاجة عالمياً في مجال الطب النفسي اثبتت قدرتها أو فعليتهها في تغيير الميول الجنيدسي و ده بيختلف عن الfetishes. ففانك تساوي الاتنين ببعض مش صحيح. و بعدين العندهم fetish غريب محدش بيسجنهم و لا بيقتلهم و لا بيجرسهم و بيخسرهم كل الوراهم و قدامهم. انت لو ليك فالbdsm  مثلاً مش هتلاقي بوليس الآداب يقبض عليك لكن لو انت شاز جنسياً حياتك شبه منتهية لو حد عرف و نشر الموضوع.   كمان انت بتفترض في علاج طب لو موصلتش ليه حاجة برده هتعمل ايه؟ و لو حد من عيالك أو اخواتك أو ابوك أو امك هتعمل ايه برده؟ انا لا يشجع و لا حاجة لكن من الناحية العلمية مفيش اي حاجة علي نطاق واسع مثبتة الفاعلية في الموضوع فمش فاهم الحل ايه بالنسبة لكل البيقولي علي الناس دي تروح تتعالج. الهو يعني ايه هو العلاج سعدك؟ الناس دي بتتنتحر فالأخر.	other

Dude if sexual assaults are accepted, thugs , violence and so on are accepted wouldn’t it be logical for lgbt to be accepted? If one gonna accept probably every haram aspect why wouldn’t they accept lgbt?  The answer is they don’t care about the haram and halal concept, they only care what will further their fucked up agenda so drop the moral mask about not accepting the lgbt because it haram and against the nature when you accepted other things against that are haram and against the nature.  By “you” I don’t mean you personally.   حبيبي المبادئ مش بتتجزء. يا تقبل بكل حاجة حرام يا متقبلش باي حاجة حرام. لما تكون بتقبل بحجات كتير حرام فايدة ال agenda بتعتك و بعد كده تقف تصرخ فوش حاجة حرام مش فايدة الagenda  يبقى انت منافق و مزدوج و بتستخدم الدين اداه عشان تلغي المش عاجبك بس و الي عجبك بترمي الدين عشانه. انت كده مش مهتم بلدين ولا بلقيم ، انت مهتم بمصلحتك.

I don't think ANY of what you mentioned should eb accepted, and anyone with a moral compass wouldn't either.  If you're angry at the people who accept some things that are haram but are hostile towards others then you're right in feeling that way. But I'd rather have someone who is 50/50 than someone who's accepting of everything haram. Still hypocritical, but it doesn't make anything less haram.	NULL

It’s mind boggling how religious arabs always compare pedophilia to GROWN ADULTS having a CONSENSUAL relationship as a way to validate their ignorant opinion. when in reality, arab countries have some of the highest rates of sexual assault and underage girls being married off to men four times their age is unfortunately common and acceptable in some places. It’s fucking sad that we view basic human rights and simply letting people have control of their own lives as “western beliefs”. Stop the fucking hypocrisy it’s embarrassing.	NULL

You can see it however you wanna see it, as I said before its absolutely your right to believe that these things are wrong, it all comes down to how you go about them. You see something wrong, you can give advice, they dont agree? Move on. Its that simple. Why tell them they dont deserve to live. Thats what I have a problem with	NULL
that was absolutely what they were doing! they were pointing out stuff that weren't similar in their culture and religion and they perceived them as uncivil, since they are white people, who are from their perspective always more civilized than us.  i can argue that historically homosexuality was less of a taboo in Islamic empires by telling you about figures like [Abu Nuwas](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1292664774?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&imgSeq=1) or [Ibn al-Rumi](https://www.diwanalarab.com/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87), but going on r/AskHistorians would be more accurate than i can ever be.  what is more important to note is that the colonizers didn't just point out the acceptance of homosexuality, but also other stuff like how indigenous peoples ate with their hands, believe in a false God, live in the desert, etc. for more details on how they thought we were less developed and uncivilized i would suggest reading *Orientalism* by Edward Said, and also *Colonizing Egypt* by Timothy Mitchell. for a brief overview, you can also read the [wikipedia page on the 'Civilizing Mission'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilizing_mission).	origin

It isn’t about you and me. It is about the society as a whole not few different individuals.   It is the blunt hypocrisy and weaponizing religion when in reality they give no fucks. In our society:-  Haram but benefits the patriarch agenda= cool let’s keep it and encourage and make someone like Adel imam an icon.  Haram but doesn’t benefit or goes against the patriarch agenda= حسبي يا الله فيكي يا منى زكي و يا رانيا يوسف و يا الهام شهين (على اساس ان مشاعد الهام شاهين مكنتش مع رجالة كانت مع قرود)    Just last ramadan no one tried tried to actively ban ملوك الجدعنة that had an obvious scene of encouraging and normalizing raps , no one tried to actively ban ونوس that had blunt use of alcohol (the reason they want to ban اصحاب ولا اعز) do you know what series they tried to actively ban and urged the نقابة to take actions against? الطاووس **series that is against sexual assault and rape** is this series was threatened to be taken down for a good amount of time.

Your sexual preference shouldn't be your main source of being, but its a big part of who you are and you can't deny that. Many people find happiness in others and there's nothing wrong with that. Same way many people here I know work their asses off just so that they can get married. These people are born that way same way you were born to like women. You cannot change it, you simply cant, try being gay and see how that works. And again you are going for extremes just to make point. Are you really comparing pedophelia to homosexuality?   >babies can be brought into the world not knowing who their biological parents are or why didn't want them  That is literally how adoption works. Its the same for everyone irregardless, and nowadays people use surrogacy, which makes them the biological parents of the children. And are you saying that every single child of same sex parents is doomed? Yes you can view same sex marriage as wrong, but I don't see how that hurts society. I told you before, if you believe its wrong then it shouldn't damage you in anyway because you simply wont do it. Everyone can't escape it because it exists everywhere in a world of social media. You don't want your children to look at that stuff and follow it, then make them, because its about how you raise them.   It all comes down to whether or not you believe its "mental illness," so we will never agree on this topic. I asked you to give me a solution on what society should do. Oust them, jail them, kill them? What should they do.	NULL

Explanation:  • Alexandrians: هو كده and it is also due to the spotlight turning towards them lately in the past couple of years for many various cases and reasons. Alexandria is also already becoming Cairo's main competitor for the label of Egypt's modern "media hub" or "cultural hotspot".   • Cairenes (including Gizans and Middle Egyptians): Live in/by the capital, near their ancestors' artifacts and many historical places, are considered the "typical" or "average" Egyptians, are greatly nationalistic and involved in the country's politics.  • Mansourians: Have a stereotypical reputation of them having the most beautiful women in the republic, with different explanations that range in accuracy from minute to none. My older side of the family mention mixing with the French as their personal explanation for the case, likely due to the Seventh Crusade occurring there resulting in the defeat of Louis IX of France in the Battle of Mansoura, hence its name "the victorious = mansoura". In reality, their beauty isn't higher or lower than that of any other Egyptian woman.  • Aswanians: Have an outdoors-type of lifestyle and work environment, causing them to acquire a fine tan. Their geographical closeness to Nubians and Africans has generally and historically caused them to acquire relatively moderate-to-high levels of Sub-Saharan African genes compared to any other governorate.  • Luxorians: Considered the pinnacle of "Upper Egyptianess" and their rich ancient cultural heritage directly derived from their Egyptian ancestors with the addition of their location which is filled with their ancient egyptian ancestors' temples and artifacts, gaining them heavy interest and respect both nation-wide and internationally.  • Sinaians: Nationally-Egyptian Arabs/Bedouins that have inhabited the region since ancient times, their culture and dialect is closest to that of Gulf Arabs.  • Menoufians: Similar to Mansourians' case. A heavy nation-wide stereotype about them is that they're very greedy, money-aware and stingy. Which - if you haven't concluded it yet - is symbolized by Jews that carry this stereotype and anti-Semitic reputation with them since ancient, medieval and modern times till this day.  • Sharqians: (???) (Seems to be unrelated to any common stereotype and likely added to fuel the shitpost)  • Ismailians: (???) (Could be football-related or a stereotype that I'm not aware of)	NULL

I think you’re mixing up religion rules with country’s rules. Again, Egypt rules are mainly based on the Islamic religion. There is no rule in Egypt to enforce a Christian to go pray in a mosque. They are not religious rules, they are the country’s rules that are mainly based on religion.   If what you are saying is true, then all the Jews and Christian’s who lived in the Islamic era/territories should of been forced to pray in mosques, which is not what happened/not true.	NULL

>Source? I haven't seen actual numbers until now, we were just talking about a hypothetical  In the US, the lifetime risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is: about 1 in 60 (1.7%) for men and 1 in 140 (0.71%) for women.  While they don't elaborate on Alcohol use, they report that alcohol increases risks of developing that specific kind of cancer. Moreover, The risk of these cancers in people who drink and smoke heavily is about 30 times higher than the risk in people who don’t smoke or drink.  Source: [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html)  Given how much of our population smokes already, drinking alcohol on top of it will make it a complete disaster.  That's for Oropharyngeal Carcinoma. Something you'd never hear about in Egypt but rarely.  >It's one of the common causes of death here in public hospitals, as endoscopes aren't readily available.  Hepatitis (especially C type) has been nearly eradicated from Egypt as a result from the Virus C Initiative. As for obesity, tobacco consumption, and the like, those cases overlap with other countries so they offset each other. Even people dying from Hepatitis C are properly diagnosed with cancer unless they are on the very edge of death.  Generally speaking, Alcohol is devastating to the liver. That fact is undeniable and indisputable for doctors around the world. I believe it's common sense that the difference in cancer rates between Egypt and the US for example lies with Alcohol consumption (as one of its decisive factors).   You're talking about a society that consumes alcohol on a regular basis (and consumes a lot) as opposed to a society that rarely consumes it on the national scale.      Males Ages 12 and Over  Current Drinkers: 55.3 percent (72,286 survey respondents)  Binge Drinkers: 28.9 percent (37,789 survey respondents)  Heavy Drinkers: 8.3 percent (10,894 survey respondents)  Females Ages 12 and Over  Current Drinkers: 46.4 percent (64,449 survey respondents)  Binge Drinkers: 19.8 percent (27,538 survey respondents)  Heavy Drinkers: 3.9 percent (5,394 survey respondents)  [Source here](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-many-people-drink-alcohol-in-the-us-67305)  How you never draw a correlation here is beyond me. Justifying it as just poor screening, and whatnot doesn't make for a a strong argument at all.  That's not all. I'm just using the states as an example but there are much worse countries as for alcohol consumption. We're also talking about its direct harms until now and we never got to [its disastrous indirect harms.](https://www.verywellmind.com/crime-and-alcohol-statistics-from-1998-62821)  &#x200B;  >Do you think criminalising weed has been stopping people? People in Egypt smoke weed a lot more commonly compared to alcohol, especially in the lower classes. It's more readily available and cheaper.  It didn't completely stop people from consuming it for sure but I'm pretty confident that the number of weed smokers are *dramatically less* than what they would be if it wasn't criminalized. It will be even less when incorporating effective mechanisms in combating their spread.	NULL

African Americans quite rightly call out white people for appropriating a lot of African American culture. It's been going on for decades. One of the earliest examples were white rock n roll musicians in the 50s and 60s plagiarising the music of African American blues and jazz musicians without giving credit. While the white rockstars became legends and made millions, the black musicians remained unknown and poor.  Cancel culture is largely a myth that is blown out of proportion by right wingers and conservatives.	NULL

First of all, there's no evidence that they're born that way. It's highly likely that environmental factors are what cause the change (genetically identical twins have been shown to develop different sexual orientations). Second, I actually believe that if you put someone in a certain environment and push the right buttons they can absolutely start developing gay tendencies. That's how a lot of grooming works. As for going for extremes, I'm not (at least I'm not trying to), I'm just showing you what you sound like by giving behavioural examples that I know you would disapprove of.  By the way, I wasn't referring to adoption, I was mainly referring to sperm donations and IVF. Even if one of the parents is the biological parent of the child, they would still face the same existential questions.   As for harm/damage, it does happen. You just can't see it yet because it's a very recent change. Wait until the next few generations grow up under those circumstances then we'll talk. So many countries are now literally giving pre-teen children the complete authority to decide what they are, and no one is allowed to contest what they decide. I couldn't imagine how this could cause any harm... Oh wait, it did! A few years ago, multiple teenagers and young adults sued the NHS because their bodies were permanently changed as per their word when they really didn't know any better, now they regret it and can't go back.  You may think this is a separate issue but it really isn't. Once you instil the philosophy of "if it doesn't directly affect me then it's totally fine" you just open the floodgates wide open and completely ignore any long-term effects this would cause on the individual and on society. Any resistance will make you an enemy of happiness and freedom, no matter how much evidence you may have.   And guess what? You can't even study many of those cases because studies are "demeaning" and would mean that you see those people as abnormal.   So, ironically, you reach a point where you strongly stomp on the freedom of expression in order to allow for freedom of expression (which is starting to happen).  &#x200B;  What should we do then? Look for the causes and search for the root of the issue, allow for objective long-term studies to take place and act accordingly.	NULL

It's the reverse. LGBT is just an ideology for enabling what's not normal and what's not natural. Having the intrinsic feeling to do something doesn't give you the justification to do it. I'm curious as to where you are going to draw the lines. Are you going to allow bestiality because humans can be born with such tendency? Incest too?   Does anything can be met with reciprocity from another partner be allowed just because it's consensual? Can we allow assisted suicide/homicide since it operates on the same exact logic of consent and reciprocity?  Remember that it's your only opinion that it should be a basic human right. You're just forcing it to the point of normalization then arguing that it was a basic human right all along. The original argument for LGBT is fallacious in itself and circular.	NULL

>In the US, the lifetime risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is: about 1 in 60 (1.7%) for men and 1 in 140 (0.71%) for women.  We were talking about cancer rates in general. And I hope you know that smoking actually causes most of oropharyngeal carcinomas. Please stay on topic.   >Something you'd never hear about in Egypt but rarely.  I'm curious how you reached that conclusion?  >Given how much of our population smokes already, drinking alcohol on top of it will make it a complete disaster.  I feel like you've gone on a completely unrelated tangent to what we were talking about. I never once claimed alcohol was not harmful or non-carcinogenic. I was simply trying to explain the differences in cancer statistics in both regions and how we don't necessarily lead a better lifestyle, regardless of the alcohol.  >Justifying it as just poor screening, and whatnot doesn't make for a a strong argument at all.   Again, I was talking about all cancers in general. And yes poor screening and records does play a part in Egypt. If you've ever been to hospitals you'd know we barely have a proper filing and record system. Just because you don't think it's a good reason intuitively doesn't make it a bad reason. Cancer can lie dormant for many years until symptomatic. And by the way read again about the possible discrepancies I mentioned, screening isn't the only thing I said.      >I'm pretty confident that the number of weed smokers are dramatically less than what they would be if it wasn't criminalized  Okay, since you're pretty sure it's definitely true I guess	NULL

How is not a western thing exactly? You just admitted that even Christianity fought it until people in the west legalised it. Now, before you go pointing fingers and accusing me of things I never said, I did not say kill the gays because they are gays. Islam's ruling on this is very clear on this. Only the act of sodomy is punishable by death. But before you say that's not fair either, do you have any idea how hard it is to convict a case of sodomy or zina according to Islamic law? You need 4 honest Muslim men. That is practically impossible unless they're having sex in public. So like you said, if they keep it to themselves, it's fine. But no, I won't tolerate rainbow flags and gay parades everywhere and all that shit that happens in the west. That's way too much. Why should we use this law I hear you ask. Because Egypt is a Muslim majority country. Article two of the Egyptian constitution states that Egypt is an Islamic country and all laws stem from the Shari'a. This is not a secular country. The overwhelming people here don't accept homosexuality that's a fact. The will of the people and the majority are what decide what happens at the end of the day. After all, even western countries had referendums before they legalised gay marriage. So it's really simple, keep it in the bedroom and no one will complain.	NULL

LGBT people arent a belief please,its not a theory or Philosophical idea,lets get this straight.   Its a group of people identified by gender deviations(man&woman) and attraction to it,as in transgender people,gay men,lesbian women,etc.   And its not something of their choice ,I know LGBT people myself both online and IRL, and its not a choice, not to mention that although there are no proven gay genes,being trans or intersexual are both highly accepted medically, I even read a study about scientists turning a rat trans by disrupting hormones in the mother carrying the rat and causing its gender to deviate,like human trans people.   this is why many informed people I know generally support trans rights as its a genuine medical condition that can only be cured by transition(we dont have the tech and ability to rewire human brains).     Anyways, tangent aside,human rights against discrimination in Egypt are lacking(specifically against discrimination), and its a right in my personal opinion to not have to worry about being kicked out of your family,discriminated against,not allowed medical help(happens with trans people),etc.	NULL

I’d love LOVE to come across someone who talks shit about Egypt in my presence or in any Egyptian’s presence for that matter. I guess the difference between us is that people (in real life, you know? Outside the internet) respect me enough to not talk shit about my country ESPECIALLY when they are not from here. So i guess that’s the difference between me and you. I’m actually respected, while you’re a joke and sadly dragged all of us into your weak ass personality that gets shat on by other nationalities, grow up bb 😘   I mean i tried to be the bigger person and call you “wrong in the head” while you replied with “you’re fucked in the head”  Listen ya habibi, if you don’t like the country fuck off to another that you like, and if you’re not financially stable for it then stfu, you crossed a big line and you knew exactly what THAT exact topic does to us, and how offensive it is, so you’re literally asking to be paraded as  “العبيط اهو العبيط اهو" So suck it the fuck up, and take the L.  Also educate yourself, we never said we’re okay with napoleon robbing the shit out of us, or the rosetta stone along with many other ancient egyptian pieces being in the british meuseum, but guess what in both the Louvre AND the british meuseum they’re in a section of their own. Called, THE EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES made of two floors in the louvre. so while yes we got robbed by white people we still have credit, our name ALL OVER each department.  While african americans are no smarter than you are, you piece of uneducated shit and look at pharaohs and say “mama…papa” so there we go, appropriate AND appreciation. That’s the difference.  Educate yourself and stop embarrassing yourself.  Also, have some self respect and make a new circle of friends since this one already has zero respect for you, too late.	NULL

Do you mean that we shouldn't give the delivery guy his fee for delivering your order when it's late?  If you have a problem with the delivery time, contact the supplier, it might be their fault, or there's just (I don't know) other people like you who ordered from the same place, so that caused the orders to be late beacuse, y'know, there were too many orders just like yours that need also to be delivered, that's why your order is late, maybe.  Why don't you consider looking at it from the other side and think about the real reasons food orders are late, and try to be respectful about the delivery service itself being existent, rather than not appreciating the delivery guy by paying his fee, because mainly, it's not his problem?  Heck, what if that deliverer himself while on his way to you made an accident for goodness sake, will it still be a problem that your order is late? Will you ignore the fact that this guy was injured while doing his work, and rather focus on being hungry?  Guys, I don't know how you think stuff through, this is unbelievable.	NULL

>We were talking about cancer rates in general.  The original topic was how cancer rates that relates to alcohol consumption is drastically less in our region more than any other region. The overarching topic is the criminalization of Alcohol usage. For that, I believe my words are pretty much on topic. Especially with regards to oropharyngeal cancer and liver cancer rates. I didn't get too much into other harms such as Pancreatitis and related diseases although it serves the overarching point.   >And I hope you know that smoking actually causes most of oropharyngeal carcinomas  If you read carefully what I wrote you'd know that the combination of smoking plus alcohol raises such cases by 30 times. And a combination of both especially in our country will be disastrous.  >I'm curious how you reached that conclusion?  You'd know if you checked the multiple sources I provided across our conversation.  Intuitively, alcohol doesn't cause cancers in every part of the body so I'm definitely not talking about all kinds of cancers in general.  >I never once claimed alcohol was not harmful or non-carcinogenic.   If that's the case, given our low consumption of alcohol does mean that we have significantly lower cancer rates (that relates to alcohol consumption) and are spared of a lot of its harms. That's kind of logic 101.   >I was simply trying to explain the differences in cancer statistics in both regions and how we don't necessarily lead a better lifestyle, regardless of the alcohol.  Our conversation is with regards to alcohol. Our low consumption of alcohol makes us lead better lives when it comes to this case in particular.  I've answered the many discrepancies point. Obesity, Tobacco, Hepatitis, all of which I responded to. It's up to you to be convinced or not. Keeping a proper record system maybe a valid point overall but it's, again, not enough. If you want to tell me that there is definitely discrepancies then I perfectly agree. But it's not that large as you make it to be and is being significantly offset by multiple factors I've mentioned before.  >Okay, since you're pretty sure it's definitely true I guess  I don't know about you but let's argue for the reverse. Decriminalizing weed will make it spread faster, no? Then it's common sense for the opposite to happen. It doesn't need to be overly complicated.  In the end, I don't think I went into a tangent but it's more like I was focusing on the main idea while you were concentrating on one specific subpoint and nitpicking on it.	NULL

Oh damn. Let me explain this:  Netflix is NOT one of your constitutional rights.  It’s a private corporation that offers a subscription based service. It also makes films and it can make whatever films it wants to make.  You, as a consumer, have a right to just not subscribe if you don’t like their content.  There are people in the Middle East who believe women should not appear on TV and on film. Should Netflix be agreeable and only make films with male actors? Moreover, there are people in the US who believe Arabs and Muslims are terr*r*sts and that they should not be represented in the media. Should Netflix stop investing in Arab films and casting Arab actors?  Your “values” mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to anyone else but you. Grow up.  The world is a big place and if you think Netflix should stop making films because YOU find them offensive, I suggest you cancel your membership now.	NULL

Please refer to my other reply on the Ideology wording,and read what follows fully.     Regarding the nature argument:  LGBT people have been recorded in ancient Greece,Egypt(literally widely practiced here until the 1850s),mesopotamia,india,etc.\[ask and I will give source\]   even in isolated islands in the pacific they have third genders and common beliefs of homosexuality. This pours into that human societies naturally observe LGBT behavior and without a specifically Abrahamic religion they wouldn't negatively perceive it.         You are fully correct in regards to intrinsic action,one should consider how his actions affect people and society at large,yet,most people can very well judge and use their own human nature to act against harmful actions.   How come a very talented,productive,and,very philosophically developed country of ancient Egypt had Laws against murder,rape,incest(barred for most non royals,)\[I should provide sources on this claim\] and bestiality yet none against homosexuality?   When humans make rules on their own we see that homosexuality is never a problem unless deep social conditioning specifically done by abrahamic religions is responsible.   This is also more confirmed by how other mammals have homosexual tendencies similar to humans\[ask for source\].   \>Does anything can be met with reciprocity from another partner be allowed just because it's consensual? Can we allow assisted suicide/homicide since it operates on the same exact logic of consent and reciprocity?     Let's add a bit of nuance, two adults having sex in an isolated room in secret have objectively harmed no one and have sanely enjoyed a human act. if it was a murderer killing a suicidal person we know both people have insanely enjoyed the act and harmed themselves, society and many other people.     Consent,harm,and sanity are needed.   Fucking and raping a goat?   No consent,most likely insane--->thus it doesnt matter if it doesnt harm or if its natural or whatever.     Fucking a child who consents?   Harmful ---->pedophilia is bad(not-to-mention most pedophiles do it for the power and ego trip not for genuine attraction to young kids,so it alot of timesis under insanity)\[sources available\]     Assisted suicide?   Harmful,most likely insane ---->bad(although in some cases argument can be made,specifically about old people who are basically just bed ridden and wont live more than a year)\[can give you links about this\]     A gay couple?   Consensual,not harmful,and sane as its similar to any heterosexual relationship.     \>Remember that it's your only opinion that it should be a basic human right. You're just forcing it to the point of normalization then arguing that it was a basic human right all along. The original argument for LGBT is fallacious in itself and circular.   by all standards of scientific and natural and historic knowledge Homosexuality has always been a sane human trait of people,Only recently in human history has it been suppressed in the name of abrahamic religion,actually only in the last 300\~400 years did anti deviation/LGBT rhetoric appear,due to multitude of factors I can discuss.   It is my informed opinion that expressing yourself naturally sanely and without harming others is acceptable in all regards and one must acknowledge actual human nature without bias,and many medical and professionally educated people hold similar opinions to me\[sources available\].   I am not forcing anyone,that wording is more appropiate to people forcing people to hide their sane human selves to disallow "deviation"\[Why LGBT people are political,I can tell you more about that if you want\].   And yes LGBT people deserve human rights.     \>The original argument for LGBT is fallacious in itself and circular.   Dont understand what your premise here is or what you are trying to say.	NULL

If someone with an ancient history background came with a piece of evidence to POLITELY contest any of the claims that were made in the video, then you have an argument, or better to say intellectual debate. Instead, those who got triggered either didn't watch it (an extremely ignorant thing to do) or saw what they wanted to see and responded like immature overgrown entitled children throwing tantrums.  Please explain to me how telling people (and showing primary evidence) that there were other complex and advanced civilisations in Africa OTHER than Ancient Egypt is afrocentric? Let me spell that out for you in case you didn't understand. Ancient Egypt wasn't the only civilisation on the African continent in the age of antiquity. There were others in west Africa, central Africa and south Africa. There MAY (as in not confirmed or ruled out) that there was contact between those civilisations and Ancient Egypt.

It'd be pretty nonsensical to believe alcohol causes every kind of cancer. I'm definitely talking about alcohol consumption and its carcinogenic effect. That's why I specified the liver and the oropharynx (although it extends to more than that as I've said previously).  &#x200B;  >Do you realize I never said alcohol was non-carcinogenic?  Then we are not in disagreement. From here, by logic, you can come to the conclusion that a country that has more than 80% of its population drink and more than 10% a heavy drinker, suffers tremendously more from alcohol's carcinogenic harm than a country like Egypt. That is my main point.  From my original post  >us having the lowest cancer rates in the world is because we as Muslims are prohibited from drinking Alcohol **and thus are spared of its carcinogenic harm.**  Although it's ill-worded, you can clearly see I meant the carcinogenic harm of alcohol which is mainly in the liver and the oropharynx, which is a point I made too many times now. However, on that note, it does bring down the average cancer rate overall.  I see you're more focused about the minutiae of obtaining that kind of information rather than the overall point. I perfectly illustrated the points I wish to discuss if you're not interested in that then you're free to not respond. I'm not going to hold it against you.	NULL

Well they stole ancient Egyptian artefacts instead.  And yes, when the French invaded and discovered all these ancient monuments, it was a shock to Europe. They were shocked that there was an advanced civilisation outside of Europe older than the Romans and the Greeks. It's important to remember that eugenics and white supremacy was popular at the time. Europeans believed they were a superior race to the rest of the world and simply couldn't accept that non-whites could have had a civilisation as rich and as sophisticated as Ancient Egypt. So in the very early days of Egyptology, Europeans were pushing the idea that Ancient Egypt was a white civilisation.  A British astronomer named Charles Piazzi Smyth even claimed that the ancient Scottish were the ones who built the pyramids.	NULL

Yeah it can make whatever films it wants according to the country it operates from. We as country must get our laws and culture to be respected.

Arab world has diversity of views that you intentionally ignoring which is disrespectful  What do you mean by "there are people the US..... Should not be represented in the media"? So why bidan congratulates Muslims in their celebration doesn't that indicate that there is some voter base he is trying to appeal to? It's even ridiculous for me to have to prove that your views is totally distorted and doesn't reflect reality  My values must be respected on my land anyone trying to target us as an audience must respect that.

Yeah, basically our own colonial troops. And the nubian "pharaoh" was hated by Egyptian society. I have nothing in common with all subsaharans. The Tombos Stela describes King Thutmose I on his victory against the nubians, which he basically genocided them.  "After he overthrew the chief of the Nubians, the despoiled Nubian belongs to his grip. After he had gathered the border markers of both sides, no escape existed among the evil-of-character; those who had come to support him---not one thereof remained. As the Nubian have fallen to terror and are laid aside throughout their lands, their stench, it floods their wadis, their blood is like a rainstorm. The carrion-eating birds over it are numerous, those birds were picking and carrying the flesh to another (desert) place."  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombos_Stela	NULL

While I admire your dedication to citing sources, the Nubian dynasty in Egypt was actually much later than Thutmose, having been instated by King Piankhi of the 25th dynasty, with Thutmose being a member of the 18th.

I don't think you said something new, all of your points I encountered them many times before so I won't ask for your sources, I already know.  >LGBT people have been recorded in ancient Greece,Egypt(literally widely practiced here until the 1850s),mesopotamia,india,etc.\[ask and I will give source\]   >   >    even in isolated islands in the pacific they have third genders and common beliefs of homosexuality. This pours into that human societies naturally observe LGBT behavior and without a specifically Abrahamic religion they wouldn't negatively perceive it.   >   >    You are fully correct in regards to intrinsic action,one should consider how his actions affect people and society at large,yet,most people can very well judge and use their own human nature to act against harmful actions.    How come a very talented,productive,and,very philosophically developed country of ancient Egypt had Laws against murder,rape,incest(barred for most non royals,)\[I should provide sources on this claim\] and bestiality yet none against homosexuality?  LGBT people being recorded in ancient history is not something new or surprising. I fail to see how it relates to it being a normal behavior as it was still practiced by a small minority of tribes and esoteric groups that have perished. You'd find many of those same or similar tribes that also offer human sacrifices and rituals that involve grotesque acts to please some pagan god of theirs. I'd rather not use them as a model example for homosexuality.  Even Ancient Egypt is not spared from this and I fail to see how their revolutionary and pioneering role in civilization relate to old tradition of theirs which drastically differed from their image of being advanced. Ancient Egyptians did disgusting things like cutting the genitals of their enemies as humiliation and despite their scientific and medical breakthroughs, they practiced pharaonic FGM (the kind of FGM that's most fatal to girls and for which Islam's blamed instead), those are just some examples out of many others.  Even Ancient Greeks thinktanks like Aristotle defended slavery and opposed the notion of human equality. He also thought women are incapable of making their own decisions and are just subjects for men, a little higher than slaves.  So are you going to use those as your shining example of morality? If it's just you making a point that homosexuality always existed then we already know but that doesn't make it natural just like those other ideas of past civilizations.  >This is also more confirmed by how other mammals have homosexual tendencies similar to humans  You want to argue about animals, then you must also know that their acts of homosexuality is mostly aggressive to prove a male's dominance over the other. They don't experience homosexuality the way you think they do. Even then homosexuality is observed in a minority of a very few amount of species that can't be compared to the entirety of the animal kingdom.  There are also mammals who also eat their own children. This isn't an argument. In fact, if you want to talk about Biology, then I can only tell you that Biology views homosexuals as fault in a species. Redundant individuals that can't contribute to the continuation of that species.  >Let's add a bit of nuance, two adults having sex in an isolated room in secret have objectively harmed no one and have sanely enjoyed a human act. if it was a murderer killing a suicidal person we know both people have insanely enjoyed the act and harmed themselves, society and many other people.  That's the idea. Where do we draw the line of insane vs sane. Where do we draw the line overall? Homosexuality at most times were considered insane  If a suicidal person who wanted to die was killed by a murderer then who to blame? Isn't the suicidal person has a right to his own life? If he decided to forfeit it then it's his own choice and the murderer is just someone who helped him do that. The only person affected here are just those two. Then what about the families? It's none of their own business, right?  Years ago, when homosexuality was considered a taboo and families would cry and grieve if they found out that their son was gay, now it's changed to acceptance by the family and the society. Why can't those same families accept that their son wanted to die and respect that wish just like how they learned to accept homosexuality? Why can't the society learn to accept that as well?  The lines are getting blurred and shifted.  &#x200B;  >Fucking and raping a goat?    No consent,most likely insane  Yeah, cows didn't ask to be milked and animals didn't ask to be domesticated and bred to our own liking. You can train a dog or a goat or a mare whatever animal you want to enjoy that kind of sick act. I swear I saw one day a person rubbing off his *own dog.* So what insanity and what consent are you speaking of? Insanity is subjective as homosexuality was classified as mental disorder once and consent doesn't work with animals the way it works with humans.  &#x200B;  >Fucking a child who consents?    Harmful ---->pedophilia is bad(not-to-mention most pedophiles do it for the power and ego trip not for genuine attraction to young kids,so it alot of timesis under insanity)\[sources available\]   >   >A gay couple?    Consensual,not harmful,and sane as its similar to any heterosexual relationship.  Blankly saying "Pedophilia is bad" is not an argument. Why is it bad then? Does your source prove that every pedophile is just a person on ego trip and not someone who's genuinely feel attracted to kids? What if he's genuinely attracted to kids and her parents agreed to such relationship under their supervision? There are many what-ifs here that can destroy the whole argument of "pedophilia is bad". In fact what decides the age of consent? Both body and maturity argument can be disputed. The west doesn't even know why the age of consent is the way it is.  A gay couple which is a couple who can't procreate is in itself harmful to the society unless they get outside help. Especially in Europe with their low birth rates which is basically relying on the immigrants at the moment. Then there's the AIDS argument. A gay male couple is multiple times more likely to be infected with AIDS and other STDs due to how gay sex works, unless they take various precautions of course. As opposed to normal male/female relationship where the vagina normally lubricates itself and disinfects itself to receive the male penis, which happens, you know, *naturally.*  In fact, the HIV virus emerged in sub-Saharan Africa where prostitution was running rampant. Let alone homosexuality. Source's available as you'd say.  &#x200B;  >by all standards of scientific and natural and historic knowledge Homosexuality has always been a sane human trait of people   >   >I am not forcing anyone,that wording is more appropiate to people forcing people to hide their sane human selves to disallow "deviation"\[Why LGBT people are political,I can tell you more about that if you want\].    And yes LGBT people deserve human rights.  As I've refuted, the historic context is of no value. Also what doctors? Ideologically driven doctors who face persecution or cancelling if they didn't conform to that agenda? Because I'm sure there are many doctors that are against than pro- and I'm pretty sure they study in the same field of medicine.  About that forcing, don't make me laugh, the west imprison people who refuse to accept homosexuality under the pretext of "hate speech", in the US, you cancel people and put others under peer pressure to boycott them if that certain someone casually disagreed with LGBT agenda without harming or hurting anyone. Canada was on its way to enact a law that criminalizes a person who misgenders someone else. You made some freak thing called deadnaming and you're lynching people who do it under the name of transphobia. You reversed it and made that anyone who don't accept homosexuality is actually the "deviant"  even if it's his own opinion and of course he gets bullied and lynched for it.  You can argue for whatever you want but this certain point is just wrong.	NULL

The haram police actually doesn’t care about the halal and haram concept. All they care about is furthering their patriarch agenda. They want women to wear hijab and follow allah but most of them watch porn at night. They want everyone, even Christians to fast ramadan (or not drink infront of them) but they themselves curse 24/7. They are okay with sexual assault and thugs movies because it furthers their patriarch agenda and sympathizes with sex offenders but series *against* sex offenders ? They try to ban it (الطاووس ramadan 2021 was threatened a ban but ونوس and ملوك الجدعنة wasn’t)  The problem I have mostly is the blunt hypocrisy and brutality. We aren’t the only country where most men are assholes but we are a country that bluntly says “majority whether it is right or wrong wins fuck minority” no logic no religious backup just pure bullshit they get away with because they are the majority and they are proud of this. I once got into an argument with someone saying Abdullah rushdy said “كلمة كافر يعني غير مومن انا كافر عن المسيحين و هما كفار عندي" I told this person Abdullah got away with saying this **publicly** because he is a Muslim, what if a Christian person says this publicly? The person bluntly told me "احنا الاغلبية احنا بس الحقنا نقول كده" see? But he fail to understand that this saying gives france a pass for trying to ban hijab cause well muslims are minority in france and minorities got no right.  obviously not everyone is like this but if the shoe fits wear it	NULL

Cancel culture, shaming and generally censorship are under strong attack in the West. What the philosophy of freedom (by traditional sense) suggests is vote with your money and attention. Don't like something? Ignore it. That "was" the prevalent idea in the West.  I am personally glad many Egyptians are pro freedom of thought. Enough with the Nasserist controls. This, however, means that you are free to criticize. I am talking about calls to ban.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but snips of it and the controversy have reached me.	NULL

>https://www.cartoonbrew.com/business/on-shark-tank-kevin-hart-and-mark-cuban-invested-500k-in-animation-producer-black-sands-212287.html  This looks like a small indie film. Hardly "popular media". Yeh sure the ancient Egyptian characters are too sub-saharan African looking and sounding but it's hardly a crime against humanity and white people have done worse.  >https://twitter.com/janeandersoncdg/status/1479506410992017416?s=21  Sorry could you tell me what was wrong here? Nothing about Egypt was mentioned in that interview.  Since you get so triggered by ancient Egyptians being depicted as black, how do you feel about them being depicted as white Europeans? Here are some huge hollywood movies of that example:  Cleopatra  Exodus: Gods and Kings  Gods of Egypt  The Mummy  The Mummy Returns  The Ten Commandmants  There's also the upcoming movie with Gal Gadot starring as Cleopatra. Now Cleopatra was of Greek descent but the other native Egyptian characters are going to be white actors too.	NULL

>You just try to deviate away cause your argument is weak.  I didn't deviate from anything actually. If my argument is weak then prove it. You haven't shown any evidence to show my argument is weak.

And he even asks why Hollywood don't use Egyptian actors or actors who look like modern Egyptians to play ancient Egyptian characters.  Not responding to my other points means that you are deviating because your own argument is weak. I keep proving how Akala was not saying ancient Egyptians were black and telling you about the other things he talks about in that lecture.

الحل بسيط، اولا: العقل البشري دلوقتي بيركز عالملذات.. بيدور على اسهل و اسرع طريقة تجيبله متعة، عشان كدة الناس بتجري ورا التريندات و الفيس و اليوتيوب الخ و حتى الفيديوهات لو لاحظتي مدتها بقت بتقل و بقت بالدقيقة و النص دقيقة. حل دي بسيط لكن مش سهل، هي عادة. اركز في ايه و مركزش في ايه يعني لو ركزت في اني اتحصل على معلومات مفيدة بدل التريندات و الضحك مع الوقت العقل البشري بيتبع العادة الجديدة و بتبقى الطبيعي. دا بياخد من ٧ ل ١٩ ل ٤٠ يوم حسب اهمية الحاجة.   ثانية: دا متعارض مع اراء ناس كتير هنا، لكن كسم ثورة يناير و كسم ثورة ٣٠/٦ كل دي احداث راحت لحالها و احنا بقينا عايشين في زمن تاني خالص. فهم حاجات حصلت في الماضي مش هيفرق ولا هيفيد لانها ماضي خلاص. احنا عايشين في وقت تاني خالص الماضي مبقاش يفرق لازم نركز عالمستقبل. ( تلك أمة قد خلت لها ما كسبت ولكم ما كسبتم ولا تسألون عما كانوا يعملون )  لو هنصحك بحاجة ممكن اقولك ١- غيري من صحبتك و اتجهي اني تصاحبي ناس يحسنو منك و تتطورو مع بعض. بدل مصاحبة التافهين الي بيجرو ورا تريندات. Show me your friends I show you your future.  ٢- مفيش بديل لقراية الكتب، مفيش فيديو في الدنيا يعوض الكتب الملموسة و قرايتها ولو مقريتيش كتب انسي انك تنجحي نجاح كويس لمجرد ان معاكي شهادة مثلا. و نوعية الكتب هي الي بتفرق يعني كتب الروايات و الخيال العلمي ممتعة، لكن ملهاش فايدة عملية في الحياة عكس كتب التنمية البشرية و البزنس الخ.  ٣- الرياضة و النوم المظبوط و الاكل الصحي بيحسنو من حياة الانسان و يخلوه اسعد مية مرة من حاله الحالية.  ٤- التلفزيون المصري و السوشيال الميديا بشكل عام مليانة افكار سلبية بتحبط و الحاجات دي بتنتشر زي العدوى و الاحباط هيصيبك، استغلي ال algorithms لصالحك؛ يعني مثلا من كتر فيديوهات البزنس الي بشوفها و التنمية للبشرية دا بقى كل الي بيطلعلي لما افتح اليوتيوب لان البرنامج معمول بالطريقة دي. ما تركز عليه يزداد و يكثر. تركزي في السلبيات السلبيات في حياتك هتزيد. تركزي في الايجابيات الايجابيات في حياتك هتزيد. الموضوع بسيط جدا.   ٥- الحاجة الوحيدة المهمة في الوضع الحالي في مصر هي الحاجات الي ممكن تأثر على شغلك او هدفك الي بتطمحي ليه، زي تغيير في القوانين و الكلام دا. اكتر من كدة كسمه و مش مهم.   ٦- حاجة حلوة انك مش بتفكري في السفر زي الناس التانية، مصر فيها خير كتير جدا و فلوس على قفا من يشيل بس للي فاهم و مجتهد و ال mindset  بتاعته مظبوطة. الموضوع بسيط، لكن مش سهل و عايز مجهود جبار و اجتهاد. و الي قدها عملها.    شكرا بس كدة يمكن في حاجات تانية غابت عني دلوقتي بس عشان مشغول حبتين و قاعد بقرا و مش فاضي. بالتوفيق ليكي و لكل الناس الي عايزة تبقى حاجة. و الي محبط و مش عايز يبقى حاجة كسمه لحد ما ميبقاش محبط و يعوز يبقى حاجة.   زياد اوت	origin

We weren’t colonized by the just the British. Most empires to ever exist on the face of the earth colonized Egypt one way or the other. Greeks, Romans, Persians, Arabs, and many more. To say that modern colonialism, the past maybe 200 years, had the greatest effect on Egyptian society is laughable. The colonial effects on Egypt go beyond British imperialism. It’s a hasty generalization to cherry pick British imperialism and relate Egypt to the way it affected the rest of Africa.

This is the best advice. Use the languages you know - Arabic, English, French, whatever - to find new perspective. Try to read news and analysis that comes from people and institutions who have a good reputation, but also be aware of their biases. Reading news from more than one county will give you an excellent understanding of how implicit bias works. Eventually you will realize that even journalists/historians/bloggers with the best intention will have some kind of bias. That’s just human.   For the existential crisis part, I recommend reading literature and philosophy. Dostoevsky, Plato, Camus, and Descartes’ meditations are all great starts. There’s also a really great novel written in English by an Egyptian called “Beer in the Snooker Club” that beautifully describes some existential struggles.	NULL

تعليق طويل شوية بس لازم احييكي على الروح دي قبل اى حاجة .   فوق اي اعتبار ، ركزي ف نفسك و ذاكري و اجتهدي عشان سوق العمل بيزداد تعقيدا ، و كفاءتك ف العمل هى اللى هتحدد مسارك لقدام و ليس فقط الوعي المتعمق ل25 يناير او الاوضاع اللى وصلتنا لها او لغيره . خدي الموضوع ف اطار الفضول المعرفي و الوعي التاريخي و تعزيز معرفتك بالدنيا حواليكي مش اكتر ( و ده مش تقليل منها ، ده شيء رائع ف الحقيقة ) ، و ده طبعا هيساعدك ف تكوين شخصيتك و إنماء تفكيرك ، لكن بالتأكيد مش ده لوحده اللى هيجيبلك وظيفة جيدة براتب شهري مناسب الخ . ف ده مهم ، متقلليش من قيمة المعرفة بأي حال من الاحوال لكن برضك منعتمدش على المعرفة بالتاريخ انها كل حاجة ف الدنيا .      أما بخصوص سؤالك ، اولا مفيش داعي للاعتماد ع طريقة "اسمع لفلان" او "اقرا لفلان" لأنها مش هتفيد اوي معرفيا مهما كانت هتحسس الواحد بشيء من الارتياح لأنه ماشي ف اتجاه بعينه .    فأظن مهم اننا نتصالح مع تعدد المصادر و اختلاف التوجهات و المصالح : متنسيش ان اللي بيوجهلك الكلام **غالبا** هيكون له مصلحة ف انه يوجه المستمع/القارئ يمين او شمال . ف الواحد يجتهد انه اه يسمع و يكتسب معارف لكن "مايتمرجحش" فكريا ولا وجدانيا . ده مهم . و الناس اللى ردوا عليكي بما فيهم انا شخصيا متستبعديش ان كل واحد له رسالة ضمنية تحت الرسالة المعلنة ، ده لا يعيبك و لا يعيب حد مننا . بشر ف الاخر .    ثانيا خدي جولة ف قراءة اخبار قديمة قبل 25 يناير و اثناءها و بعدها شوية سواء اهرام و جمهورية اللي هم  صوت الحكومة ، و كذلك كتابات المعارضة ايامها زى صوت الامة  و جريدة الدستور او كتابات النقد التاريخي و الفكري الخفيف زى مجلة أدب و نقد ( لسه شغالة ) او حتى المجلات الناقدة لكن "مش بتعارض" الحكومة سياسيا زي مجلة الهلال ( برضك لسه شغالة ) ، و تتبّعي تاريخ الجماعات ف مصر سواء الاحزاب السياسية او الجماعات الدينية او غيره ، و تاريخ التحالفات السياسية ف مصر ، تاريخ الحراك السياسي من اول احمد عرابي ليومنا عموما كل ده هيكوّن لك صورة عامة كويسة تقدري تشوفي الحاضر ك امتداد لها عشان الصورة توضحلك اكتر .   اللى بيتكلم ف الامور دى كتب كتير بس ابرزها الفترة دي حاجة زي سلسلة دار الشروق عن تاريخ مصر الحديث (اسمها الجانب الآخر: اعادة قراءة التاريخ المصري) و عندهم برضه سلسلة كتيبات كده ب 20 و25 جنيه عن تاريخ مصر السياسي الحديث ، و كذلك فيه سلسلة "الهوية" بتاعت الهيئة العامة لقصور الثقافة نشرت كذا كتاب ممتاز ف المجال ده (بالذات الكتابين رقم 19 و20) . و دار نشر "الرواق" لها كتب كويسة جدا ف التاريخ الحديث زي "حكايات من الأرشيف" و "سيرة الضمير المصري" .   &#x200B;  و من حقك هنا مثلا تسأليني : طب فين الكتب اللي عن 25 يناير ؟ و هنا اتمنى متاخديش كلامي على انه بنبرة الحكيم اللي جايلك من سابع سماء و كده لأني لا حكيم و لا غيره و زايي زايك زي اللي بيردوا عليكي ، مجرد واحد بيحاول يعرف اكتر ، لكن انا كنت اه شاب بس كبير نسبيا ايام 2011 و بقولهالك بضمير مستريح تماما : اغلبية كاسحة من الكتب اللي عنها عايزة تاخد القارئ إما يمين إما شمال .   يعني مثلا اقدر اقول لك اقري أليس الصبح بقريب؟ لبلال فضل عشان تشوفي الموضوع نضال نبيل و كفاح شباب من اجل لقمة العيش و الحرية و كل البطولات دى و اننا قاومنا مبارك اللى مفيش شعب ف الدنيا يقدر يقاوم رئيس بنصف قوته ، و اقدر اقول لك اقري كتاب الاحتلال المدني لعمرو عمّار (الشهير بـ اسرار 25 يناير) عشان تشوفي ان الموضوع كان صراع مصالح داخلي و خارجي و ان مصر كانت ضحية من ضحايا مخطط الشرق الأوسط الجديد و اننا لبسنا مسرحية كبرى ؛ اقدر برضك اقول لك اقرى 25 يناير و الصراع حول السلطة بتاع طارق البشري و شوفي احنا ازاي استندلنا مع الاخوان و رمينا الديمقراطية في الزبالة ، و اقدر اقول لك اقري الكتاب الجديد بتاع ياسر رزق اللى اسمه "سنوات الخماسين" عشان تشوفي اننا كنا ف كارثة كبيرة و خرجنا من قبضة الاخوان بأعجوبة من أعاجيب الزمن . و أجزِم لك انك هتنبهري من الانفصال بينهم ف رؤية الأمر . الحقايق تقريبا واحدة ، و الاحداث متطابقة ، بس ده شايفها ب شكل و التاني شايفها بشكل تاني خالص و كل واحد بيدعم كلامه من خلال وجهة نظره و مجالات تخصصه و التفاصيل اللى تهمه و الاهداف اللى بيعليها على حساب غيرها م الاهداف ، و مفيش سبيل خالص لتوحيد الاولويات بينهم - و دى طبيعة البشر عموما .    ف انتي احسن حاجة ليكي اقري السياق العام خالص و كوّني الصورة الكبيرة عن خط سير الاحداث قبلها بشوية (و قبلها بكتير شويتين كمان) و حللي الأمر و اتأكدي من صحة المعلومات و مصادرها و قوّي منهجك ف التفكير النقدي ، و هتلاقي الصورة بتوضح لك مع الوقت .   &#x200B;

Because the pharaohs during the Roman era were from Palestine and Jordan? That makes perfect sense. At this time, the Pharaohs were placed by the Roman empire, legitimized by the priesthood. The Egyptian Civilization had numerous pharaohs that were born outside Egypt, and were not really Egyptians. This is certainly true during the Greek and roman empires. The throne of Egypt was more like a game of thrones, where any ruler who defeated Egypt's armies in battle would then become pharaoh by ceremony of the preisthood. When looking for Pharaohs who were pure Egyptians, you have to look to before 500 BC, and have to focus on Upper Egypt, not Lower Egypt, after the capital moved to Lower Egypt, The Pharaohs were less and less Egyptian.

I wanted to love that book (I loved many things about it, actually, but not the book as a whole). The subtle yet very strong colonialist propaganda really put me off.

And the fact that he’s a settler colonialist himself justifying and propagating that absurd logic speaks volumes on its own.	NULL

Technically Netflix is not in Egypt. The company is not based in Egypt and they most likely still don't have servers in Egypt. So to access it you have to literally connect your device to a server in Europe or UAE via old underground caples. I would say the analogy still holds, since in both cases you literally have to spend money and time to access said services. and while both will be happy to serve you they aren't primarily targeting the Egyptian people.  It's literally a service that you pay for.	NULL
If that's what they want and that's what they are asking for than it should be up to them. We can't decide for them.

Egypt's most Iconic pharaoh, who lived way before 500 bc was from Lower Egypt, Ramsis the 2nd.   and you can cry about Nubians all you like. but Egyptians listed them multiple times as one of Egypt's enemies. in fact the ancient Nubians helped the Hyksos when Egypt was weak, not to mention they stole our culture. so no. try again.

As to how much influence each foreign power had on Egypt is a debate I don't think either of us qualified to have. I'm inclined to disagree since the 19th and 20th centuries were the fastest paced and most radically changing the world has ever seen. But again, I don't know enough to form a strong opinion about that. That doesn't mean that Egyptian historians seeking to reclaim their history and retell the story of the Egyptian people under European colonialism can't be regarded as taking part in post-colonial history. Many of the history books published by AUC Press fall under this category.	NULL

Well I think that your logic is flawed. You didn’t get the analogy right as well.   Everyone knows quite well that whatever’s on Netflix might collide with whatever values or beliefs we have and that’s ok. What was really surprising and hence anomalous about the movie (and hence the hype) was that this is first Egyptian movie on Netflix that discusses these problems which aren’t really rampant (almost non existent) in our societies in comparison to the west. I think that was the reason for the outcry.  Back to your strip club analogy, it was simply like: let’s build a strip club in a place without strip clubs. In this case, I’d say the  protest was perfectly valid.	NULL
Yeah that makes sense.	NULL
I think that’s disingenuous because Netflix, more than any other platform, actually tries to make content for everyone.  They have thousands of films and you’re telling me that none of these films appeal to you?	NULL
1) afrocenterists are louder, mainly because of the control the leftists movements exert now on the world.  2) no one takes white washing seriously, the same is not true with afrocentrism. while people may be inclined to take the word of afrocentrists (who are almost always americans) because of the racism they faced/face.  and actually I think you're wrong, people in this sub are lenient with afrocentric bullshit. Idk what they're playing at, trying to look more progressive at the expense of their history, it's cringey.	other

I couldn’t agree more. Harari is far from being objective in his book. I was triggered by many points discussed in his book. His white approach is only the tip of the iceberg for me. What I liked about the book was its interesting approach at examining human history. The book’s combination between biology, history, and anthropology offers the reader a wider perspective to the evolution of human history, thus provide a better understanding to how we came to be. For that only, I recommend the book!	NULL

Well I think what you just mentioned is a generalization fallacy. If not, any reliable statistic would definitely help. Would imagine this hard to find given that gays here are probably closeted.

Have you seen the Egyptian version of Why Women Kill?

I watched this movie (both the original French version and the Lebanese version) and am confused as to why people are angry	NULL
I think assuming something doesn’t exist because it’s not visible to you (because, mind you, society really ostracises members of that group and prosecutes them) IS THE FALLACY.  I want to gently remind you that once upon a time in the United States of America in the 1970s, Americans were convinced that LGBT+ people were a tiny insignificant minority that didn’t really exist in the US. In the 1960s Americans and the British were even convinced that gay people were Soviet spies..  …that they could not possibly know someone who was gay.  Now imagine how shocked they were when some of their friends, family and favourite celebrities all started dying during the AIDS crisis.  Interestingly, something very similar is happening in Egypt rn. Where LGBT+ Egyptians are labelled as heretics, traitors and western agents and the media wants you to believe that only a handful exists in our society.  I’ll now leave you to make up your mind.

So I was a pretty sheltered kid, little tv and no internet till I was maybe 12. So I'd spend most of my time plotting out novels: setting, character arcs etc. One of them was about this little planet that verged off its solar orbit and  started aimlessly floating through space (I was 10 so this made sense). The civilization however was advanced enough to extract heat from the core of the planet to sustain agriculture and all that.   Now why am I telling you this? Because the name I'd put for this little novel was none other but Akira, also the name of probably the most influential sci-fi animated movie there is, released decades before I was even born, unknowingly to me. I have only found this out a few months ago, imagine how haywire I went.	NULL

That's an interesting twist you wrote about there, the planet you spoken about since you said it doesn't make much sense that it started to float off. It could be a case of a Pluto or a body that was never a planet to begin with. Which would make somewhat some sense, but i love the idea regardless. Regarding naming your works look. It is a very very long process or researching and name finding, i suggest you take your time and do google searches whenever you come up with a name. At least that's how I do it, If the name you came up with didn't return any results most likely its only you who made it depending on how complex or common combinations used.	NULL

Note that I didn't deal with salaries but large money transfers that require IBAN, but the money shouldn't have gone through in the first place.

When I said x amount of money I should’ve specifically mentioned a big number, but yea I should’ve known you wouldnt understand that my point comes from exaggeration.   And if you did read my post, I specifically said you can criticize if you want, dont berate, there’s a big difference. My critique is judgmental how? Because I’m advocating for people to be kinder to one another? Or because instead of discussing topics that matter to the country, theyre wasting our resources on a movie? I am lost, because I can’t fathom how much hate someone can have for a complete stranger who’s done nothing in their life but exist.	NULL

I guess you're right. I used to hyper-fixate on this when I wrote or played music.

My message is for anyone here in this sub-reddit is being pro-government (because I saw a guy typing if they were anti-government prisioners ) , this video is a proof that our country is an embarrassing country and IT HASN'T CHANGED A BIT FOR THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN , look at how they are treated  in addition the outside world ( basically other Egyptians ) keep saying that those people are MB , for f sake at the end of the day they are damn HUMAN BEINGS !  Oh boy in the next couple of years to a decade , I wouldn't be surprised if there was mass migration to the west, and those for anyone who is going to defend the governments action, I am just going to respond to you in a response no matter your age or career field or whatever, don't get shocked , when you find women's from our own country running to impress mens from other countries for the sole purpose of not coming back to Egypt.  Don't get flabbergasted when the future generation feel embarrassed to even call themselves Egyptians, Its enough already that the average Egyptian is not even living  A HUMANE LIFE!!!.  DON'T GET SHOCKED WHEN YOU FIND IN THE COMING YEARS , MASS MIGRATION OF ALL AGES WHO ARE CAPABLE TO MIGRATE , TO END UP IN THE WEST , because I can assure you , from many people I spoke too , they all have the same mindset of leaving , to the point some want to leave with no return!!!  Anyone who justifies the actions of the government , Please go f yourself!!!!  This is my little rant !!!	NULL
