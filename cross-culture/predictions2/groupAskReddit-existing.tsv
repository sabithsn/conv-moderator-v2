If I were close to the person , I would confide that I had the same problem for many , many years . If the person denies it or is upset by my noticing , I would apologize and let her or him know that I must have been mistaken , and again say that I had a horrible battle with self harming . I would NOT offer advice unless asked , and even then , acknowledge the fact that it is is VERY hard to stop , and what finally worked for me may not be what will work for them . Above all , I would NOT tell the person that they are not normal , or that they are just trying looking for attention , because this is NOT true . It’s real , it does not mean that they are crazy or a freak . That’s what I would say and do ….	NULL

Again, no, you're just speaking platitudes and repeating what Redditors love hearing. You also can fix a problem without recognizing it's a problem on your own as others around you can tell you. It isn't some fantasy magical first step to fixing, life is grey, not black and white, and in reality the extreme majority will *acknowledge* a problem and never do or change or reflect upon said problem whatsoever which just tears apart your entire first comment you left that's massively upvoted despite being pretty damn factually wrong.

I appreciate that.   Overall, yes I feel that it’s a very good thing that I don’t get stoned anymore. I’m on meds and the combination of the two are a crazy high. My psychiatrist has told me for years to stop getting stoned. Plus the money and sheer waste of time. I got my first full time job 5 years ago. I’d probably spend $200+ on weed products every month. I’d get stoned after work and not want to do anything afterward. Or I’d wake and bake on the weekends and I wouldn’t end up doing much either.   I do miss the feeling of getting high until the anxiety and paranoia hit. If there was a way to just get a body high without anything in my head, it would’ve been much better. I generally enjoyed getting high at parties when a lot of others were doing the same. NYE 2017 and 2018 in a nutshell for me. However, most of the time I usually got stoned alone or with my roommate. Stoned alone is terrible on my psyche. I started smoking a lot of weed 12 years ago during my second year of college. I lived alone at that time and didn’t have a lot of people over. I’d show up to parties stoned and feeling super self conscious. Then I’d have a bunch of really awkward interactions with people.   So overall, I miss it a little bit but I don’t miss the externalities and opportunity costs. Even 2 years ago, I never imagined a life without weed. It had been a big part of my life for 10 years. A week or two into the March 2020 lockdown, I realized that I might not be able to mentally survive if I kept getting stoned. My stoner friends are jealous that I’m able to be headstrong without needing weed.  I feel very fortunate that I was able to achieve some self-improvement during the pandemic.	NULL

It's quite simple. Life is unfair and full of suffering. There are bits and pieces of happiness and joy, but mostly it's struggling. If there's a God the guy is a sociopath. If there were a creation, God could just make us in a way that we do the same shit, but feel less miserable. Or maybe not create a life full of misery. I used to be a believer. I started as a Christian, but my prayers kept to be unanswered. I became pagan/esoteric spiritual, but my rites didn't do shit. It's my experience that there is no higher power than humans and humans are assholes.  Ps. No, I'm not depressed. I live a nice life. I just have the ability to be empathic and see all the people around me who are not as privileged as I am (and I'm not THAT privileged as I grew up with an abusive alcoholic father in poverty in a communist country.

The list is endless. I've been mistreated by women my whole life.  The latest though is a woman on my dating app matching with me after 9 months and messaging me out of the blue to say she was in my city (some apps actually list your suburb) and was out to grab dinner, and asked what my fave thing from that restaurant was.  She then text to say that she picked up the thing I mentioned and was on the road, and wanted my address because she was coming over. I explained that I don't operate that way and didn't feel comfortable giving out my address to a complete stranger. She then proceeded to berate me for not being a "real man" and letting her come over and give me a BJ. She continued to text crazy crap and even called me through the app (I answered because I assumed it was actually a dude fucking with me) and sure enough, it was a woman and she was really trying to lay into me because "as a man \[I\] should be into hookups and grateful that a woman wants to get with \[me\]".   This is what dating apps have been for me. I'm not conventionally attractive enough for women I'm attracted to to be interested in, and the only women who are ever interested in me either either psychotic, abusive, catfish, or someone I'm not attracted to.

My (soon to be ex, thank GOD) flatmate has always been a slob - doesn't do chores or clean up after himself, hoards dirty dishes in his smelly pig sty of a room (and then claims he doesn't know where they are when we ask why we're out of plates/etc), never takes trash or recycling out to the curb (or even out to the cans), etc. He failed out of college and now works 40hrs a week at a 9-5 office job, meanwhile my other flatmate and I have been finishing our doctorates while volunteering and working 1-3 jobs on the side for spending money. Other flatmate and I rarely have a day off, and are consistently gone for 10-14hrs of the day. He gets home every day and plays videogames from the time he gets home till the time he falls asleep. One of the hundreds of times we reminded him to do his goddamn chores for once, he legitimately said "but I only have 2 days off a week". I was so incensed that I had to leave the room to avoid sucker punching him.

I had a client who could not be made happy, no matter what we tried. She chewed through five of our best and even broke a senior leader who was brought in to deal with her.   I introduced a new team member saying that she had very strong organizational skills and business analyst experience. She said “well I need someone technical, not someone who knows business.” When I replied immediately that this person had a masters degree in our technical field, she told me “but I need someone who knows _business_.” Conversations like this were daily. She would only tolerate one of my staff members and that was because he happened to have gone to school in her favorite sport team’s town.   She would routinely confuse and misremember technical details we gave her and then accuse my team of getting it wrong. Important things too—like what changes were going into production at the end of a sprint.   It is the only time in my professional career that I have ever been called a liar, and it was because she couldn’t remember something that she told me. It got to the point where she would have my top performing staff crying in the hallways because she was so vicious in the way she demeaned people. That’s when I brought in the senior leader to deal with her. Ended up quitting three months later after more-or-less losing his shit on her in a meeting and walking out.  Ultimately I had to tell the team that nobody could talk to her without someone else there and every conversation we had with her had to be summarized and sent in an email, with me (as the PM) and her boss, who knew about these issues, copied.  If there ever was a time where I felt like a complete failure because I couldn’t earn someone’s trust, it was with her. I still think about her and what I could have done better.	NULL

That's very true hey. I think most religions are built on it. In my case the fact that I surround myself with Christians probably plays a big part, so its defintely one-sided.

What I do like about christianity is that I know I can be fully honest with God, about everything, even questioning his ways, without the fear of him coming down to hit me with thunder or something. Out of curiosity, what is your view?	NULL

What sort of community are you looking for? I find that the healthiest groups tend to be ones with shared goals (like a community garden group, a volunteer organization, or club for special interests). There seems to be something about creating something that resonates with a lot of people. When people are working together (like collaborative storytelling in a DnD group, or sharing knowledge/skills in a makerspace), there's less room for gossip or judgmental behavior. That tends to open doors toward deeper understanding and acceptance of each other, even if you have superficial differences that might otherwise stifle a valuable friendship.     What sorts of things matter to you, and what are your interests?	NULL

They keep forklift operators around because 1. It costs a lot less for maintenance and can move outside of where the automatic one can go. 2. It’s a company liability protection to risk humans with forklifts because it puts responsibility on the operator if an accident occurs.

It was more a tag along to the answers already given like "Why should I, where's the proof, which God, etc.".  I guess my answer is more of a "Why do I need to believe in something just to conveniently explain the universe". It's hard to put into words.  I guess in the past man would use "God" as the excuse for everything (rain, the sky is blue, plants grow), now in the present they're aren't as fanatical claiming everything was God's doing but there is still a little of that for the things we largely don't understand yet. Just seems like an excuse to me. Perfectly comfortable with the idea of the unknown and if past performance is any indication, God had nothing to do with anything.	NULL

There are tons of dating sites for it online! I’ve always thought casual dating was fun so I decided to try it just to see what it was all about.

You’ll get lots of messages, a lot of them are creepy and not even worth a response. But I figured I’m normal and on there, there must be some normal guys on there as well. Went on a lot of first dates until I found someone I actually enjoyed talking to, was genuinely attracted to, and it’s been a blast :) Not to mention the trips and financial assistance are pretty nice lol Plus he’s not that much older than me so it’s not like I’m selling my soul in any way xD	NULL

For whatever reason this view is really unpopular. It’s actually pretty compatible with atheism as God is largely undetectable, and there is no evidence for God other than the fact that anything exists at all in the first place. Like for example, the fact that God is everything and matter itself makes God also nowhere, and an absent force, as much as it is an active force, if that makes any sense.  If you’re actually curious to learn more, check out Ethics by Spinoza where he does a way better job of laying it out than I did in this blurb. He was excommunicated by the Jews for developing his views on the nature of God.	NULL

Marriage in modern society is a legal arrangement with many benefits for two partners who want to pledge their life to each other.  You form a single household, you can file joint taxes and share assets and get special tax breaks as a household that you cannot do single.  You also can legally use each other's insurance, which you cannot do single. So if one of you has a good job with good benefits, your spouse can hop on those same benefits, and you can save money and have insurance for both.  In the event of death or an accident, your spouse becomes next of kin and doesn't lose those assets. This is extremely important if you have kids. Speaking of kids, marriage makes the process of the legal framework around children much simpler.  If you are charged with a crime, your spouse cannot be compelled to testify against you, it's part of the 5th amendment, since legally you are one partnership, one household, one unit. So you mutually cover each other with the 5th.  There are other situations. These are just some of the highlights.  Beyond legally? You are officially pledging your life to someone. A marriage is meant to be permanent, for life. It's the ultimate of a romantic relationship. The final stage is a solid marriage.   This all being said, there is also risk to the endeavor. So you should \*NEVER\* marry on a whim or too quickly, or too young. It shouldn't be a quick decision. You should take YEARS to mature and grow and get to know each other. Even live together a couple years if you can. Figure out if they truly are your life partner or not. Luckily, in a bad scenario you can divorce, but divorce is a nightmare as you divest assets and legally from each other.  IMO, it goes like this:  Great Marriage > Great regular relationship > Single > Bad regular > Bad Marriage.	NULL

You are correct, our definition of god being a man who lives in the clouds looking over us and judging us is bs. However, an adjustment to the concept of "what" God is makes it much more palpable for a modern world. If you were to define the original point of infinity prior to the big bang as a "perfect number", then that could be construed as God. When the big bang occurred, and physics, time, space, matter, etc are all generated, they stem from that perfect number. Thus, God is "all encompassing." Since everything follows mathematical equations to the construct, everything can ultimately be solved. Thus, God is "all knowing." And finally, this would be the proof that we do not live in a world where anything truly random exists. Everything would be deterministic. The idea that we are individuals with true individual thought would be false. We are simply a mathematical product of the universe. And while I don't believe in the man in the sky theory at all, I could potentially believe in a physics/math based theory.   However, most people can't wrap their heads around something like this, as it's not comforting, so man in sky theory wins for the masses.	NULL

I’m not doubting that? Many people convert to religions, but this doesn’t change the fact if you’re religious you’re near-certainly going to be the same religion that you were brought up in either due to family or broader community.    >but saying you believe there's no God because you were never taught about it   I’m saying *I* don’t believe in God because *I* wasn’t brought up being told it was true. When your starting point is that religion is untrue, most people don’t become religious. You did, fair enough, but you’re still working under the assumption that ‘God is real’ is the truth and therefore either the start point or end point, when to most non-religious people Christianity is as unlikely as Thor, Seth, or Ganesh.   Every religious person I know was raised religious, that does not mean every religious person is but it’s the trend. I went to a religious school, but didn’t see a single shred of evidence ever that god may potentially be real.   Honestly, what are the odds that any of us just happened to be born into the ‘true’ religion, at the right place and right time, when throughout history every culture has had their own different ideas of religion?  >is like saying that you vaccines don't work because you never met a doctor.

I prefer rideshare to driving my car to work. That was especially true prior to covid. So, Uber person picks me up, and they were kinda off (I don't know how to explain it) but, anyway, they drifted through a stop sign in a busy place.   There was a police car in a blindspot (to the right) doing enforcement of that area. Of course, they pull the person over. So, he has various issues with something happening before with other things, and he's kinda arguing with the police to just give him a warning or something and they're like 'you can't go through stop signs there are people walking around' and the tone shifted.    They didn't care about me, but I was concerned and I had a meeting, but I'm thinking to myself 'maybe it's a bad idea to reach for laptop'    So, they go back to car (or cars there was more than a single police officer at this point) and he asks me 'what should I do?' - And I'm like I think you should cooperate and not argue with them.    They let him go and stuff, but I was kinda worried that there was going to be a shootout or something but, in addition, this person's behavior was just bizarre	NULL

For me it started with being an altar boy in the 90's and reading about the molestation of altar boys in the Catholic church.  What God would let young men in his service be traumatized like that?  Then I began questioning organized religion and exploring many other religious beliefs.  I became more appalled by how religion used the scant versus of doctrine to weaponize hate of people that observe other  religions despite the large swath of doctrine/dogma that professes to love one another regardless of everything else in the world.    Then came the Trumpers and the evangelicals and folks like Westboro baptist that want to use the dogma to attack others.  What pantheon of Gods would endorse any kind of hatred at this scale?  Couple all of this with my belief in the big bang theory along with science disproving many things....looking at you book of genesis and creationism; and here I am an atheist.    I read a post the other day about someone's mom thinking that people go more toward religion as they get older.  I chuckled because as I have gotten older I have become more of an atheist.  All of that being said, I do appreciate that people need something to lean on when times are tough and they are having a lot of trouble.  For me it is my support system, but for others it could be their church and their pastor.  I feel people need to take solace in whatever helps them through those dark times.  I just think folks also need to look at science/facts and look at what we have proven and what we can do and realize that if they believe in God that God gave those people the talent to conduct those studies and to prove those theorems and take stock in that too.

Between 1980 and 1982 much of Australia was surveyed from the air to estimate density and distribution of kangaroos. The area surveyed covered 5.8 million square kilometres (75% of Australia) and included most of the distribution of the three commercial species. Numbers were estimated as 8.3 million red kangaroos, Macropus rufus, 1.8 million western grey kangaroos, M. fuliginosus, and 5.0 million eastern grey kangaroos, M. giganteus. The unsurveyed eastern highlands probably hold a further 4 million eastern greys, allowing a tentative overall estimate for 1981 of 19 million kangaroos in mainland Australia. The numbers of both grey species are known to be underestimated due to conservative correction factors.	NULL

The company that said they make their motorcycles sound like that because the riders want something that sounds more “powerful” than it actually is?   I don’t even hate harleys. There are plenty of poorly made bikes out there that are still fun. It’s the Harley riders who INSIST that Harley is the best brand out there in all categories. Insane.	NULL

I hope this is good for your question.  Years ago our washing machine broke.  We had a warranty with the company we bought it from.  They sent someone here.  He needed to order a part.  The part came a few weeks later and he came back to fix it.  But he messed up. So he had to come back a few days later.  Then he made a huge mess downstairs and grabbed towels from our linen closet to clean it up (they were so bad that we had to throw them away).  He left. It still wasn’t fixed.  My mother called them and said they better not send the same guy back and she wanted money to replace the towels he destroyed.  They sent a different guy and when he checked it out he was like “oh that guy messed up.”  He needed to order another part.  And the service people said it wouldn’t be in stock for another month I think. When it came in, it was the wrong part. My mother said forget it and after she spoke to a supervisor (loudly but calm), she told them what they could do with the machine (I don’t want to quote her because then I would have to label this NSFW lol) we ended up getting a $200 gift card to replace the towels and we went to a different appliance store to buy a new washing machine.  Part of what she was pissed about was that we had to bring our clothes to a laundromat to wash every week for months (I don’t remember the exact timeline, but I asked my mother) which cost a lot of money.  We never got anything else from that company again and they are now out of business. I wonder why.	NULL

Conservaform Jew: I don’t see G-d as some actual nebulous sky daddy that watches from a distance. I see G-d more as a moral concept in people and our achievements, if we consider we are made in his image; our science, medicine, technological advances and any achievements that lift up and enrich our human race are all G-dly. G-d can be found in mutual aid and philanthropy, in social justice work, anywhere people are doing good for their communities and those in need. I see G-d in nature and how plants and animals have evolved and adapted to best suit their environments. This is not to say that if you don’t believe in G-d you cannot be moral. As long as you are doing positive things, supporting your community, and not actively railing against being religious you have my respect.	NULL

I think the issue is that you’re assuming that these people know that the god they worship is fictitious and that’s just factually incorrect, whether or not you think it’s imaginary cannot and should not impact how you approach this logic problem. These people aren’t worshipping Mickey Mouse, they don’t believe that the god was born from the text but that the text was born from the god. Whether or not you disagree with their beliefs, the fact of the matter is that someone with that logic is not worshipping a text but a god. Fake or not, it is real to them. Kids who believe in Santa, different countries have different ideas as to what Santa does or is, but none of them think there’s multiple Santa’s each traveling to different countries, they all assume it’s one Santa traveling around the world. Whether or not Santa is real (he isn’t), the fact is these people all agree there’s one Santa, and they believe in the “real” Santa not a picture of Santa or a story about Santa.	NULL

You should go for a few sessions to just see if there is anything you need to address, personally I think everyone should have a therapist as a third-party who is *paid* to help you navigate emotional baggage rather than just dumping it on friends & family. When I started going, I wasn't really sure what I was going for, I just knew that I wanted someone to talk to, well it turns out I had A LOT of unprocessed trauma that I didn't realize I was just surpressing with comedy & sarcasm. 13/10 highly recommend therapy.

>If you spend enough time on atheist subs I think you’ll find that you’re a minority on this issue.  Not in my experience. Most atheists view on life is 'live and let live' - I've no problem with anyone's beliefs as long as they're not expecting to influence my life based on them. For some atheists they have had to break out of some pretty abusive situations and are pretty pissed off about it so I'm not going to judge them either.  > You’re right. People do that.  As the saying goes: good people do good things. Bad people do bad things. But for good people to do bad things, that takes religion.  I'll add to that that religion can also make bad people do good things too. But the point is that it changes behaviours.  > If God is timeless then he doesn’t need to be created  This is just wordplay though - just defining God as something doesn't make it true. You might as well say God is real because you've defined him as being real. Can you actually explain how anything could ever be 'timeless'?  > “Because God” is the start of an acceptable answer because it at least makes some reasonable attempt to explain the origin of the universe as opposed to giving up and not making any claim whatsoever about what cannot be absolutely proven.  I fundamentally disagree. "Because God" is the start of closing your brain off to the possible and deciding that you'll use a pre-determined off-the-peg answer rather than remain curious.   Is it better to recognise that there are some things that we just cannot know given current understanding, or is it better to invent answers to fill those gaps?	NULL

The way the law is written and how it is applied is different in this case. There’s hundreds of celebrities and tens of thousands of people that call for the presidents death every year and it’s covered under the first amendment. If you read the incident list on that website you’ll realize how rare it actually is for that law to be enforced and most of the time charges aren’t even filed because of our pure speech protections.  “The court found that his speech urging Obama's assassination ("Re: Obama fk the niggar [sic], he will have a 50 cal in the head soon" and "shoot the nig country fkd for another 4 years+, what nig has done ANYTHING right???? long term???? never in history, except sambos") was protected by the First Amendment.”   Even that is covered under the first amendment.

"New Year's Day: Now is the accepted time to make your regular annual good resolutions. Next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual.

Thirty days from now, we shall have cast our reformation to the winds and gone to cutting our ancient shortcomings considerably shorter than ever. We shall also reflect pleasantly upon how we did the same old thing last year about this time. However, go in, community. New Year's is a harmless annual institution, of no particular use to anybody save as a scapegoat for promiscuous drunks, and friendly calls, and humbug resolutions, and we wish you to enjoy it with a looseness suited to the greatness of the occasion."  -Mark Twain	NULL

I was thinking of something that goes away from the concept of money itself . Everyone works but for each other and themself and people get put to different works( guild system ) based on their talents and interests . Just imagine the first man who said this is my land and you owe me ? ( maybe it was just something that evolded out of animal territorial behaviour like the lion that leads and protects the pride ) . We could just share everyone provides to the community in which ever field they are talented in. ( why is there even a need to make high end middle end and low end devices it would be economy of scales to just manufacture high end for everyone ) .there would need to be real good land planning , reaource planning and other stuff . we could just coexist like a symbiote .

There is no way that it's going to be exactly the same. You're assuming that each discovery will be in line waiting for it to be discovered one after the other.

Kinda related? I was told by the CEO to talk to a new kid (20 maybe still in college) who was learning SQL. I made poorer choices and was working in the call center. I had the highest numbers day 3? I started at $8/hour because he was helping my dad out by giving me a shot. Anyway, every month which was how we got paid, I was to put through fake leads to the for-profit online schools our company worked for. I was told to stop at about 30k in revenue. It took me a day and a half at first. This was very obviously so he could pay his entire call center without actually paying us. It was fraud. ANYWAYS, (sorry I rant) me and that SQL kid got it down to a click of a button. He actually had my back and never said how quick we got it. I used to browse Reddit the entire day. It was glorious.

One day when I was a toddler, maybe something like 4 years old, I SHOULD’VE died.  I wanted to get something from my parent’s room. They had a super big dresser, and I reached for the top drawer. I used a little stool and pulled the handle, and the entire dresser toppled over. Since I was little, pulling on the top drawer handle pulled the dresser drawer DOWN, not OUT. This entire dresser, full of clothes and other stuff fell on me. If I remember correctly (from what my mom told me), my arm also got caught in the drawer as it landed on me.  With such a heavy dresser, and me being so tiny, I could’ve been killed, or injured.  But somehow I walked away totally fine, not a scratch, not even a bruise.	NULL

I think everyone should spend time coming to their own conclusions about the unknowable aspects of the cosmos and there shouldn’t be rigidity to it. That’s why I don’t prescribe to a religion.

You need a reality check by visiting rural India. Millions of people who still live in rural India believe and follow the caste system. Visit villages a few kilometers away from Haryana and try to observe behavioral patterns. In India we still follow the caste system, we don't talk about it as much anymore. We still have OBCs, SC/STs, where we still give them a caste designation. Reparations which were to be made using this system still haven't been made. In temples in Delhi and Noida, we've still seen casteism in recent years. You saying you know Hindus And they don't believe in the caste system doesn't invalidate that people in India, and Hindus in India still majorly follow and believe in the caste system.	NULL

Even Apple don't make this claim. What the M1 chip does is dominated the mid-high tier for similarly specced devices. Which IS awesome in itself.  The issue with all this is there a lot more going on than the processor. Storage, RAM, GPU etc. This kind of tunnel vision is how people but shitty laptops with 32GB of RAM and an i3 with 126 GB of HDD storage.   The graphical capabilities for gaming and other 3D rendering stuff is far far below what non devices can be capable of.   And the price. Holy shit. Looking at the pro right now. It's an extra $400 for an additional 16GB of RAM. Another $400 too add on a single TB of storage. WTF!?   Twice it's price class indeed. You could buy another MacBook just because you upgraded a few components.  What IS good is that they've added back a decent amount of ports and it's reasonably fixable again.	NULL

Im a water scout so we have a lot of boats and we also maintain these boats to stay in a good condition. So every winter we get the boats out of the water and we clean them and paint them again so that their wont be any leaks. One winter I guess around 4 years ago we had flipped one of the boats to clean and paint the side that is normally under water. This meant that there were a lot of shells and little oysters sticking to the surface which I tried to sweep of using a broom. I did this standing on the boat and when I was done I jumped of the boat holding the broom in my hand. But unfortunately  the broom hit the ground first and I kind of jumped on the broomstick which almost pierced me right through my chest. Luckily it didnt but I couldnt breath or shout for help for a good 5 minutes. I really thought I was going to die and thanked everyone in my life for the amazing times. And then someone finally found me and helped me through it all until I started to breath and talk again.   TLDR: jumping off a boat on to a broom almost piercing myself right through the chest.	NULL

I wouldn't (and don't believe) simply because of the concept of it.  If there is an all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-loving God, why do we have genocides, famine, why do people die from cancer under it's watch (because it was God's will to give little Johnny a carcinoma?). For a being that demands blind faith, subservience, and worship, God certainly hasn't done anything to warrant those examples of narcissism. As far as I'm concerned, should there be a God, it doesn't deserve the things it demands.  It doesn't take religion to be a good person, and many people either forget that, or base their good deeds around their religion, and it's disgusting.	NULL

Well, when I was an infant, doctors mutilated my genitals due to the influence of a popular religious cult that believes that a human sacrifice is the greatest thing to have ever happened.

Here's why find this idea baffling. If someone chooses to live as a man, fine. No skin off my nose. But men don't have the organs to bear children. Maybe someday there will be a way to transplant them. For now, though, conceiving & bearing a child is limited to individuals born with those organs. And once those organs are in use, by default you're back to living as a woman. At least that how it seems to me.  Maybe it's something I just don't get, because I've never wanted to either live as a man or bear children, much less do both at once.	NULL

Matthew 21:22 does not mean you get whatever you want because you want it. It still has to align with the will of God. 1 John 5:14 better clarifies this- “This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.” Part of having faith is trusting that God will do what is most fitting with His plan/purpose for you.  But And this is where many atheists don’t want to believe. The views expressed on trials, suffering, and carrying of crosses are not taken well. Even many Protestant believe that God wants us to have everything we want and be happy all the time. But the truth is that God, seeing all possibilities, has a plan set for us. Strong prayer with strong faith can, of course, lead God to intercede, but it’s not 100% guaranteed. I myself wasn’t bullied specifically, but suffered many hardships s as a child. I could have been resentful for many things, but realized that everything I went through made me the person I am today. I was able to grow in compassion and understanding , be a better listener, etc. My suffering was part of the plan He had for me.   And before anyone says, not all human suffering is what God desires. Much of the suffering on earth today is from the free will of oneself and others. While God calls us to our higher selves, many will ignore His calling and fall prey to the trappings if this world. They will take, kill, destroy, etc. That doesn’t mean it can’t be turned to good	NULL

Not a man, just putting that out there because of the thread. Psychedelics helped me a lot, although people shouldn’t look at them as something that’ll just cure you, it can help. Just because it’s being studied to treat mental illness doesn’t mean it’s suddenly always good for everyone, I mean alprazolam and clonazepam have been used to treat mental illness for awhile now, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for everyone or anything close to a cure. We all know what happens with things go wrong with that. I’m aware it’s hard to compare something like alprazolam to psychedelics, but I’m just pointing out that whether or not things are approved treatments they have risks. You’ve just got to stay safe when you take psychedelics and start small, it helped me but I know a lot of people that were very negativity affected by them, although nobody talks about that it seems.

Being emotional, being sensitive, being loving, being playful, ...  Started with my ex that she at some point told me that this made me look too feminine to her and she wants more a "man" but ofc when i closed myself off with all my emotions I was being "toxic".  My second relationship started off similarly, i was her first bf aswell so I had some explaining to do that all men, even men above 40 years are normally more playful and more sensitive when they open up to someone.  Initially, this was one of the reasons why i didnt want anyone who was never in a relationship before... but love can be difficult sometimes. Anyways my current girlfriend understood after a while but it still hurt at the beginning, especially again being called not masculine just because i was not a macho.	women

Please provide any sort of reputable study that claims with confidence a 70% number.  You’re still not understanding how wildly oversimplified the point you’re trying to make is. You are neglecting the fact that there are also causes of bad diet outside of personal responsibility, and environmental toxins that invisibly contribute to all sorts of disorders and pathologies that get lumped in with that.  I agree diet is an incredible problem, but the reason your take is shit is that you are assuming socialized health care will cost MORE, when we spend shittons on privatized health care right now.  And I say we, because your taxes go to the government, the government provides corporate welfare to failing companies in the form of handouts and tax credits, based on bullshit trickle down voodoo economics and some idea of “job creation” that literally gets ignored.  These companies then turn around and do wht they want, frequently damaging the health of the people who live in these areas to do so.  We’re already paying for all this shit, you’re just blind to how the current system works and how it’s being dismantled. Go spend some time on r/noctor. Those people are the people who will be presented as “doctor” in ten years time.  US health care is in the middle of a race to the bottom that no-one gives a shit about. We hold financial ideologies ahead of actual medical goals and we’re suffering as a nation, top to bottom, over it.	NULL

I agree with you that Mathematics is just a tool to be used, if a very powerful and dangerous one.  As for the creation myth, or at least the Christian one in Genesis. It is not meant to be a scientific explanation for our existence. It is meant to be a poetic exploration of the human condition. I like to think that just because it is not technically accurate does not mean that it does not contain truth.   I think evolution is very likely to be completely accurate. And a fun fact about the Big Bang Theory is that it was first theorized by a Catholic Priest Georges Lemaître.	NULL

I highly recommend looking up Dr. Stephen Collins the archaeologist who found the sight of Sodom and Gomorrah in 2014 simply from the texts in the Bible pretty amazing because it was written of its destruction 800 years afterwards in  Genesis but  There's zero documentation of Sodom and Gomorrah in any other neighboring civilization of the time which leads one to be believe that the claim that the  Writings of the bibles stories were divine in nature according to Jesus and his disciples they claimed that the Bible was written by God thru them.

A cousin of mine experienced this I believe. Sadly, they took their own life by car. Drove at high speed into an embankment.

Family was told tho they died on impact	NULL

There was one where the Covid vaccine was going to kill all who took it in 2 years by dissolving our DNA or something.  This was relatively early on in the pandemic.

When someone has hypothermia, what you want to do is heat their torso, but keep the arms and legs cold.   As soon as those blood vessels open, warm blood rushes into the limbs, and comes back as cold blood, straight into the vital organs.   You want to take it very very slow. Having a few cells die in your legs isn't nearly as bad or as permanent as having a few cells die in your heart or brain.	NULL

My current job barely covered inflation with their pay bumps, so after ~3 years (1 as a hired consultant aimed at becoming in house, 2 as in house) I went and got a new job with better benefits and +50% salary (~56k to ~87k USD with today's conversion rate) and stock options  after a year that pay dividends (company is structured to pay out 50% of net profits as dividends based on % owned). I could have gone for a provision based job instead that would have been somewhere between +70% to +120% depending on my projects and how many hours I could bill. But I liked the other company and the benefits there more than the potential added pay.	NULL

You’re limiting your definition of “evidence” to “scientific evidence” which relies on repeatable observations.  There are non-scientific evidences which attempt to explain observations through experience, intuition, logic, and tradition. You are free to reject those as baseless, but they’re a reality for many people.    You are free to take me to trial for the murder of that guy in my city, and I may even be incarcerated for it... not because of scientific evidence, but more likely because of the intuition and experience of the prosecutor and judge.  There are many folks in prison right now serving time because the “evidence” presented against them was non-scientific, but it was enough for someone to believe.	NULL

Brought up catholic and got so sick of the women hating, gay hating, child raping, multi national money making power corporation that is the Catholic Church. There was just no link between what Jesus said and what the church does. Then well, science. I just saw religion as a way of explaining things that weren’t understood at the time. We know more now. Sure we don’t know what happens when we die but I’m pretty sure there is no heaven or angels or St Paul’s gates or however many virgins.   The concept of the leap of faith and believing in things with no evidence was just a big No from me. The the Taliban and what they do in the name of religion. It’s pure ignorance used to justify power. I’m done with the hate and war and killing over my imaginary sky fairy is right and yours is wrong. I live a good life, I’m kind, I’m thoughtful, I’m generous and I help my neighbour, if there is a god, it will understand I did my best. So it really doesn’t matter.	NULL

Right wing here, here's a couple left wing opinions.  Mandate the COVID vaccine and any subsequent boosters. No religious exemptions, only strict medical exemptions.  Abortion is 100% unrestricted.  Ban coal use immediately, ban sale of ICE vehicles by 2025, all energy must come from renewables by 2030.  Tax the rich. 50% for people making $1 million or more.  &#x200B;  I'm right wing because:  Unrestricted firearm access, probably stopping at tanks and fighter jets. End most welfare benefits. More military and police funding. Build the wall, deport all illegal immigrants. School choice (public school left a horrible taste in my mouth). Massive import tariffs needed. Not into the whole nonbinary/changing genders community, I've had way too many negative interactions with those people.	NULL

Initially my reasoning was "well I have no proof."  Which I do still stand by but there's more to it then that. So many groups preach hate disguised as love for their own benefit based off of their interpretation of some text.  I just can't imagine that if there is a higher power they would be discriminatory.  Mankind has taken whatever and ran with it to fill out their own agendas and I can't stand behind hate.  Of course there are groups who are accepting and loving, which is fantastic, but the loud majority spread hate and I don't want to be connected to something that hurts others	NULL

Now after drinking all that water i really wanted to take a leak but she wouldn't let me as I was one of those who were sent out of the class.  I pissed my pants and everyone outside was looking at me, soon the class teacher got to know and I went to the washroom to change my pants, what followed was a bit of playful teasing by my close friends which continues till this day.

See I’m the exact opposite. The older I get, the more I realize that what I enjoyed in my teens and early 20’s, is the only stuff I actually enjoy.   I’ve spent the 20 years since that period, listening to eclectic mixes of everything, to try to be open to everything. I’m slowly realizing I don’t like anything else. In 20 years sure I’ve heard neat songs, but generally nothing that makes me feel the way my nostalgia music makes me feel. Nothing fills me with energy, or pulls at my emotion or makes me feel strong or happy like this one weird little niche pocket of music.  I gave up. I like what I like. No one gives Boomers or the elderly crap for not liking anything other than Led Zeppelin, Cat Stevens or “oldies”. It’s who they are, it’s their stuff. So fuck it, I’m a 43 year old chick who listens a crap ton of Rancid, some 3rd wave ska+ same era punk, early 90s hip hop R&B, a touch of grunge and Garth Brooks. It’s who I am. Nothing makes me feel things the way my 27 favorite Rancid songs do, I spent 20 years looking and didn’t find a single one that was close.	NULL

Lack of evidence beyond the anecdotal. Everything that I’ve ever heard of as proof of a god or higher power can be explained naturally and without an appeal to the supernatural. And even if it couldn’t be explained, we can’t just assume that it’s god(s) or a higher power. In short, lack of any compelling evidence to merit belief. I’m open to the idea but I don’t just blindly believe things; faith is for the gullible	NULL

It's impossible to parse an omnipotent being as being this fucking bad at putting some shit together.  I mean look around, it's a shitshow. Even if God was real and heaven was a place, it's fairly fucking obvious even his supporters don't know wtf to do to get there, the documentation sucks.  If there is a God, he didn't do a good job with all this Earth bullshit, and omnipotent superbeings don't do bad jobs on accident. So, it's either we're here to suffer and in that case, he can eat a fat dick, or we're here alone, an accident created by a pool of goo and then who the fuck cares.  Either way, I'm not going to be nice to assholes just to get to a place I don't even know exists, and I'm not going to pretend with people saying that's what they're doing yet doing the exact opposite. None of it has brought anything but pain and misery to the majority of people in the modern world.	NULL

I never did it, but I had several coworkers (some in management) tell me it was super easy to steal from our gas station convenience store employer as long as you were the one unloading the truck. They'd only ever have one person unpacking the entire store's 3x weekly deliveries and it would be delivered anywhere from 11pm to 3am depending on your store's location in the district. Basically poor supervision allows for sticky fingers if you're careful. The reason I know that they weren't lying was because I walked into a coworkers bathroom while hanging out at their house, and they had taken three gigantic rolls of toilet paper and stuffed them under the sink for home use.

Well to answer the question, “If sex is more enjoyable, is it a form of mutilation?”  A man circumcised at birth couldn’t tell you the difference. So how are they to answer that?   In all the other circumcision threads everyone always pounces on the circumcised guys too, telling them cannot masturbate, or have xx% less “sensitivity”.   Maybe sex is more enjoyable for circumcised men? I’ve had multiple partners tell me they preferred my circumcised penis to the “water weenies” they’ve experienced. Fluffing my ego is pretty enjoyable, on top of the sex which has always been enjoyable.  Any actual scientific study on the subject shows that circumcision has benefits of less disease and cancers, with the initial risk of infection or anesthetic complications that are there regardless of elective surgery type. But those studies get attacked by people claiming there is a global foreskin illuminati conspiracy.   I didn’t have my sons circumcised, and ZERO percent of my decision making thought went into their “sensitivity level” or is this “mutilation”.	NULL

I see loads of terrible things happening to people on the internet, with very little help whose life is just a downhill spiral.

TL;DR - Insecurity, cheating on the mother of your kids frequently, lying, jealously. These are traits both a man and woman could have, maybe swap the mother for father.    Friend at work (female, 33) has a boyfriend / baby daddy of two with her that is still in his mid twenties (think 24?) that will not allow her to have me on any social media platform and starts arguments with her if I comment on a mutual friends post that she also commented on or if I send her money on Venmo for ordering and grabbing lunch.   Should probably mention I am a gay 34 male. She’s told him this, apparently he doesn’t believe it and thinks I’m playing some type of con.   They were still living at her moms where she basically takes care of the kids while he goes out with friends to bars and random trips on the weekends. Every time they fight and she kicks him out (only lasts a week if that) he comes back with the ‘I just want to make the family work - think of the girls!’    Funny/not so funny story when she kicked him out the one time and he was gone for about a month. He said he was staying at a friends house, she didn’t realize it was a female friend that he fucked around with before they were together. One night she was going through instagram and saw some pictures of a mutual friends party and saw a picture of him being a little to friendly with said girl.   This of course was shortly after one of the “I’m just thinking of the girls and our family” speeches. She texted him a screenshot and said oh yeah you’re really thinking about the family, to which he accused her of spying on him and tried to turn it around as he fault.	NULL

TSA’s focus is mainly on security, not on specifically seeking out drugs, but if they do find them in the course of their other security searches, then you will of course face legal repercussions. This includes being caught with marijuana (regardless of if it’s legal in your origin, destination, or even both), as flights are considered federal territory, and therefore possession is still criminalized.   Certain airports will not arrest for possession under a certain amount, and some jurisdictions have similar policies in general, but bringing weed (and of course other illegal drugs) on any flight, /especially/ an international one (as you could easily be accused of int’l smuggling), isn’t a good idea. ([x](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/02/18/6-questions-about-traveling-with-marijuana-answered/))  In short, yes they absolutely do care, even TSA’s job isn’t specifically to seek them out.

Patient here, I actually at the end of recovery.  I have no more mental health problems.  I don't take and medication.  After I become employed, which will happen soon, I will be done with therapy.  Won't have any more meetings because there won't be anything left to talk about.    Advice:   Starting medication is not a bad thing. I was so sad when I was prescribed pills for depression.  The only people I heard of who took pills were people  who took them from the streets, Dr House(tv) who was an addict and people who had a life long illness.  But I really needed them and they really helped and I take nothing now.  Took me six months to reduce from full prescription to no medication.  It's okay to take medication.  It's not a life sentence and your not bad in any way for having to take them.  Progress from going to rock bottom and broken all to way to being so happy, hopeful and looking forward to a bright future takes a lot of work.  I was so stressed at the beginning because I wasn't where I wanted to be.  It felt like I wasn't making any progress.  I didn't realize this until the end but how it actually works is progress starts as the tiniest snowball.  You don't even know it's there.  Then you keep going bit by bit. It's okay to not work on yourself everyday.  It took a lot of practice for me to be able to work on myself everyday.  You also need to look not just where you want to be and where you are now but behind you.  You need to be proud of any progress from where you were.  You need to understand the past and how you got there to really improve on yourself.  You aren't supposed to live in the past but you are supposed to understand how you got to where you are to pave the way forward. And by the end you end with this massive beautiful snowball that you are proud of.  I am so proud of where I am and my snowball.  I am not ashamed in anyway for how I felt or how I was back then.  Neither should you.  It is so hard to work on yourself and takes a long time.  I took me six years from broken to now.  But it is worth it.  Trust me.  Take those steps forward.  Keep building your snowball.	NULL

That college/jobs/ careers have more factors to them than just an annual wage. Your career should be stable but not overtake your life.  I always hear "be an xyz they make this amount of money a year." I agree that you should do something that comfortably pays the bills, but there's many people my age being pressured into majors that they hate because of their parents. There's a reason doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc make a lot of money: their jobs are difficult and they often have horrible mental health/ work life balance. It takes a certain type of person to be successful in those roles, and although the wage is a large draw, you shouldn't actively hate what you're studying.   Basically, they put 100% on stability and ignore all the other factors	NULL

People base their "criticism" against God based off of whatever they think God is, and not what He really is.  Basically all the comments about child cancer, rapists, genocide etc. etc. is the consequence of free will.  If you have the free will to do good, other guy also has the free will to do bad.  Moreso, bacteria is much as the same creation of God as is plants and humans. It is the free will of bacteria to evolve to kill humans, as is the free will of humans to kill animals. And most importantly, it is the free will of humans to basically choose the right course or action to be in God's favor or not.

I was raised to ask questions and seek knowledge. When I was a teen, I moved to a different part of the country and started going to church (forced). I immediately realized these people explained everything with God instead of actually learning how things worked. Even basic psychological principles, the Christians I interacted with would say it’s all God.   I think what really hit home was a specific interaction with an older lady. I asked this her why she was so nice to people who were mean to her. Her answer was, “because God says to.”  I asked her to think about it for a moment. Is there any other reason? She said no.  I then explained my reasoning for being nice to people no matter what. I told her that person might be having a bad day and they probably aren’t even mad at anyone. There is no point in letting someone else’s bad attitude influence your happiness. This Godly woman in her 50s told me she had never thought about it that way.

But baseball isn’t the only sport. And if you’re molested by a coach, that trauma might make you not want to play anymore (or to encourage others to play either.) So you might play a different sport.  Your original claim was based on the idea that you “enjoyed baseball.” If you were traumatized by a sexual assault from a baseball coach as a child, you likely won’t enjoy baseball as much afterwards. So why encourage others to play if you don’t enjoy it?  If you take issue with OP’s grandpa removing themselves from something they associated with sexual trauma, and think they should have “gotten over it” and given it another shot, I’m not sure what to tell you other than “no.”	NULL

Leftist is a distinct and absolute range of points on the political spectrum.  It’s your socialist, your social democrats (maybe, if you’re being generous your third way liberals), and your syndicalists (I’m likely missing a few).

"god" is nothing more than a self-made bogeyman that people use to pretend to be moral. And if it isn't "god," then somehow Satan is to blame. Either way, personal responsibility gets abdicated to an imaginary being so people can feel better about themselves.  I grew up Mormon. I saw a fuckton of hypocrisy in its teachings, and eventually left due to it (small example: I had to fight my mom to be allowed to have *Nightmare Before Christmas* stuff because it was "ugly", but was forced to go to Seminary, where I learned that it was a-okay to throw a woman to rapists because Jesus. Judges 19:11-31 gave me nightmares). When I left, I tried other branches of Christianity, but found the exact same problems. Now I'm an atheist.  Looking back, the most self-righteous, judgemental, hypocritical, cruelest people I knew were some flavor of Christian, from my own family, to a roommate who ripped me off of rent, to ex-friends whose friendship was conditional on church membership, to church leaders and teachers being so hateful in their condemnation of certain groups while also claiming to "love thy neighbor".  Most of my friends now are pagans, atheists, or deists who focus on just their relationship with whatever god they believe in and keep other people out of it. It's so much nicer to hang out and have a conversation without fear of misstepping or being judged.  I do not have the cognitive dissonance required to be a Christian. I can't dislike someone for arbitrary bullshit like having sex out of marriage, being queer, wearing whatever clothes, choosing to drink, etc. and then turn around and make excuses for people like Josh Duggar because he "made a mistake" (read: gets a pass because he believes in the Christian god, because no one in this country would be defending him if he were Muslim) and "we should forgive him because god does."  If your god is going to sit back and let a child get molested to begin with because "it's part of the plan" or "free will" (which I noticed only ever excuses an abuser's actions, and is NEVER used to defend the victim's free will to not get assaulted...) or "he works in mysterious ways," then fuck your god. Your allegedly all-powerful god could have smited that abuser and didn't just to make an innocent person suffer. If a human does that, they're an evil sadistic fuck, but "god" gets a pass for not only allowing, but outright hurting and killing people, and his followers excuse it because he has superpowers.  Yeah. Humanity is cruel enough without a bogeyman to help it sink even lower into depravity by justifying abuse against the "right" people.	NULL
Off topic but here is my prediction.   I firmly believe that ‘94 will repeat itself. The current president of Rwanda is Tutsi and he absolutely hates the Hutus (for good reason). They are now marginalized and will fight back again.   The Tutsi’s got preferential treatment by the colonizers because they had more European features and thus considered more civilized and hence closer to whites. The Hutus on the other hand were more Bantu looking. The best jobs went to the former, more money was spent on their education, better housing, medical care etc.   The first 2 presidents of Rwanda were Hutu. How the eff was that going to work in country were the Hutus were treated as third class citizens after the Belgians and Tutsis.   And it’s replaying itself right now.	NULL

Sure, it seems I have to be there in person though.   I went to the races and told someone to put money on a horse, was horrified with how much they did because of me, but they took me to dinner after because they won so much. Also, I'll sit next to, or even walk past pokies (slots) and the player will win free games or jackpots straight away... it's bizarre.  I only put about $5-$10 on every week-month or so, but guess I even out mostly.

Yeah I fell in to the trap of ignoring or even accepting red flags because I was trying to be an understanding person, but in the end it just trapped me in relationships that weren’t healthy. And when it happens so many times in a row you do start to wonder if it’s your fault despite your best efforts. But now I’m in a healthy relationship with someone I consider my best friend and we never fight or put each other down. Just goes to show it’s easy to fall into abusive relationships, especially when its most of what you’ve experienced and you don’t know its not normal.	NULL

The first article in the Bill of Rights, as presented to Congress, would have certainly ensured this. It's the only one of the 12 suggested amendments that's still unratified. It would require One Congressman per 50,000 people. Right now, we haven't added any seats in over 100 years, and each congressman "represents" 800,000 people. In reality, there are 12-15 unelected aides doing the work for each district, because the congressman has to raise thousands of dollars *every day* to buy enough TV ads to reach 800,000 people.	NULL

In all the stories of gods they act like the worst kinds of mean bosses.  The worst!  Why would you support such a system of favoritism and random punishments when you could move away and just ignore it all?  The absolutely crazy thing about humans is that a lot of them will worship a rich person just like a god - they will excuse any horror committed, any smite, any cruelty, and bow, scrape, or eat poop for favors.  I just don't understand it.  The world around is full of so many random acts that are inconsistent - even being kind to every person around you does not result in reciprical treatment.  You have to watch your back and be on guard all the time.  So-called "all-powerful" gods can't even cure headaches, common colds, or rainy days.  What a crock of shit.	NULL

I know. But I don't think its a reason to deny one kid from moving on, thus having a permanent record, which can deny him from getting into college. I'm not saying we make a habit of it. The system we have isn't good.   We have rules for a reason. But we need a human heart and mind to know when and how to enforce those rules. We're not machines. We can think for ourselves to know when a rule is good in one situation vs another situation.	NULL

I'm not saying people were richer because religion but your statistic also doesn't show the opposite.   Why are you bringing equality up in times that slavery was standard?    But fact is no country/society grew without religion, it controlled the population, it controlled the kings and commanders (religion were always advisors), gave an excuse for people to learn and preserve knowledge (it could happen other way of course, but who would pay for it)   Monotheistic religions even made more, because multiple countries would work together and would conquer even if overseas using the excuse of religion.  Even the Vikings that were known to  pillage and rape needed the Gods incentive to do so.   So many lives were sacrificed in name of the gods throughout history, either in battles, travels, etc ... We would not be here like we are now without it.	NULL

That thought process fundamentally misunderstands what theism(or at least traditional monotheism) asserts about the cosmological role of a god, and the philosophical subject that theism or atheism is debated within.  A god is suggested as an explanation for contingent phenomena, not as a superfluous thing that also happens to exist in addition to an atheistic system.   Saying there is a god is like saying a table is held up by its legs. Talking about a flying spaghetti monster is talking about something that exist on or adjacent to that table and is completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand about what is, or is not, holding up the table.

I said at its price point, and when you’re talking about a $2000+ laptop your primary audience is professionals. You have a point on touch which is certainly decisive and many Mac users wish Apple would bite the bullet and add it to its laptop line. But look at any laptop in its price range and compare them. I’ll make it easy, they all look pretty much the same.   I’d argue that at its price point, your main comparison is performance and battery because those are your primary differentiators. That’s the only think you are getting at that level that is different from a $1000 laptop. And a few of those I will immediately disregard, very few users care about upgrading their laptop and I/O is basically the same. And of course OS preference comes into play because that’s what we’ve been talking about the whole thread.	NULL

It depends on the pepper spray.  Whenever I bought pepper spray in the past I would test in on myself to make sure it works.  With all the ones bought from Walmart and such, doing this was fine.  It burned, vision was blurry like being underwater, and it was hard to keep my eyes open like walking out into the sun from inside on a bright day.  Bad but bearable enough that I kept doing it every time I got a new one.  Then I tried it with pepper spray I got from a police supply store.  That was some instant regret.  Throat locking up, can't breathe, burning several times worse than cheap pepper spray, could not open my eyes no matter how hard I tried.  I immediately ran to the shower, blind, and washed it off.  My face was swollen for a week and had chemical burns that looked I had been crying acid tears.  Fortunately my face completely recovered within a week.	NULL

My mother always dated men who beat her. (My dad never did, they split before I was born).  Anyways, she dated this one huge asshole named Eduardo. He was from Mexico, didn’t speak a word of English, served in the Mexican army, had the prettiest green eyes, was super fit. Idk why, but she wouldn’t leave him despite every bright red flag he’d show. He did not work, he spent everyday sitting in the living room listening to Spanish music and drinking, he never talked to me (not exaggerating), and he beat her almost every night throughout my childhood.  One day I was tired. I was only 9 years old. I had this bright orange rubber soft ball I found outside playing - it was one of those balls that had the indented holes throughout it and was solid as a rock. I think you can find them in batting cages? In the midst of her screams, i threw that thing to at his head as hard as I could and busted it open.  His eyes shot straight at me and he let her go to grab me. He threw me across the room and pinned me underneath him and just stared into my eyes while his blood dripped down his face. He didn’t say a single word, just stared at me. My mom screamed and after a minute, he let me go and went back to my mom.  Everything calmed down and I went to the restroom exhausted and defeated once again. I discovered he pinned me down to let his blood drip all over my face. I still remember the exact trail coming down his face to this day, over 20 years later…	NULL

Was raised Catholic and was always a bit skeptical. My brother was murdered when I was 13 and it really shifted my views. First, many peoples beliefs are my church seemed illogical. The fact that their kids were spared in the shooting it was considered god’s will and presumably favor. My brother’s death was somehow also god calling him home which made absolutely no sense to me at 13. What was his life for then? It just continued to break down from there. Why pray if god already knows your thoughts and hopes? You have to express it in this formal way for it to maybe be answered? But still maybe not because god works in mysterious ways. The concept of heaven seemed obviously like a way to deal with our mortality with bonus points for being good and punishment for eternity for not being almighty god’s idea of moral.	NULL

You need to realize that some people claim to do things in the name of God but in reality they aren’t. Being a Christian myself it’s sad to admit that some Christians hate others and do stuff that the Bible tells them not to do. It’s either cuz they’re lying about being Christian (hopefully not) or they’re confused. Which is why I pray to God to help them and every Christian follow his Word better, for if we follow his Word like how he intended us too, then everyone in the world would see how great God’s love is, and then everyone would want to turn to God and confess and repent.

What's the point of having hundreds of nuclear heads, if you make it clear you are not going to use them?  How do you define "World"?  I don't think that would entail a large scale war like Ww1 and Ww2. It would be easier to invade other countries, control their resources and block trade with your enemy.  Add propaganda to the mix, and you get an extremely volatile social atmosphere. Enough to make government fall, by the hands of its own people.   In the countries at war, we would have lots of random shortages.   In the countries that got invaded, poverty would increase because most resources will be directed towards the invading power. So how would they react? They would be pissed off, but what can you do against American, Chinese or Russian capitalism?  Not so much. They could wipe out your country if they wanted to, just to make a step forward in their destabilization strategy.	NULL

Music does not have to sound original or complex to sound good. It’s enough for it to sound good - and sometimes that’s even based on timing and set and setting.

There are three possibilities: 1. God exists and is just. In which case I would not be judged or punished for questioning his existence   2. God exists and is not just. In which case I would be judged for having questions. But why should I want to worship an unjust god? (And why would he judge me for giving me a brain that questions the supernatural?)   3. God does not exist. In which case I only have my time on earth to be as just as I can to others  -My interpretation of Marcus Aurelius' meditations.

I thought about that too when the text messages started and I didn’t want to be unfriendly. Even awkwardly trying to add me on social media I can understand too. It just didn’t sit right with me because in our 15-20 minute conversation he didn’t ask for my number himself, or ask to add me on social media, or even say that he wanted to talk more or later. The conversation ended with the transaction of buying a comic book so to me I thought he was just a really good store employee who did his job for the day.  I didn’t accept his social media requests because he was still a stranger to me. I was still going to go back to the store on Friday even with these things happening because it was still in the realm of being socially awkward and I figured we could chat in person so I can get a feel of his intentions.  He crossed the line by surprising me in a library late at night while I was by myself because it showed he had enough initiative to come find me. Even if he innocently saw me in the library (which is suspicious to me because I never saw him on campus again) he didn’t come say “Hi” he hid behind me and tested me to see if I would pick up my phone. That was what triggered the fear.  But yeah, I totally was hoping he was just socially awkward and unknowingly crossing some social boundaries. Hell, it still may be true because he completely stopped after that night, but man I never want to experience something like that again.	NULL

Tantrumming after being told "No" or getting rejected. Also, not listening to people when they are presenting a differing perspective or opinion. Basically a lack of basic empathy skills, forcing their options and feelings on others. Using manipulation or physically bullying someone to get their way. Bonus points for temper tantrumming and blaming others when manipulation and bullying don't give them what they want and drives people away.   Also when they "know" how people think or feel without asking... Huge red flag. Someone who makes constant assumptions about their partner without talking about things first with them is a trash human. They think they are dating a fantasy not a person which is a huge sign of immaturity.   Also guys who try to rush into relationships under the guise of "being friends" and use basic kindness as a manipulation tactic for sex.   Thinking someone is your friend only to find out they were only nice to you for sex is literally the most whiplashing experience. I would debate it hurts as much if not more than being rejected. You are losing someone who you thought was your friend only to realize all your time with them was a huge lie. It makes it's hard to trust guys afterwards and causes you to be paranoid about your relationships with guys. So many people don't understand how traumatic that can be especially if you get sexually assaulted or worse because you trusted a guy as your friend and they just used that trust to get access to you.   Hard pass on any guy who exhibits this behaviors. Immaturity in a guy typically is given a pass and is even expected in some cultures, but I would debate that immaturity in men can be dangerous to others safety. If you see a guy exhibit anything I mention above, run.	NULL

If God is truly omnipotent, he could have created a universe in which we could both have free will and never have anything bad happen. To say than an omnipotent god *had* to make things this way, is to deny his omnipotence altogether.	NULL
Government should be inefficient. It should be doing things that no business ever would, like employing people just in case they're needed, or stockpiling way more than is needed right now because it might be needed in a rare event in the future, or spending way too much money to give access to a program for the last 1% of people that are hard to get access to. The goals of government, and the goals of business are just different.   Everyone agrees that waste is bad, but defines "waste" is very different. It's good to have conservatives around that push to streamline things, but they need to stop trying to run the government like a business. It's not and it shouldn't be.	NULL

When I was about 7 years old, I started getting sleep paralysis. The scariest situation I was in though, was when I had sleep paralysis while my face was on my pillow, so I couldn’t breathe or move.

I dont even want to imagine what could’ve happened right then and there.	NULL

This is my only complaint about voter ID laws.  I have a right, as a US citizen who has never been convicted of a felony, to participate in US civic life by voting.  This right is not based on my housing status or my ability to afford an ID card.  Requiring people to have an ID that they must pay for to vote is a poll tax, and it disenfranchises the poor and homeless (yes, the homeless can vote too if they are citizens).  IDs should be free, plain and simple.  Then pass your ID requirements.  (Yes, I know the point of these laws is to disenfranchise the poor, but let’s at least air the hypocrisy for all to see)	NULL

I'm centre left, but I quite like having a Monarchy (UK). There are many problems with it and some of the people who make up the royal family, and they certainly shouldn't have privileged protection from the law. But our monarchy is almost 1,000 years old. It's a tradition and institution that defines our nation, and the lives of our forebears.   To abolish it because of today's societal standards has not only been tried before, but feels like we'd lose something irreplaceable. In a world where so much happens, so much changes day to day, having something constant, something enduring, is rather refreshing.	NULL

When i was in my mid 20s, a crazy blizzard had just started and I had a rare day off. I decided to walk to the drug store before it got too bad outside and while I was standing in line, I noticed this tall white guy 2 people in front of me with his head turned to the side, staring down at me out of the corner of his eyes, with a disgusted look on his face. As we waited, I noticed him looking at me a few more times and got a bad vibe. He checked out and left and I took my time, hoping he'd be gone by the time I got outside. He was not.     I walked out and turned right to go to the sidewalk. Out of the coder of my eye I saw him standing in the parking spot closest to the door. He exited the parking lot and started following me. It was like 2pm and there were a ton of people out, so I didn't immediately panic. I used to work at a coffee shop on the way to my house, so my plan was to get there for safety.      I looked back every now and then and he was walking at me so intently and was getting closer. The way he was looking at me and the ground he was gaining on me sent me into flight mode and I took off running in the snow in my snow boots, which slowed me down significantly.     I made it to the coffee shop and told them what happened. We looked at the front windows and he walked past, looking inside for me. Then a few moments later he walked back the direction he had come. He did this a couple more times, before I was finally pissed and ran outside to....idk, fight him? And he was gone. Then I called the police and looked over my shoulder as I walked home.      I never saw him again after that and luckily I live in a new city now, but that was the first time I had actually felt targeted by someone. Hunted. I'm assuming he thought I drove and was waiting in the parking lot to follow me to my car, but decided to try to follow me home instead.	NULL

Girl I dated in uni was a preppy, clean cut ‘glamorous’ kind of girl and I was a scruffy chubby music nerd so I guess I was her bit of rough or some ‘project’ she was trying to shine into a diamond. Looking back we were probably both just using each other.   She offered to cut my hair and I told her that would be great, thanks, just do it the way I ask. She ended up giving me a preppy clean cut look, completely contrary to my wishes.   It felt like rape, and when I asked why she’d done it her way when I specifically told her how I wanted it, she and her housemates just laughed and said it looked much better this way and she was trying to clean me up like Belle giving the Beast a makeover.

Ah let’s see what are some faves.  Chuck some Tony chachares in a stuffed mushroom recipe and suddenly you’re the only person who gets asked to make stuffed mushrooms at gatherings anymore  I make a watermelon caprese every year where you sub in watermelons and strawberries for the tomato, huge crowd pleaser because everyone loves the way caprese looks but a lot of folks don’t like tomatoes.  Not exactly cooking but you can make your own limoncello really easily and give it out as wedding favors or similar and everyone will be impressed.   Oh, curry! Curry is one of those things no one brings to a gathering, so you’ll always look interesting when you bring it. I do a chickpea curry that is slessentiaply “dump several cans of tomatoes and chick peas and some seasonings in a crockpot, stew on high for 6 hours, add a can of coconut milk and serve over rice”  There’s a couple I really enjoy making :3  https://imgur.com/a/y8aS47V/  Pics of the limoncello(this batch was lavender limoncello so it’s a weird color) and the watermelon caprese	NULL

Or a tidal wave rises up so impossibly sharp and tall that I know it will swallow me under, and I see them in the clear water. Big eyes rolling to watch me as the water gets ready to crash. And then wooden boards from shattered ships are swirling around me and sand hits my face and water fills a hundred feet above me, and they are everywhere, bellowing in the dark.   Or I go underwater in the bathtub and suddenly I’m in an aquarium so deep I cannot see the bottom, but I can taste that one of them is rotting down there. I can taste it in the water.

When I was in college I had been working over Christmas and had missed the evening bus home on Christmas Eve. I decided to hitchhike the 60 miles home like I’d done many times.  However a wicked storm had kicked up but that helped my cause and I got a lift from a guy almost immediately, let’s call him Mark. Mark was in his twenties and driving to a nearby town with his younger brother who was maybe 12.  The storm intensified. At one point near our destination the main road was blocked because of fallen trees. Mark said he knew a back road we could take. Some other drivers followed us..   We drove down the back road and all was going well until we came across a huge tree that had fallen down. It was suspended across the road resting on both banks. There was just about enough room to pass underneath. Mark said “I think we can make it” and slowly moved the car forward.  Just as we were passing underneath the tree lurched and fell. The roof of the car was just ripped apart as the tree came down and crushed the car. I flung myself to the car floor.  It’s all a blur for a while after that. Flashing lights. Voices. When I came to my senses, I found myself by a fire in a large open bar with a whiskey in my hand. The 12 year old brother was across from me and shaking with a whiskey in his hand also. Mark was there also and looking very sheepish. We sipped whiskey while we waited out the storm.  Later I was taken home by people who were travelling to a funeral. I remember arriving into town and going straight to meet my friends in the pub. I tried to tell them all that I had just nearly died but they were already after a few beers and said “Topper, you and your stories”. I gave up and ordered a drink.  Never really told anyone. Thanks for reading.	NULL

Blood types. Not only AB0 and Rh system. There are many more types of antigens that can make transfusion really complicated. It always fascinated me how and also why we evolved to create them. Just a few molecules and it can cause creation of antibodies if recipient doesn´t have that antigen. Sometimes it happens and it´s mostly almost harmless. Just fever and recipient survives without problems. But from time to time we (i work in blood bank) hear about really nasty reaction, sometimes even death.Yes, people nowadays are killed by transfusion less than in history when there was little to know about it, but it still happens. The more we know, more we can prepare, but in some cases we just don´t have perfect bag for recipient, yet it still must be given, because other option is certain death.  What we also see quite often is Hemolytic disease of the newborn. Basicly mother unknowingly creates antibodies against red blood cells of her baby, slowly killing it. To survive, the baby must be given blood, which is also risky, because you basicly have to stick needle into umbilical cord and in some cases it can cause abortion. some mothers must go through this multiple times, risking life of their baby multiple times yet also knowing that they are killing them and it´s the only way to save them.     It is fascinating how much we can do to save people, yet terrifying to see that sometimes it´s still not enough.	NULL

The horn is an underrated instrument in popular music. The only problem is the horn is so enjoyable that once it starts creeping in to music culture, we can't stop ourselves from adding more and more horn. Then you wind up in total ska hedonism before it all crashes and music winds up in a decades-long horn hangover.   We as a society need to learn how to incorporate the horn responsibly in music. Getting rid of the horn entirely is no good. But let's learn how to use it without going overboard.	NULL

The best explanation I found was in a book on the enlightenment.  A claim needs more proof the more unbelievable it is.  Someone claims they bought bread from the bakery? No proof needed. Most people buy bread. Bakeries sell bread. The claim follows logically from your experience of how the world works.  You got hit by a car on the way to work? You both work and cross streets to there. Pedestrians get hit all the time. The story checks out.  You saw an albino reindeer? Pics or it didn’t happen. They’re exceedingly rare and you being in the same place at the same time as one is extremely unlikely.  An omnipotent diety pretended to be human and resurrected himself when he got killed?

Only if you insist on a literal interpretation which, despite what it might seem like depending on where you live, is a minority of Christians.

When I was 4 years old, I was exploring the backyard of our new house with my 3 year old brother. We found a tool shed with the door sightly ajar. I opened the door fully and looked inside and saw a momma cat nursing a litter of kittens. She hissed at me and I got scared, so I slammed the door shut and ran away, my brother running behind me. A couple months later, I had forgotten about the incident, and I went to the shed again. I looked inside just like before and I saw a mass of decomposed flesh and fur. It smelled horrible so closed it and left. About 25 years later I realized that I unintentionally starved that family of cats to death when I slammed the door the first time.	NULL

Incapable of cleaning up after himself. Refuses to learn/do basic chores (laundry, cook basic meals or even express interest in trying). Will not comply with a basic "routine" request to help out - e.g. "hey, can you be sure to feed the pet in the morning or at this time?" or "hey, can you please put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher instead of leaving them out on the sink". There's obviously exceptions to each of those cases, and obviously some people might forget time and again, but I mean a recurring issue of just not doing something simple.     Also, a certain degree of immaturity is honestly probably good for most relationships and people in general - but when it's excessive is when it's an issue.	NULL

There are many reasons,  some reasons to believe they don't exist, many to believe that if they did exist I shouldn't worship them, but to be very brief:  Reason's I believe they don't exist:  - Every religion I have been introduced to has been self contradictory and based on fear of offending God. - because there is nothing in the universe that makes me need a creator to explain it. Science can and does explain everything that can and does affect the universe. I don't care about things beyond that scope. - I see that the universe must be less complex than god (given god's omniscience and omnipotence over it) and so I think statistically it is more likely that the universe came from nothing than God. - I want to not believe of God as I want to believe the universe is understandable and that makes it's beauty and magnificence more, than if it was created by someone sentient or conciouse. - I am comfortable with the idea that after life I stop, I believe it means we put more care and effort into this world to make it better, whereas I see many religious people who 'game' the system, doing the rituals, but not caring for people of the world, trying to win a place in heaven. - it can't be shown, because you must have faith is a ridiculous position. Extreme claims require. - True faith, everlasting paradise and suicide being a sin would result in followers setting up extremely dangerous scenarios (wing suiting) which will likely kill them. Snake handlers kind of do, but no religion, quite fits the with that. - Because people's religion correlate so strongly with the religion of their parents.  - No religion fits what I would envision a religion from a real caring, nurturing omnipotent, omniscient father figure.   Reason's I think if God did exist, we shouldn't worship them (obviously differently appropriate to different religions):  - I am yet to hear of a God I consider moral and as such decent.  - deathbed conversations for monsters says to me that God doesn't care about what we do, just that we worship them. - morality can't be reduced down to eternal suffering or eternal paradise. That cannot be a moral way of distributing justice. - I believe that nothing is worthy of worship.  - if God did exist they gave me reason and critical thinking and they tell me that his doesn't exist. A God who would punish me for using the abilities they gave me, is cruel and malicious - I see so many preachers taking advantage of or harming their flock and as such am skeptical of the religion they preach - Because I see the emotional trauma in people raised Catholic and I believe it is wrong. - Because there are too many awful things in the world, which don't make sense and I am unwilling to trust that parasites eating babies eyes, or natural disasters are morally acceptable as a way to test peoples faith. - the Christian heaven, separates, the soul (to which lives on), from the body and mind which die. Being a soul with no mind, is no longer me.	NULL
In theory, i support it wholeheartedly. There are scum who deserve death. But we as humans are flawed and sometimes convict people falsely, and when a falsely convicted person is killed for a crime they didn't commit, well. Big problem. In practice, I support reformation prisons .	NULL

I’ll never forget her.  It was 6/6/2014. She was the most absolutely stunning woman I’d ever seen. 16 years my senior. I was 31. We started small talk and while waiting on our orders we decided to have a drink together.  We laughed and talked. Like kindred spirits. I was never good at making friends out of strangers.  I’m so glad we had that small talk  That small talk ended up in a 5 almost 6 year relationship. It was literally the best years of my life.  We parted because she had to move away to follow her son. I totally understood and respected. We both knew long distance wouldn’t work.  Also, our age gap, bothered her much more than me over time.   She taught me how to be a good person.  How to laugh. To be spontaneous. To literally dance in the rain no matter who is watching.  To stop and take selfies in front of the “welcome to” state signs for memories.    We parted 3/8/2019  We met up again around October and had a small few week fling.  For those three weeks, I was complete again. No more drinking all night. Crying. Listening to sappy country.  Then she was gone again.  I miss her terribly. I am not sure I’ll ever find someone like her again. I’ve looked, lord knows I’ve looked. I am ok if I don’t. I’ll never forget her. Her smell. Her laugh. Her touch. Literally intoxicating.     All that to say. Please take a moment and get to know that person beside you. You never know how it’ll turn out. I did and it was 5 of the best damn years of my life.  I’ll love you forever flossy. I promise.	NULL

The best reason to me personally is that the concept doesn't seem coherent enough to warrant belief. Perhaps it just hasn't been defined or explained in a way that makes concrete sense to me.

Religion has caused nothing but pain in my life. My days of arguing it's validity are done. I don't wish ill-will against religious people, I just don't want to engage with them anymore.	NULL
When a Mormon hears arguments for the Muslim faith, or Hindu hears a Catholic explaining why their God is real, it's easy for them to see how paper-thin and flawed the claims of another religion are. The exact same reason the Janis or the Wiccan beliefs not compelling to you, that's how I feel. To me, it just all feels obviously made up, obviously false, and argued from flawed premises.   Moreover, when you look at the stories of people who founded a religion, like Mohamed, Joseph Smith, Jim Jones and others it's always the exact same thing. "I am God's chosen messenger, and that means you all have to do what I say and I get to sleep with all of your wives." Every single story we know of someone who founded a religious movement goes exactly that way, but yet the people in a religious movement founded that way always try to claim that their guy is different. Why should we believe you and not all the others? No one can ever give a good reason for that, because there isn't one. Religions were founded by con men who wanted power, and once they got it, they fucked everyone's wife (and usually underaged girls too). if that's what God is all about, then leave me out of it.	NULL

It never really made any sense, but the final nail in my religion coffin was when my great aunt died. She was in critical condition and I prayed like I was told to do and I said "If you want me to believe in you, don't take my aunt yet." She passed away later that night and I decided to end all of my beliefs right then and there.   Every single time someone told me "God has a plan for everyone." or "This is the path God chose for x," it's another reminder that God can't be real if he really planned for kids to get abused, or women to lose their extremely wanted babies, or letting millions of people suffer daily. People like to thank god when things are going right like he did anything to help you get to where you are. I could literally go on forever about how much I hate the Christian religion.	NULL

On christmas day my boyfriend started drinking at 7 am, started arguing with my son at 9 am, and called the police on ME when I told him I wasnt doing this all day and I was taking him home to his Ma's (hes bostonian)   He freaked out, held me down, then tried to tell the police i beat him (hes 6'6" and a big dude), they didnt believe him so he told them I was a danger to myself and had tried to burn off my own tattoos (I had to show the cops all my tattoos to prove I hadnt)   Thankfully he also told them about how he held me down while I screamed "im scared please let me up" repeatedly until he did, and they believed THAT part, arrested him and told me to get an injunction since apparently he made threats towards me to them  No one told me an injunction requires us both to show up to court and now I'm spending the next 9 days in total anxiety because all I wanted was to never see him again, the whole point of an injunction is to keep someone away and now you tell me I gotta be in a courtroom with him? I'm scared	NULL

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  You know what you're getting into with a garbage sitcom. They server their purpose.  My definition of worst wasn't that it was poor cinematography, acting, plot etc.  It was the worst because I hated it. I hated it with a passion. I wished the time away as quickly as possible.	NULL

Ah finally, an opinion that struck a nerve in me.  Dexter Holland's voice isn't that great, but personally I see past it. I've gotten used to it over time, and I also focus a lot on the music itself. But yeah, you're entitled to that opinion. Voice quality is very important for a lot of people, myself included, but we all gave some biases here and there.  Also, punk isn't really supposed to be "good"; it's more about the message.	NULL
Yup, said the same to myself every 3 months for the past 2 and a half years. And here we are😄 Meanwhile, all other prospective interests have moved on…	NULL
Only a valid idea if you've got free lounge access, which usually requires either a top tier airline status or a credit card with an annual fee in the hundreds of dollars.  I paid for lounge passes once. We had a 9 month old and a 6 hour layover in Atlanta. It was worth it for the comfortable seats and amenities, but paying for access just means your bill is already paid, now you have to decide how much food and drink you need to consume to make it worth it.

You totally missed my point. Should I have said "you could vastly reduce people who are without homes. I didn't say a thing about drug addicts. Also you didn't mention who's proven it can't be done, you're just being pedantic. Also also read the inital question "what issue for you" < that's for me, not you.  I read an article that Jeff Bezos could buy everyone in Africa that needs to travel over 5km a day for water a bicycle and still have 95% of his wealth.	NULL
My family allowed me to explore many faiths without pressuring me into any one in particular. It quickly dawned on me that everyone couldn’t be right and it was likely they were all bullshit.

No, I don't want to accidentally insult them. They might have had something happen in their life that caused it. They could have lost their job and had their water shut off, and you commenting on their smell would be like rubbing salt in the wound. They probably know they smell and hope no one notices. By not saying anything there's at least a slight glimmer of hope in their mind that they don't smell too bad.	NULL

I think the mystery “third person” in my unattributed but speculated closing quote and yours on the ineffective god could be none other than Stephen Fry. Regardless, that’s precisely who I hear in my head reading those words.   It’s tho eh if “he” thinks it character building for nations of people to starve and be placed under desperate destitution while other fellow human beings on an equal plane in the grander spiritual sense stuff themselves with an abundance of food, god is nothing but a cunt.    Having never been indoctrinated the whole thing has always had an air of being a way that the plebeian class can be relegated into joyful servitude.	NULL

Those are a symptom, I'd recommend finding out of what and then getting it treated. Your quality of life will improve.

Being able to taste injections. I was 2-months-ago years old when I realized a only small percentage of people can.

That's the key. Why is everyone assuming God is all about making you feel good at all times? The Bible talks about the fear of God. Do you not admire and respect fire, just as you fear it? We are orbiting the center of the universe, something we do not understand completely. Does that mean that the center of our universe is a "parent" with expectations to take care of us to teach us to fly? You're right in the sense that maybe it's better if God leaves us alone. If we can learn about the nature of fire, it will be easier for us to avoid getting burned. My point is: the concept of God matters.	NULL

1. Age is directly related to how likely you are to die in childbirth. Even modern medicine can't surpass this. No, it has never been normal for 13 year olds to get pregnant and carry to term. That's a ridiculous, anachronistic misunderstanding coming from the fact that betrothal ages used to be low and people normally fuck when they are married. 2. A large part of age is a social construct, meaning that what constitutes an adult is dependent on culture. There was a time when the knowledge to operate independently in society was able to be understood and internalized by a 16-year-old. That is not the case today - our societies are more complex, the jobs we have are more distantly removed from intuition, and the consequences for lesser performance are more dramatic. Humans have always needed to stay in the nest longer than other species, and as we advance that will become more and more the case. It is entirely possible - and even likely - that in the future a 21 year old will be what we consider a teenager. And yes, you wanting to fuck them if you're 35 will make you a pedo. Deal with it.  And if you don't understand these things, there is a non-zero chance you're a pedo. Please re-evaluate your life choices and leave the playground.	NULL

I'd say Julian the Apostate - just out of curiosity. The idea of a pagan emperor coming back and issuing such wide-sweeping reforms, and promising to build the Third Temple (that last one especially being something I rather like the alternate history of), it seems he had a serious shot at challenging the new status quo. I'd be curious to know if his efforts ended up fruitful if he had more than just a couple years, but closer to a full decade to raise the next generation in his own way.	NULL

Was for a while a semi serious road cyclist, I shaved my legs because a) dealing with road rash if you come off is much easier without hair and b) muscly legs look fucking more so when smooth and tanned, and c) cycling is a tribal sport, so if the pros do it you do it to feel part of the tribe.   Had a mate say it was a "worry". I told him no one defines my masculinity except me, and if his masculinity was threatened by my legs that's on him. He wasn't sure how to react.	NULL

Majority were uneducated. They were brutal times where a toothache/infection would kill you. Times have changed, we now know there is no god yet you will still try blast at me there is.

The amount of fees required, antibiotics, and hormones, the amount of agricultural run off generated from factory farmed animals is damaging to the environment in a very real way. Why shouldn’t that impact be minimized? The only real way to do that is to end factory farming and return to older forms of animal rearing that will necessarily produce less meat but in a more sustainable manner. This will have a knock on effect that people will eat less meat.   Can I ask you a question? Do you reject the idea of any life style change being required of you? If so, why?	NULL

I mean sort of, yeah? We remember the holocaust as probably the single worst event that has happened in the history of man kind for a reason. Its a true outlier in human history, never before or since has there been a industrialised, bureaucratic and methodical attempt to exterminate an entire people.  Where as under 10k happens every few years somewhere in the world. The reason these people want to bring it down to a few thousand, or a few tens of thousands is because they want to stop remembering the holocaust as an outlier, and move it into the "well that's just what happens in war territory".

No reason to. It is like if i say harry potter (a character based on a fictional piece of literature) is real.. and ask you why you dont believe in it?!  You believe in folk lore, stories and myth. You tell me why you believe in it. The burden of proof is on you.   Earlier humans were weak and dumb and at mercy of nature. So they made up stories of powerful beings in sky who they needed to be in good terms with. Then someone started building stories about him. Then more and more people followed. Associating safety with his belief and demise with his rage. Then people came in with religion trying to moral police and control and teach people the whats (what is this world whats this whats that) hows (how to live) and whys (why universe is the way it is) which they themselves didnt understand.  We dont need them any more. We dont need stories. We are strong and confident enough to be ok with uncertainty about the rest of mysteries of universe.  Why do people believe in god? And how much of it is just conditioning from parents and care takers and society? Do you think dogs believe in gods? What about birds? What about bacterias?   If you managed to erase the idea of god and religion (and the conditioning) from the entire world telepathically using some magic. (You dont even need to remove the physical estates and  documentation like temples mosque churches holy books etc. ) Do you think people will accept the idea of god (again) on their own while they already had science to question it?

It’s not because I’m a woman it’s because of common sense. I didn’t get hurt recently. I actually have a boyfriend. I’ve never cheated on anyone I’ve been with because I actually loved them. Loving someone includes wanting to grow with them. Being a team. If I cheated on them, what does that show? That I don’t respect them enough or care enough about them. You might think you are in love but if you are willing to hurt that person so badly but getting with someone else then it’s not love. You’re just trying to justify your actions because you’re a serial cheater	NULL

If they get super defensive, express your concerns and acknowledge it's an insecurity. Everything should be okay. If they can't handle you simply asking, then that another issue on its own.	NULL

Albuquerque, NM. I'm not even from there but visited and I'll probably move there someday. I mean the food is phenomenal the landscape is some of the most beautiful in the country.

Back in elementary school a teacher was sick so we kinda waited in the yard, it was late classes so most of the school wasn't there, i just laid down on a bench because it was comfy, one girl from my class sat down next to me and we just talked.  I felt so mega calm just laying there, it wasn't even anything romantic or anything.. but for some reason, not even Meditation got me quite as calm and cozy as that sensation of just chatting comfortably with a light breeze just laying around.  I tried to replicate that moment of pure calmness but i haven't managed to do it quite yet... Considering i have adhd and a bunch of sensoy problems like light sensitivity and anexiety problems... It's quite rare I even am calm.	NULL

Worked with a lady in a grocers once, she was holding a new iPhone which was a piece of shit knock off. She had bought it on the street off a man who came up to her saying he needed to sell it because he had lost money gambling or something. She said she had ‘felt sorry for him’ so bought it, I think for £50? I hope not more than that. She was an absolute idiot, dumbest person I’ve ever met. I hadn’t met someone before then who literally looked like there was nothing going on up there.   Another story, I used to know someone from Tennessee who had about 10 guns. Once on video call when talking about guns and all the shooting that happen in America (I’m from uk) - my point was that it’s much easier to kill someone when you have a gun than without. He turns the camera on the guns and tries to prove (?) to me that they’re not dangerous by shouting at the gun laying there: ‘gun! Shoot!’ Like??? Yes I know the gun can’t shoot by itself, it’s the fact they’re so available in America to be accessed by anyone (like this mentally unstable man) and shot BY THEM that makes them so dangerous!!! Fucking idiot lol	NULL

A few.   The Beatles are overrated, their solo stuff was wayyyyy better.  Rap isn’t music (lol SIKE) Rap music, despite being the most hated is one of the most artistic genres to ever have been created. Not counting the shit on the radio.

Eminem is mid and if he’s your favorite rapper you do not hold a strong opinion on rap music.  Stevie Ray Vaughn is the closest we’ll ever get to ANYONE playing a guitar that challenges Hendrix.

I grew up watching my dad beat and abuse my mother. And all the church people telling me that my dad is sorry and that he confessed his sins but he would still do it. When I told my family that I didn’t want to go to church anymore they asked me why. I told them that I couldn’t belong to something that thought harming a fellow person. They said that it was ok if only they confessed their sins, my mother said this as well. I flat out said that if that is the case then I rather live in hell then be in heaven with people like my father. Stopped believing ever since.	NULL

Queen Victoria, although maybe closer to 10-15 years later. She would’ve put a stop to WW1 since many of the belligerents were ruled by 19 of her nephews and grandchildren.

This would’ve changed everything as most global conflicts since WW1 arguably couldn’t have happened without WW1 preceding them.	NULL

The manager/supervisor I have to report things to is so annoying.   I gave him 2 weeks notice but some how he misread that and changed my shifts for the day after today. So to him it looked like I only told him 2 days before. When I made him aware of this he didn't even apologise. Or acknowledge it.   He was saying things like I can't just tell him when I'm coming to work or not when it's literally my first time and I told him 2 weeks earlier + I'll only be gone for 2 hours.   This has actually made me upset I didn't realise until I started typing.   Why do managers act like they won the company? Is it a power thing?

Oh yes, of course using it in a professional capacity, especially as your (or one of your) main tool(s) it is imperative that you keep as up to date as possible, as you will be exchanging files and documents with your peers. And like I said, for some, a rent/constantly updating option is best! Clearly that’s the mentality behind them offering this package.   However my situation, along with many others I’m sure, is that the capacity in which I use PS is not stable enough to warrant that kind of commitment. If I don’t make any money from the project I’ve used PS for over the course of a year, then I’ve run out of funds to be able to spend on it, and therefore cannot rent it for use in the next project as I no longer can afford it. So no new project, no funds for PS, no project, etc.  In this case, it’s better to be able to save up and purchase it outright so that I can rely on it in the future, regardless of my financial situation. Just like my computer is an investment so that I know I can use it in order to make money, regardless of my situation.   So all of a sudden they have isolated all of us that have not got the stability to be able to throw money at it every month, and therefore cuts us out of its business model entirely.   You’re right, an alternative package with the same power as PS is definitely my best option at this stage. It’s just very difficult to find something up to that standard as Adobe also enjoy cornering the market.   I will continue to look for CS5 or 6 copies for sale, and until then I’ll try using some of the alternatives suggested here. Hopefully something matches the features and quality we need without being so money-hungry.	NULL
That was a "spiritual sequel" - a new franchise from one of the people who worked on the original (like Yooka-Laylee with Banjo-Kazooie, but fewer people from the original). It was unlikely to amount to anything good.  The original studio (Silicon Knights) had already gone bankrupt because of the idiot in charge of the "spiritual successor" - he decided to try and sue Epic Games due to poor support (they bought an early version of one of the engines and were warned it may not be suitable). The really dumb thing is that, due to this lawsuit, Epic discovered that the "propriety engine" that Silicon Knights ended up using instead for multiple games had loads of stolen code from the Unreal engine.   But, yeah, the lead developer of this "spiritual sequel" (which was unlikely to be finished anyway) was arrested for child porn.  Nintendo are the company in charge of Eternal Darkness. They also own the patent for the sanity system, so this "spiritual successor" would be lacking that.	NULL

I think they're beautiful people, but I don't think they did right by my husband.

Like Miss lady, are you going to pay for all of these doctors appointments and etc?   and I also feel like my in-laws did not do enough to inspire family pride in my husband.  But I come from a very close-knit family, and I'm very proud of my family. And if it's on the rare occasion you find me bragging, it's normally about how awesome my family is. Yet my husband doesn't ever seem like he has one nice thing to say about his family, and that kind of breaks my heart.	NULL

The big question of quantum physics is most reasonably answered with the consciousness-causes-collapse theory.

I think this misunderstands what atheism is.  Atheism is the null value. We are all born with the bull value. Most of us are raised with a specific set of superstitions, practices, dogmas, or other beliefs but we all started with the null value.

Downside: All the tourists attractions get boring after the 10th visit, even the beach. In the summer it takes an extra 30 minutes to get anywhere because roads are packed, no one knows where they're going, and people are going 10 under the speed limit so they can stare at the ocean instead of the road. You make as much money as you can in the summer because you're gonna be living paycheck to paycheck in the winter. Also, random things are extremely overpriced, ex: local candy store sells fudge for like $18/pound. We're not metropolitan, so doing non-tourist things (shopping mall, concerts, etc) requires 1+ hour of driving one way.   Upside: I live in a really beautiful area (hence why people summer here) and meet a lot of interesting people.	NULL

The world is full of things to worry about, and if you worry over every single thing, it will destroy you mentally and emotionally. You can only fill yourself up with so much. If your world is filled with money worries, political worries, humanity worries, social issues, things like insurance and inflation and the knowledge that you will probably work until the day you die doing work you started out liking, but losing the passion as corporatism beats it out of you like a drum. At some point you have to shut yourself off from all the rest of the bad so you don't go insane.  We just had our first (and probably only) kid two months ago, and so far, even with the exhaustion and extra work and lack of time to ourselves, the baby gives us so much joy and happiness and a feeling of life fulfillment, that I can see how people can chase that feeling for as long as they can.

How old? I'm asking because most of the "best" men are married by a certain age and out of the dating pool. The guy's I knew in high school who were in shape and oh trans and presidents of their clubs and got top grades weren't still dating by 35. The guy's I knew in high school who had their shit together were all married before 30. It started around 26 and by 30, they were all married. The truth is, the older a woman gets, the quality of available men goes down as the most desirable partners get married.	NULL
I think its also important to consider that these kids are probably the first generation that we know of who are growing up with so few social constraints around gender as well as access to the information that challenges traditional norms.   It was easier before because kids were put in a "social box" laden with prescribed rules which gave a framework for growing up. For more and more kids, they don't have that anymore - and finding yourself when growing up is hard enough even when you're told, e.g. "what it means to be a man", I can't imagine what its like without those social crutches to help you along.

I think the poster had observed that the construction of what makes a man "mature" is that he starts doing what everyone else wants him to do instead of what he wants to do: the marriage and kids thing normally.  "Immaturity" is a concept that's often used to shame people into confirming to inauthentic social expectations.  "Well done Billy that's very mature"  From a certain point of view: it's quite childish to base your life decisions on other people's ideas about what is and is not mature - ideas that are normally expressed by a person trying to shame and control another person's behaviours to serve their own interests.

When I was 11 someone stole my new bmx bike. I suspected it was my “friend” across the street but had no proof. Later that night around 3am I snuck into his backyard, broke the lock, and stole his blue bike. I took it upstairs to my room and hid it in my closet. He asked me if I knew where it was and I said nope. About a month later I found my bike in my brother’s friends garage. So yup stole an innocent kids bike. I’ve always hated myself. The day we left to move to NY I grabbed the bike and left it on the side of his house.	NULL

Left. It’s not going to sound it but Universal Basic Income is my most right wing thing. I don’t want all the current government programs PLUS UBI. I want UBI instead of all the mishmash of bloated, ineffective, biased, easily scammed, easily defrauded programs.   It’d be rough for those who live in high cost places and amazing for those who live in low cost places. But a lot of people in low cost places are also in the places that are struggling the most right now (rural areas) without additional safety nets and with a lot of hidden costs. Even though it’s cheaper to own a home it is impossible to live without a car or get to a doctor, or it takes you days and you have to live in your car to see a doctor. Or a dozen other things.   $1,000/month to everyone. Cut all the government programs. Have the people who run it focus on nothing but actual fraud (phishing, account hijacking, applying for dead people, Russian fraud rings, whatever the flavor is of month is).   And people on the left have called me a murdered for this, so you know. Very right wing stance.	NULL
Had this happen to me while flying to a job interview right before thanksgiving holiday years ago. Followed the gate number on the paper ticket I got and waited at the terminal. Didn’t fly much before so stayed there until someone else there bolted away saying someone about a gate change. Went to look at the departure list and saw gate changed. Didn’t make it in time to the gate and was about 2 minutes late after running across O’Hare. Was on standby the rest of the day but by a miracle got on the last flight of the day to connect to Dallas super late. Bombed the interview due to the lack of sleep and stress the next day. Also didn’t help I missed an ‘optional’ meet and greet dinner due to missing my connecting flight day before. I always use digital tickets now to double check the gate now.	NULL

Firat, let me say that I'm not 20/20. HOWEVER...

After a week or so of doing this, off and on, I noticed that things were in slightly better focus--just crisper--about a half hour later. So I looked around a bit and discovered that there are actually prescription taurine eyedrops out there. Apparently, taurine is concentrated in the eye, and a deficiency can contribute to cataracts. I'm just a layman, but found this very interesting, since it seems like I just stumbled on to something that seems to help. I'm nearly 60, and in good health, btw.

>"because it's God's plan".  This includes the suffering.  For me gay people were the reason I wondered if a religious god was real or not. If God didn't want people to be gay, why would he let them be born that way? Religious people say it's a choice, but they never say that being straight is a choice. Also, who would choose to be persecuted like that?  Then I discovered that some animals have homosexual tendencies as well. So you're telling me there are gay dolphins that would never burn in hell, but humans must suffer through a life of quiet desperation until death because desiring love and intimacy from the same gender is verboten?  This is all just to save their souls. Why would a merciful God make someone gay and then make them suffer severe loneliness and then persecution and promise eternal suffering if they dare act on their impulses? That seems cruel, like some sick joke.  Religions do more harm than good. The principles they teach can be learned from philosophies. Additionally, religions take the responsibility of saving humanity out of our hands and place it in some supernatural force that cannot deliver on its promises. This creates a mental prison and stops people from, say, eating the rich because they're supposed to be punished in the afterlife for their exploitation.  Fuck that shit. Get them now!

The "moss only grows on the (direction) side of the tree" kind of navigation tips.  No, it grows on all sides, and as much as you think you're walking a straight line in a forest by walking from tree to tree, you're probably not.

It could be one of two things.  It's either a piece of farm machinery used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, cotton, flax straw, salt marsh hay, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport, and store. They produce bale weighing around 1,000lb, cost anywhere between 35k<105k and can weigh 3tons, making them unsuitable for a survival situation aboard a small self built raft, but seriously capable of beating a shark to death if you can swing it.  Or  It's a cup or bowl used to bail water out of the raft. An asset in a survival situation, but less suited to beating a shark to death owing to its light weight, rounded edges, and lack of deployable hayrake.	NULL

Was your life really ruined? You were stuck living with someone you were in quietly in love with, someone who didn’t feel the same way about you. Is that really a life worth preserving? You (and the OP of this thread) deserve happiness, and as hard as it is to lose a friend, you were right to try, because that friendship wasn’t fulfilling you.  Yeah, ideally you’d have fallen in love with someone else eventually, but how easy could that have been while being near him every day?	NULL

>Do you have evidence that anything you have been doing in your life will pay off eventually?  No. What even is "paying off" for my life anyway? Why would I need evidence of "paying off" just to get on with my life?  >It was always faith that everything you do have sense and will lead you somewhere.  Lead me where? I don't have "faith" any of my actions will "lead" me somewhere. I can make plans and predictions about the future based on previous experiences and guesses and judgement. If I apply to that job, I might be happier because I'd have more time to do that thing I want, etc. That requires no "faith", it's a best guess, and it might turn out wrong.  >You never had an evidence that things will work for 100%.  Of course not, nothing is 100%. But a complete lack of evidence is completely different from, say, looking at a body of evidence and picking *the most likely* "true" thing.  And of course, being open to revise that opinion if better evidence emerges because of course, it's not 100% certain.  >Same with faith in God. You don't know if going to church and praying will pay off, you just have faith that there is something up there.  Ah, but here there's not *any* evidence. You don't know it will pay off, and can't know. Yes, there's still not a 100% certainly, but there's not even a 90% or 30% or 1% certainly based on availability evidence. Because there is literally no empirical evidence. It is 100% faith.  Ah! But like you said, even though there's literally no evidence, it could still be true and you're right - if it is, why not blindly believe as a good bet so you don't go to hell if, by some extraordinary means, it is!  Well, religious are exclusive. You will go to hell if you pick the "wrong" one, usually. Why pick Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism etc? They all have equally zero empirical evidence. They have similar punishments. Why choose one over the other?  And given there's a cost, in my valuable time, to pick any over none (I have things to do on Sunday etc), I think none is a much more logical choice.	NULL

It's also heavily situational. By that I mean that things like how much sleep you've been getting in general and got the night before, how much you've been eating as undereating causes your autonomic nervous system to panic, as well as things like caffeine intake or level of exercise. I fully believe if I didn't have a 75% active job (other 25% is standing in place so still kinda active) and regularly consume caffeine I would be a tantrum monster.  I also recently noticed I was getting angry all the time (but not lashing out at anything except vidya) and it hit me that I'd let my diet slip and was probably only eating like 2,000-ish calories a day when I burn well over that through work alone. I started cramming more food in my mouth and got up to around 3,500 a day and suddenly my anger just never came back over the same stupid shit that had been pissing me off before.

Fuck you, you've made me waste so much time lol (sorry, imperial system)  So the average coat of paint is about 4 mils. Mils are thousandths of an inch. That means 1 inch every 250 years!   The average doorframe is 36 inches wide.   As a slim guy, I'd have to pick a room to be locked in at the 3,625 year mark.  Suppose this was a magical trap, survival scenario, so food get's magically stocked,  water/electricity/air will keep flowing, and you wont age.    The obvious room choice is the largest room in the house, and you would move the fridge there in the first few years.   Air, or lack there of, can be the first thing to kill you. If air can flow through this magical paint, or windows only trap you, then it's no biggie for now.   If you need vents... well then I'd start suffocating in 2000 years.  Say air isnt an issue.   Then the biggest initial issue waste.   Ya gotta shit and ya gotta throw away crap.   If the terrain is destructible(minus the paint), then your first job should be to make a rudimentary sewer way from the biggest room.   You can probably remodel the ground vents or something.  The next issue is whether or not water counts as "magically restocked food", and whether is spawns in a movable object (ie fridge).   If so then we good on that.   If not... with some jerry rigging and leaving the kitchen faucet on at the 560 year mark, I can probably have water in my living room till year 13,750.  All that's left is to get some extension cords, wheel the fridge into the living room, and browse Reddit for 22,000 years till the paint encases me.	NULL

This done by allowing lobbying and it is the center of all that will consume us and why nothing is done that does not directly benefit the very companies destroying existence for a profit.

No it isn’t. In the absence of definitive information it is impossible to draw a meaningful conclusion. Agnosticism is the logical and scientific position. You could argue that atheism is the best model of understanding currently available, you could strongly doubt that there might be an emergence of information that would change your understanding, but to deny the possibility is dogmatic in the same way as theism. Neither position can be tested, proven, or disproven, so they are arguably meaningless.	NULL

I like character. I dunno. It looks different on everyone.   My fiancé looks like Weird Al and Tiny Tim had a baby. He knows the Latin names of tons of mushrooms and plants. He’s built a green house and a make shift biosafety cabinet to work with plant tissue culture. He’s also kind of an idiot. He eats out of the trash, and around mold spots, if there is some clean fruit left. He’s like a food poisoning Olympian.   One guy I dated before that had Marfan syndrome and rode his motorcycle across a college campus in an anime girl dress while holding a metal sword he’d dipped in gasoline and lit on fire. Also objectively an idiot.  There was an ER doctor who had many horrible corrosive acids in SOBE drink bottles in his closet. He and his brother had stolen them from a school lab in college by arriving with an empty bottle and pouring stuff in when the professor wasn’t looking. He watched the YouTube video “Dumb ways to die” like 40 times in a row.   I dunno personality is good.	NULL

I pretended I was having fun, I laughed at what he said, like it was a joke.  I was a virgin at the time, just 17, he was in his 30s and so I played that card of being too scared to just give it up, so he knew he had to work hard at convincing me.  Each time we got close, I was overcome with cotton mouth from "that pot being so good", so he would have to get me water.   And by the time I drank the water, he would have to start coaxing me again.    This happened about 5 times.  The last time, I knew I was sober enough to fight back if I needed to, so I called him on his drugging me and how what he did didn't work, and he needed to call me a cab.  He started to argue the cost of a cab, and I told him he needed to do whatever he could to get me home because he wasn't going to overpower me at that point, I was no longer drugged up.  He  complied and I got my cab.  I sometimes wonder if he went on to do things that were worse, or if he already had....I don't know how I would find that out, but I'm almost certain that had I not been keenly aware of the threat he made, I wouldn't be here.  I'm not sure how I knew I could let him know I wasn't drugged up anymore...arguably a bad move, but I knew throughout the experience that if he got sex from me, he would have killed me.  I'm sure of that to this day.  It was a dangerous game, do not recommend playing it.  No one knew I was there.  No one.  It is a terrifying thought.  ETA  just reading my post over and it struck me that he didn't deny drugging me.  Curious....	NULL
I get, but personally like I said in another comment, I can’t even touch someone sexually, if I don’t really love them.

Not really an inherently right wing belief, but the second amendment is far too demonized by some of the radical left. Firearms obviously need some legislation to ensure fewer shooting sprees, but by and large, I think they are a necessary tool in the modern world and we shouldn't give them up as easily as some on the left want us to. Usually, my argument is if the fucknuts who did J6 try again or start getting more violent, it'd be best we didn't willingly disarm ourselves.

Not scary but strange AF and it happened to me.  I usually pee into the toilet at the men's room whenever I'm in a public restroom since I prefer the privacy of having the door closed, and I'm usually mindful to have the seat up to minimize the mess.  And I did so for over 2 years at an office I worked at with no issues until one day...  When I entered the restroom and headed straight for the stall on autopilot, the janitor confronts me and asks me if I always piss into the toilet in the stall and I said yes.  And he said something like this is not allowed here, you're only allowed to pee into the urinal.  Fyi, this is in America so it's not some weird country with different customs.  I was about 30 at the time and I've NEVER in my life (up until that point) ever been told, as a guy, that I cannot piss into a toilet in a public restroom and that I'm required to use the urinal if they have one.

Yeah, I understand that was a wishy washy phrase, but I want to avoid pretending to know how life started.   To attribute the “momentum” to a conscious creator is a logical leap that is impossible justify empirically, so that’s out for me.   I also don’t like the notion of “higher power.” It’s a phrase that is so broad and malleable that it can include infinitely many interpretations, which increasingly recede from the classical idea of a deity. At its limit, you could say that the “higher power” is the complete and ultimate understanding of the nature of existence, and to call that a deity is a primate superimposition.   Are there aspects to the universe, to consciousness—to being—that we don’t yet understand? Or course. Is there a possibility that we are linked in some way beyond our current capability to understand? Sure. Does any of this require the intervention of a deity? I think I’ve made myself clear on that.

It takes time and experience to learn. Above all, protect your assets and never let anyone close to them. Even when I was married (both times) I always was paid through a third party trust of which I happen to control. I never owned anything, even though I controlled it. Ultimately if a woman wants you to marry its because she wants to take advantage of your money, there are no financial benefits to marriage, only downsides. I do understand from a tradtional/religious point of view, but like christianity and islam is concerned there is no marriage in the eyes of god if the bride is not a virgin. Luckily there is no god, money and benefits is what we should focus on when it comes to this.	NULL

It started off as a date but we realized we didn't see a long term relationship with each other. We are still good friends and I figured I ask her to be FWB.

If I had to guess it's probably due to how much actually ends up in it and how quickly you get it taken care of. I only got a little from a AA battery, and it took a few minutes before I felt it.   So story time:  I was working at a shop that would buy and sell used consoles. Couple brings in a Wii they want to sell, so I pop open the controllers to see if there's any batteries and/or noticeable corrosion. Yes to both. I hand it back and say we can't take the console as we required a good controller to buy it in at the time, and it was the only one we had. Few minutes later, my eye starts burning. I think it's just dry and irritated so I go wash it out in the bathroom, gets a little better then starts burning again. I wash it out again, same results. So I tell my boss I think I got acid in there from the controller, call my GF and asked her to take me to the ER.   Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to get there, and she has trouble comprehending me telling her to "drive straight and it will be on the right". So she gets in the car and I'm driving with one eye closed cuz it's burning that bad. Get to the ER, tell them what's going on, and get admitted. Nurse then leaves and comes back with a giant, thick, plastic contact with a hose and what looks to be an IV bag full of saline water. He hooks it up to the bag, reclines me, sticks it in my eye, and tells me to just lie there for a bit. Water just seeping outta my eye, soaking into my shirt and the pillow I'm laying on. Eventually they come back to check on me, see that and wrap the pillow in a blanket so it doesn't get as wet and hopefully keeps the water our from under my head, and walk away again.   Bag runs dry, few minutes pass and I'm just stuck there with my eye starting to get irritated again before they come back. Ask me how I'm doing, I tell the that it's irritated still, the take out the contact, swap out bags, and begin the process again.   Total of 2 bags of saline water and 2-3 hours later I'm discharged with still blurry, but functional eye and drive me and my GF home.   Thankfully it was all covered by workers comp as it was a work-related injury. Downside is it was my major introduction to the HR head as my (now old) boss didn't want to file the paperwork and handed it to me to turn in as I had just accepted a desk job with the company and I had no clue who to give it to.

Spanish flu never really *ended*. It evolved into a milder variant at first, sure, but it regularly mutates into MUCH more dangerous variants, and has for the past century. The only solution we’ve had for it has been massive containment measures, which have worked so far (look at all the flus which almost made it out of SE Asia over the past century), but in the areas it comes out, there are a lot of deaths.  The world didn’t have to deal with that before 1918 - now it does.  Saying “covid will be just like the Spanish flu” is not good news. It’s very, very bad news. Dangerous variants will crop up regularly (likely more regularly than the Spanish flu variants), we will have to lock that area down if the local region is willing (not likely), massive death figures will be thrown up, and if it’s not locked down it will tear through the world again. In a model matching the Spanish flu, this will happen REGULARLY.	NULL

Same, I mean IF there really was a god, why would he allow the world to suffer so much? And the sentence "he doesn't give you more than you could handle" doesn't help at all, then god expects too much of humans.   Also, if the bible was true word for word, why are Adam and Eve always portrayed with a belly button? Or, why are angels always the beautiful, winged and harp playing beings above the clouds when in the bible they're depicted completely different.    Also if there was a god, how did he came to live? Does he have parents as well or did he just somehow appear out of nowhere?	NULL

 The most helpful thing was seeing a therapist for a few months. She knew I couldn't afford long term sessions so we really focused on practical tools that would help in the moment.   Here are the methods that have worked best for me since: - journaling in a stream of consciousness style, putting down every thought and getting it out on the page instead of running it over and over in my mind. - exercise a couple days a week, even a short walk. I have to force myself sometimes but I feel better once I do. Active hobbies like hiking or gardening are my favorite for this. - limiting caffeine (honestly the hardest one for me!) - learning to figure out if I am feeling anxiety because of a scenario I have constructed from possibly incorrect "evidence" (such as a slight frown on someone's face meaning I did something wrong, etc). Writing helps me get better at recognizing when I'm doing this, too.   Best of luck with this journey!	NULL

Because the same thing happens to us even with women we don't want to have sex with.  Here's a question. In the past 20 minutes since I started replying to you, how many online pictures of naked Men have you seen?  In fact, make it a whole week compared to the average guy on the internet for 20 minutes and only then I'll bet it's comparable.  Women really really have no idea. I remember playing truth or dare in college and one asked how many times everyone masturbates in a week. In a week! The other guys and I just laughed like "hang on I need to get my calculator".	NULL
Freedom of speech is limited in many western countries. In Germany for instance, you're not legally allowed to deny the holocaust, these are fundamental differences in philosophy on rights.  You could make the argument that someone shouldn't deny the holocaust but at the end of the day we are talking about the freedom to say what you think.  People have been arrested in the UK for covering news stories that have been "press banned".  The US is ranked 44th in freedom of press according to who and why? There is no regulation of press in the United States so please explain that?  You're clearly very biased in your opinions as 100 million people in the United States support the 2nd amendment and many many in Europe wish they had it.  At the end of the day we're discussing freedom and I guess people who grew up in a country where they are subjects and not citizens would have a different view of what freedom and liberty actually mean.  If trailing behind the rest of the West means that if 1 of our economic sectors crashes and that causes 3 Western countries' economies to collapse because of it then I guess you win lol.	NULL

When I was 11, I realized that I was Buddhist because I was born in a Buddhist house.  If what your religion are (at least for a major part of your life) somehow depends on pure luck then maybe it is all bullshit.  Ponder on it for a week or so ( I was a kid, give me a brake).  Then I realize that religion sole existence must be to prevent people from harming one another.  They use fear to regulate what people SHOULDN’T DO which make sense bc without it, people would kill with no remorse (I was thinking in a scenario where laws do not exist yet). After realizing what religion was for, and how they used it to get money from people … well.  It is all downhill from there.   Don’t get me wrong.  Religion also gives people hopes and a sense of communities, which is good.  But I think the manipulations, and the corruption outweighs all the positive ness of religion.	NULL

I only like singing in musics if it has a musucal quality. I don't care AT ALL about lyrics, only that the sounds the voice makes are musically appealing and adding something to the music. That's why I mostly listen to intrumental musics, with little to no singing and usually it's mostly choirs or something similar.  My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and the singing there is just amazing even if you just care about how it sounds. Of course the lyrics bring something too but for me that's secondary.  I despise most popular music because it primarily relies on singing with often poor instrumental (get that lame ass three chords guitar with whashed out lyrics out of here please).	NULL

The reforms you mention are something I’ve been advocating for years, and it would go a long way toward fixing the current problem.  But it’s important to remember that most people simply don’t earn enough income to ever become part of the investment class.  This means that their income goes almost entirely toward subsistence.  Their ability to keep and use that money to live on deserves a special designation in the tax code.  The fact that ANYBODY who earns less than $40k/year has to pay federal income tax is simply wrong.  And yes, I do believe there IS such a thing as having too much wealth.  Our system is flawed in that once you achieve a certain level of wealth then it spirals out of control.  An imbalance of wealth distribution of that magnitude gives too much political and economic power to too few people.  We’re already seeing the results of this with Citizens United, the Koch Brothers, etc.    We’re in a new Gilded Age, and it’s not pretty.	NULL

Like many leftists, I adamantly support gun rights (this is generally considered a right wing position in the US).  Firearm bans are politically and practically unviable and also overwhelmingly unpopular, decimating re-election chances.  Political influence is finite, and that influence would be better spent on other policies such as environmental action, healthcare, labor rights, infrastructure, etc.  Furthermore, the problem of gun deaths (yes, we do have a problem with this) isn't inherently a product of gun rights, and revoking those rights would fail to fix the problem.  The question we should be asking about our relatively high rates of gun deaths is why so many people want to kill others/themselves in the first place.  Some of this is toxic gun culture and irresponsible ownership.  A lot of it could be dealt with by meaningfully addressing systemic poverty, ending the drug war and ending broken windows policing.  These are policies that lefties push for but liberals aren't willing to commit to.  They view gun bans as a shortcut to fix the most visible issue, like trimming weeds as opposed to pulling out the roots.  Lastly, passing a gun ban and enforcing it are two different beasts.  Given our "come and take it" attitude towards gun rights, there's no way everyone would peacefully hand their guns in.  The ban would either not be enforced or it would be a bloodbath.  Many of the people who are the source of our high gun violence statistics would just aquire their arms via illegal means and carry on about their business.	NULL

Olivia Rodrigo is overrated. No one thinks she isn't vocally talented, but the "I broke up with my boyfriend and that's the whole album" trope is getting really old. Driver's License was probably the only redeeming song on that album, but otherwise, it just felt like another Songs of Innocence album by U2. She's going to essentially sweep the Grammy's which in my opinion is solely a popularity contest instead of for actual talent in both singing and song writing. She plagiarized was it 5? different songs and only owned up to it when it became public, and she was being sued. Obviously, a lot of that shit should go to her producer. However, when you are creating and sending things out, it's your responsibility to make sure you are giving to the correct people the credit they deserve. Sometimes people don't realize, and that's ok. It also doesn't help when people choose to publicly address it instead of working out things privately. People are up in arms about artist's art being stolen and sold for NFT's but pass this off as fine. Obviously, sampling is going to happen and has led its way to great songs. However not crediting especially in this day and age, especially not until you are forced to, is a bit scummy.	NULL

Only tangentially related rant: I'm a chemist at a plant that makes, among many other things, incontinence solution for wipes. Our production operators make it basically like a lotion and then our marketers sell it to wipe manufacturers which dilute it and soak their wipes in it. Anyway, to test specific gravity of thicker liquids, we use a steel cup with a known mass. Because the incontinence solution will have humans as the end user, we aren't allowed to use the normal steel cup to measure specific gravity. The customer (the wipe manufacturer) is concerned the lotion will corrode the cup, and over time the corrosion will lead to inaccurate results. That's correct, they are worried that the lotion for your nether regions will corrode fucking steel. For the record, the shit is like over 90% water. It's just emulsifiers that make it thicker. And no chemical of any variety is left in the cup longer than like 2 minutes.  So the next time you wipe yourself after wetting yourself. Know that somewhere (Milwaukee) someone (me) had to go through a special handling procedure just to test specific gravity on the concentrated solution for your wipe. Your welcome. Lol	NULL

Religion isn't required. It stands to reason that the person was saying that they held the same position they had before they knew of the concept of god. they don't, not in relationship to the proposition. A person that does not eat meat is a vegetarian. Does that mean that when we call a baby a vegetarian and and adult a vegetarian that it would mean the same thing? Of course not, it would be silly to call a baby a vegetarian.  And no, you can't go on to say babies are atheists from the fact that they "lack a belief" because that's not what atheism means in relation to the proposition "there is a god".  That may be the context, but the logic still stands that saying that babies have a position towards the proposition that "there is a god" doesn't follow from observing that they are not in a position to hold a belief about God.  But you're claiming it isn't contentious, right? That there is no plausible argument against the claim?	NULL

I mean dude. I said that I don’t like guns and they’re a huge reason for the issue but they’re not the sole reason for any of this. They’re an issue yes, and I agree, but it’s such a shortsighted fucking view that it’s the main issue. There’s a huge problem with the fact that people are actually shooting up schools and it starts with why they wanna do that. I grew up in Canada too, so it’s not even a thing in my country and as I said it’s something I disagree with but I saw the same type of kids grow up with the same type of feelings and I felt like that was a huge fucking problem. Now living in Florida, I know a lot of gun people and I disagree with most of the shit they say but it’s not the same problem I saw.

Modern stand mixers that people complain about have a couple of plastic parts that have lower lifetimes than the rest of the appliance. You can replace them. They are also the first thing to break, and that's sorta by design. Cheaper to replace 1 plastic bit than a bunch steel gears.   The #1 thing to take from that sub is that if you want things to last, you need to *maintain* them. Like the stand mixers -- you'd need to make sure things are oiled when & where they need to be. Newer stuff is 'low maintenance', which just means breakable/replaceable parts.	NULL

People who dismiss rap as a genre haven't made the effort to understand how diverse it is or the musicality of what gets produced. Even worse are those who say rappers who don't write for instruments aren't musicians: there's a load of rappers who use wordplay and rhyming patterns to emphasise and play with rhythm in a way that any percussionist (for example) would find impressive. Their voice is literally an instrument augmenting and layering the backing track. I'm pushing 50 and not really a rap fan at all - or at least not mainstream, Lowkey, Jehst, Akala, Mic Righteous a bit more perhaps - but I can totally appreciate how a Kanye West song like Jesus Walks is accomplished and compelling music at every level...I don't understand people who can't see that.

I'm sure it's almost impossible to pull off, but I've read stories that imply you can demand a replacement item which is functionally identical.

I had an ileostomy bag after my second surgery and had it reversed after six months. When I was first diagnosed and starting out in this whole cancer journey my biggest thing was I didn’t want one of those poop bags. Once I got the hang of emptying it and changing the bag it was such a simple process. The reason I had it six months was because I just didn’t set up the procedure with the surgeons as I was only supposed to have it a very short amount of time but it became something that I was okay with living with.   If someone won’t be with you because you have a colostomy/ileostomy bag then they’re just not the right person for you. I never let having my bag stop me from anything and my wife had zero issues with it as well. The contents within a bag aren’t great to look at but there are cloth covers that go over it, which is what I would always wear and especially when at a water park or somewhere you don’t wear a shirt. I had another big surgery after getting my ileostomy reversed and before that one I let the surgeon know I didn’t care if I woke up with a bag because that’s how simple having one became for me and that’s how easy it would be for you to live with.   Most people I know that have been diagnosed with colon cancer don’t have an ostomy bag. If you’re having digestive issues the best thing you can do for yourself is to have it found early. You don’t die suddenly with this disease, especially if you’re a young adult (just my opinion).	NULL

Learn your history.  Women were also hunters, and men were also gatherers. Caring for children was mostly a job of the collective, and mostly elderly or  injured cared for children. There was no central family unit, because the tribe and collective mattered more than the individual bonds. There was no 'male' who supports a family, because everyone was supporting the tribe. Also, no monogamy back then, actually quite the opposite.   This modern idea of the ancient lifestyle is flawed and based on bullshit assumptions coming from our own lifestyle and recent history. And most of this is a luxury - the luxury of letting g 50% of the population 'at home' so that the other ones could go hunting is a waste in the harsh life of nomadic style. And not every man was fit for hunting,  and that was totally fine back then, because there was plenty of other stuff to be done for the tribe.	NULL

Not a dating story, but I have a mysterious liquid story I've always wanted to tell:  Decades ago I moved to an incredibly tiny town in the rural South with my ex-fiance so he could be closer to his family. I got a really bad case of the flu and was getting well-wishes and batches of chicken soup from people I'd never met. They'd show up at the door, explain their connection to the family, and I'd just smile appreciatively and accept what ever they were offering.   My favorite one was a guy who swung by and gave me a mason jar of cloudy, pinkish, thin liquid. He was family by marriage and his dad ran moonshine for a living. They wanted me to have the cure for the flu. I smiled appreciatively, took the grim-looking potion, and asked what was in it. "Cure for the flu." But...what is it made of? "Moonshine. Herbs. Things that'll fix you." Okay. I was then told to fill a coffee mug with this concoction, zap it in the microwave for ~30 seconds, then gulp it down. The jar had enough for three "doses" over the next three days. I still don't know what the hell was in that jar, but I do know that if you gulp 8 ounces of tepid moonshine once daily and survive, you no longer care that you have the flu.	NULL

When we talk about car safety, the only reason you’d bring up cars from the 70s is to talk about how far we’ve come with car safety since the 70s.   When people argue that nuclear power is dangerous because of things like Chernobyl happening, it’s like saying “driving a car in formula 1  is dangerous because multiple drivers died every season back in the 70s”  Look at how far formula 1 has come in 40+ years. Did you see the Romain Grosjean accident and fire in 2020? That accident would’ve decapitated him in the 70s and there wouldn’t have been a body to bring home for a funeral, just ashes. But now we have safety features like the halo, which is a very basic but super important (as we’ve already seen in just a few years) upgrade. Fire suits and clothing, compared to what Nicki Lauda wore has gotten much better too.   The fact of the matter is that Chernobyl had no quick way of shutting down in an emergency, among other major design flaws with its reactors, modern reactors can shut themselves down in a split second, sometimes without even relying on a person to hit the button.

No evidence for it.  I grew up believing but the more I studied science and maths and understood about the world the less god fit in.  Everything in science fits together le a puzzle and builds the picture of the universe and then I just kinda had this god piece where you try to fill gaps until something else came along and fit better and made more sense and eventually I realized I never needed that piece that I was told I did.  I've debated for years and no one has ever provided evidence for god and while doing that I learned more about logic and fallacies and reason and there's just nothing reasonable about believing in a god. No one believes it for the same reason they believe anything else and they don't question it like they would with anything else.	NULL

I have been a believer and an agnostic person now. Trust me life is same for me. Its just that I save a lot more money now. Being a Hindu, once I stopped visiting temples I have more money by my side which I used to spend on pooja, temple donation and lighting lamp etc. I have more time as well which I used to spend on praying. But one thing I understood over time is that when I used to pray I used to talk to myself in my head to a God and that had self healing and other mindfulness. So when I stopped praying I started bottling up things. Now what I do is when I am alone, I do spend atleast a bit of time to think on my actions, state of mind etc and acknowledge my issues and achievements. Praying was a good thing as it does engage one in talking to oneself. Having found an alternative I am at peace again with more money in hand. :)	NULL

Do you not know people thought Troy was fictional until someone actually discovered it? The parts about the gods might very well be fictional but Greece did wage war with a well protected city that we now call Troy.   And in the same way there's surly a lot to the Bible that is purely fictional but I think it is an extremely small minded opinion to write off the entire work as fiction. At the very least we can recognize that the old testament was a retelling of a people's history albeit with some obvious fantasy added to it.	NULL

The problem with that is that it removes all forms of responsibility and accountability from humans.   Consider the following scenario. You wake up in a hospital bed, with pain in your side. The room is crowded, full of beds, full of nervous and frantic activity. Children and adults are crying. A nurse notice that you've woken up, and while checking your wounds she tells you that you're one of the survivors of a random mass shooting. Meanwhile, someone in a hospital gown and a bruised face stands over the bed next to yours, crying. The person in that bed isn't moving. The nurse carts that bed out of the room, too busy with keeping patients alive to comfort the crying person.   Later, the shooter is arrested. He tells the camera he had no choice. He believed it was right, and that God told him to do it.   Does that excuse hold up to you? Probably not. This man was free to question if his belief was correct or not, and what he ended up doing instead of saying "no, that's wrong" was to put bullets in a whole lot of people who never harmed him. He believed everyone he shot was a sinner and that God hates them. Even now, when he's talking to the camera, you can tell he feels smug about all the sinners he sent to burn in hell.   That's the thing with belief. Everyone's got one. And we're all real quick to question the beliefs of others, because they're incompatible with ours. We all disagree with the religion of someone else. But it's all too easy to not question the log in ones own eye. The shooter example was extreme, but we can all agree that picking up a gun and firing is a choice.   You're right that we cannot flip a switch. But we can question things, and examine things. If *we* can't do that, why do we all say that *other* people should change their minds and come around and think like us? Judging by the way many people complain about all the harmless things other people think and do, humans obviously believe we can change our minds!   And we can. Just gotta remember to hold ourselves to the same standard. It's gonna be gradual. And it's gonna be work. But beliefs change over time - they changed based on the people we meet, and the suffering we see.   With that in mind? Yes, I'm a theist. I do believe in gods. But I don't think that's the most important thing. If they are not real? Frankly speaking? That's of no matter. What matters is if my religion made me a better person, and I can choose to pursue that thought.   Now there's nothing wrong with the kind of belief you describe. That's how I started out as a theist. It helped me. It healed me. Belief can help. Belief can heal. Sometimes, that's exactly what people need.  But it's a starting point on a journey that doesn't have a set track, and doesn't have a finish line.	NULL

Meaning I look at something I’ve cherished for a long time and I decide I no longer feel connected and give it away. My assumption is that it’s an intentional, “I’m not going to need this anymore” type of detachment.	NULL
When I worked as a cashier, a concerned customer whispered to me he saw a handgun on the floor of the bathroom and he was scared there was going to be a shooting. I asked a coworker to cover me as I went to the bathroom and sure enough, there was a handgun someone had set down next to the toilet and probably forgot about it. I gave it to my manager and she called the police.   Before the police arrived, a different customer came to my register and asked me if anyone had found something "weird" in the bathroom. I knew it had to be the gun's owner but I just said nope! I haven't heard a thing :) He left visibly disappointed/upset, and shortly after the police arrived and took the gun. Sucks for the gun owner, but I didn't think he was being responsible and the situation could have been worse.	NULL

I think they were saying that the Abrahamic religions and the idea of central scriptures are not distinctly European, and are in fact still aspects of  the largest attested sets of beliefs even if you subtract Europe and the nations it colonized. While I agree that asking people if they believe in a higher power and they just start dunking on the KJV then the question is not being addressed in its broadest scope but I don’t think u/juizze is falling into that trap, as they acknowledge the vast diversity of spiritual beliefs outside these.

5th grade English class in elementary school. I was always the one who tried super hard since I loved writing, and I’d always get an A on essays and homework. I had the same English teacher for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade, so she knew me pretty well and the fact that I was a try-hard. There was only one person better than me and she was some girl named Lucy.   Anyways, at the end of 5th grade, we needed to type up an end of the year essay on some book we read, and it was required to graduate. We used the school’s computers.  I didn’t have a computer at home, so I decided to stay at school one day and do it. I get to the computer lab, wake up a computer to start. To my disbelief I see an essay that’s fully typed out other than the conclusion on the screen already. It’s the one person that was better than me - Lucy’s essay.   I read the essay, write the conclusion, change her name to mine. Hit print, and turn it in to the teacher 2 days early.   I graduate, Lucy doesn’t. My teacher didn’t even question me cause of my proven work ethic   If you read this Lucy, I’m sorry!	NULL

Instantly a story from a sound bowl meditation class I took popped up in my head. Sound pretentious? Reality and the concept of life and the teachings of yoga were lost on this woman. She said she had ALL the certifications and trained with *this* person in *this* country and blah blah. The teacher asked her if she used her knowledge to help and guide others who do not have access to high end retreats while not having to work AND have no kids. She said, "No I'm just working on finding myself and figuring out who I am." Well, you never will and here is why : helping others and hard times make for a more well rounded person. Traveling doesn't *really* satisfy your craving? It makes you happy but still unfulfilled because you didn't really work towards it. I will never forget how pompous and sad she was.

Was prepared to end my life. Was getting ready. Filled up the tub, got out my little utility knife blade, just...you know. Ready. Huge nerd. I'm in tears, hurting, when all of a sudden, this pops into my head:  "It is not this day." It's from Lord of the Rings. I stop what I'm doing and go listen to the speech. The part that gets me goes like this:   "I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day."   Bawled my eyes out and went for help. LOTR has held an extremely important place in my life ever since. I've had a few attempts since then, but have always had to stop myself and remember that it is not this day. I've been able to get help each time. Spent some time in mental hospitals, therapy, etc.    But those words will always echo in my head. Tolkien amd his works saved my life. I think God put something in my head that he knew would grab my attention qnd keep me going, even years down the line.   Sorry if comment is rushed and messy. Just remembering all this and looking up the speech again makes me cry.	NULL

You don't have to use the subscription though. They still will track your workout performance and are good exercise bikes albeit at a higher price range.  I paid only $1,200 for mine as a coworkers husband was in legal at Peloton, but for that price it's the same as other high end workout bikes so it was a no brainer.   At the full $2,200 it's insane though. I think they need to price at the $1,200 range that is the current going rate for a really nice exercise bike and then hope people stay in the subscription too.

I don’t think that « once a cheater always a cheater » is a law or 100% true. I think the likelyhood of cheating depends on the person’s maturity level, if they learned anything from cheating or from exceptional circumstances. If you meet someone and they take no accountability or can’t explain the cheating in a mature way (saying because you didn’t feel loved is still shitty in my opinion) then I can guarantee you that the cheating/shady behaviour will continue.   I accidentally cheated once on someone and can guarantee that I would never do it to my spouse. I remember when I was seeing this guy (not my current spouse) back in 2015. We were official for 2 months when suddenly he just ghosted me. I texted/called him multiple times but he never answered. We were long distance and a broke uni student so I really couldn’t afford to go to his house. After 2 weeks of silence I thought that it was a sign that he wasn’t interested in me anymore. I was sad but moved on really quickly. I went online to find dates. I had met a couple of guys when a month later the guy I was originally seeing texted me. He didn’t offer any apology and denied he was gone for a month. I really tried to bring up that he ghosted me but I didn’t really want to rock the boat as I was in the middle of my exam period and didn’t want to make him feel bad. I didn’t tell him I went back online. I saw him one more time to go to the movies. He wanted to get physical but I didn’t want to so I just texted my friends to tell them to pick me up from the movies. He was getting sus so he asked to see my phone. I was worried he would see my text to my friends, text to the guys I was talking to online and my online dating profile. I told him no, left the movies on my own and walked 2 hours to get back home. I should have just told him straight up that it was over when he unghosted me. I truly thought the relationship was over after a month of no contact so I dated other people. I know it wasn’t my fault for seeing other people after being ghosted because 1 month of no contact is no bueno but I shouldn’t have lead the guy on any further than after he contacted me. I would never see other people if I’m with my spouse unless I was sure the relationship was over.	NULL

One summer I was playing video games with my mates when I heard a meow it was feint as I had a headset on but I was sure I heard something. I assumed it to be an ambient sound it was a Halloween event in the game I was playing after all. I was in the middle of a comp match so couldn't really get up to search but I looked around my room and saw nothing. Just to add I was home alone and it was very late in the night around 1 in the morning.   My game was over so I went to the home page then went to the bathroom. As I was washing my hands I heard a very loud meow followed by a hiss. I looked about and saw a tiny bit of blood in my bath I thought little of it assumed it was just a new shower gel my housemate got.  I went back to my game and mid match my plant in my hall was knocked down that's when I got scared. I left mid match to search around my house (I was playing r6 siege so I was in the hunting mindset) I went into into the bathroom again terrified this time nothing was there when I turned around I saw a dark figure run into my room I did what every sane person dose and grabbed a 3 iron then went into my room.   I saw a box from under my bed get pushed out. Then a dark figure jumps out at me I slapped it over the face with my golf club (not hard because I was jumped at and barely could swing but enough to make it fall onto my bed) thank god my microphone was muted or my mates would have heard a very loud high pitched manly scream.   It was a fucking cat. I fed it and gave it a blanket then took it to the vet the next day it was alright thankfully and I adopted it. Her name is Ruby her nickname is scaredy cat	NULL

I'm really just spitballing here but ok  I think it's a question of scale. Quantum computers upend the current paradigm of easy-to-make, hard-to-break protocols. I'm not a mathematician but expecting Blockchain to 'adapt' to an entirely new tier of computing power at a meaningful pace seems naïve.   Also institutions (i.e. those ostensibly most threatened by some of the more libertarian parts of DeFi/Blockchain) will have access to meaningful quantum computing well before the consumer. Who knows what the hell BlackRock will do with it. Too many variables to say.  I also think that quantum computing breaking Blockchain means that investors will lose faith in the technology and look for the next big thing. They're addicted to it. The only reason to have faith in Blockchain is because of implied future value, and I doubt they'll really see the nuance if people start losing money in the short to medium term.	NULL

The right has given up the self righteous quest for “traditional family values.” They know it’s a losing issue. Most right wingers will tell you they LOVE the gays. I think they are being facetious.   They will follow up by making snide statements on more marginalized groups like trans folk. Most of them have a fairytale fear of someone using the wrong bathroom. What’s ridiculous is that if someone wants to commit a crime in the bathroom it’s not like there’s police at every stall checking sexual organs. A dude can walk right into a woman’s bathroom and do whatever they want. And vice versa.  TL;DR: Loving the gays is not really a controversial take anymore.	NULL

My oldest kids got shoved off on to family members I'd pay a few dollars to because we went broke after my ex husband and my job (same place) closed down.  Fast forward I'm remarried living in UK now, my kids get free 15 hours of childcare a week, and £4 an additional hour if I need it.  I also pay a few pounds a week on home cooked quality meals with a real chef planning them. I'm talking about baked ham, roast chicken, curries with rice, baked pies, homemade chocolate cake etc.  My youngest was diagnosed with autism, had a SEN teacher assigned to her, speech and language, taught communication with cards and pictures.  I could cry that this was standard for children, in US I'd sometimes watch my neighbors boy who had Autism. There was no child care and no help for his mom. She tried her best, when he was put into mainstream school the old bitty that took care of special needs children tackled him Infront of my son because he wanted to give him a hug (they were really close).

I'm very liberal/left-wing.   Things I believe in:   1. Legalize all drugs, but regulate + tax 2. Transsexual, homosexual, bi, etc people are just people and everyone deserves equal chances at happiness. 3. We should invest more in public education, universities/colleges need to be affordable with state colleges/unis being completely free. 4. Medicare for all 5. Tax capital gains higher + irrevocable trusts shouldn't exist as another way for rich people to dodge taxes. 6. I believe that gun background checks should be total, complete, and reach much further up your ass so as to flush out whether you are a fucking psycho before giving you even a scintilla of a chance at a gun. This includes background checks of your family because I don't want your fucking kid going on a rampage. 7. Women should have the right to choose up. Period.  These are the right wing things I believe:  1. There is no excuse for heinous crimes. Violent destruction of private property, carjackings, illegal possession of firearms, etc. should be met with prison time and the accused shouldn't get to just walk out without a high bond to pay. I don't believe in the new age "set them all free! they're all underprivileged!" bullshit peddled by my city/county's DA. 2. Corporations and rich people are wrongly villainized and generalized in the same manner that poor people and minorities are. It's not right in either instance. You know that little diner you go to is a corporation, right? And you realize that Betty White is a rich person, right? As is Dolly Parton? You can't just say "rich people deserve guillotines" or whatever the fuck 3. If the man doesn't want the baby, but the woman does, there should be arbitration that allows a man to choose to have the baby aborted because if he helped create it, it's as much his as hers. However, if she doesn't want the baby and he does, the choice is always up to *her*. 4. I hate these stupid new age pronouns. I don't want to call you "Ze" and I don't give a fuck about your reasoning.	NULL

One of the biggest misconceptions that I see from religious people / Christians / Theists about atheism is that they are told that atheism is an active state of disbelief in god. In reality, there is a bit more nuance to the matter. There are belief stances and knowledge stances. Epistemologically, they are separate, but often lumped together by intellectually lazy Christian apologists, which is why there are so many people with misconceptions about atheism.  Atheists simply lack a belief in one or more gods. An atheist may also be agnostic, which is where a knowledge stance comes into play. A person may come to the conclusion that they haven’t discovered a reliable reason or suitable evidence to believe in one or more gods so they are agnostic. From this position comes even more nuance.  Those who are gnostic atheists claim that they have knowledge of whether god exists or does not exist and thus lack a belief in one or more gods. Per Russel’s Teapot analogy, you’ll find that it’s quite rare to run into a gnostic atheist or anti-theist. Personally, I am an agnostic atheist because this analogy makes the most sense when trying to wrap your head around the arguments that theists make for god.   Those who are anti-theists (also often agnostic) take it a step further and actively disbelieve in one or more gods, but it’s important to note that atheism and anti-theism are axiomatically different positions.  Atheism: simple lack of belief; not active disbelief  Anti-theism: active disbelief  Christian apologists (philosophy) often intentionally misconstrue these epistemological nuances in order to indoctrinate people into believing or paint a picture of implicit bias that is used to discredit atheism as a belief stance.   Simply put, religious belief is a learned behavior.  Everyone is born lacking belief in one or more gods.  Meaning that everyone starts as an atheist (lacking belief in one or more deities).	NULL
Well lets ask ourselves some very simple questions:  1. If a god would exist, why is there such things as evil in the world? 2. if there is evil in the world, why would god need somebody to represent him to destroy the evil things (aka the church and all of the believers) if he is literally allmighty? 3. if god is almighty and always „good“ why would he even create something „evil“? 4. can you even scientifically prove that there is a god? Have you ever heard, smelled, touched, seen or tasted god?	NULL

No, there's more to it that renders that idea impossible.  Mark 9:1 "There are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come"   Matthew 10:23  When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.    Not once does he say anything about transfiguration. The only other times in the Bible they use phrases like "Kingdom Come" and talking about the return of Jesus are when they talk about the end times. But we're supposed to believe this one time they meant something completely different? And what, wrote purposefully wrong text about it on purpose? What good is this book if numbers and dates and words in it all mean something totally different?	NULL

Let me ask a question, because this is an interesting question so I must answer it by asking a question.      What is the left/right wing opinion on international trade? If you look at U.S. History you'll find it's not easy to answer that question. Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were vehemently for opening up and freeing trade. But, both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are pro-protectionism.   &#x200B;  I think a part of the problem we have is that it's not a left/right scale and it never has been, particularly in the US where federal control is not a given. It's, at minimum, a four way system in almost every issue you look at.      I'm an unabashed free trade proponent. To me, this is right leaning, but to a trump supporter generally they would say its left leaning when we are talking about moving down a line.   &#x200B;  Another instance that I don't think we have a meaningful conversation because of the attempt to make it a two pronged argument is marriage. It is my view that both sides of the popular argument should be considered leftist on a single plane. My view is that marriage shouldn't be regulated by the state. That all marriages should be handled as private contracts. We shouldn't be limiting by law who can be on each others insurance policies, who can have visitation rights. We can still have laws around incest without the necessity of regulating marriage.   &#x200B;  On student loans, the "left" wants student loan forgiveness and the "right" wants no action right? Well I'm for retroactively making it eligible for bankruptcy protection.	NULL

Hell naw. I work for my money, so should everyone else. Ain't nothing stopping a homeless person from going down to a shelter, getting a shower, washing their clothes, and going down to McDonald's to get a job.

I once witnessed a bum downtown posted up outside of a tim Hortons with a help wanted sign in the window and he's begging for money lol. There's literally people who's job it is to help employ homeless people. The help and resources are out there, but most of them are too fuckin lazy to help themselves. And also half the money the make begging prolly goes to booze and cigarettes anyway so fuck that even more.

Left wing - I believe in the death penalty and access to firearms. I chafe at serial killers and child molesters/abusers being left alive in prison on the taxpayer's dollar. I personally would never approve my money to be used for that if it was actually an individual choice.    As for the guns, I'm not opposed to mental health background checks, holding periods, and stuff like that. I just don't think guns should be banned or restricted for responsible carry. As we've seen over the past two years, the government can be... volatile, and so can the populace. I'd rather have the tools to defend myself and my family than be forced to depend on someone else.

I had a woman come up to me in the grocery store and grab my arm. She asked me if I could pretend to be her boyfriend for a few minutes because a guy was following her around town. She said she was able to evade him for a minute, told me her name, and said "in the last store, I called my voicemail and made it look like I was calling my boyfriend. I'm single. He just won't stop following me. Help."  Before the guy came around the corner, I asked her story she faked to be more convincing. She was supposedly buying a cake for her sister's birthday. My friend in the bakery and I have a code for certain events that take place. We have one for this scenario, a time loop, being followed ourselves, etc.  I said our code word to them, and they let us hide in the big cooler room. The woman told me he has a gun. She knew because he was showing it off to a friend before. We sat in there for 10 minutes before being let out by the friend. The guy was still in the store. We faked ordering a cake after that just to be safe. We also walked out together. He followed.  At this point, now I'm terrified. As I'm loading groceries in my car, she's standing next to me. He walks up and asks me why she's with me. I told him it'd be weird going grocery shopping by myself and not invite my girlfriend. He looks at her and says "you were serious about having a boyfriend?" She agrees.  He walks away, gets in his car, and leaves. After his car is no longer visible, I look at her and say "I was 2 seconds away from shitting myself. Do you need an escort home or something as well?" She says she'd love one, but is willing to wait for me to finish shopping. We go back in together, finish my shopping, and I follow her home.  He's in her front yard talking to her sister now. At that point, we circled the block, parked at a local restaurant, and I called the police while she called her sister. The sister said he came by wanting to know if SHE was single. The guy is arrested for multiple reasons. I drive her home, help her unload her groceries with her sister, I got both of their numbers just in case they needed me again, and went home.  This story isn't the SCARIEST for me, but one that definitely had me on pins and needles. This was a year ago, but I sometimes relive the events in my head. Thank God my friend remembered our code.

I was an angry kid when I was younger and definitely brought that shit to the playground but I levelled out between the age of 12-16, I wish I could apologize to every kid I fought and let them know I just wasn’t dealing with my own shit the right way. It might never make everything right but I want them to know my regret.  I recall one kids in particular I was jealous of for being close friends with one of my friends so I picked on him because I felt my friendship was threatened and that my buddy might like him more than me. The way kids think can be all or nothing and it takes time to learn you don’t own your friends and you aren’t the centre of the universe. If you’re reading this Ryan, I’m so fucking sorry I made your life hell. If it makes any difference, I’ve made my own life more of a hell than I’d wish on anyone.	NULL
Eh, I’m not sure. I’m not trying to be a purist or say that all porn is evil and you should never consume it—I’ve watched it too—but I think that the bad does kind of outweigh the good in this. A couple of years ago PornHub quite literally had to wipe its entire database because there was no other way to purge all the CP on the platform.    Things like written erotica and animated pornography are probably better substitutes. Verified adult films with verified adult actors are fair. It’s the thousands of unverified videos on PornHub where you just have to take the poster’s word for it that it’s not nefariously produced are where the issue lies, in my opinion.	NULL

I don’t know if they’re really a corporation but Pornhub…   It’s inherently wrong to watch porn, but a lot of people on here are so touchy when someone mentions that the porn industry is not the ethical enterprise that they tell themselves it is. You might be watching someone being abused or trafficked without even knowing it.    There isn’t really a clear answer to how to fix this but it’s a conversation a lot of people on here avoid like wildfire.	NULL
What's really unfortunate is the guy probably actually has a really difficult time realizing they're coming off as creepy. I mean, to most it's probably obvious you shouldn't use business information to stalk somebody-- but some people seriously lack that much social awareness/capabilities that they just lean so much on other factors. (I.e. adding people on Socials) and just hope that's enough, I guess?   The alternative is they are aware and they often pressure people into positions like this and I wouldn't put that past some of these monkeys.   They also probably looked at you funny when you mentioned a boyfriend, if they knew your "Status" on any socials. Which-- trying to imagine their expression is quite spooky.	NULL

The problem with Kpop are the fans.    You say you don't like jazz.  Fans are OK fine, it's not for you.  You say you don't like Kpop.  Fans are like "what?  Have you heard this?  Are you racist?  You just haven't heard the right music etc..."  Just look at your passive aggresive post "it's fine if you don't enjoy music in other languages."  Like that's the only reason?  Like there aren't a bajillion other countries with different languages and there aren't a ton of other music genres that Koreans make?    Sorry to break it to you but Kpop is corporate made music based in a brutal culture that converts people into products and forces a very superficial value system on young Korean people forcing them to cut up their faces to support a beauty standard controlled by 80 year old Korean men who are afraid of outside influence in their culture.    There is almost no controversy when a male Kpop star dates a blond hair blue eyed girl but watch what would happen if a girl Kpop star dated a black dude.    I don't like Kpop because it represents some of the most reprehensible aspects of Korean culture.  Also the music is horrible.	NULL

Christianity is literally a religion where you can commit any sin, ask for forgiveness, and be accepted into heaven. Most Christians are not Constantine thinking about how to be better, as evidenced by... I mean I hate to make it political, but have you seen literally any religious conservative party in the world?  Religion is not the only valid source of morality. In fact, one could argue that morality for fear of God's wrath is not morality -  it's self interest.

‘Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.’ -Christopher Hitchens  When I was a very doubting believer, this sentence summed it up for me.

You can’t use the book that invents the story as proof of the story’s validity! I point out that it’s the same as saying ‘jedi knights and wookiees exist because the book that invented them says they do.’	NULL

"What was the before universe?" isn't a sentence that reflects real meaning aka reality because there was no "what" before all of the "what" aka the universe.

Before the proto-planetary disk there was clumpy gas and particles left over from previous supernovae. Etc., etc., back to the "Big Bang" aka the moment of inflation.

Umm that's awesome. Ive never met any montessori kids before. I had a neighbor who mentioned her kids went to montessori and they were rock stars. Id never heard of it but I Googled it and read that they do multi age classrooms and since my daughter an only child, I thought thats brilliant! My sister taught me everything, I could read by the time I was 4 so i know how beneficial multiage learning is. I figured "yup. She's gona go to a montessori school" anyways- one year later and I just enrolled her, she's 4 so we shall see if it's worth the money eventually. Either way there's like 8 in her class so she's getting lots of personal attention that would not be equivalent in a public school. Not to mention I'm not worried she will be murdered in a school shooting:  we have to code them into and out of the building.  Thanks for sharing the experience. Glad to hear it is a superior teaching method.	NULL

It's sad to me that so many people in a religion never take the time to learn the tenants of it.. I feel bad for their kids and loved ones the most because of exactly what you're saying. You can read God's plan right there in the Bible. Wether it's true or not is up to you to decide but in the Bible god's plan was perfection, pleasure, relationship, fulfilling work, and peace. That's it. Then people broke it because God gave choice, imagination, and creativity. I believe lovingly so. Ever since he's been only trying to save as many as he can. I really don't understand where all the other "answers" as you said, "non-answers" come from. I'm sorry someone in your life tried to cover their ignorance with bad answers.	NULL

The "correct" answer? I am an atheist, but answers like this are completely idiotic. There can be no correct answer to the question of why you should or should not have faith, this is just one possible answer. In this post people like to point towards evidence, fair enough, but I think that is a shit reason to be an atheist. Personally, I do not care about evidence one way or another. I'm an atheist because I do not want to worship some higher being, and this would not change if there was evidence. To me, atheism is less about whether or not god exists, and more about whether or not that even matters.  But this is my answer and it's not more or less correct than any other, because whether or not you should believe is not a question anyone other than yourself can answer.	NULL

When  i was like 12 i was in a public swimming pool, it had this special system that would create fairly big waves, there were also ropes attached to the sides underwater.

It's the first podcast I ever started listening to and has been the only one ever since. I've enjoyed all 530 episodes and each one is delightful in one way or another. I've tried one or two other podcasts on writing and nah, nothing comes close.   It's a beautiful marriage of John August's machine-like ability to aggregate and organize topics and Craig Maizin's ability to be Craig Maizin.   I'd pushback and say that they've podcasted their way out of obscurity and are well regarded rather than underrated but I take your sentiment well because I don't think you need to be a writer to enjoy listening to them, more true is that when it comes to the off-theme bonus segments.

That is faith alone. Your faith is that there is no afterlife. However, it is wise to find out where you will go before death transitions you to the other realm unseen in this one because once you die, it is too late to turn back. Why? does one who believe that 2+2= 5 changes the difference from the reality that it is 4? Like a man who believes that he will ascend upward when he jumps from a cliff nakedly, will he not still plunge to the ground? Take heed. The same reality is with the realms of the afterlife. It will be far better or far worse for you. Depending on your faith, you will either go to a realm of unspeakable torment without escape or a realm of absolute endless happiness. There is no other fate.	NULL

I'd been having problems with my neck, from an old whiplash injury. Physiotherapy helped, but there was something going on that x-rays couldn't see.  It took a while to persuade my doctor to order an MRI. He referred me to a spinal clinic to go over the results. I went to my appointment, hoping I wouldn't need surgery.  [A photo of my MRI](https://i.imgur.com/SYWwz1B.jpg).  So I had a herniated disc that was compressing my spinal cord.

The surgery was a success, there is some permanent nerve damage, but I have full use of my hands and legs.	NULL

From my vague recall...the kid escaped, though his brain had been peeled open and Dahmer had been digging in there for a bit. The kid managed to find help via a police officer by running into the street but Dahmer discovered them, told some story about being the kid's guardian or some lie and, I believe, with Dahmer being a white man and the kid being a POC (young Laotian boy) the cop believed Dahmer and let Dahmer take the kid back.

I agree with your position that gun safety should be mandated. But, if given to kids at a broad scale, that will increase the likelihood of fatal mistakes during training, at which point massive controversy would be stirred.

Hell and Heaven. I grew up in a very religious (Christian) house, the kind that prayed every day, never missed a day of church, and read the Bible cover to cover numerous times. I’d say I was a pretty good (by the book) Christian until my later teens when normal teen stuff had me guiltily “repenting” every day for all the ways I was falling short.  In college I found myself hanging onto theism by a thread, under the overwhelming weight of evidence that told me there was no God. That thread was the fear of the 0.001% chance of the  afterlife I’d been raised on.  It was ultimately the strength of the same convictions that kept me trying to follow the “law” of the Christian bible to the letter that ultimately put the nail in the coffin for me.  I went on a journey to learn about the worlds religions to better understand my own, but as my horizons broadened and I learned much more about the many beautiful religious traditions of the world, I also had to come face to face with the realization that billions of people - many of them doing far more than me to improve the lives of others - were, by my upbringing, still going to live out eternity in some kind of eternal torment.  That’s when I knew that even if that sliver of a chance of the afterlife was true, I wouldn’t want to gain admission to a heavenly place run by such a vile creature.  And suddenly (it really felt sudden) it was like my faith disappeared and I felt completely free. 20+ years and I haven’t looked back.	NULL

My specific beliefs are a little bit complicated, and although I'm not technically a atheist, but pretty much any one religious would call me one, so.   I was Christian as a kid, and as an adult one fact becomes more and more apparent the more and more I learn about organized religion.   Organized Religion is manipulative, abusive, and all about influence and power. The church doesn't give a single damn about God or truth or anything. They use faith like a weapon to lie to and manipulate and use people. Its about power, they don't want to "save" anyone.	NULL

There is plenty of debate to be had considering the simple fact that nobody actually thought it was necesary and the US had been fully aware of Japanese intentions to surrender for half a year at that point, and since they had intercepted Japanese diplomatic they knew what the Japanese condition to surrender was (one they planned to have anyways).  The bomb was a show of force, the entire idea that it was necessary is post hoc justification for an immoral and unnecessary act.	NULL

I had sex in a fire truck. It was a very small town and we were not fully staffed. On call basis. I met a girl while on a call at a nursing home for a medical. (She was a CNA)  She somehow found me social media, added me and straight up said she wanted to fu*k. She asked for a tour of the fire station, So…that’s what I did. Showed her one of the fire trucks, next thing I know she’s doing to dirty dirty on me and things progressed from there. Most definitely a once in a lifetime thing. I ended things very quickly after I found out she was also having sex with my best friend at the time who was the one and only police officer in that same town. She ended up keying both my personal car and the officers personal car. She was crazy. Like legitimately psycho.	NULL

I always send goofy stuff to my husband, and a few years ago I saw a good opportunity when a fast food restaurant I was at had corn on the cob on a stick.

I obviously wasn’t paying attention to what I was doing, and luckily instead of crashing my car being an idiot, I just sent the picture to the wrong contact. Unluckily that contact was a coworker.

From what I recall from my Labor Law course, >90% of CBAs do not allow for “direct dealing.”  The union claims it’s so that the business can’t negotiate higher pay individually with a majority of the workers so that the workers will be less willing to strike for other issues that need to be addressed collectively.  The reality is that it takes away power and control from the union, and they don’t like that. One of the biggest tools for the unions are negotiating pay increases. If employees can get those on their own, they might start questioning the need for the union.	NULL

First times don’t count since I had no idea what I was doing besides the straightforward stuff.  Physically it feels good or bad, right or wrong for me. It’s weird to say but I think different vaginas feel different from the perspective of what I can feel. Sometimes I don’t feel anything and that’s not a knock it’s just not as pleasurable.  Condoms I feel have come a long way (no pun intended). They used to be big boner kills for me because I’m circumcised so I think I have different sensitivity experiences than somebody having sex uncircumcised.  The thinner condoms are amazing but it also adds an air of mental worry in sex because sometimes you feel like you’re not wearing anything at all and occasionally that’s because the condom broke and you should pull out and reorganize haha.  From good or bad, I mean especially with wetness. So taking aside uncontrollables like how a particular vagina is gone feel or whether I’ve got to wear a condom or not to avoid an unwanted pregnancy, au natural wet is great and feels like I’ve accomplished something but I’ve also met women who were into me but didn’t get super wet (idk enough about anatomy to know if that’s simply natural or on me). Either way that’s when a water-based lube comes in handy and makes sex feel slippery and safe and more enjoyable for both parties.  I’m 30 but I’ve long since given up the urge to fuck around. I enjoy watching porn but when I’m in a relationship I’m monogamous and value the relationship beyond the sex, so for me it has to been something beyond ejaculation.  Sex with a partner can be making love but other times it really just be a quickie so in that regard I just revert back to the above stuff.  All that being said, sex wakes up parts of my groin that don’t usually feel anything at all. Attraction to a woman has once even felt like electricity to me, like a jolt of horniness that turns on an animal in me that just wants to fuck.  I can’t explain pleasure to you at this moment, but think of when your legs really want to run. Or when your hands really want to punch. Or when your hips really want to swing and dance. Sex to me as a male feels like a natural urge to reproduce, but as I’ve grown in a time of society I up until now have felt activated in those moments to make my lover and I feel as good as can be, as happy as can be, and ideally to both cum. So sex sort of feels like an obligation in that regard, but it’s not a bad one by any means. Except when a woman says “harder” and I’ve already reached max “harder” capacity 😂	NULL

The idea that we don't know whats beyond the horizon (i mean the fact that we don't know how and what is beyond the universe) is enough for me. I don't feel the need to fill the gaps. I am okay that we as a civilization don't possess that knowledge yet.   As far as other reasons go - i value personal responsibility above all. Religion gives you a cop out - its God's will. It isn't, you fucked up.   Imagine having 1000 molecular copies of yourself that start the life at the same exact spot and moment. All of those copies would have wildly different lives, fates and stories. Whatever happens to you is your fault, hence absolute personal responsibility.	NULL

Especially when average pay hasn't inflated at the same rate. I'm not talking about minimum wage or anything like that, just the purchasing power of the average consumer.  You used to be able to realistically work your way through college - i.e. work summer jobs and have a part time job and NOT have to take out a loan that will shackle you for the rest of your life.  Same with houses, decades ago, the average American could work a normal blue-collar job (factory worker, boring office job, etc...) and actually afford a house, cars, wife, kids, and go on vacations. In today's day and age, that's not possible without a higher level job, usually required at least a Bachelor's degree... now you're crippled with that loan and stuck with ZERO way to save up for a down payment, let alone afford a mortgage payment...  It just sucks because even if you do literally the EXACT SAME job your parents did, you would be lucky to be able to survive on your own, let alone all the things mentioned above...	NULL

My family looked at this about 15 years ago (in the intervening time, our logic has only solidified). We found:  * Commuting time - living in a rural area and having to commute to a larger town carries time cost (min 30 minutes each way) plus fuel cost and vehicle maintenance cost ($5 per day, minimum) * Children are happy in their school, which provides a lot of opportunities. Rural schools are smaller and have fewer options in terms of activities * Friends live locally * Good access to public transport * Taxi home at the end of a night out would be 5x what it is when you live in the city * Good access to local restaurants, takeouts etc. * Superior broadband  But the thing we found is that property prices within commuting distance of the city were actually not that much lower than in the city itself. If you're living within a 30 minute drive of the city, you're only saving 10% on the price of the property, but literally everything else about life becomes less convenient and more expensive.   With an anticipated commute of less than an hour each way, the numbers simply didn't stack up.	NULL

Every religion is a made up book of fairy tells wrapped in wishful thinking. There’s literally no proof for a single spiritual entity in the modern, scientific world that holds up to scrutiny. It’s painfully obvious that every major faith is made up by those who were naive, weak minded, fearful, or lustful to control their subordinates. No one knows what happens when we die, the best guess given the evidence is we simply stop—-we’ll each get to see if that’s true when it happens. In the mean time: enjoy life, love one another, and leave this place better than you found it.	NULL

So for anyone struggling with the inability to even open your mouth when confronting relationship issues with a partner, there are answers out there for you! Try therapy, if you can’t afford it, at least try reflecting on your parental relationships and see if that maybe has anything to do with it.	NULL

As a former Atheist, now a neo-pagan with a strong tendency to skeptcism, belief or non belief for me is not a choice, it's a matter of experiences...  For exemple if someone tell you they have five hundred thousand dollars in their wallet would you believe it? depends if the person seems sane, if you know and trust the person, the kind of clothes the person is wearing, if you consider the volume of this wealth would fit into a wallet, if you consider a bank card or a valluable object to be five hundred thousand worth... all of those judgments you make in secconds come from your previous experiences and knowledge.     In my case I grew in a Catholic family, going to mass every sunday, participating in some church events but not really practicing beyond that, and as a Kid I never believed in santa and other things but I always played along because I thought it was all like playing make believe, and I was in shock when I first met an adult that not only truly believed in the bible stories but also was really agressive about it, it also was the start of my former ill will towards believers... which I grew out of, but for my reasons to believe in Neo-paganism, some old gods (mostly Egyptian and Greek, but also native Brazilian and African gods) appeared in my dreams and warned me about several things, as someone who studied psychology as a hobby I thought it as archetypes at first, but the deeper I went into the subconcious, the more I couldn't find explanations for the things I saw and experienced, but then I met some people who delved into magick, skeptical as always I was analyzing everything as rationaly as I could, until I saw some really weird stuff I couldn't rationalize as simple self-hypnosis, deep focus and other things I knew, so now I believe but I also question it all the time.

There are two main concepts that seal my opinion on this topic. The first is that god is either incompetent or uncaring. If you see all of the bad things in the world: natural disasters, plagues, the needless suffering, and awful unfair ways terrible people thrive; you can only come to two conclusions. Either god is unable to stop them, and thus incompetent, or god just doesn’t care. Either of those leaves me thinking that whoever god may be, they’re pointless to pray to or worship.  The second concept is the idea of the afterlife. Almost all theistic religions have an idea that “we go to good place, everyone else goes to bad place” in their core texts. Even if you lead an awful and horrible life killing and hurting others, you can still go to the good place when you die as long as you believe in the right guy at the end and feel regretful (which almost every person does on their deathbed). Vice versa, if a good person who spends their life helping others and always trying to do the right thing doesn’t believe, then they get some shade of eternal damnation and suffering.  If god is real, and if they are some perfect being, they wouldn’t be so petty and self-obsessed to the point of sending good people who just didn’t believe the right thing to hell while saving monsters that picked correctly. If religious people truly believed that anyone who doesn’t believe in their god is damned for eternity, they would be frantically trying to save every person they know and living as desperate missionaries. The fact that they don’t tells me that they know deep down it’s not true.  In summary: if god is real, too much bad happens in the world and thus god either can’t do anything about it or they don’t care; both tell me they aren’t worth worshiping. In addition, if god is real they wouldn’t be petty enough to send good and virtuous people to hell for not believing the right thing while sending monsters to heaven for picking the right choice.  If there is a Heaven, I’ll get in for being a good man and doing the best to help those around me and leading a positive life. If god sends me to hell with that, then he’s evil and undeserving of praise.	NULL

For me it isn't so much as not getting it and rather I've seen it all before. New slang, new fashion, new antics.. it's not really new it is just repackaged.

In reality they're thinking "I already know how this is going to end, hurry it up.."	NULL
The problem of evil (or as I prefer to call it, the problem of suffering). The existence of a benevolent God is logically incompatible with the extreme suffering in the world. God would not make a world with the brazen bull, heroin withdrawal, agonizing depression, factory farming, or  the rest of the incalculable remainder of routine agony. This is demonstrable *proof* that if God exists, he is either evil or indifferent.  That said, I still practice religion as a cultural tradition and spiritual practice. Theism is false but there's a lot of good in religious ritual and community.	NULL

Yup, it exists. Hard getting though. Only been telling my doctors for like 20 years that I’m tired all the time. Finally got a psychiatrist who listens to me & a doctor who listens to me, & they both were like, “Yeah, you shouldn’t be THAT tired.”	NULL
I don't know if it's even fair here to say that anyone who's engaged in abusive behaviors is an abuser, that's also labeling and reductive and bound to get the worst offenders of abuse to think they are irredeemable and not seek treatment or go into total denial. You even said people with NPD cannot handle the idea that they have flaws. If someone with this disorder who'd engaged in abusive behavior read this, wouldn't the natural response to be to run away from the label of abuser and not be able to acknowledge their own behavior?  It's naive to say that some disorders aren't more associated with abuse and it's naive to say that narcissists don't frequently engage in this behavior. Yes it's the response to feeling like they are being fundamentally attacked in situations where that's not the case, but it's still abusive.  I think labeling people as abusers is probably more harmful than anything because it would dissuade people from addressing the core cause of why they are abusive, which is this case is narcissism. The solution is not to be naive about the harm NPD can cause the individual and their loved ones, but just more education on the discover itself, probably.  I know other people can be abusive too. I'm saying this is someone who was emotionally abused by a mother who probably has bipolar disorder and I don't consider her a lost cause. I recently ended a relationship with someone with probable covert narcissism and I don't consider him irredeemable either, but he's got to seek his own help and I'm not sure he ever will.	NULL
That road trip episode was trash.  Overall I liked the show, it had a good mystery it didn't drag out. It had bad and boring moments but that road trip one was just awful and excluds the show from this thread imo.	NULL

I’m ngl the last one is true for me. Had 2 exes that went out without me and then got raped. I got zero issues with trusting them, but I don’t trust other guys. It’s at a bar, there’s alcohol, she’s all dressed up, I’m not there, I just don’t want bad things to happen. Idk definitely been a point of contention in a few relationships, but one of the exes it was some random and the other was a close friend I regularly told was creepy. When you see the aftermath of that kind of act; the pain, the change of personality, the feeling of disgust she has (one was super close to her dad but after never was), it just breaks you as a person. You can’t help, you can’t soothe it, all you can do is support from a distance. It changes too much. Sex became a worry for me, I was hesitant to initiate and do anything. Was told by the first ex she thought I hesitated cuz I thought she was a slut, despite me saying why I hesitated so much, and it broke our relationship.   If you’re a guy who takes advantage of girls fuck you, literally please do us all a favor and just go away. Get help.	NULL

- Can’t properly apologized - Can’t accept an apology  This is true for *any* adult. If you get in a long term relationship or marry someone who can’t do both these things, get ready for a life of misery.  For men specifically:  - Can’t express a genuine emotion other than anger or laughing at a joke  To me this is the number one indicator that a guy is still living by the rules that he learned as a child and isn’t capable of expressing himself like an adult.

Well done! Now, what number comes after 2?	NULL
Yeah but its a big one.	NULL
Yeah, I have an Aunt who is extremely faithful, and who often is very loving, doting, and generous. But she’s also been openly intolerant, and has said very hurtful things, like a person can’t be a good person if they aren’t religious. She’s much better than she was thirty years ago, and she has many gay friends, but still has issues there that she generally keeps very quiet. We all have our flaws, but her intolerance is clearly rooted in her faith and the religious  values impressed on her growing up. She had far less room to question than I ever did. It was a very old school Catholic environment. When I learned about the Jesuits in middle school, I was told they were barely Catholics! I laugh about it, but it is just another example of intolerance, inflexibility, and obedience that I hate in religion. I have no interest in belief systems where that’s required, religious or otherwise.	NULL

Couple things, mainly I wasn’t raised with religion, but also, when I was a kid I had a friend who had cancer, she was great, really the best human.

I was raised by evangelics. They teached me about god when I was a kid. I was a very depressed teen and people told me to trust god and that he will heal my wounds. I never got the help that i needed. That was the time when I started to question everything and see things from another perspective and saw that nothing made sense. They always pray to god to heal people, but when people die or bad things happens, they always say its god's plan. Basically if you are sick and get better god healed you, but if you die, god wanted you to go. The mysterious ways god act they say. Its all BS. Thats the way i feel about god and religion.  Sorry for my bad english Btw 😅	NULL

Wasnt raised to be religious. Besides the logical inconsistencies, contrdictions to factual things and more, I think that if god did exist he would be a morally repulsive being. I dont think most religious organizations are a force for good in the world either. The fact that some people actually believe that morality and kindness can only exist because of god and the bible is maddening, especially in light of the fact that the most horrible people I have had the displeasure of knowing in my life have all been deeply religious.

At my birthday party one year in college my friends were taking things too far about teasing me when I couldn’t chug a smirnoff ice, and I wound up throwing something down on the table (which hit the girl sitting next to me) followed by smacking our landline phone off the TV stand and into the wall, leaving a huge dent in the wall. I then stormed halfway to my room before turning around and playing it all off like I was just joking the whole time. Needless to say it was a little awkward and tense after that.  I don’t normally have anger issues, but I was fairly intoxicated and didn’t like being put on the spot and having twenty people laughing in my face.   A temporary lapse of judgement that haunts me to this day, and something they’ll probably always remember when thinking about me.	NULL

I'm 27 and happily single now and staying with my parents during my semester break. I started playing Mass Effect Legendary Edition and he keeps on making comments like "you should be playing with your second kid by now, not this video game".   I get it, my mum was 24 when she had me (quite late in my country for that time period), but I can't fucking imagine having a tiny creature be fully dependent on me to take care of it 24/7. Add in my depression and other health issues, and I'm just not ready. Doesn't stop him demanding a grandchild.  He's now moved on to commenting to my mum about how they should've had another kid. Which is a horrible thing to say to my mum, since he's the one who convinced my religious mum to have an abortion when she got pregnant after having me because they just couldn't afford to have another kid at that point (it was her decision in the end, and it was a good one, but it's still a shitty thing to bring up given the circumstances).

Then, it was that it just simply didn’t make sense. I couldn’t understand why people would want to believe in a god, when so many horrible things have happened and just been waived off as necessary suffering. But, after a few POV considerations and deaths around me, and general growing up, I can see why people would want to believe. That they want forgiveness, or for their loved ones to still exist after death, or for someone to give a shit about them.  Honestly, now I wish I had been raised religious. I want forgiveness, and for dead loved ones to not just be bodies in the ground, and for someone to care for me while knowing my worst mistakes and thoughts. I just can’t.	NULL

I took a test like that once in Intro to Psychology...  The first 50% or so of the test was basically A,B,C,D,A,B,C,D over and over...  Then there were curveballs thrown in that changed the rotation order backwards and then a bit farther down back again to the original rotation...  I asked the teacher about it and he chuckled about it...He said he was interested to see how many people would fall for the reversal by not paying attention as well as if the class had been paying attention to the subject...  I still remember the final question was an essay style one that asked if we had noticed anything strange in class that day and to explain what it was...  That intro to psychology class was fun...

Thanks for sharing your experience. This whole "being in the present" thing is new to me, that's interesting. Idk if that's just you or if a lot of men experience this. At least, this "acceptance" feeling comes up a lot it seems.  >Then sex is that step further, the closest you can physically be to another soul.  Also I totally get that. When I was with my first bf in high school, the first few months of dating before we'd ever had sex, I loved hugging him but I felt like something was always... Missing. Like I could be all pressed against him, I still wanted to get closer. I still missed him somehow. Then we had sex and sex gave me that, finally: the feeling of being united with my partner, the feeling of being together for real, of connecting in the most powerful way humanely possible.

BSB/Nsync/Britney/Spice Girls/etc are really more Xennials than GenX.  That genre is very much made for teenagers; people who were teenagers in 1997-2000 were born 1979-1987.  If you want GenX music, you should go with what was popular in the early 90s: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, REM, B-52s, Lisa Loeb, New Kids on the Block, Madonna, Boyz 2 Men, All 4 One, Counting Crows, etc.  This would be high school for people born 1971-1980, which was peak Gen-X.  Note that the music has a very different feel which mimics the cultural difference between generations well.  Early 90s pop/alternative is angsty, angry, cynical, resigned, and generally pessimistic, usually featuring a lone singer against a usually-spare, sometimes hostile instrumental backdrop.  Late 90s pop is upbeat, shallow, optimistic, and filled with vocal harmony.	NULL

One of my earliest memories is asking: "why did we need to go to church?" The answer I got was we were there to worship God and Jesus; because apparently that is what our family did every week on Sunday mornings. I was not amused and dreaded going.  I suspected something was wrong with that idea too because, if the stories of God and Jesus were true, shouldn't I already have some knowledge or awareness of them prior to being told about them? I didn't have any prior knowledge or understanding, but everyone around me acted like they did so I played along thinking something would eventually happen and I would understand and believe like they did.  As I got older I continued to question but I also developed a solid fear of disbelieving in god. That fear prevented me from really considering if the god of the bible, or any god for that matter, was real? When I finally did face my fear and really considered what god and Jesus and hell meant to me, my faith fell apart. I did not believe and I no longer feared not-believing. I also no longer feared death. I was, and still am, afraid of dying but I am not afraid of being dead because I am pretty sure nothing happens for me after that.   I would love to be wrong, because continuing on in some way after I die does have some appeal. But I don't see how that might work without some kind of physical form to contain and sustain my thoughts, ideas, and experiences.  I'm pretty sure that this life is all we get, so I will hang on for as long as I can manage. If there is an afterlife, I think I would like it to be something like the short story ["The Egg", by Andy Weir.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)	NULL

Here's what you apologists don't get when you say things like this; the people who engaged in disgusting cultural practices were consequences of their time. *We condemn their actions and dismiss them as people who did not hold themselves accountable for something that society allowed because why would we expect them to behave any better.* These people **sucked** and should never have done what they did. Anyone who married a child or owned a slave was harmful and ignorant and we can say that easily.   Muslims, however, will not say that about their prophet. They can not say that he was harmful, ignorant, and dismiss him as a product of his time because he's God's most brilliant creation, he had to know better. And so instead of dismissing him and his actions, they turn away from child abuse and say "it was normal at the time", "what's wrong back then is not wrong today", "everyone was doing it then." Suddenly you have billions of people walking around without basic morality, people who *in our time* think that raping children is okay. THAT is why we talk about this specifically. This pedophilic rapist is still your leader, how?	NULL

The problem I have with religion is whenever we don't know the answer to something, it is God or scripture that is immediately suggested to fill the void. It could literally be anything at all, but if we don't know something at a given time, we are just supposed to 'fill in the cracks' with God. Inevitably, science/logic/reason lead us to the answers we seek, and what was once thought to be the divine is easily explained through acquired knowledge.

For me, all the believers I have ever met have had clearly displayed flaws in their critical thinking ability. I used to believe, when I was an 8 year old who had been raised to believe I'm questionably.   There's a reason why religion is more prevalent in countries with poor education and widespread poverty. Subjugation is far easier on people that lack critical thinking skills and the ability to make evaluation. And the facts speak for themselves.   Not one historian of Jesus day makes a single mention of him, despite several lengthy and thorough expedition across Jesus supposed sphere of influence. There's nothing, not one shred of evidence from his life that survives. The Roman histories make no mention of the conflict and major stories in the bible are at complete conflict with all other major national histories. Additionally, there is solid and clear evidence that Christianity is essentially a  collection of stolen traditions from other, older religions, man's of which did not believe in a single god, or even any 'gods'.   Lastly, being atheist doesn't mean not believing in a higher power. Maybe those powers we believe in are the forces of the universe. Maybe for some it's the creator of space, or a creator of a program we're living in (which is becoming increasingly probable).   Lastly I think it's worth noting that I'd never challenge someone on their religious point of view, unless challenged like here.	NULL

Maybe if you can prove negligence (such as the case of the parents in the case you are referring to).  But outside of negligence, where do we draw the line on putting blame on others?  Why would this be specific to just guns and not other property subsequently used in crimes?  Say someone's car is stolen and the joyriding thief hits and kills a pedestrian with it - do we hold the owner of the car partially accountable since they let their car get stolen and if it hadn't been, the pedestrian likely wouldn't have been hit?  Should a bartender that served a patron a few shots be held responsible when that person leaves and kills someone driving home since if the person wasn't served alcohol, the accident probably wouldn't have happened?  Say someone fails to properly maintain their home and their dryer catches fire due to a build up of lint and a firefighter dies fighting the fire, should the homeowner be held responsible for the fire fighter's death since the fire was caused by the owner's poor maintenance?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for hold people accountable if they are negligent with their firearms (or any property or duty for that matter), such as leaving a firearm unlocked and a child getting ahold of it or a straw purchase.  But I struggle to add blame to someone just because someone stole their property which was not negligently easy to acquire and then did something bad with it.  That's just a very slippery slope in my mind.  It's too easy to go from blaming the owner, to blaming the seller, to blaming the manufacturer.  Then why don't we blame bartenders, bars, and alcohol producers for drunk driving deaths, or car manufacturers for vehicle collisions deaths?  It starts getting into fuzzy arbitrary lines as to who's really to blame beyond the person directly responsible.	NULL

Haha I will admit that when the song started I was like "this is just noise" but as it moved along it started to grow on me. It definitely saves itself after 2:55. Have you heard of Genghis Tron? I wouldn't say they are black metal at all because they play around with synth, but the aggression in their songs are similar to Damaar (beautiful band name btw). I mostly listen to their albums "Dead Mountain Mouth"  and "Board Up the House" - but mostly Dead Mountain. Their albums are an experience. You almost can't listen to one song on its own. I used to buy metal hammer and rock sound magazines back in the 2000s and White Walls was on one of the free CDs that came with these magazines. It was the first time "screeching music spoke to me". I dunno why they work for me but they just do. Their songs are very experimental and mix and match genres fluidly. I don't know any band like them and I also don't know anyone who knows them haha. I haven't heard their newer stuff but looks like they still make music to this day.	NULL

A lot of people commenting lack the intelligence level to appropriately engage this discussion, therefore any comment in here I see as abundant.   Egocentrism causes a lot of “opinions” and “views” to be illegitimate. Your ego doesn’t have anything to do with religion. There are scientists that do believe in JHWH, there is just basically no evidence, if there was a god, it wouldn’t be in any human sense, if a god created us, there is no chance he made us intelligent enough to even understand the concept of a god. A higher power is more believable, but a higher power could be anything. We as humans don’t even know 90% of our existence, why listen to some strangers on the internet or value their religious opinions? If you have an intelligence above a certain threshold, you are able to comprehend most question based on a higher power, you do understand then that most religions are based on nothing but stories.   It’s the unexplainable that makes people believe in something that cannot the proven, because the unproven is unexplainable. A human brain always searches for an answer to a specific answer (the reason we got here in the first place). Sometimes there is no answer and faith is the only fuel that moves the vehicle.	NULL

Agnostic but we got lumped together often, just the fact there 100s of religions that claim they are right, what gives them any more validation over other religions. More over if there is a god or gods , then by what right can we possibly understand them, that in a universe so massive that they care so much for us, do we care about the lives of ant below our feet as we walk? There is some strange slight proofs that perhaps there might be something of a god, but all that proof shows signs that god does not have concerns of morality of our life’s, they are on another level of existence we humans have simply attached ourselves to and gave human logic and ideals too. That fact every culture across the world has some form of religion based on a god or gods shows it’s something that’s comes naturally to us and maybe it’s a natural mechanism for understanding the things we don’t understand or perhaps there is on some level a impression left on us to believe there is a higher power by design , whose to know dogs , cats and other animals don’t have the same sort of impression of this higher power	NULL

Child abuse is bad, giving the state tools to further legally torture people in a system where mistakes can and do happen governed by people known to have bad actors in their midst? That's so much worse.  Besides i work with child abuse victims, revenge doesn't help them and capital punishment isn't a deterrence.	NULL

Mum grew up in a religious background she hated so much she turned into a complete atheist, my dad was an atheist and his family were never religious and had strong negative views on religion (would never be discriminatory, just opinions kept to the family) and i as a kid could never grasp the concept of just believing in something cause lots of people believe its there, my household is quite science based so as a kid i would only really believe in things if there was proof, same doesnt really apply now though lol im quite gullible but religion still doesnt appeal to me, i feel like a lot of people turn to religion to help them cope with grief or other things but I dealt with grief differently and not once did i consider religion, i also had a friend who believed in God and she completely put me off the idea due to the fact she always tried to push Catholicism onto me. summary: generations before - bad religion experiences, me- no need for religion in my life	NULL

No that's not what I was saying.  What I meant was autistic people generally have extreme sensitivity to noises and it really upsets them, its unbearable.

Its overtakes your mood and thoughts and you can't get past it, as opposed to just "i think it sounds disgusting and I don't like it".	NULL

I'm not arguing against rap, I love all subgenres of rap. I am stating that gangster rap (a small subgenre specifically in the category of gang activities ie hard drugs, guns, violent crimes, killing, human trafficking, rape , etc) LITERALLY DOES glorify those acts. It would make perfect sense that a racist would MISREPRESENT that fact to demean those of a particular race that do partake in those activities or that rap about those activities. Also, it may be a "black created music genre" but not every gangster rap song is by a black person or group. It's good that you don't want to be like your racist dad, but if you think the message of gangster rap is "don't be like me" then you're kidding yourself.	NULL

I was very creeped out by the encroachment on my personal space as she said she just wanted to see how it looked. I changed back into my clothes and after asking if she was ready to check out I directed her to a co-worker and went to walk away. She grabbed my ass and smacked it as I turned around.

Firstly, the modern self-identified strain of ‘liberalism’ is explicitly correlated with mental illness. Studies of the mentally ill have found that they tend to vote less conservative and more liberal (Howard and Anthony, 1977; Kelly, 2014) . One paper, for example, found that 78 percent of mental illness outpatients in Germany preferred liberal political candidates, compared to just 56 percent of the general public. More recently, Kirkegaard (2020) analyzed the General Social Survey data and found that extreme liberals had a 150 percent increase in the rate of mental illness compared to moderates. Conservatives — even extreme conservatives — were 17 percent and 24 percent less likely than moderates, respectively, to have been diagnosed with mental illness.   Meanwhile, Pew Research Center’s March 2020 American Trends Panel Survey similarly showed that 38 percent of ‘very liberal’ whites have been told by a doctor that they have a mental health condition (compared to 20 percent of moderates and 15 percent of the ‘very conservative’).  More broadly, the same strain of ‘liberalism’ has been associated with destructive and unhealthy behaviors. Conservatives tend to be happier (Napier and Tost, 2008), healthier (Subramanian and Perkins, 2009), and — you guessed it — more attractive (Peterson and Palmer, 2017). Believing, as they do, that they have personal responsibility for their lives, they also tend to live longer (Kondrichin and Lester, 1998; Smith and Dorling, 1996). Studies suggest that liberals, meanwhile, are more likely to drink alcohol (Yakovlev and Guessford, 2013), take drugs (Nour, Evans and Carhart-Harris, 2017), and be promiscuous (Hatemi, Crabtree and McDermott, 2017).

As an adult, I can look back and recognise my mom was in deep depression most of my life.

I find myself sitting in a chair like her sometimes quietly looking off, and I have to stop and examine if I am also experiencing depression.	NULL

Let see going to catholic school while the church was covering up sexual assaults. Working in public safety and seeing all the messed up things people do to other people. Examples: guy says he was convicted as minor for a small thing, turns out he raped his little sister when she was 12 and he was 16. But not a big deal to him that his sister is going to be messed up for life and the family gatherings will be hell cause the family took him back in. Or the one where I had a mom get convicted of using her kid 4yrs old to sell drugs, then at 5yrs the mom is pimping the kid out. Yea no God I want to know, who is all knowing and merciful would allow that to happen to kids. That’s why I don’t believe in a God.

I work for Sirius Corp, an interstellar corporation with the wealth and power to rival governments. Our trade ships are often the target of Archon Delaine's Kumo Crew, the galaxy's worst and most powerful pirate organization, the only ones with the means to pose any threat to us.   My job is to intercept and destroy their pirate vessels, but failing that, I can respond tit for tat by hunting down and destroying their slave transports....yes, hundreds of slaves end up dying of space exposure or in a violent explosion but at least the Kumo Crew will have lost a transport, a member, and a whole bunch of work force for harassing us.

This has been very helpful positive perspective. Starting a website and selling products/services online is much easier too which I have done.

Call me a party pooper but... I never liked the storyline with the Nadja doll.

Dw not an idiot. A copypasta is a short or not too long text usually within a very specific yet very generic context, that is as the name says copied and pasted multiple times. They range from funny, to cringe, to grotescque, to horror (and in this specific theme they are called creepypastas and have great fanbases around them + entire series of stories (like SCP or The Holders)  In this thread i was implying that the comment above mine was really similar to a copypasta and if it wasn't it really should become one.  How to "create" a copypasta? Copy the message, store it in a document somewhere, and use it whenever you think it's appropriate. When enough people do this it becomes a proper copypasta.	NULL

i wont go as far as say im an atheist but i would say idk.  The reason I say idk is bcs heaven doesnt sound that all great. You can have everything you want whenever you want and you live in peace and paradise?  It doesnt sound too great, if i can have everything then theres nothing to strive for, nothing to want, nothing to earn. Life would become so boring. I wouldnt want to live forever when everything is just given to me. And if i am never sad then how am i going to know if im happy if happy is my only emotion then how will i know for sure im happy if i have nothing to compare it to?   Another thing people mentioned to me when i make this argument is that i become a perfect person but you cant be perfect without flaws and if i dont have flaws then who am i? Kevon is a person with flaws and strengths but if i become a perfect person i wont be kevon anymore and i wont have emotions since i am always happy all the time, i would be hardly human, doesnt that terrify people?

Maynard is an egomaniac, sure. But, there are a few things that he has openly talked about regarding his stage presence.   From the ænima days, he started painting himself and dressing in drag so he wasn’t easily recognized by overzealous fans, and that coincided with the birth of his son.   Somewhere between ænima and lateralus, he moved to the back stage right, typically. He said he did this do shift the focus onto the music as a whole. Instead of staring at a lead singer, the intention was to experience the rest of the band.   With APC and Puscifer, it’s varied a bit - but mostly he’s fine being a typical frontman (not 100%, but more typical than Tool). He usually wears costumes and glasses a ton, and still doesn’t like too much light on him - be that artistic or eyesight, I’m not sure.   He may be an egomaniac, but he wants his privacy. Everyone thinks he’s an asshole for that, but not everyone has 25-50k fans per night keeping an eye out.	NULL

Genuinely my first reason was depression everything else like how silly it is, lack of evidence, etc. those cane later. The belief made me extremely unhappy and made me fail to correctly rationalize why negative things were happening in life. Got a horrible mindset that God was unhappy with me and thus these negative things are happening. Resulted in poor grades, a more reclusive social life and being unable to enjoy the things I enjoy. I was becoming suicidal.  I give credit to my dad who saw this and intervene. He's a really soft on religion as in he technically believes but dislikes the church and he's probably as close to agnostic as a religious person gets. You could never tell from any interaction with him. I don't know if he's gone atheist now but it doesn't matter. He never pushed the religion thus I was technically free to go with any.  Anyways to wrap it up. I decided to drop praying, drop any ideas god is watching, etc. That I'm responsible for my actions and if bad things happen I may be able to nullify or correct that. If I don't it would be on me. I think this cured my depression. Instead of wanting to end life early, I'm now in the position that I want it to go on as long as possible. I've now had an overwhelmingly high amount of happy days since leaving bad days to injuries and illness both of which don't really happen much.

But if a friend says, "Hey, i feel more comfortable if you call me Frida instead of Fred and Her instead of Him," I'll be sure to do my best to do so.  My wife is good friends with someone who's actually pretty important in the Hawaii Mahu community, and she's an amazing person that you would probably feel really awkward misgendering. But if you called her him and didn't mean to offend, she would laugh it off and go on about her day, never holding it against you. If you meant to offend, she would probably make you feel like a pathetic child and then go on about her day.   It's not something they NEED. It's something they're asking for as a sign of respect and love. If you have no respect or love for them, then nothing is lost and you will find no friends there. If you think you have friends that identify this way and you just refuse to acknowledge their preferred gender, they aren't your friends, and you're not their friend. Friends treat each other with kindness and love. That's a trivial thing to fix, and if you're not willing to make the effort, you're not a friend worth having.	NULL

I was horribly abused by my mother and her family as a kid, sexually, physically, verbally, you name it.   I used to believe that I believed just to hopefully feel better because I had heard it helped. But it made it worse, I felt as if that imaginary entity had also left me and didn't want me and it made me feel worse.   If god is "all Caring", why would he allow a 4 year old to get raped by her uncle?   If god is "all Caring" why would he just let that sexual abuse continue from all members of the family until that girl was 10?  Why would he let that girls family best her until it hurt for her to breathe?  I just don't believe any higher power is there at all, I think there's just us coping with inevitably of death and that there's things we don't understand.	NULL

I can’t remember which bigger YouTube did the video I’ve previously seen, but they cover basically the same points as this video:  https://youtu.be/SqK0ciE0rto  The biggest concern is really how similar some of the words are despite being very far away from each other, including plural version of same words which can be difficult to differentiate over the phone, before even tackling with language barriers.  The video I saw before also criticised the fact that the technology in generating the three words were proprietary; as well as how continental drift can feasibly change your three words without you realising (although that’s not specific to using it for your address).

Hi Reddit,  I am writing today to get your opinion on something that bothers me now for ages. Being a German native speaker I have a big problem with the word ‚race’ and how its being used by the English speaking communities around the world. It may be, because we have a history in Germany, especially when it comes to racism and anti-semitism in relation to the nazi times. If we have learned something out of our history:  **There is no such thing than a race, other than the human race!** I find it utterly frustrating and embarrassing when I hear people from the US talking of other peoples ethnicities, using the word „race“. We would NEVER ever use this word in German, other than describe different races of dogs or animals. I believe nobody would use this word to describe someone else’s ethnicity here, it would just feel so wrong. It may be, that we are extremely sensitive on these topics in Germany, which I believe is important to not forget the past.  I am genuinely interested in your opinion on this. I have the impression that there is no discussion about this going on, as everybody is just accepting it as part of the English language and how its being used.To all the English native speaking out there: Does the word „race“ and how its being used sound wrong to you, or do you have an explanation on why its still used so widely in our times? Today everything is about being political correctness, we have movements like Black lives matters and a lot of social imbalances going on.   Shouldn’t we all make a statement while not using the word „race“ in relation to a human being? #humanrace	NULL
The thought of my brother finding my corpse made me tear off my helium exit bag just as I was passing out. Came to with the shreds of the plastic bag still around my neck a couple minutes later.

After the attempt I went to my brother and told him everything, later that week I started seeing a doctor and started the tedious way to get my life back together.	NULL

There’s no reason or evidence to point me towards believing in a higher power. There *is* however much corruption and wrongdoing caused and perpetuated by many churches and religious figures, and it’s clear to see how so many people take religion as an excuse to not use any critical thought of their own.   To me, it’s an archaic relic of the past from the days when we needed a way to explain what this sun thing was that rises and sets every day. I can’t imagine why someone who didn’t grow up (indoctrinated) religious would ever become religious, there’s by definition no evidence to support it.	NULL

I'm genuinely shocked by the number of people who have argued to me that lip syncing and playback is okay because they're dancing, or because they are trying to preserve their voice.  If they can't do it consistently then they shouldn't perform it that way.   I feel like it's never okay to pretend like that.  It sets a super unrealistic expectations on what is actually possible.  Plenty of artists can sing and dance live.  If you're faking half of it then why not just give the job to the person that could actually do it? Do something else. Why not get back dancers instead? Why not take turns switching with other group members? They can even just take a dance break where the full track is being played, but just don't sing along.   Don't get me wrong.  Recorded parts are a very important part of stone performances. Pre recorded backing vocals and instrumental tracks are totally fine as long as what the artist is contributing live is a different than what's in the mix. I just don't think it's ever acceptable for an artist to make it seem like they're doing something they're not without disclosing that to the audience. Tickets be fucking expensive ok?	NULL

I am left wing and do not think sperm banks should exist.    My reasons are:  1. We are bordering on an overpopulation problem.  If you aren't in a situation where you can have kids, go adopt one.   2. The children usually aren't allowed to know who their father is.  That is so wrong.    If you really want to bare a child with your body.find sperm from a man you know and write a contract where if your child has any questions or are curious then they can ask their biological father.    My Aunt is a lesbien and had my 2 cousins via sperm donor.  She said "I think what I did should be illegal.  I think it should be illegal to willingly choose for your child that they cannot know their biological father."    My cousins are some of my favorite people in the world and we are close.  I know for sure my one cousin hates that he can't ever know his father.  He has the word Vader (Dutch for Father, we have a Dutch/Frysan last name) tattooed on his back as not having a dad hurts him and shaped him so much.  I don't know if my other cousin cares as much..?  He is gay so maybe it affected his perspective with men less as he got male companionship in the form of loving relationships so the hole is partially filled perhaps?   (Like a lot of people, he was born gay so I am in no way saying not having a dad made him gay, that's not what I mean at all).    FYI I am bisexual myself and my opposition to this has nothing at all to do with her being in a lesbien relationship.	NULL

While I don't shit on mental illnesses or people that suffer from them, I fucking HATE when it's used as a crutch.  I used to live with a friend that did this.

Then some years later, they get diagnosed with ADHD, and suddenly it becomes their excuse for everything. "It's not my fault, it's the ADHD" was their catch phrase.  But here's the thing.  I ALSO have ADHD. I understand the struggle. But you know what I do? I put my big boy pants on and I get shit done, even though it (literally) pains me.

The belief that your interpretation of what this guy is trying to say is valid is unlikely, if your thinking is so simple and binary that you can only conceive of the idea of a higher power as synonymous with a “god” in the traditional sense.

oh iv got one that should remind young men like myself to not open up to people.   p.s. I apologize for the grammar in advance.  long story short I saved enough money to move from shit bag lower AZ to Lovely Colorado.  I didn't know anybody or anyone but have a good chunk of change saved up so I didn't care. I definitely couldn't afford any studios up there (900$+ is fucken ridiculous for a studio!?) so I had to do the roommate thing, not a problem I was roomateing with a few friends in lower AZ.  spend three bloody days in a hotel before 1 person got back to me, this strange little Russian chick who seemed shy and her tweak boyfriend.  So I said fuck it and moved in, long story short she was less then inviting  and the guy was so shy he could even look me in the eyes?   I had my own bathroom but I wasn't allowed to use the fridge, or other basic things that where annoying. This is fine we didn't need to get along just Co-exist. then about three weeks later of me busting my ass in construction I started to get a very bad pain in my lower right abdomen...and so when I got back home I thought maybe just would just sleep it off. That was a mistake as the pain got so bad I had trouble maintaining my composer, then I realized it was probably my appendix I was in rough shape and there was no way I could drive (Or afford and ambulance) iv never asked my roommate for literally anything and she got pissed when I begged her to drive me to the hospital, so after a bumpy ride (she is a horrible driver) I get into the emergency room and boom I was right I have appendicitis and its going to burst if they dont do surgery. Luckily the hospital was good and in a few hours I had the surgery done  but fuuuck did everything hurt, my life insurance would definitely not cover me being in the hospital for more then two days so I had to put my best "No doc I feel fine" face on so they would release me and I was lucky so release me they did.   Now it has bin about 18 hours  or so since iv had my surgery so I feel like shit and can barely walk, my lovely roommate said she would pick me up as soon as I got out, so its about 10 am and I call her, no answer so I call again and again till about 5 calls later I realize she's not picking me up. not a huge deal I could call a Uber, but dam did they take a long time to get a driver who spoke good enough English to get someone competent to pick me up about two hours later...I really wanted to get an over the counter Advil, some tea literally anything to help this insane pain go away so 2 hours felt like an eternity.  Got back to the apartment and unfortunately I was reminded I live three floors up...after crawling up the stairs I finally get to the door and its locked...I had forgotten the key in my hast to get to the hospital. At this point im ashamed to admit that the stress had gotten to me and I couldn't help but start to weep as the pain was almost unbearable, so I knocked on the door again and again till about 20 mins later her boyfriend opens up the door to me on one knee...inside and the Bitch is sitting in the living room, eating Cheetos, watching tv with her phone right next to her not dead as I could hear her Facebook notifications going off...I was raised with manners and all my strength was drained anyway so I get up and start to hobble to my room before she stops me and starts going off on me about little pet peeves I didn't know about that apparently she was getting mad about, then she seems to remember I had literally just came form the hospital and then this Bitch starts telling me to "Grow up be a Man it doesn't hurt that bad?!" like this little bitch knows anything about being a man! my bad I just got some shit ripped out me and am not feeling 100%...

My mum was a wonderful person. She was a midwife who supported 100s of mothers and helped bring 100s of children into the world. She was also a scientist working on a book about human evolution. She also happened to be an atheist. She died from breast cancer at 39, when I was 17.  In my mind there is no option for why this happened where god makes sense.  Either god killed her because she was an atheist, despite the profound good she had done and could have done. Or god does not care what good you do, and random deaths are just that. Or they are part of some master plan that has no concern for individuals. In either case, no higher power who could allow this deserves worship or praise, so I would rather believe they do not exist, because it makes the world feel a whole lot more fair.  This is really just an extension of the "why do bad things happen to good people" argument, but my mother's death put it into harsh reality for me.	NULL

Quit drinking soda. Year 5 of no soda will begin tomorrow. I was pretty heavily addicted to sippin on a cold dr. Pepper…..Somewhere around 100+ ounces a day of the tasty DP. One New Year’s Eve I went out with some friends, and instead of drinking alcohol I drank a 2 liter of Dr Pepper to myself in just a couple hours. Nearly threw up and felt bloated for about three days. Laying on a couch next to some severely intoxicated friends, I said “I’m never drinking soda again” and they all said, in the most encouraging drunk talk Ive ever heard, that I should really stop. Here we are 5 years later.  (I do have to admit though, I have had one dr. Pepper after a near death experience at work, but I don’t consider that breaking the streak because of the circumstances)	NULL

I was once on an evening wal with my friends in the old town, and it was absolutely crowded because it was a independence day or something, and, being too much into our own conversation, I screamed "BLYAT" (not in Russia but it's still the most common swear word in my region) the absolute loudest a living person can do in a conversation. The next moment came the realisation of how bad I just fucked up (I didn't care too much, but knew it gave the crowd an unpleasant shade), and my friends were about to burst into laughter, when I heard some other man scream "HUY" (another very common swear word)  just as loud as I  did and the relief was amazing.

Hmmmm where to start. .. I'm 55, disabled since birth (use a manual wheelchair) but I only bring this up to give context to what has happened in the past 2 years. I have always been employed (since 14) and single and self-supporting, I own my own home, have never had a personal care attendant and have owned a number of large (100 lbs +) dogs that i have fully cared for by myself.  I've worked for almost 30 years advising landlords of their tenants' rights in a series of jobs - all supervisory and mid-executive in level.   In Jan 2020, I started (for the first time ever) to have a number of wounds that just wouldn't heal - a pressure wound on my lower back, scrapes on my toes, etc and they just kept getting worse.  I ended up with gangrenous toes on both feet, pressure sores on my butt and thighs and a wound on my back that was 6 cm wide and 6 cm.s deep (that's approximately halfway above the knuckle of your index finger. )  I smelled of rotting flesh - like I had stapled a dead racoon to my ass, literally.     a wound care nurse visiting 3 times a week to change my bandages and a wound vac to help heal the crater on my back for 6 months.     At the same time, COVID was going on.  It tanked my industry and my business so I went through all of my savings.  I was able to get unemployment which kept the wolf from the door but that ended in September this year.   I owe 8K on my mortgage and have less than 10K to my name.     O and want to know the capper?  My mom died of COVID on Christmas Eve a week ago.  Do you know they do wakes via Zoom these days? The good news is I found a program from the Fed that will reimburse you up to 9K for funeral expenses for someone who has died of COVID so I can help make sure my sister will be made whole for paying for everything.    I am almost completely paralyzed by panic and I have no idea about how to be honest about it with the people in my life (sister exempted.)   But if you can't be honest with a bunch of good hearted strangers on Reddit,  then you're really in the shit.	NULL

Left wing here. I routinely argue for government spending to be fixed, and cut. We need to work more efficiently so that our tax dollars go to more. This means cutting a lot of the excess bureaucracy and jobs associated with it, honoring budgets and sticking to them, and limiting debt spending. It’s odd though, it seems democratic presidents are better at this agenda than their recent Republican counterparts. It’s the Congress that gets me angry with their pork infested budget bills. And that’s a both sides issue.	NULL

I have often told people to *try* to make a pop song, the simplest they can; 4/4, 4 chords. It's great for creativity because you suddenly have to think about everything that is not chords or rhythm. How deliberate are your vocals? How are you dynamics? How tight is your bass line? Are we on time or are we ON TIME? Are we using the eq range the best way possible? Is this the best way to structure this song? Tons of considerations that can go down the drain if you're trying to cram 30 chords and solo in Lydian mode on a polyrhythm at 200 bpm.	NULL

I think you have your own perspective bias going on.  I already acknowledged that religious history is covered with inhibiting knowledge at times.  But overall, religious institutions have been the primary organizers of knowledge until the printing press happened.  And even after that,  many religious institutions have provided extensive funding for scientific research. For example, the science of Seismology is often referred to as The Jesuit's science because many founding scientists were Jesuit priests. Additionally,  the physicist who first developed the Big Bang theory was also a catholic priest.    I'm aware that there are many darker occasions, such as the Muslim theocracy in the 1100ish that devastated Baghdad as the intellectual center of the world. And the more recent evangelical movements fighting against evolution. Among many others. But there are many examples of religious infrastructure holding organized knowledge together.    Also,  I'm a professional scientist, with a STEM PhD.  Yor	NULL

I can guarantee you that all 10,000 of those users got their heroin anyway. The criminal justice system is broke for many reasons, but the main one is that it is *intended* to rehabilitate or solve any issues, it's a for-profit business with a goal of making money. It does not make society any safer, it actually makes it worse because people who come out will have little choice but to return to crime since nobody will hire them.

> The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.  — Anatole France  It's literally illegal to be homeless most places. Of course they are going to break the law.  But another part of the challenge is that "homelessness" isn't just one thing. People wind up without a house for a variety of reasons and when we try to paint them all with the same brush, we can't possibly find effective solutions. Even worse is that each city is largely trying to find solutions alone. This means that any city that provides resources for unhoused people will find that other cities and states are quick to buy people bus tickets there, making any such system prohibitively expensive.

I know people optimistically think that being a cheater is an on-off switch, so if you cheated once, you just flip that switch to off and then you're never a cheater again.  The problem is not that the person cheated, it's that *they have the switch at all*. I do not have that switch. I just don't. The very notion of cheating or being cheated on causes a deep physical revulsion in my body. I literally get sick to my stomach thinking about it. There is not a body on this planet that I find attractive enough to cheat on my wife.   So to me, the challenge is not that a person can change. I believe anyone can make a mistake and resolve in themselves not to make that mistake again. But it's a matter of having the capacity to make that mistake in the first place. I do not have that capacity. I believe many if not most people do not have that capacity. But if you do, if you have ever cheated on a significant other, then you have the switch, and you might spend the rest of your life with that switch in the off position, but *you have the switch* to begin with, and I can never be 100% sure it will never be switched on again.

How can so many people be racist against Jewish and brown people of any culture when Jesus is brown and Jewish? How are we created in God's image when we have evidence we evolved from homo-erecrus? How does space and modern science fit with the Bible? How can one decide that one is good or evil and why would God decide a humans fate if he is a divine being?	NULL

Here are three very similar ones which were all told to me by an insane relative.  1.  The Loch Ness Monster exists but it’s not in Loch Ness. It, in fact, washed up on the shores of Japan but the Japanese government covered it up because knowledge of existing dinosaurs would cause a mass panic (for some reason).  2. Pterodactyls still exist and footage of one was taken in Montana in the 00s and uploaded to YouTube but the government had the footage removed and scrubbed from the Internet because they have a vested interest in keeping people immersed in the paradigm that dinosaurs don’t exist anymore.   3.  A National Geographic affiliated archaeology team in India discovered fossilized evidence of giants dating back to biblical times. Although they published their findings, the Indian government made them retract it because it provided evidence of the real historical battle between David and Goliath and the government wants to actively suppress any information that indicates that the Bible is an accurately written history of world events.  All three of these examples are evidence that governments around the world (or maybe just one big shadow government) are actively colluding to suppress scientific and archaeological evidence that the bible is an accurate and complete history of the world.  These governments suppress the fact that not only did humans and dinosaurs live alongside each other in the past but also that dinosaurs never went extinct in the first place. In fact, extinction isn’t possible because that would mean that a part of gods creation was flawed and that would be logically impossible.  These governments sustain these lies because it gives them some kind of control over the populace’s minds. Other mind control practices include water fluoridation and chemtrails of course.	NULL

I am a guy who believes in things that can be proven, also i think if you look at nearly any religion today objectively, its just a tool to control.   I think religious people today are mostly poor/uneducated and maybe struggling or have been at a point, when you have nothing its a comfort to believe in something.  I dont think religious people are stupid, a lot of them have been brainwashed into it by family and maybe your little community from a young age, and at that point it becomes a fact for you, its life. I have prayed when i was a kid, life wasnt easy etc etc. I never really believed but i thought what the heck, ill give it a shot.   I dont buy into the whole afterlife thing. What makes us different from all the other species? Does ants go to heaven too? What about micro organisms? If we go far enough back we probably share an ancestor, but why would a microorganism need a "heaven"?   As for what i believe what comes after death, i usually just answer with; same as before you were born, which is just nothingness. The chance of all of you being "you" is essentially 0, the number is so tiny you shouldnt even exist, but you do somehow. Nothing you do will matter in any way shape or form in the end. Some might look at this in a depressing way but id say its the opposite. Do whatever the fuck you want. Its still your life and you might only have one chance, you made it here, atleast enjoy your stay.	NULL

I’ve watched Taylor’s live performances (one of the more notable ones being her Tiny Desk performance) and her instrument playing doesn’t strike me as well above average. Her song writing is where she shines the most. She knows how to write a great song & that’s undebatable.  She’s good at piano and guitar but it’s nothing impressive. On piano, almost every chord she plays is beginner level and the songs can be learned fairly easily in a day.  Same with guitar. Almost all the chords she plays are the beginner open shapes you learn when you first start playing guitar. I’ve never seen her even attempt to play lead (not saying you have to in order to be considered a good guitarist, just an observation), so I’d say rhythm is where she’s most comfortable. It’s also hard to find footage of her playing a barre chord lol. Nathan Chapman plays a huge chunk of the guitar parts we hear on her albums.  There’s nothing that “stands out” about her playing but She’s good enough at each of those instruments to write great songs though & that’s all she needs!	NULL

I am actually in favor of making it illegal for any government employee to lie to any member of the public in their capacity as a government employee.  They could use as a defense only that they were unaware of the truth at the time, so they thought they were telling the truth, which obviously only works once.  The punishment for a conviction should be that they are permanently removed from eligibility for any and all government employment.  This would make undercover work impossible.  I'm actually Ok with that, but I'd also be OK with a warrant requirement, such that any undercover work must be pre-authorized to the specific lies told and to whom.  Which would still make things difficult, and I'm fine with difficult.	NULL

My senior year of HS I skipped a lot. One time I missed so many days of school consecutively that one of my teachers whom I had for math class the previous asked me what was going on. I told him my dad had passed. (My biological father wasn’t in the picture, so it was easy) well anyways the next day I walk into my AP Spanish class and immediately I get pulled aside. He begins to sob and tell me he can’t imagine what I must be going through because he still has his dad and talks to him everyday. Months go by and I graduate and I see him at my buddy’s graduation party as we’re pulling up. I panicked and before we could get out the van I come clean to my mom in front of my siblings. They all laughed and my mom was furious, (after all,  I still managed to graduate lol) he spoke briefly and I watched them talk for like two minutes when I ask my mom about she still can’t believe I made her go through that .

It depends on the trauma.   If it still affects the individual into their every day adult life, e.g. repeatedly having abusive significant others, addition, stealing etc. Then a method known as Schema-Therapy is one aspect that could greatly benefit. Essentially, it's a loop of habits, be it played on repeat (like PTSD / CPTSD), habits like picking the wrong social circle is like the snake eating itself - the traumatised individual needs to work their way through finding that loop, accepting it happened and then progressively working on forgiving themselves, loving themselves to help them getting through it.   There are more, intense, methods to get through trauma as well, by very specific professionals. It's called "EMDR". Essentially putting the individual through a sleep-hypnosis to relieve the trauma & conquer it, master it, forgive it, heal it.  I'm not sure what country you're in, or if this is available for you, but hopefully these will help you, or the person you're worried about. Best of luck.	NULL

That’s one of the great things about getting off of network television, where you have to go to a two minute break every six or seven minutes. You can tell a story (or a block of a story) in as much or as little time as it takes to tell. Sometimes you can tell where they’re trying to hit a certain attention span or syndication requirement, but then you look at shows like Black Mirror, where the runtimes are all over the board.  With regard to Chernobyl, I think the choice was to either pad out a couple of episodes and risk boring the audience or keep it concise and hope they’ll stay with you for an extra 25 minutes.	NULL

I'm really hoping that the "trust the science" cult doesn't pull a complete 180 now that CDC director Walensky has come out and stated that over 75% of cove deaths had at least 4 comorbidities, that roughly 40% of people reported as "hospitalized for the cove" were actually "hospitalized *with* the cove" (hospitalized for something else, and only realizing they were infected when tested at said hospital.), and that the vaccine doesn't stop transmission, but only lessens the severity of our own symptoms.   Hopefully now that the authoritarian cult realizes those they slandered as "science deniers" had a more accurate take on this, they can get over their narcissism and let everyone get back to living and letting live. Especially now that it's been confirmed that people choosing for themselves whether or not to get vaccinated, will literally only impact themselves.   This whole experience has really taught us all how far neurotic types would go, for even a false and fleeting sense of momentary security. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering. We've seen a darkness come out in people, that will be hard to forget. Even now that we know who would've supported concentration camps in WW2 though, we've *got* the be willing to forgive them, should they ever possess the strength of character to sincerely apologize for all the damage they've advocated for (beyond the unavoidable damage imposed by the virus itself.)   We have to accept that many people lack the requisite mental facilities to see through bullshit. So they are essentially victims of fear mongering, and campaigns telling them their irrational hatred is somehow virtuous. We must be willing to forgive those transgressions, should they ever stop committing them. We only get one life to live, and it would be wasted at each others throats.	NULL

As someone quoted above "What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence." Your religion or god offers zero proof it exists or is real. It’s your job to demonstrate your religion is true, not mine to demonstrate it is wrong.  A negative cannot be proven, but this is not a “victory” for religion because this is true of all religion. I cannot prove that Zeus, Thor, Yahveh or the giant spaghetti monster don’t exist. As long as they are invisible, never do anything and exists in a parallel plane of existence beyond our ability to experience, it may as well be anything.	NULL

That’s what I mean, and plus realistically, I’ve been in and out factories at all sorts of levels and industry’s and the issue with the automatic fork lifts is that they can only go so fast with only so much efficiency, depending on the factory I’ve always seen forklifts with human operators are more efficient, more dangerous and unpredictable? Absolutely, but people who draw the bottom lines for these places don’t care about how it’s done as long as it’s done quick and automatic forklifts have a ceiling to how efficient it can be before wasting time.

My grandfather and I talked about this. He believes that marriage between a homosexual couple shouldn't be called marriage. He thinks they should be able to get a legal agreement that allows them all the legal benefits of marriage, but it just shouldn't be called marriage. This is because he believes marriage has a religious connotation, and that there is something more "special" between two heterosexual lovers.  My dad just thinks it's nasty and my grandpa's neighbor who is a crazy asshole, racist, and bigot, thinks that God wants us to kill them all.

As far as documentation goes i'm talking about things like varied creation myths across the globe from different times, especially among small tribes they can be very tailored to that culture (someone came up with it mostly independently), things like cave paintings depicting sun deities... yes there is lots of evidence religion is something that people naturally have a tendency towards.  It's clearly not a viral movement emanating from one place.  It crops up just about every place we see any record of history.  And also, sure, many people are happy to live life without much real curiosity, but even the dullest child has wondered where they came from, why they are here at least once.  I'd say 99% of the world's population has pondered their existence at least once.  It's not surprising to think someone devoid of any information thinks, "well, someone must have put me here".	NULL

For me I typically refer to the Kalam Cosmological Argument a la Dr. William Lane Craig, that the Universe as we currently understand it came into existence, and therefore must have had a cause (unless we are to believe in spontaneous generation which is paradoxical and doesn't account for fine tuning). I go a little further into defining that cause as something that must be outside of time and space as we understand them in the physical universe, in order to be able to create these dimensions. It must have some sort of agency to have been able to create a Universe with order, and with parameters that allow celestial bodies and life to form. This I think flows naturally from arguments for Deism into arguments for Theism, but I won't go into those here for brevity.  There are hosts of other arguments for the existence of God, some of which are talked about by Alvin Plantinga [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R21z7RrKywo) and some against [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeX6Lhb0_6A). Although Dr. Plantinga notoriously does not believe one needs an "argument" to believe in God, and that it is perfectly rational to have a belief in a higher existence without needing an argument to prove the existence of such a being (a stance I'm not sure I agree with). Dr. Plantinga is also known for his assertion that Naturalism cannot coexist with a view of Darwinian evolution, in that an evolution that evolved from lower forms of consciousness cannot be relied on as an instrument that can reliably infer ontological and epistemological truths (to sum it up extremely roughly, I would recommend watching his lectures on it if you actually want to learn it). This was a position argued for by C. S. Lewis as well in his books "Miracles" and "Mere Christianity".	NULL

In my jrotc class in HS, we would have a free period on some days, told ahead of time and were allowed to bring in movies. We were told ahead of time for our Major or Sgt to get votes on what movie, if they had to rent it or if someone had it, what snacks, drinks but mainly to approve the rating of the movie.  One day I came up with an elaborate plan. You see our high school had a printing press with scans. It was a special class to help with college credits or help you get into the printing press trade school.   I knew which period the Press teacher went to his big ass closet and took a nap bc it was his free period. I know this bc I was his teachers asst during honors computer class.  I skipped my class to go there, to accomplish this I used the excuse that he needed my help. This wasn't unusual as I've legitimately had to before.   I had the National Lampoons Senior Trip movie. I cut the vhs box to lay it flat, scanned it into the computer, and printed out a whole new box (that had to be assembled) but with a new rating of PG13. Then bided my time.  When the day came, our Major asked about the movie, I said my movie "Senior Trip", Major asked "What rating?" and I told him, the box says PG13, everybody agreed.  Day of, I show him the vhs box, he nods and put the movie in.  Walks out to go to his office. My classmates are looking at me. They know this movie. They know it's not PG13.   Of course my luck ran out and Sarge walked in during the end of the hotel scene with the dildo display. I explained immediately to him that it's only that scene for humor nothing more. There's no sex or nudity.  He gave me two hours of PT the following Monday. Apparently never told Major bc I didn't get reprimanded or demoted.  Not too much of a secret except for how I did it. My classmates I'm still in contact with from jrotc still call me Dags bc of that.   Always asking how I pulled it off.	NULL

Dismiss the concept of atheism for a second, and consider science.  Religion will see something that doesn't make sense, and tell a story about it.  Science will see something that doesn't make sense, and strive to make sense of it through observation.   They are different. All beliefs in dieties are beliefs in the unobserved, while 'belief' in atheism is the knowledge of the observed. Atheism is fundamentally discrete and isn't just 'another belief'.	NULL

Politicians in my country. The current political party has been ruling since 2002 and they became extremely rich. The country has been dealing with high inflation -%36 last year if you count on the governmental institutions- and wage increases can't even meet the inflation rate.   The politicians, especially politicians from the ruling party, have no clue about the life of an ordinary citizen. President's wife said something like "If the citizens can't afford to buy avocados, they should buy it when it's cheap and dry it up." Avacado is extremely expensive and it's not something a minimum wage worker can buy whenever they want. I think politicians think people buy avocados and a martini and go to their 400 room palace after work as they do.   A minister said the people who wait in long queues to buy cheap bread fake it and they are paid actors by the opposition parties.   The president called students who were protesting the bad conditions in dormitories terrorists.   And this list goes on forever.	NULL

Multiple reasons  1. If there is an almighty kind god, why are people raped and murdered. No it’s not “their plan”. It shouldn’t be anyones plan to have kids raped by pedos.

I don't think there's anything unethical about sending someone a like, follow or message if you know them in the offline world in some form or another.  Doing reverse searches on their email address(es), legal name, phone number and/or address to dig up everything they've ever done online from their first computer? That's definitely crossing a line. In fact some countries have laws against that, the legal term is 'cyber-stalking' and in some cases it can be as serious as stalking someone in person. Don't do that.	NULL
Okay so I recently had a friend fly over and stay at my place with his girlfriend. He's only had 1 other girlfriend and it wasn't serious. But anyways I kid you not, he'd put his but in his gfs face and fart and shed do nothing but let out a "seriously" and he proceeded to do that multiple times to the point where I had to tell him that's not how you treat any girl let alone your own... but who know maybe she has a fart fetish he and I don't know about.

it's really amazing how they took this show, that was so amazing, that it was everywhere.  Everyone referenced it all the time.  There was GoT themed everything.   and the way it ended was so amazingly disappointing that people just pretend it didn't even exist.  you don't hear people saying 'you know nothing' or 'hodor' anymore.  it was just basically wiped away from everyone's memories.

I don’t think I was ever *the bully* but when I was maybe about 10 we used to pick on this kid in my school who clearly had some kind of mental condition.  He left school one day and never saw him again. That was almost 20 years ago. Never made amends. I don’t think he’d even remember me (I hope not) and if he does, he probably wouldn’t want to hear from me anyway because to him I’m still just some arsehole kid he used to know in the same way in my mind he’s still the same strange little boy I used to tease to make my friends laugh.   I hope he turned out alright but to contact him now would really be more about making myself feel better than out of any sense that it might help him at all.	NULL

Yeah that route I had was pretty bad. I eventually switched because every time I asked for help I was told I just didn't know how to handle them and it was all my fault. One day my boss decided to meet up with me and was waiting in a lot where I got off the highway, she said she could actually hear the kids before I turned down the street and the windows were up!   I still wasn't allowed to have an aide, even after one very unfortunate morning. I had 3 boys holding 'fight club' in 1 seat, 1 kid jumping from seat to seat, one crawling under the seats, and a first grader gave another first grader 2 Sudafed thinking they were Tylenol. The fighting kids I was told I couldn't punish since you couldn't see the actual hits on video, couldn't see the kid under the seats either. The one jumping from seat to seat did get in trouble (amazingly). The girl who gave the pills was suspended by the school & the other girl taken to the ER and had her stomach pumped. Luckily another girl told me about that incident so i went into the school and told them right away.  Eventually I got off the route and the other drivers who did that route who had years of experience had so much trouble one pulled over and radioed for help, another asked if PD could come out and get them to settle down.

I got a DUI in 2011 in the state of Kentucky while I was in the Army. I messed up, but dealt with the consequences, fulfilled my obligations  (license suspension and DUI classes) and paid my fines. I always had a PA license and moved back to PA a year later.  **SEVEN* years later, I’m renewing my PA license and I get a notification from PennDot that because I had a DUI in KY in 2011, my PA license would be suspended for 1 year and I’d have to pay a fine and take DUI classes.  I think it’s a clerical error and try to call Kentucky DOT for my records and proof that i completed the requirements.  I was told that my DUI was so old that it had been expunged and there is no record of it to provide to KY. Efforts to obtain records through the police or a lawyer were unsuccessful. PennDOT would not accept this answer.  $10,000 in attorney fees and 9 months of no driving later, the situation finally gets sorted out. It **WAS** a clerical error in both KY and PA and I didn’t have to go through any of that if someone had just done their job.	NULL

>they age out of the system (no longer considered a child)  So basically the most important difference between orphanage and adoption - kids from orphanage get expelled as soon as they get adult, with no parents, while adopted kids are adopted by the parents as their own, and they get into adulthood like children from normal families (ie. living with parents until they decide to move out)  So, foster care is pretty much a small orphanage except that the "staff" lives with them like real parents, instead of being employed?

Many reasons. I started down this path when I was very young. Being a part of a minority community I experienced a fair amount of prejudice. Worst part was, some of my own family members were the same, they cried about how people treated them but spoke of "others" and "them" constantly. This made me very cognizant of bigotry and how pervasive and insidious it could be.   As I grew, I gravitated to literature and media that was disdainful of such stuff.   When I was in school my town experienced both floods and a pretty bad earthquake. People came together and helped each other, it was amazing. Also, I saw most of my town coverd in smoke from a communal pogrom. Luckily for me it wasn't against my specific group. We still ran away from the state for about 6 months.  I've seen no benifit from a belief in God. To everyone that says that there is so much good done in the name of religion, I ask how you can feel it's enough recompense for all the terrible things done in its name. How many people need to be fed to balance out an 8 year old being raped for 3 days and then strangled at some temple at Rasana? Ask yourself, what is your moral limit? I've decided. I can't condone this shit.  I also feel that any good I've done or will do was because of me. Not god, or fate or any other bullshit. The devil didn't make me do shit either, I've got to take responsibility. Heaven and hell give excuses for terrible behaviour. - do good, you'll go to heaven even if he did bad and seems like he's having a great time, he'll go to hell. What a fucking cop out. Take responsibilty, if there is no place after death, more people would be likely to improve this plane. Atleast that's how I feel.

The world would be a less shit place if people quit believing in a sky fairy and instead develop their own set of morals and accepted the fact that life ends when you die and you should love each other while you are alive instead of trying to force someone to be a part of a religion that doesn't exist so that you can feel better about yourself when you die. Religious people are inherently bad because their moral system is based on avoiding repercussions rather than behaving based on what they truly believe is right. Bo Burnham said it as a joke but it is really true.. " you shouldn't abstain from rape because you think God wants you to, you just shouldn't rape because it's a fucked up thing to do" religion has been the center of nearly all major conflicts in human history.

Aside from the very few cases like Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, and John Wayne Gacy (i.e. prolific serial killers who are guilty even beyond unreasonable doubts), it shouldn’t be used. As plenty of others have stated, innocent people being executed is outright unacceptable, and the financial cost for all the trials and appeals ends up costing more than a life sentence. And the matter of all the appeals and lengthy trials has another problem: punishments for crimes should be need to occur in a timely manner. With the average time on death row currently being around 19 years, the punishment is anything but timely. For some people, waiting on death row basically ends up as a life sentence anyway.  As for reducing crime, its been solidly seen that it the death penalty does little to nothing to lower crime rates. And while it is heavily debated, there’s even a hypothesis called the *brutalization effect*, where it’s proposed that violent crime may actually increase after an execution.  So unless we get another Albert Fish, Jeffrey Dahmer, or Richard Ramirez, that’s a ‘no’ on the death penalty for me.	NULL

I would consider myself a fairly logical, calm, and orderly man.  I do technical IT work for a living, so my brain and personality tends to be that way.  But when I get in "'the mood" all hell breaks loose in my brain and all I can focus on is getting "that fix" like it is a drug.  It is a burning desire for that euphoria, and then after it's over it is like the HULK or Mr. Hyde has disappeared and the real me returned to claim my body and I return to my work and duties with clear and focus intent.  But that burning desire is focused within by crotch, inside my pelvic region.  My penis is the antenna and transmits the "good feelings" inside of me where it actives something (I don't know) inside my pelvic region that eventually erupts!!!!  My body explodes with every good feeling.  I can't breathe, I can't think, I can only feel warmth, love, happiness, tenderness, joy, just everything that I'm missing in life.  And then after that moment it's gone.  The raging storm that was inside of me is now a calm ocean.  The raging beast is satisfied... for now.  I have been given a reprieve to continue my work until it reveals its ugly torment.	NULL

SCABIES, if you didn't say this or have this come to mind first, you have no idea.   Thousands of bugs breeding under skin biting you and feasting on your flesh, plus everyone is allergic so you get a deep burning itch   Biggest nightmare of my life and takes over a year to get rid of fully.   Was miss diagnosed twice because it's so hard to determine if you have it because they are microscopic.   I'm talking scratched myself with a pumpkin scoop till I bled every day for 6 months itchy till u was diagnosed.   Even after you get rid of them, they still stay under your skin like glass and slowly get pushed out over time. But when it's pushed out you get sooooo itchy because of the allergic reaction  Plus they are microscopic so you don't know if you actually got rid of them. 6 months if having them plus another three months if post scabies having the waste pushed out  I would not wish this on my worst enemy	NULL

it was both my parents and honestly our relationship was very strained but it's gotten easier since trump is out of office. it stopped being the topic of every conversation and now that ive moved out we don't see eachother often so every conversation is pleasant. before that though I would just lock myself in my room and only come out to eat because they were so uncomfortable with me for a long time but we've worked through it thankfully but again it was hard and I moved out at 19 which is pretty young to move to a big city kinda far just so I could get away. it was difficult money wise but the best decision I could of ever made for myself and our relationship	NULL

No, I think it's more that a lot of older men don't have a template for how to be grandparents as much.  Or they have a much kinder one.  So they know how to be a dad, because that's how their dad treated them, and few of them rarely take into account what their relationship with their father was like.  So they "know" how a dad should be, but it's not really how dads should be.  This causes a rift.  They either know grandparents spoil or they don't have a set template so they feel it out as best they can.  This enables a healthier relationship.	NULL

There is more to life than having as much sex as possible with as many women as possible. This gets asked in some way shape or form all the time by men who think their current non-existent sex life is the end of the world when really they need to realise they’re either most likely the reason they’re not getting laid, or that they should be focusing on other things because it’s just not everything.   A man who’s slept with 500 women isn’t any better than a man who has slept with 10. Or none. It doesn’t make you important, or valid, or a man.	NULL

> Atheism is the rebuttal to this claim, that God does not exist.  This is where you are wrong. No rebuttal is necessary to be considered an atheist. It doesn't matter if you *believe* that a rebuttal is necessary, because it simply isn't. Words *mean things* and you can't decide that they don't include things that they do.  **https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism**  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#DefiAthe  >While identifying atheism with the metaphysical claim that there is no God (or that there are no gods) is particularly useful for doing philosophy, it is important to recognize that the term “atheism” is polysemous—i.e., it has more than one related meaning—even within philosophy. For example, many writers at least implicitly identify atheism with a positive metaphysical theory like naturalism or even materialism. Given this sense of the word, the meaning of “atheism” is not straightforwardly derived from the meaning of “theism”. While this might seem etymologically bizarre, perhaps a case can be made for the claim that something like (metaphysical) naturalism was originally labeled “atheism” only because of the cultural dominance of non-naturalist forms of theism, not because the view being labeled was nothing more than the denial of theism. On this view, there would have been atheists even if no theists ever existed—they just wouldn’t have been called “atheists”.  It isn't even accepted within philosophy to mean *only* what you are saying it does. It even addresses the concept of a complete unawareness of the concept of god.  >Departing even more radically from the norm in philosophy, a few philosophers and quite a few non-philosophers claim that “atheism” shouldn’t be defined as a proposition at all, even if theism is a proposition. Instead, “atheism” should be defined as a psychological state: the state of not believing in the existence of God (or gods).	NULL

My friend dated a guy briefly who was in his 30s living with a roommate and they had zero living room/kitchen furniture. It was a 2br 2bath apt and the living/ kitchen area was just...empty. Two grown ass men and neither of them owned a couch, or dishes! They used paper plates and plastic cups.   She is sort of a non committal type and apparently the sex was good, but eventually even she couldnt get past it.   It is now a joke in our friend group that if he has a couch then he already has a mark in his favor.   Also, bonus story. Another friend went home with a guy and he had a not only clean bathroom but it was functional with a shower curtain, towels and hand soap.

I have a twin brother and we share a bunk bed (I sleep on the bottom him on top) and I let him go on the bottom bunk if he wants whenever he wants and I let him touch whatever item of mine he wants but when I wanna go on his bed to show him a video or spend time with him in general he gets really visibly upset and raises his voices and if I don’t in x amount of time he physically kicks me off the bed or shoves me out. And when I touch his things and I don’t give them back to him in 3 seconds then he starts punching my arm to the point where it’s not enough to leave a bruise but just enough so that it leaves a sore on your arm for a while. And when I asked him, “Why don’t you let me touch your things or go on your bed? I let you touch my things and go on my bed” then he replied with something along the lines with “I can’t help it” or “I’m sorry I just can’t” and that brings me here to ask the question, is my brother selfish or does he have a mental illness?

The world has too many coincidences and too much chaos to believe that there is one.   We, (humans) are capable of free-thought and coming up with colossal ideals that would not be possible without our own cunning and improvisation.  That and The Big Bang and Darwin's Theory of Evolution just seem to be the most consistent of the stories of how the universe was created or how the human race came to be. The similarity of humans to our fellow primates to me are too much to ignore. Not just the fact that we have posable thumbs and have similar body structures; but also how our societies are structured.   In short, while I have a bit of respect on a philisophical level for some of the teachings the Abrahamic faiths in particular have brought on the world; I still consider myself an athiest because while correlation does not equal causation, there are probably too many correlations to ignore.

While the claim itself is somewhat of an overreach, it describes an observable phenomenon known as multiple discovery, wherein scientific advancement or near-identical discoveries occur independently. Common historical examples include calculus and evolutionary theory.   While you could argue many religions often share motifs, this can often be attributed to copying, schisms, or generic events (war, natural disaster, etc.) and the specifics become diverse and non-compatible.

I always found it interesting how so much of modern religions (mainly Christianity as that's the one I know most about) is stolen/adapted stories from other religions, and yet those religions are wrong whilst Christianity for example is right. God literally looks like Zeus, but God is real and Zeus isn't? Noah's Flood is an adaptation of a Sumerian story iirc. Hell is just straight up Tartarus. Then there's the stuff that was twisted, ram horns used to be a symbol of fertility until Christianity decided they were a symbol of the devil. How can all these religions Christianity stole from be false, but Christianity is somehow true? How am I supposed to follow the beliefs of a religion that took it's beliefs from "false religions"?

Nargaroth is my personal favourite right now. He's made several songs about the seasons, nature and the cosmos. One of my favourite songs of his is called Spectral Visions of Mental Warfare. Everything about this song is perfection in my opinion. It even has throatsinging in the middle of it haha. The lyrics are also just...     "In the old Man's Dream   He saw an Emptiness in my Eyes   Insatiable   In the old Man's Dream    I threw my Heart   Into the Cosmic Core    In the old Man's Dream    I left as Son    And returned as Chaos"    All his songs are contemplative and very atmospheric. I absolutely adore his work. He switches between singing in English and German and majority of his fan base are Spanish and Portuguese. For some reason a lot of Spanish people are very into black metal. :)     I also enjoy listening to LUSTRE and Thy Light who mostly make atmospheric black metal and even though he is a controversial shithead, I do like Burzum's music too. His songs are also about nature. Dunkelheit is a brilliant piece of music if you ask me. From Dunkelheit:     "When night falls    She cloaks the world    In impenetrable darkness   A chill rises   From the soil    And contaminates the air    Suddenly    Life has new meaning"     Then there's Agalloch even though they aren't officially classified as black metal, they definitely feel like black metal. Their songs are about nature too. Their song "In the Shadow of Our Pale Companion" they have this lyric:    "Here at the edge of this world     Here I gaze at a pantheon of oak     A citadel of stone    If this grand panorama before me is what you call God     Then God is not dead"     Very beautiful lyric if you ask me. These black metal artists have a way of painting pictures with words and their music is like sitting in nature through time as you slowly become a tree. I dunno how else to describe it. :)	NULL

Not all stray animals have rabies. In many places it's actually not that common to meet a rabid animal. And in the vast majority of cases the rabies symptoms show up relatively shortly after the bite (if it has been left untreated). So the risk of the disease showing up years after is pretty low (it also depends where on the body you have been bitten).  The vaccination protocol is also different depending on what type of vaccine it was (prevention or post-exposure emergency vaccine). Was your vaccine a preventive or reaction vaccine ? And how many booster shots did you get ? At which frequency ? Because the protocol matters for the protection.	NULL

So I would call it zombification, not 'teaching'. Even now as an adult I can feel these 'facts' deep inside me, even if I fully understand that it is bullshit from uneducated people	NULL
