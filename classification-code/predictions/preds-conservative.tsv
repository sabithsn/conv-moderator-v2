Yes. Yes it would. VAERS cannot be used to establish causality but it provides extremely useful data which is why it exists. Entries are most commonly made by medical professionals. Period. There is an effort to discredit it but like Wiki it provides useful information that is actively moderated, tracked, and edited by experts. More deaths have been removed from VAERS than what are currently listed in the system. Around 50k have been reported and after review 20k remain…   I have a vaccine. I’m boosted. My gf and parents are and so are their parents. I’m against the government’s *actions*. I simply cannot believe they are forcing people to get vaccines. The FDA and CDC are evaluating risk. There *is* risk. Remember when they told pregnant women not to get jabbed? Then they reevaluated the risk, it’s mitigations, and re-assessed. People have a right to evaluate what risk they’re willing to accept. The FDA and CDC might say the risk is worth it but millions disagree. Release the data and let people draw their own conclusions. That’s their prerogative. Don’t feel safe in public because of COVID? Fine. Stay inside. That’s your prerogative.	existing	existing	[0.78898036 0.21101959]

I am not an expert but am educated on the manner. Agg and industry use like 90% of water in the US. So we do good there.  Colorado being on the continental divide has the ability to increase (by millions of gallons) runoff to the east or west, depending on the right price.

Just it is the same.  &#x200B;  >*The democrats worked with republicans to pass the infrastructure bill, which was almost identical to what Trump was pushing... then not a single republican voted for it.*  First, the $1.2T infrastructure bill did pass. Thirteen R's voted for it and 6 D's did not. It was signed into law by Biden in November.  Second, Trump's infrastructure proposals where regularly shot down uniformly by the D's leadership. Even when they would start to agree, they would move the goal line. No way they were going to hand Trump that kind of victory.  Last, the $2 to 3 trillion social spending BBB 'infrastructure' bill is what has not passed. It had strong support with some but not enough to pass and certainly was not bipartisan. It was mostly a Progressive wish list - including not paying for it long term as the CBO mentioned.	existing	existing	[0.5582382  0.44176173]

If I were you I’d go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers.

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	removed	existing	[0.7645895  0.23541051]

Anybody who tries to tell you differently is either stupid or a liar.	existing	existing	[0.8462028  0.15379722]

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	removed	existing	[0.7785611  0.22143887]

His statement was just a warning shot across the bow, so to speak. Donating to the protest effort is fine. Protest is a part of democracy.  HOWEVER, anyone caught donating to a group who has expressed their intent is to foment violence or overthrow the government, has committed a crime. The phrase 'trump supporters' is generally an allusion to violent actors.    It is sad that all conservatives get painted with the broad brush.  It does not help that at every single one of his rallies, Trump has encouraged violent action.

    Let the Bible speak for itself on marriage, sexuality, and the gay agenda etc.        Romans 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. 28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.            Jude 1:5 Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgement on the great Day. 7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. 8 In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.            1 Tim 1:8 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly. 9 We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, 10 for the sexually immoral, for those practising homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine 11 that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.            Mark 10:6 “But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’ 7 ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, 8 and the two will become one flesh.’So they are no longer two, but one flesh. 9 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”            Isaiah 3:9 The look on their countenance witnesses against them, And they declare their sin as Sodom; They do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have brought evil upon themselves.            Leviticus 20:13 If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination        1 Corinthians 6:9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.            Genesis 2:22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. 23 The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.” 24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.            Matthew 19:4 “Haven’t you read,” he (Jesus) replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ 5 and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”            Hebrews 13:4 Marriage should be honoured by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.             Ephesians 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— 30 for we are members of his body. 31 “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” 32 This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.	existing	removed	[0.12765002 0.87235   ]

What we need to focus upon now is not dominance or singular policy. America I'd and has been great because it has allowed for 300 years it's citizens to pursue a personal relationship with God.  And to realize how much love God has given.  Before we have had to fight opposition for centuries.   Now it is important to realize America is one of the lastplaces left where religion is not dictated by the government. And our abilities to spread hope and love to other nations is why Christianity is spreading.    The most important reason is not to win the coming battles, but to survive them so we can continue our tradition of not succumbing to human authority and tyranny.	existing	existing	[0.82661176 0.17338826]

Lol, don’t worry, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden he just got 81 million “votes” from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you’ll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they’ll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don’t see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the “worst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics” even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you’re a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you’re constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	removed	existing	[0.70464844 0.29535154]

First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	removed	existing	[0.59394467 0.40605533]

This will undoubtedly sound callous, but I don't care, at least any more than I care about deaths from any other cause. Life happens, and death happens as a part of it. The "if it saves one life" mantra is unrealistic and downright irresponsible when factored against economically depressing effects and quality of life degradation for hundreds of millions of people.  Cardiovascular disease is on track to have killed, in 2021 alone, almost as many Americans as died of Covid ("with" Covid? "of" Covid? Will we ever get honest numbers?) in 2020 and 2021. Where is the outrage? I continue to challenge anyone who purports to care about raw numbers of American deaths: Where have you been for the last few decades of our citizens eating themselves to death? And why do you think that a government which watched fitness and nutrition related medical disasters unfold for decades is starting to just now adopt a policy of "if it saves one life"?	existing	existing	[0.7568499  0.24315014]

I agree. Even during the summer of 2020, 56% of Americans said their lives were better than they were in 2016. By 2024, people will be able to compare 4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden and it shouldn't even be close as to which will have been preferable.   That said, I still think he should step aside. And while I think his mind will be fine, I think the man should just rest and enjoy his retirement. The man spent decades working long hours. His cumulative time spent sleeping over the course of his life is probably lower than that of many people half his age. He's in his 70s. He was cheated out of a second term, even setting aside the questionable election results. (The Democrat weaponization of COVID was very much real (in terms of the fear, not a bioweapon, so shut up lefties) and that all gets used as fake talking points to pretend his policies led to many of the issues we saw, ignoring the glaringly obvious context of a pandemic.) He should just live out his days in a less stressful manner. Play a kingmaker role, enjoy Florida's sunny weather. Take it easy. Enjoy his golden years.	existing	existing	[0.85721487 0.14278509]

First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights’ worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith.

We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers.

I am well aware that if St, Francis of Assisi ran as an R, he'd be vilified.  I get that.  The problem with Trump is that too many people have already decided they hate him.  That includes many squishy suburban types who vote on their feelings and have decided that he's mean.  It is fair to say that Trump doesn't help himself with things like his performance in the first presidential debate last year.    Presidential elections with an incumbent are normally about the incumbent, who has to run on a record.  This administration is a disaster, and running on its record should result in a Reagan/Mondale level landslide.  But as soon as you put Trump on the ballot, the election becomes about Trump.  And that is an election that can still be lost.  I know that few people on here think that 2020 was fair, but the fact remains that it was still close enough for the least inspiring candidate ever to keep things close enough for the cheating to work.  Trump served a great purpose.  He stared the process of ending dirty business as usual.  But the message is more important than the messenger, and the messenger in Trump's case has important flaws that stand in the way.  It is better for his cause for him to step aside and let let someone else pick up the banner.	existing	existing	[0.5978826 0.4021174]
That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	removed	removed	[0.18962331 0.8103767 ]
To incentivize businesses to actually take the leap and create the parts necessary.

There's a lot more research to be done here before I'm going to get mad about this.	existing	existing	[0.8554905  0.14450946]

>Our society is slowly but steadily becoming less religious.  That’s the problem. I don’t agree with the notion that a strongly religious and a strongly scientific society are incompatible, look at America seventy years ago if you want an example. Atheistic characters always put Christian’s on our back foot by claiming faith is belief without evidence, but that’s simply not true. Look up the Greek word Pistis if you want to know the actual foundation of Christian faith. It doesn’t mean belief without evidence.  I would argue that without faith humans into self-serving narcissistic nihilists, and this is exactly what we are seeing in society today.	existing	existing	[0.6842356  0.31576437]

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.

Medical ethics:    1) Patient Autonomy - my body, MY CHOICE - the right to say no without paperwork!    2) Non-maleficence -- FIRST, do no harm!    3) Beneficence -- do good.

Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	removed	removed	[0.12354842 0.87645155]

Home schooling would be a good alternative, I agree.  Teachers aren't teaching anymore - they're indoctrinating future cult members.

Encouraging diversity of thought while increasing education standards (not standardizing, but we can't let kids pass grade levels when they are 10 years old and can barely read) would be another fix.

I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	removed	existing	[0.8508913  0.14910872]

The responses to your question fog up what he ACTUALLY said.  He talked about the badness of whiteness for the vast majority of the podcast.   That whites are genetically incapable of sympathy and such.  That is NOT why he was fired from his job.  He was talking to an ex-member of Public Enemy ("Professor Griff")...who was in full agreement.  Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...

"I’m confused on why people downplay the issues/systemic problems that have gone on in our country for centuries. People were enslaved and forced to work for free while being stripped of their humanity,families, or any other humanly items/thoughts while being told they shouldn’t be allowed to read, write or enjoy any other freedoms that their oppressors enjoyed. If it’s safe to assume legislation and legal action has generational effects on people then we can easily assume that the 200+ years of legal slavery 100% had major impacts on those people. And it only gets worse. Once slavery ended those people weren’t actually freed or given literally anything to start with. We just swapped slavery with indentured servitude, enslaving these people for life-but legally. And after that? Black codes, Jim Crow laws, segregation etc. It’s crazy to think after 400 years of this group of people experiencing nothing but pain misery and hate from another group that they’d be able to magically “pull Themselves up by the bootstraps”. After centuries of this treatment we finally Found “equality” which isn’t even true equality and now we tell the group of people who have been though all of this to essentially get over it, and move on. This group of people have been destroyed within this country for centuries and all you guys have ever done is either A- be the problem or B-do your best to make it seem as if there is no issue and that these people are dramatic. It’s disgusting. They kneel during a national Athem against a systemic problem they’ve been facing and somehow that’s anti-American but breaking literal laws and going against the ways of the country on Jan 6th is okay?

This is an interesting angle, and I agree with you somewhat here.   Religious based arguments should not be used. Seriously. Most of the religious arguments I hear have better arguments that are not based in religious beliefs. Republicans have the vote of most Christians. Using arguments founded in religious belief will never appeal to a non-Christan person. They will ignore your premise because it is based on beliefs they do not share.   But I don’t believe we should throw religion out of the window. I have and would vote, in part, based on the presumptions I can draw about a politician being Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc.  I mean, what is the purpose for religion if not to guide thoughts, life, decisions, etc.?  I don’t know a practicing Christian that could separate their decision making from the moral and philosophical principles instilled in them through religion. If they didn’t allow religious principles to guide them to some extent, they’d be no different from a non-religious person.  Also, Christianity is very much pro-individual rights and personal liberty, but that is probably another discussion.	existing	removed	[0.1338795 0.8661206]

Lots of things are harmful to society. Guns in the wrong hands can be illegal. Free speech can certainly be offensive. What about alcohol? Cigarettes? Gambling?  It is not your job to protect society from itself with government overreach. It is not the government's job to do so either. Part of living in a truly free society is accepting that some things could be 'bad' for an individual and they can choose to partake or not to partake.  That's even assuming I agree with your stance that marijuana is harmful to society...and I don't agree with your stance. Statistically it is impossible to overdose on, much less harmful than smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol, and is a convenient excuse for police officers to conduct stops and searches.  If YOU don't want to consume marijuana, that is a choice for YOU. Not for you to make for the rest of society.	existing	removed	[0.2141764 0.7858236]

> I have seen no evidence of that.   You have seen no evidence of that because the election boards have conveniently locked away the articles of evidence - ballots, envelopes, and voter registration which are what is able to prove whether the envelope was signed by the individual that was registered to vote based on signature verification.  All we know right now is what each of the local election board tells us. That X number of people voted and whether that person did or didn't vote. But we have no proof that Steve Smith's ballot that was counted was actually filled out and sent in by Steve Smith because the election board will not allow anyone to independently verify that:  1) Steve Smith actually exists. (That he is an actual living being and not just a name planted in the database for a free vote.)     2) Steve Smith was legally registered to vote and that he resided at the residence where he is registered to vote. (That he hadn't moved to a different state or precinct without updating his registration.)     3) That the signature on Steve's envelope matches the signature on his voter registration. (That someone else didn't fill out his ballot and submit it for him with or without his knowledge.)     4) And that the ballot was received legally, post marked, intact, and on time based on the laws the State Legislature passed. (That someone didn't find his name in the registration showing he hadn't voted and then decided to fill out a ballot in his name for more votes for their own candidate.)      You can't lock away the evidence, letting no one examine the documents, and then be surprised that anyone would question the "fair and legitimate election" claim. Those that do question it have a legitimate complaint that no one is actually countering aside from just saying, "prove it!"	existing	existing	[0.8019467  0.19805332]

It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term.

Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense.

I don’t take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being “retarded” ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I’m proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity.

Hospitals being overfull result in more deaths and problems as well.

According to his old profile Dave Zegarac is a far left, violent, extremist associated with antifa types.   https://web.archive.org/web/20210905065814/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave\_Zegarac   "His song lyrics deal primarily with anarchist politics.\[3\] Zegarac is an outspoken vegan and long time Anti-racist activist." -- antifa terrorist they should edit this to be.   Seems like he is just like the racist terrorist that killed kids at the christmas parade last year in Waukesha and the racist terrorist in Charlottesville a few years ago.   The far left needs to start calling out these people or they are all extremists and racists by association -- following the standards of discourse set by Trudeau, Singh and the CBC.   Typical example of the left being far out of control and turning to violence and terror over and over again.

While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	removed	removed	[0.48375237 0.51624763]

I’ll just address two of these and see what shit gets thrown at me.   Gender isn’t a “science” issue. There’s no science that disproves the existence of non-binary people (to name one example).  Now for the systemic issues, firstly it’s a matter of perspective. I am a cis, het, white, man, and I’m willing to bet you fall under most if not all of those categories as well. For us, we can put our fingers in our ears and drown out this stuff because it doesn’t affect us. But when you live in fear of getting stopped by the police because you’re afraid of getting killed by the cops, when you watch a large crowd of white supremacists with tiki torches shouting Nazi slogans and wearing Nazi iconography, when you hear politicians calling you animals, rapists, and other horrible things, these issues stop becoming “minute”. Even people like us suffer from things like police violence. There were many peaceful demonstrations that took place over the last two years where everyone, regardless of skin-colour, were attacked by riot police with tear gas and water cannons. I wish it were as simple as “a few bad apples” because that way we could be done with them and I could go on with my life without the pain of knowledge.

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.

Because people over 50 are considered in the "at risk" group for covid. The risk reward with the vaccine is closer to balancing out. These vaccine arguments are not about being anti vax, they're anti vaccine mandate. People under 50 represent roughly 7% of the 800,000 deaths. Forcing young people to get a vaccine for a virus that represents almost zero risk to them under the guise of "safe and effective" is ridiculous and it's a lie.  Just to drill down on the numbers a bit more, the 0-17 demographic has like 680 deaths involving covid since the beginning of the pandemic. I read there have been an estimated 7.5 million cases in this demographic .009% death rate. How does this justify jabbing 5 year olds?	existing	existing	[0.82017326 0.1798268 ]

Person bringing the allegations has the burden of proof. Right now your mouth just moving up and down up and down.

I agree that we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Rather, that we just come to the understanding that the moral teachings and principles of religion came from man (Unless you believe that texts like the Bible and the Quran are literally written by whichever deity you worship). And that if they came from the minds of men, that would mean that man has the ability to think morally and rationally without invoking the divine. That moral principles are right and good from a rational point of view. Not having a list of morals handed down from on high, but a set of rational principles arrived at through philosophy and reason. Principles arrived at using this method would be able to  stand side by side with modern scientific thinking, and would remove the ability of people to simply brush them aside on the basis that their foundations lay in ancient superstition. In short. We need to modernize the way we talk about morality.	existing	existing	[0.62605524 0.37394473]

Everyone's got a different answer about that.  I think it's because  opponent  was deeply embarrassed by an unfortunate photo that spread  as viral as  something could back then.   Americans usually vote based on feelings, not on policy in my opinion.   Trump didn't offer anything policy-wise... His charisma carried him into office.   Reagan had charisma two and Mondale just didn't.   I'm not really a fan of Reagan but some of his speeches were just great.  I like the shining City on the hill speech among a few others.   Reagan is the closest thing we have to Obama when it comes to gravitas... Add to that he pulled off in an impressive electoral map  and Republicans can't help but point back to him as some high point.  I'm not a big fan of what he did to the national debt.	existing	existing	[0.6576347  0.34236535]

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years.

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	removed	removed	[0.14190888 0.8580911 ]

The information on the CDCs VAERS is unverified, self reported information, not facts. The CDC has a disclaimer that states “VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind.” And that “Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.” I could go and file a report right now if I wanted to.	existing	existing	[0.85439366 0.14560632]

> They have a choice between the party that pretends to care (yes, all lies) about their interests or the party of open racists like Jessie Helms, David Duke, the republican parrty of Arizona that voted NOT to recognize MLK, Jr. DAY, etc...

In the year 2022, yes there is. It's the Republican Party, more specifically the libertarian/constitutionalist faction. They are ones advocating for school choice, police & criminal justice reform, more economic liberty, and a cultural shift back towards intact nuclear families. All things that Black Americans would draw crucial advantages from, even more so than other Americans.  > even voted against MLK, Jr. Day being recognized  So you base your voting decisions on the distant past. Okay. Where exactly do you draw the line? 2010? 1980? Surely somewhere after 1965, right? After all, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party, **and** the pro-Jim Crow party? So how come you don't eschew them for past misdeeds?  I'd argue that the Republican Party has an imperfect, yet infinitely better track record at how the treat Black Americans than the Democrats.

You have no right to automatically assume I'm sick based on whether I've taken an experimental medication that seems to have almost no effect on the rate of spread to other people.     I'm vaccinated. In fact I've got covid right now. I have friends and family, both double vaxxed, boosted, and unpacked. They are experiencing almost identical symptoms as I have no matter their status.     Businesses are welcome to make their own decisions. If those decisions coincide with the exact moments where the federal government **threatens their ability to exist without requiring vaccination** then they aren't making their own dedecisions. It's an illusion of choice.     I have more respect for the businesses that decided to require passports or masks in spite of relaxed or less restrictive rules made by centralized authorities because they *actually* made a choice. Everyone else who just so happens to require things at the same exact time as they're required to aren't making a decision beyond not allowing their livelihood to be stripped away.

> I love your manipulation of stats  My manipulation of stats? You're the one spouting this sensationalist 1 in 50 chance of death claim based off of totally incomplete data that would have to assume all, or even most, COVID infections are identified and reported. Quite the opposite is the truth. The large majority of infections are never identified or reported because most people have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. Therefore, the actual fatality rate is SIGNIFICANTLY lower than this 1 in 50 fear mongering nonsense. I don't know how the difference between IFR and CFR and why CFR is much less reliable method for determining real risk still needs to be explained after nearly 2 years of this being the number one news story in the world.  > Hence why you should use closed cases.  Which is still heavily overinflated garbage because it doesn't, at all, take into account the majority of infections which are never identified so they never even become a case to close.  > Do you have a source of the IFR?  My source for the IFR is the CDC.  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html  Table 1 includes a current best estimate of IFR.  These are actually pre-Omicron and Delta numbers. While Omicron and Delta were more contagious than the original COVID strain, they were both less severe AND we have more knowledge on treatments and methods for dealing with COVID since that time, so I'd be willing bet a large chunk of change that the IFR estimates would be much lower now than they were then.	existing	removed	[0.4682925 0.5317075]

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead.   :heart:️Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate :heart:️.

'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	removed	removed	[0.18381423 0.8161858 ]
