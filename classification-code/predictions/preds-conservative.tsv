That's not the end game. There's a bunch of states that will gladly secede as part of a hardline negotiating strategy to gain concessions from the fed. Like Hawaii has been vocal about native rights forever, because they basically had the island stolen from them. I mean it's not like their going anywhere.  This is going to evolve like a union walkout because the employer/fed won't  meet wage demands. This could work well as each seceding states fails/goes bankrupt we can woo them back in with slavery reparations, indigenous reparation/repatriation, original treaties boundaries, economic development.   Conditional on full acceptance of all the federal laws the dem Congress passed while they had the government obstruction free, and abolition of capital punishment. This will be a legislative bread and circus as the parties stage another national narrative of knock down drag out political drama.

I literally said he lost so im now questioning your literacy but there is some proof outlined by Crowder in one of his shows. However, what he outlined was nowhere near enough to change the results.  Yes. I'm against murder so that's a restriction and something I won't do. You ignore most of what I said to nitpick single lines without their original context. I said I was against murder and it somehow turned into you saying I'm restricting others from murder? That seems reasonable.  The left wants to control everything you do or say. They censor, cancel and destroy anyone that speaks out against them. They burn and murder their way to their goal.  Personal freedom is the antithesis of leftism now. You have to tow the line, believe what they do or you're an outcast and deserve the gulag as some TV hosts have suggested.   I believe in freedom to choose not freedom from consequence. You want to shoot up heroin? Go ahead. But you deal with the consequences of that, not everyone else.   I believe the 1/6 rioters who committed violence belong in prison. I also believe the Antifa rioters and murderers who killed 30+ innocent people over a year of terror also belong in prison. Consistency. Try it sometime.	existing	removed	[0.1985094 0.8014906]

Yes the BBB was very impressive. And that was the point to attract voters. On that front alone, it worked. Biden planned to make this fail with Manchin and Sinema as the foil. All three of them along with Schumer and Pelosi have the same donors and serve the same masters.   I didn’t see much fighting for it in November and December. It looked like a half assed care show to make it seem like he was doing something. The progressives have been saying this for months.  And at any point Biden could write an executive order to pass even a small sliver of his alleged BBB agenda. To say otherwise is just a bold faced lie. That’s one of the powers the president holds.   Obama wrote executive orders and Biden stood right behind him. Was that a dictator move? I didn’t think so.	existing	existing	[0.9818786  0.01812136]

It's interesting how they want to charge Trump for the crime of giving a speech before a riot where he told people to peacefully march and also to vote out anyone who doesn't support blocking the electoral count, which is really a weird thing for someone to tell people when they're planning to overthrow democracy and declare a dictatorship, but they don't care about punishing Trump for murdering women and children with drone strikes. I mean, he killed a whole wedding party. I wonder if the reason the media has kept the eyes of the herd off that ball has to do with the fact that if they were to go after Trump for being a war criminal that would mean they'd have to go after Saint Obama for murdering more women and children than Trump ever did, or Joe Biden for bombing kids?	removed	removed	[0.46709198 0.5329081 ]

The political compass is a very bad metric for judging politics. Hitler was obviously very far right, but “left vs right” is a poorly defined scale. Government size? Nope. Far left has anarchism and communism with government, while center-left has high government interference. The government was large in Nazi germany, but corporations could still (for the most part) operate “freely”  Or guns? Most leftists don’t want people to have guns, but what about the revolutions? What about the individual rights? Same with the right.   There’s a great video “debunking” political charts and graphs that can summarize this much better than I can.   https://youtu.be/9nPVkpWMH9k  tl;dr applying an abstract model to a material world won’t work as the abstractions do not follow the rules of a material landscape  Went on a bit of a rant here, focusing more on the political placements, but nevertheless I hope this is somewhat informative.  Edit: And yeah, Stalin wasn’t a communist. They had a government and classes. That is directly opposed to communism.	existing	existing	[0.97483885 0.0251612 ]

Hello! Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately it has been removed because you don't meet our karma threshold.   You are not being removed for political orientation.  If we were, why the fuck would we tell you your comment was being removed instead of just shadow removing it?  We never have, and never will, remove things down politicial or ideological lines. Unless your ideology is nihilism, then fuck you.     Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: "if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.""    If you wish to rectify your low karma issue, go and make things up in /r/AskReddit like everyone else does.    Thanks for understanding!

Archive at https://archive.is/AkxTK  > Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday shredded the “never before changed the filibuster” argument. Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.) gave one of the most stirring speeches, making clear that while John Lewis gave blood on the Edmund Pettus bridge, this Senate couldn’t bring itself to “bridge” a procedural rule. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who bent over backward to accommodate Manchin’s concerns on voting reforms, blasted the gamesmanship: “I think by voting this down, by not allowing us even to debate this, to get to the conclusion of a vote, that is silencing the people of America, all in the name of an archaic Senate rule that isn’t even in the Constitution. That’s just wrong.”  > When Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) insisted it was unfair to equate voting restrictions to Jim Crow, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) let him have it. “Don’t lecture me about Jim Crow,” Booker declared angrily. “I know this is not 1965. And that’s what makes me so outraged. It is 2022, and they are blatantly removing more polling places from the counties where Blacks and Latinos are overrepresented.”  > Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who lost two legs and partial use of an arm in battle, excoriated the GOP’s cowardice. “I’m not asking Republicans to do anything near as difficult as what John Lewis went through for our democracy. All I’m asking for is the bare minimum,” she said. “All I’m begging them to do is to not sit in silence in the face of grave injustice.”	existing	removed	[0.2028624  0.79713756]

Maybe I overreacted. I get a bit pissed. I believe I have a right to be pissed. I have underlying conditions. Her family has been trying to kill me for the past three years thanks to their intentional bungling of covid. My life has once again been reduced to hiding from life. Something I promised myself I would never do again after dealing with severe mental issues forty years ago and actually coming off the edge of a ten-story building to reengage with society and lead what had been a very, very happy, successful, normal life since then. Just as I finally retire and can enjoy the life I fought for, with the help of trained professionals who must always be given credit for what they do, this family intentionally moves to put me back into isolation. I hate them with every cell in my body. Maybe I under-reacted. I really don't know but this is all the time I will dwell on the issue in this thread as I learned long ago that five minutes of negative thought needs to be followed by ten minutes of positive thought and meditation.

In their eyes, those things are good policies that'll help save their countries. They've voted for some pretty non charismatic people before who supported the same policies, and still do tbh.  The propoganda was much heavier on Bernie than anyone else I've ever seen. Warren still had big money donations and super PACs. She also revealed that her m4a plan wasn't really Medicare for all. She did that to herself. They didn't ignore her half as much as they did Bernie tbh.  As for Manchin and Sinema, they aren't even democrats at this point tbh. Name one democratic policy they are for.. it's non existent. Manchin is a coal Barron, and he gets to make legislation for our green energy. In my eyes it's a 48-52  Also I'm not saying it's easy for a woman to run. But no woman will ever win if they keep repeating elect the first woman president, and all that BS. Make clear that you will improve people's material life more effectively than Bernie, and you will become more popular than Bernie.

And godforbid you say their chicken isn't that great.   Seriously, people, I've tried it like five different times. The chicken itself is just that. Chicken. I don't understand why people line up around the block for it.  Seriously, it's their sauce that tastes good. And I can make you some excellent sauces and rubs that would make Hate-Chicken's look like absolute dogcrap. "Good" sauces are generally a combination of oil, fat, butter, and salt/sugar and/or other spices.   They're NOT hard to make. Basic BBQ sauce is literally ketchup, brown sugar, and either white or apple cider vinegar. Anything else you add will push the flavor in one direction or another.  And I say this with love and the advice you would be given by a dear friend -- the way things are going? ...learn to cook. Seriously.

I’m betting the Ukraine/Hunter Biden fake controversy would have been used by Trump as a pretext to stay out of Ukraine. Had NATO done anything he would have left NATO.

It’s not a theory, it’s actual conspiracy. The Clinton campaign engaged in actual espionage or at least paid for it to happen. Just because information was corroborated by those who sought for it to be, for 4 years…doesn’t make it true, namely the supplanted “evidence” Trump was a Russian operative. It’s not republicans investigating anything that the mainstream democratic media machine allows to be told. That’s not the case at all, binary affiliates are a minority in reality. Rather, there are decent and rational individuals at the justice department who are carefully proceeding and thoroughly aligning a proper case that in function and practice meets the standards leading to conclusivity, thus irrefutability.   A good analogy would be to find you have cancer after dropping everything to become a personal trainer. Just a because you thought a career as a physically fit and healthy model for others was destined, doesn’t relieve the possibility that one gets a cancer. Denial is fickle. The best we can manage as dedicated, decent, human beings is to  be honest. Always. No exceptions, or at least try to be open to all possibilities, but to stand up for what is known to be right given all other possibilities. Truth above all.	removed	existing	[0.92776376 0.07223623]

I guess the problem with this quotation, from the journalist's point of view, is that   the phrase "African American voters" does tacitly acknowledge that they are Americans, so it had to be changed in the headline in order to maximize outrage.

>And hey, this is even better. [Truckers attack ambulances and healthcare workers, while slowing them down.](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/ambulances-pelted-with-rocks-during-protest-health-workers-patients-face-added-stress-delays)  Reading the article, it looks like this is an isolated incident involving a single paramedic. This kind of behavior isn't acceptable, but this isolated event is far from representing the entire group of protestors.   >[US citizens flooding 911](https://globalnews.ca/news/8609284/ottawa-trucker-convoy-airport-disruptions/)  I heartily agree that this is inappropriate. In the article, it says that a *significant amount of calls that “almost jammed” the city’s 911 phone system*, so it seems like legitimate calls were still able to get through, but still... not cool.   >[Urinating on war memorial](https://metro.co.uk/2022/01/31/war-memorial-urinated-on-by-anti-vaxxers-as-canadian-police-launch-investigation-16018874/)  Also disrespectful and inappropriate. I'm having a hard time finding any details about this because all of the articles are coming from blogs and small outlets, but it's hard to imagine that such an underreported incident involves a significant portion of the 5,000 protestors.   >[Soup kitchen](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/convoy-truckers-canada-soup-kitchen-b2003765.html) Forgot they assaulted a security guard, too.  Another example where the behavior is inappropriate.  The article is locked behind registration, but the part that's available is vague about the details. I feel safe in assuming that this is another isolated event because it sounds like it's only happened once.   Overall, reviewing your sources, it's hard to argue that a protest consisting of 5,000 people that has lasted for two weeks is actually as disruptive and destructive as implied. Really the most disruptive thing that's been going on is just the traffic from so many vehicles that wouldn't normally be there	removed	existing	[0.5748677  0.42513227]
For sure!  > Were there any particular details or reasons that convinced you?  Yes, the fact that Lindsay Menz posted about the harassment in 2010 ([right after happened](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/politics/al-franken-inappropriate-touch-2010/index.html)) on social media.  It was clearly not done for fame or money, since she attempted to garner none, but it's a contemporaneous statement of what happened years before this became a scandal in Franken's life.  This was basically the prybar that opened the floodgates of credibility to other accusations.  Some, like Leeann Tweeden, I still don't find credible.  But you don't have to have more than one victim to be a victimizer.  > what level of certainty do you need to be comfortable removing someone from office?  This depends on what I'm going to get in return.  When we removed Franken from office, we lost a Senator from Minnesota.  In return, we got a Senator from Minnesota with no history of sexual assault.  I can think of no laws or other acts of the Senate that have been sabotaged by this change, so the cost is minimal.  So for a case like Franken's, where that's all we lose, lower certainties are acceptable, in general I'd want above 50% certainty when evicting someone from office accused of sexual assault.  > Are innocent people ever arrested or accused of crimes, either by mistake or because it’s useful (I’ve met people who say if they weren’t guilty they wouldn’t be on trial)  Absolutely.  Forget looking at arrested/accused, just looking at the much higher bar of people who were convicted of crimes and later found guilty, something like 1 person is later found innocent for every 10 executed while they're on death row.  That's a staggering statistic.  However, the key difference here is that evicting someone from office is not a death penalty.  They will personally remain rich beyond the means of 99% of Americans.  > Does the Army veterans described experience match the photo of said experience?  As noted in the [reporting](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/30/politics/al-franken-groping-allegation/index.html) on this particular incident with Stephanie Kemplin:  > Kemplin estimated that the touching lasted anywhere from five to 10 seconds. She said she eventually turned her body to shift Franken’s hand off her breast before the picture was taken.   Your question assumes the description of the impropriety was captured in the photo taken.  She explicitly states it was not.  Is it possible Kemplin has an axe to grind with Franken?  Absolutely, she could be some crazy MAGA head jumping on the "fuck Franken" train.  However, I've not heard any reports of her holding that kind of political position, and in the light of other accusations I see no reason not to believe her.  Playing devil's advocate is useful.  Just don't become the devil in an attempt to justify your desired position.	existing	removed	[0.13523589 0.8647641 ]

If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator.

Trump and Putin secret Kremlin meeting, 2017: Trump and Putin sit across from each other, discussing Ukraine and Syria before the G20 summit. "What you're doing in those countries is great! Somebody needed to do something about them!" Trump exclaimed, as Putin silently nodded. "It's just great!" Trump continued as Putin began adjusting his pants, becoming visibly impatient and overcome with sexual frustration. "And somebody needs to do something about Venezuela!" Trump continued. "Stop!" Putin commanded. "Yeah! I'm the best stopper! I build YUGE walls! I stop whatever I want!" Trump proudly exclaimed. Putin leaned forward and grabbed Trump's red tie, yanked him out of his chair, and smacked him in the face, smearing his spray tan. "You're as much of a winner as I allow you to be. And you don't stop me. I'm your daddy now. Do you understand?" Putin said, as he continued clenching Trump's red tie, pulling him forward, and looking sternly into his eyes. Putin then put his hand around Trump's face and squeezed his cheeks, prompting Trump to open his mouth. "Tongue!" Putin commanded. Trump then stuck his tongue out and Putin leaned above him and spit in his mouth. Trump let it slide down the back of his tongue and into his throat. Putin then unzipped his pants with his one free hand, pulled out his dick, already hard and dripping precum, and pushed it into Trump's mouth. He then grabbed the back of Trump's head with both hands and began to skullfuck him. *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp* "Aaah!" Trump exhaled heavily, as Putin briefly released him for air before continuing to pound Trump's throat, hands pressed firmly into his toupee as he pushed his head all the way to the base of his dick and held it there for a few seconds before continuing to pound away for several minutes. "Mmm! Tastes like winning!" Trump excitedly exclaimed as Putin pulled his dick out before yanking Trump's red tie and pulling him to the desk. Putin then bent Trump over and pushed his face into the desk. He then unbuckled Trump's belt and pulled his pants down to his ankles before wiping spit on his dick. "Open it!" Putin commanded. Trump then spread his butt cheeks open and Putin began to slowly push his throbbing dick deep into the old clown's hairy dung tunnel. Putin gradually sped up, fucking Trump harder and faster. Trump's flabby, saggy, hairy, old ass could be heard smacking against Putin as he aggressively drilled Trump's rotten old shitter into oblivion. He yanked on Trump's red tie, pulling his head back and began choking him. Harder and harder, Putin continued fucking Trump for several more minutes before pulling his dick out, jacking it for a few seconds, and ejaculating all over Trump's face and in his toupee. Cum was dripping down Trump's face. Putin looked down and noticed Trump's shit on his dick and his fingers. "You shit on my dick! You sloppy fuck!" Putin angrily screamed. With cum still dripping down his chin and neck, Trump slyly smiled and winked at Putin, knowing that he was the true winner all along.	removed	removed	[0.01253134 0.9874687 ]

Or Pelosi telling us to fuck off, about Congress swindling stock positions via insider information they garner behind closed doors, so she and most the others can profit from their position?  Or…  The DNC doing jack shit, or oft times getting directly in the way of the will of their own supporters (by that abhorrent Debbie Wasserman Schultz purposely holding back Bernie in 2015-6 and 2019-20) and to be honest, Biden won despite the DNC. It would not have been close had they actually worked to bring progressives together with traditional centrist lefties.   So, why should “I work harder” when they don’t help me (I make too much but I’m still a staunch Dem).  How do they let the Merrick Garland nomination get stalled by GOP? How do they let Kavanaugh’s succeed? Or Gorsuch or Barret? We’re now stuck for a generation with a brazenly GOP partisan bench.

A lot of black Americans are disenfranchised by liberal policies & lack of commitment to their agenda. How would you feel if you grew up in a State like say Washington, a liberal haven, and were in severe poverty. Than you move to a republican state, and work the same job, and all of a sudden you can afford your own place, your own car, go out with friends and enjoy your culture because you can finance it.   When democrats preach change and free education, medical care for all, yet continue to lie everyday you eventually get sick of it. And especially when you see people in republican states being able to actually afford the American dream it is easy to see why people move to supporting the GOP.   A lot of liberals like to ignore the fact shelter is one of the most important aspects of mental health. Fear of losing your housing will cause you to make rash decisions and change your way of looking at the world. I can not think of a single liberal city in this country where the working man can continue to live in luxury. Not only that, but you start to look at the liberal greed in this country. Using washington as a example, it is the most regressive tax system in the entire country.   Liberals like to act like they are bastions of truth and equality while simultaneously supporting the growth of wealthy americans, and passing laws that maintain the status quo.  And id like to end this, before someone attacks me personally, i am not a republican and do not support any republican politicians. I was just doing what this person asked, trying to rationalize why a minority would support the GOP.	existing	removed	[0.24081187 0.7591881 ]

It's understandable when you think about it probabilistically. When you're popping a bag of popcorn, you get a few kernels that start going off WAY before the bulk does. Uranium-238 only has a 50/50 chance of splitting in 4.5 billion years. You can imagine the incredibly low chance of it splitting if you're just sitting there watching for 5 minutes. And yet a block of Uranium has such a ridiculously large number of atoms that the block's warm to the touch because so many are constantly splitting.  So... imagine a random black person in America. Who were they born to, and where? Where are they growing up? What friends do they have, and what books do they read? What religion do they practice, and what other life experiences have they had? Is there really no possible life you can imagine where a person might end up (either due to propaganda or Christianity or whatever else) voting Republican even when they're black?  America has about 40 million black Americans. Assuming 30 million are of voting age, If you want more than a 50/50 chance of not finding even a single voting Republican, how low would the chance of someone ending up like that would you need?  We'd need a probability such that (1 - p)^30,000,000 > .5. In other words, the chance of flipping an unfair coin 30 million times and having it always come up heads.  I got that the chance would need to be under .000000231%. That's really Goddamn low, I can imagine given the ways a person could get there, it'd be a fair bit higher. Any higher, and you'd expect to see some people voting GOP.

That does not explain the same or higher suicide rates in countries with few available firearms.  But even if it's true, is stopping those deaths a public policy worth pursuing through more stringent gun control?  Suicide is not a criminal act, but it is treated as one by responding police and institutions who enforce de facto jail (or actual jail in this state) as punishment for attempts.  The costs and benefits to more stringent controls are wildly different when we're talking about homicide vs. suicide.  Put bluntly--if I opt to kill myself over a dementia diagnosis, it's not your f'ing business how I do it.  Suicide is intensely personal and there's a good argument that we already have too much governmental intervention into a non-criminal act.	existing	existing	[0.9729912  0.02700875]

Lincoln was a white supremacist and a dictator himself. I don’t give a shit about him. And a handful of people wave a flag on the side that doesn’t believe in restricting their rights even if they don’t agree with them.   And you keep assuming I’m on the right. I’m not. I’m just not stupid enough to ignore the bullshit coming out of both parties. And here comes the “Biden’s changed” defense despite him making racist comments on an almost weekly basis in public. His own Vice President attacked him in the debates for the policies he has supported and authored, like the Crime bill in 1994, and his career full of racist policy.   Or his remarks like “Black people don’t have access to computers.” Or “poor kids are just as smart as white kids” or “Latinx people are afraid if they get vaccinated they’ll get deported” or “you can’t go to a 711 or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent”  [here’s a video of some of them](https://twitter.com/debrapasquella/status/1454813231554367488?s=21)  He literally opposed the desegregation of schools and there’s been no evidence apart from his own assurances that he’s changed. Every single Democrat running against him called out his bigotry.	existing	existing	[0.51385826 0.48614168]

NY has 50% higher per-capita GDP than TX. Of course Texas has a higher absolute GDP... it has 30% higher population, but also only has 4% higher absolute GDP.

This is a big piece (not the only piece, but a big one). Politicians go where the votes are, especially the consistent ones. If progressives want to matter they need to be just as reliable voters as 70 year old conservatives.

Dude, even if we humored your transphobic nonsense, the concept of changing your name isn't even necessarily a trans issue.  Cis people change or go by different names all the time.  If you grew up with some girl whose parents named her Bertha and you overheard her later introduce herself as Beth, you wouldn't start "correcting the record" and telling everybody that she lied and her name is actually Bertha, right?  No, at most you would probably say she used to be named Bertha.  Even if the same hypothetical girl changed her name from something common to something you thought was ridiculous (but still feminine/neutral), you wouldnt say that isn't her name.  So then why the hell are you so obsessed with what this person's name is to the point that you not just disagreeing with the choice but outright saying it's not their name?

There are states with weaker traffic laws. For instance, in one southern state you can drink a beer while you are driving as long as you do not go over .08 BAC.

There was only one thing I admired about KAMALA during her campaign for the nomination: her ability to include the phrase "AS A BLACK WOMAN" in her answers to any question about anything. That made it clear that she had learned to say what she thought people wanted to hear, not that she held any deep conviction.

How about students go to school respectively, learn what is required to achieve a profitable occupation as an adult, start being taught to love their country’s flag again, moreso than the rainbow flag, the fucking teachers stop instructing our children with lessons promoting communist policies, influencing our children to be oversexed and gender confused, and most of all stop trying to make everyone whos straight, turn gay. Being gay is not something to be taught, it is not a trend and I don’t think kids need to be calling the shots, respect your elders and if you do choose, pass out flags after school. Fucking disrespectful children don’t know any better but act like they know it all and have no respect for authority, they will destroy our lives once they’re of age at this rate. And protesting isn’t acceptable for a child to attempt. Teaches them protesting everything is okay and it is not. Let’s be honest, protesting is a literal adult temper tantrum displayed in the public’s eye. If we don’t instill our kids to be disciplined then they will become defiant, unruly adults... This leads to many spiteful, unmotivated, undisciplined, angry, miserable grown up failures to ruin this country some more for the future. Something to look forward to. This country was built on Christian values, this is Gods country not some circus. School is meant to produce distinguished goal oriented adults, not an oversexed perverted bunch of lumps who’s only future lies in the vile porn industry. You want to be gay fine, but it still is a sin under God and shouldn’t be pushed upon young people’s minds. It’s like sex Ed 8am-3pm. I don’t trust our public schools anymore. They have influenced our kids with the teachings of Russian dictators policies that have no place being taught in America, period. We have allowed this country to be infiltrated by the enemy and they’ve been successful in seducing the minds of our young. Respect should be taught. A child coming to school with pride flags after laws are passed not to discuss gay matters during school is a child that needs to be disciplined and taught not to break laws. Damn good they got suspension they should also be fined for breaking the law. It isn’t funny. So disrespectful, this generation. What a bunch of confused fuck ups they will be. Shame on teachers for screwing parents under the radar... They all need to be fired and allow teachers of moral compass to replace them that have traditional values rather than un-American ones to instill our young with. America has turned into the cast of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and it’s embarrassing. Hope all whom are democrats are happy that they’ve transformed American people from leaders of the free world into a socialistic circus characters tutu sporting anti-Americans who hate their own damn country. End times are upon us people, hope all the ingrates are ready for what is to come because it’s all your fault.	removed	removed	[0.04580599 0.95419407]

If we were, why the fuck would we tell you your comment was being removed instead of just shadow removing it?  We never have, and never will, remove things down politicial or ideological lines. Unless your ideology is nihilism, then fuck you.     Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: "if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.""    If you wish to rectify your low karma issue, go and make things up in /r/AskReddit like everyone else does.    Thanks for understanding!

I never made the link between DNC wrongdoing and democratic primary voters not voting for Bernie. Candidates who preferred Biden over Bernie rallied behind him to unite the vote for the candidate they wanted to see win. That's a reality of politics in our flawed system but not actual wrongdoing on their part.  The wrongdoing I was alluding to had to do with the fact that the Democratic party is not immune to influence from corporations and the wealthy as they readily accept campaign contributions from both.   It's amusing to be called uncritical by someone who is in such a rush to spout off about Bernie conspiracy theories that I never mentioned or supported. It's almost like you've been programmed by the media you consume to attack anyone who is critical of the DNC for any reason.	existing	existing	[0.98340696 0.01659301]

Because Republicans have demonstrated they simply don't care about human life throughout the pandemic.  And at this point nearly everyone dying is a Republican who believed livestock medicine, aquarium cleaner and/or the "power of Jesus" would protect them. Or they believed the virus was a hoax. Or they believed the vaccine will turn them into a non-human and thus make them ineligible for the afterlife. After two years of fighting disinformation, Democrats and independents are exhausted. We are fresh out of sympathy for the people who, despite our best efforts, really seem to want to die to a deadly virus as part of some kind of crazed virtue signaling to a former president.  So the reason there's no social reckoning is simple: Republicans want to die and Democrats are so tired of keeping the Republicans alive that we're inclined to just let them.	removed	existing	[0.9448285  0.05517144]

The war wasn’t fought well and was lost decades ago when the religious right, Koch brothers and others laid out a plan leveraging millions of racist rubes in downtrodden states. It was solidified when W was anointed by the SC without basis.  18% of the population determines the Senate. And that’s just simple majority; a 60%+ is not that many more. Biden won with a massive 7M vote mandate - the Oval Office was decided by only 43,000. All this was with demure suppression efforts - it cost HRC and countless others, but paled to what is coming.   We need to fight, but the reality is that too many idiots debate the shade of blue, whine that some massive and radical change didn’t happen yesterday or that ‘Fox News’ said something.

No you wouldn’t. You specifically create the criteria that qualifies for the experimental group and the criteria of the control. For example, why would you compare recreational drug users to also recreational drug users if you are measuring the impact of drug use?   You can randomize a population sample if you are doing exploratory analyses, but not if you are comparing an experimental group to a control group.  In the Mitch example, you’d compare black populations to other population (could be white, or anything else). By nature of your design setup, you would bin black participants in the experimental group and then compare to a control group (matched by other demographics like income, education, etc) but specifically exclude black participants from the control (because an exclusionary criteria for your control group should be the inclusionary criteria for experimental).	existing	existing	[0.9253352 0.0746648]

Yeah, Ukraine's president fired back at him for that and I think that's deserved. It's a stupid ideology to think that as long Russia only takes a little of Ukraine's territory that it's somehow not as bad. It's like if a country only took Hawaii or something and that warrants a lesser response from the government. No, if a country invaded just Hawaii it would be war the same as if they invaded the US mainland and it shows how selfish the US can be when it comes to their allies over themselves.  Take that as you will being a Canadian's opinion on US politics, but any act of aggression from Russia should be treated equally and would be if the US was the one facing Russian aggression instead of Ukraine.	existing	removed	[0.07386829 0.92613167]

So I looked deeper into the definition of propaganda from your source (Wikipedia).   > In the 20th century, the English term propaganda was often associated with a manipulative approach, **but historically, propaganda has been a neutral descriptive term of any material that promotes certain opinions or ideologies.**  This states any opinion is propaganda. Therefore I could argue that what you’re saying is propaganda because you are trying to change my opinion. Which is a ridiculous concept to me. Listen, the definition is the definition, but IMO the connotation of its use today is to intentionally manipulate people.

Before the American Rescue Plan economists were predicting it would take until 2023 to start getting back to normal.  The American rescue plan jumpstarted and supercharged the recovery.  Also, the reason that the pandemic is at a point that businesses can reopen is due to the herculean action by the administration that got 63% of people fully vaccinated and 75% of people partially vaccinated, combined with all the treatments distributed that can reduce the lethality of covid and all the other steps he's taken.  Also, during the Obama administration people blamed Obama for not taking more action to get the economy recovered faster.  Biden worked hard and took action in order to insure a quick, more equitable recovery.  Without his action we would be in a far worse place.	existing	existing	[0.96275616 0.03724389]

Ah, conservative values!  I remember a discussion about that subject a year ago.  Not one single conservative ever even attempted to define what their cult's supposed values were, they just spewed incredibly stupid lies and fled in terror from the very idea of evidence.    I can see what conservatives value based on what conservatives say and do, what they support in the real world.  Conservatives value bigotry. Conservatives value racism, sexism, homophobia, and mocking the disabled.  Conservatives value conformity. They think the mere fact of being different makes someone less than human.  Conservatives value hypocrisy. They prescribe rules for others but ignore those rules themselves. They scream "***FUCK YOUR FEELINGS***" until someone dares tell them to fuck their OWN feelings.  Conservatives value hierarchy, when they can put themselves at the top.  Conservatives PRETEND to value monogamy, until they get the chance to cheat on their wives.  Conservatives value greed, ignorance, and arrogance.  But more important than what conservatives value is what they DON'T value.  Conservatives do not value honesty, consistency, or clarity. Conservatives do not value compassion, kindness, or empathy. Conservatives do not value learning, evidence, or understanding. Conservatives do not value consent. Conservatives do not value freedom.  Conservatives care infinitely more about policing "vulgar" language than about actual harm to real living breathing human beings. Unless the vulgar language is coming from one of their own, then they have no objection to it.  Conservatives value their own money and power above all else, and basic human decency not at all.	existing	existing	[0.98160696 0.01839303]

The author of this piece wants Trump to be guilty of something, not because he cares about the criminal justice system, but simply for political vengeance. A lot of people were absolutely irate that Hillary Clinton lost and they were going to do everything in their power to arrest the person who defeated her. The investigations, started by Democrats in every case, began before he even took office. They used Congress to demand documents that could not be obtained through a court order and then turned around and gave the documents over to DAs to sift through to find any evidence of a crime of any nature. That’s the first time in history that has ever happened. It set a precedent. You don’t have to have any evidence or even an allegation of a crime to investigate someone criminally. The reason they can’t “get” Trump is because they’re on a crusade without fact or evidence and merely their hatred for opposition candidates is all they have for a crime. I live watching them flail about, hoping anything puts their opponents in prison, regardless of how cooked up the allegations are.

It seems quite plausible to me that the rotating villain theory is true. Time and again, it seems on every fight, that Dems are consistently losing. They lose so frequently, so embarrassingly, that this seems more like a scripted WWE fight that the Dem is determined ahead of time to lose. What’s more plausible: the Dems have not one single person smart enough to strategize and scheme to come up with plans as well as McConnell that makes them lose just about every political battle in the past 20 years…. or that they’re scripted to lose?  I hope I’m wrong but the consistent ineptness of the Dem Party is hard to explain any other way. Yes, I know the Dem party isn’t just one party and harder to stand unified against the one-minded GOP but that still doesn’t explain it. Battle after battle lost to McConnell’s evil fuckery for almost the entirety of the 21st century so far. Much of it not due to certain factions within the Dem party disagreeing on the issue.	removed	existing	[0.9625779  0.03742217]

> A far simpler explanation is that Bernie ran as an outsider and wasn't even a member of the Democratic party until it was necessary.  We all should recognize the DNC and RNC have a stranglehold over a critical part of our government.  A functional, consensus-based government would not choose the candidates our process chooses.  Can we mutually agree that it's a dysfunctional process that doesn't lead to good governance, good policy or the effective promotion of laws that are adopted by consensus?  > But organizations like the DNC are made up of people and those people will invariably favor the people they know and who have put in the time. First time around that bias was pretty clear, not great, but hardly surprising. Second time around there were a lot more Bernie people in the party putting in the time and the DNC was a lot better.  I think "putting in the time" has a lot implied and not stated and Bernie Sanders has been advocating for working people for many decades.  Can you describe what "putting in the time" actually means to you?  > Didn't change that the bulk of the party and candidates weren't on the left wing of the party. Nothing about any of this is sinister and is pretty obvious if you have spent any time around any organizations decision making, it's politics.  You focus on the fact that Bernie was an outsider.  What quality of insiders among Democrat leadership should be esteemed? What are regular party members holding onto that only leadership can be trusted with?  I don't think an ineffective process that leads to terrible outcomes has to be "sinister" to persist.  At the same time, we as regular, unprivileged primary voters should be able to recognize the efforts to keep this process as dysfunctional and corrupted by campaign financing as possible aren't in the best interests of voters no matter what party or leadership says.  It's just common sense, isn't it?  So instead of recognizing Bernie's outsider status (he had caucused with Democrats practically his entire time in Congress) and how he wasn't a part of the campaign-finance leadership, we could be recognizing that Democrat leadership's cupboard was so bare of established and well-known leaders after the Clintons that this outsider had favored polling status among the general electorate.  The reason he had a shot was because Democrats had maintained a reputation for failure and an inability to hold corrupt executives accountable for at least two decades.	removed	existing	[0.9816613  0.01833867]

It was the most votes ever, but a big part of that was the continuing increase in population.  If we look at voter percentage, there was a 66% turnout. For comparison, in 2016 there was a 60% turnout. In 2008, there was a 62% turnout.  So it wasn't significantly higher than other presidential elections. As the population grows, the number of voters will increase, but the percentage is staying about the same.  And of course, about half the population still didn't vote, despite the record turnout.	existing	existing	[0.9807091  0.01929094]

The Federal Court system all the way up to the Supreme Court has been where civil rights went to die and corporations and slave owners and other monied interests were protected.

Agree totally. I didn’t learn anything useful whatsoever in high school. In Econ, which was only one semester, our big semester project was to plan our fucking wedding day.

I tried my best to be a cheap ass and save money but we were required to order flowers, invitations, all that crap and price it all out. Anyway, none of that is important, but back to my original point- I think high school should be spent actually teaching useful knowledge about life.

The Dems and this sub do pull the "we represent the minorities" card too much. But, hell, it's only by the fact that the Republicans represent the .1% so much that race really isn't anything more than an afterthought.

You literally hold the belief that all Democrats think the same and that despite Democratic control of Congress and the Presidency we are a one party Republican state. Not to mention you believe that “RINOs” just don’t exist. Oh and you believe that when two of your 48 members don’t vote with the party line that somehow those two members have the only votes that matter despite the Senate having 100 members. Mate when using words like “idiot” you’ve gotta be careful. Throwing stones in glass houses and all that.  You also bring up “e-males” despite me not having mentioned them at all and crammed. Personally I’ve noticed a few grammatical errors in your posts, but I don’t really think that matters. This is a Reddit thread not a college essay.	existing	existing	[0.7523476  0.24765235]

I think this is why many no longer prefer that term. It opens the door for people to think they don't have the same claim to citizenship as those referred to as only Americans.

Cut the extreme rhetoric. This isn’t unbridled hatred.  All this does is anger the already angry and escalate the divisiveness.   Words like “Unbridled hatred” is itself a form of bigotry: She doesn’t agree with you, that doesn’t mean she hates you.   Steel man her argument and address it. She’s claiming that teaching sexuality at ages 6, 7, and 8 year olds is inappropriate and those who do have bad intentions.   The rebuttal is simple: orientation and identity manifest earlier than people are comfortable to admit.  Teaching it in the classroom should be age appropriate and standardized so that children are best prepared at the age in which the developments are first appearing. Rather than banning it, we should be working toward a standardized curriculum in cooperation with state authorities.  We look forward to working with parents, administrators, and legislators to explore the ramifications of not properly preparing children for the future.   Done.	removed	removed	[0.03974493 0.9602551 ]

I am saying that right wingers are not decent people by definition, it has nothing to do with whether they're armed or not. If they are armed, all the worse. But my point is that the only reason American society is able to function at all is because decent people--those who are not right wing lunatics--are not armed and causing trouble.  If normal people behaved the way right wing lunatic dumbfucks behaved, society would collapse very quickly. You can't just go around yelling at people and threatening people and acting like a crazy fuck and expect society to work. If decent folks just shot first and offered excuses, right wingers would create a civil war; fuck, we're almost there already and no one is even doing anything to provoke them.	existing	existing	[0.84049916 0.15950081]
