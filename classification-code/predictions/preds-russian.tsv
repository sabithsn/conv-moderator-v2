You've answered my question with a question. Let's try and clear up this communication.  Does Russia see NATO as an organisation who made its life mission to destroy Russia?  Does Russia see NATO as talking behind Russia's back with Russia's close friends, trying to get those friends to abandon Russia and side with NATO? If so, who are the close friends?	removed	existing	[0.68567914 0.3143209 ]

Hey dude, did you escape from the asylum?   What is communism?    The communist government uses this idea. There is public ownership and control over industry and resources (mines, factories and factories). The goal is that there should be no different social classes, that there should be neither rich nor poor.   All people will be equal.   To be effective, communism requires a delicate balance and the equal participation of all people. This may seem simple enough, but it can actually be very difficult. That is why it has failed in many countries that have tried to do so.   The main principle of communism: "To each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!"   Capitalism (fuck it) is a social system in which one class of the population (capitalists 10 percent of the population) owns enterprises, factories, firms, industrial enterprises and even the bowels of the earth) and profits from the fact that another class (wage workers are modern slaves 90 percent) of the population) serve these capitalists    The inevitable companion of capitalism is unemployment, since the main goal of the capitalist is to extract the greatest profit!   don't be an idiot!!!!!!!!	removed	existing	[0.68567985 0.31432015]

It's simple, really.  The US government can order the families of US diplomats out.  It's part of their condition of employment.  The US government can't order US citizens in general to leave their place of residence without a substantial legal reason.  Just look at how we deal with Hurricanes.  Generally, there are several days warnings of imminent danger.  The smart thing for everybody to do is to Get Out of The Way.  State and local authorities will strongly suggest that people evacuate the area but many people don't.  Instead, we wind up wasting a lot of resources fishing them out of the area that's been flooded and destroyed.  It would be so much simpler if the governments could just order everybody to evacuate, but they can't.	removed	existing	[0.6856816  0.31431836]

Thank you learnt that some 25 years ago in school.   Ok, so you missed the point or somehow failed to grasp it.   As mentioned above, and what I replied to:     >According to some modern Russian historians, not 27 million inhabitants of the USSR died during the Second World War, but almost 40 million. This was calculated on the basis of the fact that in 1946 the USSR had 170 million, and the estimated population should have been 209 million .  My point was and still is that there are probably more to this 39 million discrepancy than just the German invasion (although no doubt the main culprit directly, or indirectly) but none the less. It doesn't matter how you define the Gulags. It was one of many alternate non-German related ways of dying in Soviet times.   And I know that this is the wrong part of Reddit for critical thinking. But a lot of numbers back then was manipulated to fit the political narrative true on both western and eastern sphere. I can imagine that such as the true number of East block civilians escaping to the west would not be publicly reported. 20 million extra dead during 34 months is quite noticeable as it would be almost 600 000 more dead per month.	removed	existing	[0.68568075 0.31431925]

In Russia, we only have "специалитет" ("specialist" degrees; usually 5 years of studies, roughly equal to bachelors and masters combined),,бакалавриат (bachelors), магистратура (masters), аспирантура (\~PhD postgraduate studies), докторантура (higher doctoral studies), + a few other degrees for medical doctors).  So, there is no exact equivalent. However, it's possible to say "диплом с отличием" \~ diploma "with distinction"/"with honours". So, "диплом бакалавра с отличием" would mean, literally, "bachelor's diploma with honours". Not sure if it really conveys the meaning but it sounds OK.  "Послевузовское профессиональное образование" is worse because it sounds very formal, and, I think, it usually covers PhD and further studies.	existing	existing	[0.6856826 0.3143174]

Isn't it kind of disengenuous to compare the two situations? The US border is a migrant problem. The issue in Ukraine is the Russian military is massed at the border and specifically the types of units they are massing would be the types you would have in the event of an invasion. I'm sure the world would be alarmed if the US started massing tanks and armored vehicles at the Canadian border too, especially if they did so relatively recently after annexing Quebec or something.	removed	existing	[0.68568    0.31432003]

Russians are not religious. Actual Russian Orthodox women who  are invested in their religion are not interested in marrying someone who isn't Orthodox, I actually know such girls.   I have a Ukrainian Orthodox acquaintance who lives in Western Europe and is married to an Indian. That dude had to convert to Orthodoxy and jump through some serious hoops to marry her. Like, she had to believe he *truly* wanted to convert to Orthodoxy, that this wasn't just a ploy to marry her. He had to prove it to her the hard way. No way would she have married a Catholic btw.	existing	existing	[0.68567723 0.31432277]

You're not just imagining it. I think Spanish vowels (not an expert on Spanish here!) tend to be 'pure' – that is, the sound doesn't change from beginning to end.   /o/ in North American and Standard British pronunciation tends to be 'impure' – we close our lips a little toward the end, so there's almost an /u/ sound. Try saying (or listening to an American saying) "ohh... " slowly, you'll probably hear something like \[o\] with a hint of \[u\] at the end.  Russian stressed /o/ is also often 'impure,' but in a different way: speakers often round their lips more at the beginning, less at the end, giving the slight /a/ coloration you've heard. It's more noticeable at the end of a word, perhaps not so much before м. It's a subtle point but worth listening for, as the 'o with a hint of u' can contribute to an English accent in Russian. It's perhaps the main thing that distinguishes 'vote' from вот.	existing	existing	[0.6856792 0.3143208]

I know, but "normal" inflections are at least a little easier to tell apart in theory. I mean, with "окно" versus "окон", they're actually spelled differently, so someone who is learning Russian from textbooks will know how to decline the noun properly even if they screw up the pronunciation. But when inflections are differentiated by stress only, there's more potential for error when you're learning from textbooks and other "academic" learning materials. In my experience, textbooks don't do a very good job of explaining why stress matters. It might not be as much of an issue for someone learning through genuine immersion.	existing	existing	[0.68568003 0.31431994]

Мне сложно понять то, что вы говорите, тем более на английском. Точнее я все это слышал уже миллион раз. Все повторяют примерно одно и то же, но звучит это так как будто люди сами не понимают о чем говорят.  *"Ум" – много о нём говорят, много болтают... Да либо вообще не понимают, либо превратно понимают, либо однобоко понимают. А как он есть на самом деле, не понимает никто. Потому и множатся всякие учения, столько, что не счесть.*  *Никто из обычных живых существ не понимает его, не видит своего лица, и потому все блуждает в трёх мирах, бредёт шестью дорогами, претерпевая многие страдания. Сколь горестно не знать свой ум!*  *Шраваки и пратьекабудды хотят понять его с точки зрения анатмана, а как он есть – не понимают. Да и остальные – каждый любит своё учение, своё писание и, попавшись в их тенета, не видит Ясного Света.*  *Шраваки и пратьекабудды ослеплены пристрастием к объекту и субъекту. Мадхьямики ослеплены пристрастием к крайностям двух истин. Практикующие крия- и йогатантру ослеплены пристрастием к заклинаниям и садханам. Практикующие маха- и ануйогу ослеплены пристрастием к пространству и осознанию.*  *...Имён же ему столько, что и не счесть. Одни зовут природой ума, ум как таковой.*   *Тиртики зовут атман, самость. Шраваки настаивают об анатмане, отсутствии Я. Читтаматрины называют его виджняна, сознание. Кто зовёт Праджняпарамита, Запредельная Мудрость. Кто зовёт Сугатагарбха, семя Сугаты. Кто зовёт Махамудра, Великий Знак. Кто зовёт одинокое тигле, уникальная сфера. Кто зовёт Дхармадхату, дхармовое пространство. Кто зовёт Алая, основа всего.

Does Russia have an equivalent of Red Dawn where America, NATO whatever invades Russia and some teenagers fight back?     Red Dawn is a good movie but I’d agree that it along with many such movies does depict the Russian antagonists as inhumane monsters. It may be ideological or just a way for the writers to dramatize it and make you root for the protagonists. Probably both.     Are Russian people offended by depictions of Russian characters as monsters?    For example, in Red Dawn the Russian invaders are depicted as inhumane monsters and commit heinous atrocities. In the beginning of the movie a high school kids are depicted in a class, and you hear the planes outside. The Russian paratroopers land and the kids go to the window and watch the teacher go outside and get shot. The Russian troops deliberately fire at high school kids and kill some of them.      War isn’t puppies and rainbows but I find it hard to believe they’d go that far and be so barbaric.     Then you see the troops taking the kids parents forcing them to dig their own graves and shoot them while the kids are secretly watching. You also see a girl about fourteen leaving a package that’s a bomb. But the troops that see her make lewd comments implying they want to rape her. As she runs away the bomb goes off.     I know it’s flawed and I don’t take it seriously. It’s still an interesting movie because the kids seem to replicate mujahideen style tactics from Afghanistan. I know it’s just entertainment but some people may take it seriously.   Do ordinary Russians ever think the depictions are unfair and offensive?

I just remembered another misadventure from my time studying abroad.  My (American) friend and I wanted some pizza but it was snowing so we decided to order delivery to our dorm. We called the restaurant, struggled our way through ordering, they told us it would be 45 minutes, and we waited.  And waited. And waited. After about an hour and a half, my phone rang and it was the driver saying he was in the building. We told him we'd go down to the lobby but he wasn't there. We tried to give him directions (poorly) He kept calling back and he was getting angrier and angrier but we just could not understand each other.  We went outside looking for him and we finally saw him in front of the wrong building down the street.  We waved him down and he drove up with our pizzas. He was visibly annoyed with us.  Then he saw that my friend was wearing a shirt that said "Я Русская" and he busted out laughing hysterically. He was like "Russian but not good at Russian language??" We had a nice laugh with him and gave him a massive tip. Every time we got pizza from them after that he'd be like "My Russian girls! "	existing	existing	[0.6856812  0.31431878]

If you speak Russian at least at a medium level now, nothing will happen. Just don’t forget to practice it time to time (listening to music or watching something in Russian will be already enough to maintain the same level you have now).   This confusion of languages can happen if: 1) you start to learn two new languages at the same time  2) if they are very similar. It happened to me when I started learning Spanish (knowing French at an upper intermediate level). So I almost completely replaced French with Spanish in my head. But again, it happened only because I completely stopped practicing French for 3 years. It was my biggest mistake hahaha. Now I’m learning it again, and I begin remembering all the stuff I was learning before.   So, Russian and Icelandic are not similar at all, so you’ll be fine!

Okay, there are a few things to unpack here.  First, Ukrainians and Russians are close enough culturally and genetically, plus have a significant share of intermarriage. This means that being "Russian" or "Ukrainian" is often a question of self-perception when answering population polls, so a child of two ethnically Ukrainian Russian citizens can easily have themselves listed as Russian in a Russian poll, and a child of two ethnically Russian Ukrainian citizens can easily have themselves listed as Ukrainian in an Ukrainian poll.  Second, the last data point available for [Donetsk](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8) and [Lugansk](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%9B%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%97_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%96#%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4) oblasts comes from 2001, but then ethnic Russians made up some 38% population of the former (to 56% Ukrainians) and 39% of the latter (to 58% Ukrainians). This means that the populations of the People's Republics are Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian and Russian ethnic descent.  Third, what the population of the Republics wants is quite a bit more nuanced than "joining Russia". Their original demands, when they followed the Western Ukraine's lead in capturing city administration, were essentially increased local autonomy: federalization of the country, veto right for their regions in the Parliament. Obviously, after these demands were answered not with appeasement, as was the case in the West, but with artillery fire on living quarters and ground attack plane runs on the captured administrative buildings, the share of those willing to live inside the Ukraine lowered, and the share of these who wanted to join Russia or become an independent nation grew. The following war, with the Ukraine using Nazi paramilitaries such as battalion Azov or battalion Tornado as punitive forces against civilians, did little to endear it to the locals further.	existing	existing	[0.68568116 0.3143188 ]

"I think it also brings me to Putin. ... in our country, we don't have much love for our leaders. My God, how much shit our prime minister gets is just unbelievable. I'm curious why there is a protective culture around him. Is it just because you can't really change anything?"   You see, my friend, some things can only be understood in the context of some distant events. Imagine that some person saved your life when you were in imminent danger of death. Well, let's say you were hanging over the abyss on a bunch of blades of grass, and realized that another minute or two, and you were already flying into the abyss and this is the complete end. And all your emotions about it. And there is no hope, no hope at all. The only reality is death at the bottom. Introduced?   .   That's about the state in which Russia was suspended over the abyss after the collapse of the USSR.  It is necessary to describe what was going on then for a long time and in detail. But how the enemies of Russia triumphed! Here is a quote from Brzezinski: ""The New World Order will be built against Russia, on the ruins of Russia and at the expense of Russia."   That is, he has already buried all of us - it was assumed, apparently, that we would all really die of hunger, and there would be stacks of our corpses and the corpses of our children on the streets of our cities. And I'm not exaggerating, we all felt the approach of something like this.   When I saw a university professor selling some spoons taken out of the house at the market to buy food, and old veterans selling their orders... And terrorist attacks almost every day! And the war in Chechnya, which seemed endless. And the salary that has not been paid for months. And complete hopelessness - where to get food?   And then Putin came to power. The war in Chechnya ended two weeks later with the complete destruction of the bandits. They started paying off their salary debts. There were still terrorist attacks, but less and less, and then they stopped altogether. They started paying off pension debts. In short, we suddenly felt a timid hope that this fall of the country into the abyss would stop.   And then suddenly roads and bridges began to be built, emergency housing in cities was replaced with new comfortable high-rise buildings, whole streets and neighborhoods were built. And then suddenly it turned out that the eternally unprofitable agriculture began to make a profit, and we went from food importer to exporters...   No, you won't understand. Young people here who did not live at that time, they also no longer understand   But those who survived that horror - they will hold on to Putin with their hands, teeth and claws. Because we have always remembered that "the safest place is behind his back."	removed	existing	[0.68567926 0.31432077]

По отношению к лесбиянкам и всему, связанному с женской гомосексуальностью, в русском разговорном языке употребляется также прилагательное «розовый».  В русском блатном жаргоне, своими корнями уходящим в тюремную лексику, по отношению к пассивным гомосексуальным мужчинам (ср. «Опущенный») используются такие обозначения как «петух», «попер» и другие.

Officially, new information to a conversation (the rheme) is supposed to be introduced last in Russian. So unless you verbally stress the first word, люблю я тебя emphasizes тебя.  [http://rusgram.narod.ru/2128-2151.html](http://rusgram.narod.ru/2128-2151.html)  > Коммуникативная задача - это стремление говорящего подчеркнуть тот аспект содержания предложения, который является важным, существенным в данном контексте или в данной речевой ситуации. Например, в предложении Брат купил книгу коммуникативной задачей может быть сообщение о том, что сделал брат (купил книгу). Смысл этого предложения может измениться, если говорящий поставит перед собой другую коммуникативную задачу - сообщить о том, что купил брат: Брат купил книгу. Такая коммуникативная задача предполагает, что слушателям известно, что брат купил какой-то предмет, но неизвестно, какой именно. Возможна и иная коммуникативная задача - сообщить о том, кто купил книгу: Книгу купил брат. Коммуникативной задачей может быть сообщение о том, каким способом брат приобрел книгу: Брат книгу купил.	existing	existing	[0.68567973 0.31432027]

Sturgeon population is endangered and nearly all caviar that is not farmed cones from poachers.    Now, farming is not easy, as the fishes mature slowly.

hello , i am from Tunisia, north africa , and the your map is wrong , There is no US military base in Tunisia,  , limited troops for training exchange maybe , but no bases.     However there was attempts to establish a US military base, first during president Ben Ali era, but he refused ( see his meeting with Condoleezza Rice and the tension it created), he got overthrown under the sugarcoating of arab spring , then they brought in pro-western islamist ,and  they accepted to establish US military base, However Algeria (russia No 1 partner in north africa and probably whole of africa)  intervened  and it was posponed, and now there is another "coup" which is  algerian backed ,      coup between ""  because the president dissolved the parlement and said all power in my hands, so more of a shift of power , which is good to some extent ,cause almost all  the legislators in the parlement were on the pay roll of  some US institutes like the NDI  ( the  National Democratic Institute) , so the get paid to pass in action the laws dictated by the corporate america, like for example one week before the coup , parlement members were to pass a law permitting foreigners to exploit water  points and groundwaters in Tunisia,  you will see Nestlé jump in Tunisia in 5 min,  luckily the "coup" happened	existing	existing	[0.68568075 0.31431928]

I want the British to know more about their country!   James Le Mesurier - British military man, founder and   sponsor of an organization known as the White Helmets!   (TERRORISTS ASSISTANT!)    cooperated with militants of banned terrorist groups such as Tahrir al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra), participated in sabotage and even executions, spread disinformation against Damascus, staged attacks using banned poisonous substances and filmed fake videos “from the scene”, to blame them on the Syrian government and army.   https://img.projektn.sk/wp-static/2018/04/syria-hoax-I.jpg?fm=jpg&q=85&w=2400&h=1260&fit=crop&fm=png&markx=10w&marky=5w&markpost=bottom-right&markw=15w&mark= 2019/06/sk.png   the entire Syrian government arsenal of chemical weapons was eliminated a few years earlier - under the supervision of the OPCW and the world community, and even with the direct participation of the United States, Great Britain and other Western countries.   And this is where the White Helmets with their fakes came in handy. Footage of civilians killed and suffocated by poisonous and nerve-paralytic gases by this organization regularly appeared in the global media space. The White Helmets churned out videos with fake “bombed out hospitals” and “killed civilians” due to Russian and Syrian air strikes. However, when checking, it turned out that the footage was a production, for participation in which money was paid, and the “victims” from the video were wearing makeup.   Russia and Syria signaled the staged nature of the content of the White Helmets, presented evidence to the UN and the Hague Tribunal, systematically exposing these British terrorists!   These combined efforts have paid off. In particular, due to the fact that a large number of facts indicated that the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma was in fact an act of fraud, Washington decided in 2018 to suspend further funding for the White Helmets project. As Bild wrote, at the request of the United States, Canada and a number of European countries, Israel then evacuated hundreds of NGO employees and their families from Syria to Jordan, from where they were later taken to the UK, Canada and Germany. The Americans were forced to rethink their military, political and media strategy in Syria.	removed	existing	[0.6856811  0.31431893]

The US/NATO position is that Ukraine is a sovereign nation and should be able to dictate its own security, including whether or not it joins NATO in the future.

Vladivostok used to be dubbed the ‘Russian San Francisco’ by former Soviet leader Nikita Kurshchev. It is known for it's beautiful hills and position on the Pacific Coast. There are a lot of Korean and Chinese migrants/tourist and are well tolerated by the populace, albiet some tensions here and there. My observation from my last visit is that it's full of South Korean girls who want to go do Europe but don't have the time and money so Vladivostok is their substitute 'European' city to take endless selfies with those selfie sticks walking around all day.

One story told about the origin of this phrase suggests that it came from Odessa: "фонтаны" were drinking fountains that tapped into the underground artesian water wells (the Fountain districts were named after them: see [here](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Большой_Фонтан_(Одесса)#Происхождение_названия), for instance), and Odessans could tell the difference between water shipped in from elsewhere and drawn from these drinking fountains.

Russia said they won't invade Georgia - they occupied two big areas of Georgia in 2008  Russia said they have nothing to do with Crimea - they occupied it in 2014. In 2015 they agreed that their military forced such actions and illegal referendum.  Later Russia said that they have nothing to do with Luhansk and Donetsk regions - but somehow THOUSANDS of Russian tanks are in eastern Ukraine.  Till this day Russia does not acknowledge that after WWII they have had occupied Baltic countries for more than 50 years. We are now independant for 31 years.  Russia is occupier and lier!  Such country cannot be trusted.  What they have done in Lithuania after occupation - they send 160.000+ brightest people (teachers, politicians, scientists etc) to gulafs in Siberia. Many were jailed and killed.  Just to ensure that country wouldn't resist.  We need to support Ukraine, so that the same fate wouldnt fall onto them. That's why Lithuania stands up for Ukraine and Taiwan, because we know what it means to be opressed.	removed	existing	[0.6856811 0.3143189]

BDUs all over the world are typically made by the lowest bidder and are pretty much disposable. My friend served with the US Army in Afghanistan. He never saw any real combat, but went through dozens of BDUs, especially the pants. The Army wouldn’t replace them often enough for him and so he had his mom buy and mail him surplus multicam pants from the States. She also mailed him stuff like Magpul anti-tilt followers for M4 mags, because the issued aluminum 30 round mags were terribly unreliable with their tilting followers. It took the US decades to start issuing decent, modern magazines for their service rifles!	existing	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431916]

When a user transmits several propaganda phrases at once, it's not a matter of discussion, it becomes arguing about tricks. Each of these phrases is based on some artificial beliefs which, in turn, were produced to explain common lies. For instance, there are only 2 variants: people are totally happy with each and every government and president, or there are Americans who hire protesters (or there are Europeans, or Japanese, or aliens). No protest can be directly caused by the president's inner politics. This can be only terrorists from US special services. Also, each country has its interest which includes consequent ruining of another countries. You can not be interested in international trade and collaboration and in scientific researches. USA needs Ukraine and Russia to be destroyed or become weak and poor. Why? That's important myth from Soviet ideology which is used by Russian propaganda. Only Cold War and only nuke bombs. So when the president on Ukraine talked about integration with Europe and then told it's not possible and then talked about it again, people who wanted to live in Europe and be more independent from Russia went to peaceful protest meetings. Then there were police shooting protesters, Molotov cocktails and so on. Of course in this point it was a matter of some interest of USA and Europe, but much more so of Russian president. He is obsessed with false imperial politics and strongly dislikes any government in post-Soviet countries which he can't control. Also there were some business questions about oil and gas. When Ukraine became more independent and more democratic, the Russian president needed to punish it in revenge. He occupied Crimea and started war on Ukrainian territory. Now Russian propaganda say that Crimea “came home” and that war is just between Ukrainian people. The question why Russian president thinks he should control post-Soviet countries can't be discussed. His ratings become lower and lower slowly in the past years, so he thinks about short war to raise his popularity before the elections. He doesn't know any other methods and don't consider allowing anyone else to become president. He will steal elections and fake its results for sure via electronic votes and all that methods that we obviously see on the 2021 elections and in pat years, and the main question is if he will add 15% to his results, or more than 40%. If you think it's none of a difference, look at protests in Belarus. So this hybrid informational autocracy with elements of tyranny mainly produces a pretty picture for press and people => no honest elections, no massive protests, no real politics should be seen, just fake picture. Just fake news.  I could somewhat simplified the situation, but this is closer to what we have.	existing	existing	[0.6856812  0.31431878]
When the Crimean affair happened I watched it very closely since I lived very close like an hour away from " Taman" town which is directly next to crimea.   Personally I supported the annexation, what I didn't support is lying about it. If we just said "hey it's our troops over there, we are returning Crimea home" that would be fine, but first saying that there were no troops and then saying there actually were our troops is not fine.   Even if it was a private military group I'm sure it was allowed to operate in crimea by the Russian government, otherwise nobody would let them in.	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431952]
First of all, what you described is slavery. No, no man on earth has enough money to get a slave. What you described has nothing remotely equivalent to what men are providing for. Second of all, women aren’t owing men anything if they pay for some dates. Lol. It’s just a courtship. Just a thing. Same as holding a door. If you think you owe something to a man that pays for your dinner — you should reevaluate your self esteem and self worth. Third of all, if man actually trully invests in woman — covers life expenses, buys house, car, vacations, etc then surely there is some implication that woman will try to birth him a kid. But that’s about it. You aren’t slave. It’s just males job to provide food and housing, and woman’s job to birth a child. Period. If you think you owe him to be a slave then again you should reevaluate your self worth. Lol	existing	existing	[0.68567914 0.31432092]

Defending is one thing, invading is another. Russia is not trying to defend here, it is trying to attack through invasion. You guys are conflating "defense" with "offense", which is ofcourse due to the propaganda. If the west pushed for an invasion of Russia, I would have cheered for you guys for amassing troops.  Ukraine, just like any other neighbouring nation, has the sovereign right to invite american troops and build bases. Russia, being a sovereign nation, has the right to oppose such steps on national interest grounds. It can threaten sanctions, severe ties, etc to stop such things from happening. But threatening to invade or use violence is a declaration of war. It can't use violence in an offensive mode to serve its political goals.	removed	existing	[0.6856789 0.3143211]

мой/моя/моё = 'my'. They are different because they are used with different genders: мой with masculine, моя with feminine, and моё with neutral gender.   For example, друг(a friend) is a masculine noun, so if you want to say 'my friend', you should say 'мой друг'.   Подруга (a girlfriend) is feminine, then, my girlfriend = моя подруга.  Хобби(a hobby) is neutral, then, my hobby = моё хобби.  *You can guess gender by the last letter(s) of the noun. Nouns, ended by а/я/сть are normally feminine. Of course, if they don't mean obviously masculine things, for example, father(папа), uncle(дядя). Such nouns are obviously masculine gender.  Words, ended by o/e are neutral.  Words ended by hard consonants(for example, м/н/г/к/д/т/р...) are normally masculine.  It is great simplificantion, of course. Sometimes it can give you false results, but it will work correct in the most cases.	existing	existing	[0.68567836 0.31432167]

Honestly, if you’re very much a beginner, forget about grammar (mostly). Focus on vocabulary! Most Russian educators say that if you spend all your time learning grammar and no vocabulary you won’t be able to communicate as well as if you did it the other way around. Granted, a lot of mistakes will be made with cases, gender, conjugation etc but people will still understand what you say.   I’ve been focusing on vocabulary, speaking/listening, and maybe 20% grammar, and while my grammar sucks and I sound like a child speaking Russian, I can still communicate. I met some native Russian speakers last week at a bar and they were delighted to see someone speak their language.. Russian natives know it’s a hard language, especially for English speakers and will understand if you make mistakes with grammar, but will still understand what you’re trying to communicate... But if you don’t have the vocabulary, they will have no idea what you’re saying.	existing	existing	[0.6856794  0.31432068]

That’s not the point of the argument, I never said the US does no wrong - clearly they do and I’m sure they killed tons of people. The argument I’m making to you is about your statement, which factually is wrong. When you are telling a 15 year old that Russia won’t hurt anyone and they are there for the defense of the 1/100 people in Ukraine that want to be Russian, that leaves 99/100 of those people as targets to be either repressed or put down like mangy dogs.

My Russian professor told us of students who went to Kiev/Kyiv for language stays, as it was far cheaper than Russia to attend school there. Overall, they all liked it and made enough progress to be happy about it. She told us there are many beautiful sights in town, good food, kind people and Russian is still widely spoken (and either way Ukrainian is close enough to it that people should understand you well, there's only accentuating and some words here and there that will change substantially). If you're conversational, you should not struggle at all!  As for the geopolitical situation, I doubt it will make it much harder to speak Russian for you. It's still the native/second language of many people in Ukraine after all. Of course, the current tensions will probably make the asshole behaviour of asshole people more frequent than usual, but they'll likely not be a majority - and I'd guess once people know you're a foreigner who's not Russian, through you telling them or your accent, most will be very happy to help you and make you discover their city!  Now as a word of advice: once you're settled on your choice, you should contact your local embassy/consulate. Given how hot the situation in Ukraine has been, they'll surely have the info you need and may even have an update feed to let you know if anything is happening once you're there. And, worse come to worse, they'll be able to contact you and help you better if you require evacuation for any kind of emergency.  Sorry for writing something so long. It's not my own experience so it may need other takes on it, but I hope it helps! Всего доброго!	existing	existing	[0.68568    0.31432003]

It depends on specific person and topic. There are more 'вы' usage in complex or abstract topics.   Initially i use 'вы' and switch to 'ты' if another person did it (talking with eldery ppl is an exeption ofc). Because for me it's uncomfortable when someone sticks with 'вы' without context reason or age gap. Looks like he's trying to keep maximum distance from you (mb his attitude about you is bad).

Im polish and i know that Krimea historically belonged to Russia, but instead of marching your troops right away dis you ever negotiate. If eastern Ukraine is populated by russians then why not just talk about it. Make them autonomous by negotiating. NATO intervention in Yugoslavia happened too late to make Yugoslavia fall (after Tito’s death it was already falling apart) not even talking about the fact USA helped Yugoslavia When USSR wanted yo incorporate it to the eastern block.

Just imagine that your country was destroyed from the inside into many parts. The economy collapsed, civil wars broke out on the outskirts. The middle class has been destroyed.

Moreover, these pennies may not pay them for many months and even years. People just went to work. And in order to have food, they planted potatoes and cucumbers in the gardens.

What's truly disappointing is to see that Russia is used as a tool for domestic politics in the United States, but given how our culture and news is smeared all over the planet like a toddler's feces it ends up having a global impact. Both major American political parties have boogeymen. For the Republicans it's black people and poor people and college kids with blue hair. For Democrats it's Republicans and Russians. Both sides whip their base up into a frenzy by hyping up the imaginary threat posed by "those people" in order to distract them from what's really going on right here in our own country. It's sad that Europe panders to the US so much and echoes all this nonsense. I'll be the last to say that I 100% support Putin and everything he's done domestically and internationally, but I certainly won't fault him for standing up for his country, and to watch the American news it's clear our leaders think he has some kind of audacity to stand up for his own interests (meanwhile we've got our hands up the assholes of half the governments on the planet).	existing	existing	[0.685681 0.314319]

Get the Windows 10 mnemonic Russian keyboard--you can basically type a lot of the same letters and the extra letters (Russian has more, 33 or something like that) are typed with combinations.  Anyways, learn the alphabet, do some of your basic intro lessons to learn how to greet people, thanks, you're welcome, etc.  Then you get on HelloTalk and you go into the search and look for Russian speakers.  You can start 25 new conversations per day.  Do that--people will drop out for long periods of time (I've done it myself).  Once you start seeing the standard greetings and figures of speech often enough you can start copy pasting the beginning stuff.  Find the people that want to talk on audio/video calls (lots seemed to want to use WhatsApp).  There are seriously so many Russian speakers on HelloTalk that want to practice their English.  That ought to get you started.  The most important thing is to find the things you are interested in and do/watch/etc. in the target language.  Don't feel like you have to plug along with lessons or w/e if you find them boring.  Don't get attached to specific apps or w/e because if you stay in that ecosystem you're probably not going to take whatever skills you build outside of it.  Lastly, recognize the fear to make a mistake or to be misunderstood.  It's going to happen no matter hard you try because you just don't know what you're doing yet.  If you can recognize that and put it aside, you'll make a lot more satisfying progress.	existing	existing	[0.68567926 0.31432077]

A couple of facts:    1. Kiev is a Russian city. Therefore, it is logical that everyone there speaks Russian.    2. The so-called Ukrainian language is a dialect of the Russian language, which has undergone partial Polonization over several centuries. That is, it is a corrupted Russian language.

Obtaining a resident parking permit (which does not entitle you to a specific space) is not an easy task and does not guarantee a successful outcome. The cost of parking is 450rub / hour around the clock. There are a lot of shops, depending on where and what. In the center, the same grocery stores are rare, but you, as a rule, cannot drive up to them by car either. On foot or by public transport.

I never said they were entitled. Yet again I did imply there is an entire world outside of the US and Europe, that has a far different cultural development.   Sure, in this case, the girl is residing in the West where that usage may be problematic (altho Switzerland as a slave state? Really?), and knowledge of local cultural points never hurts, but my point was that the post colonial culture largely exists almost exclusively in the West, and it's not wrong to realize there is the majority of the world in terms of populace and landmass that simply does not care to the same level nor has the same history/cultural taboos.  I believe it was OP's question whether such differences existed and that was a response to her question.	existing	existing	[0.68568146 0.3143185 ]

I do not like it. RT DE has been shut down due to conspiracy theories about the coronavirus, such as Pfizer's vaccine that kills more people than it saves, and animal testing of BioNTech's vaccine reveals dangerous levels of nanoparticles in organs...  Russia, as the heir to the USSR, has vast experience in the development of vaccines, and the best in the world, well, or almost the best. and the West, led by the United States, how much crap they poured out about the Russian vaccine Sputnik?   The West still does not stop trying to discredit the Russian vaccine against coronavirus "Sputnik V", developed by the Russian NITsEM. N. F. Gamalei   A series of pseudo-analytical investigations and eyewitness false testimonies about the alleged danger of the Russian vaccine are being prepared on social networks and Russian-language Internet resources funded by foreign grants.   The West is driven by banal envy and fear of competition - the Russian vaccine, registered the first in the world, turned out to be the most effective among all the analogues being developed, which means it will be more in demand.   The plans of the West to discredit the Russian vaccine not only exist - they have been actively implemented over the past few months. First, it is necessary to continue and actively promote the very noteworthy Russophobia that exists. Russia in the image of absolute evil, where, in principle, there can be nothing good, and even more so there is some kind of vaccine, the first in the world, for a second. The second point, no less important, is that the West needs to clean up the market for its vaccines that will someday appear in this way. So that they do not have competitors, they must behave in a similar way. Here they are doing it all.	removed	existing	[0.68568224 0.3143177 ]

I am a Russian woman of age 44, so even Sovjet times, I was always prepared to myself. Especially on the first date. Cause it gives you certain freedom, not to feel obliged, if the date failed and you didn't like a man. I think most of men at least expect the suggestion to split the bill from a woman, cause it is sort of a sign she is not taking him for a wallet and taking him for granted. But you say you've been dating for several months, and he probably made it clear a long time ago that he doesn't want you to pay when you are with him. Actually, that is a sign he is taking you seriously, that you are his woman and he wants to supply for you, for you as his couple. But I always made clear to my partners that paying for me, doesn't mean buying me, that I will always work and have my own income to put my share in our budget as a couple. You know your boyfriend better. Try to explain that giving is also important for relations as accepting gifts. That it is important for you to share with him.

The "civilized" Western world against great Russia!   The war will continue until the “Russian question” is completely resolved, that is, the destruction of the Russian superethnos and Russian civilization with its unique “Russian matrix” – the idea of ​​justice and life in good conscience. Only by destroying the Russian people and the Russian language, by physically destroying Russia, can the West receive the main prize - the planet!    Papal Rome remains the spiritual ideologist of the “onslaught on the East”, on Russia and the Slavic-Russian civilization from the early Middle Ages to the present. The other two "command posts" of the Western project are London and Washington.   Therefore, the Western "elites" have always looked with great surprise, misunderstanding and fear at the "mysterious" Russians, who always, having superiority in military skills (warrior people), did not colonize, did not rob, did not ruin neighboring nationalities, as Western peoples did. .   in particular, if it weren’t for the revolutions, wars and “reforms” of the 20th century, then there would be about 500 million Russians now, that is, we would be the third ethnic group on the planet in terms of numbers, as at the beginning of the century, after the Chinese and Indians), with each round of development, the Russian super ethnos and Russia are becoming more and more powerful and great nation and power.   Hence the clue to Western Russophobia. The current Russophobia is not due to the fact that the West does not like "bad Putin or Stalin", it has millennial roots. This is the fear of the Russians (“Russians are coming”), which was known both in Ancient Rome and Constantinople, preserved in Paris, London and Washington, which inherit the ancient traditions of confrontation between Russia and the West. This is hatred for Russians, hostility, which expresses the inferiority complex inherent in a less perfect culture in relation to a more perfect one. Misunderstanding and inability to understand a more developed culture, while militarily a more powerful people (the Russians more than once defeated the western hordes, but did not raze Warsaw, Berlin and Paris to the ground as they could), generates genetic, biological fear and envy. The Westerners are afraid of the militant Russians and envy them, they greedily want to take advantage of the riches of the Russian land.	removed	existing	[0.68568164 0.31431833]

The very best thing to do would be to take a class, either IRL or online, even if it's just Skyping with a tutor once a week. Feedback is so important and structure is good, especially in the early stages of learning.  The free podcast "Russian Made Easy" is a great primer for grammar, IMO. Russian nouns change their endings (declension) in a myriad of ways, and there are a lot of rules to learn. This podcast helps prepare your brain for the concept by explaining how it works in terms of pattern recognition, matching and rhyming. It was an invaluable foundation for me.  Both grammar and immersion are important, and there are tons of resources for free in the Interwebs. Be sure to check this sub's Wiki for a comprehensive list. Some of my favorites: Youtube channels "Russian with Max," "Be Fluent in Russian," "Real Russian Club." Podcasts "Comprehensible Russian," "Russian with Daria," "Speaking Russian."

HOW JAPANESE MOTHERS DEMANDED THE SOVIET VACCINE   In Japan, in the 1950s and 1960s, a real tragedy unfolded: thousands of cases of polio were recorded in a small country. Only a live vaccine produced in the USSR could stop the epidemic. But registering and issuing permission to use it was very difficult. Then the mothers of children with polio took to the streets, demanding permission to import the Soviet vaccine. They got their way: 20 million Japanese children were saved from the threat of disease.	removed	existing	[0.685682 0.314318]

Of course Stalin wasn't a visionary thinking of Hitler in 1931, he was just pumping up his audience while thinking about war with capitalist countries - Britain, France, USA.   When it came down to actual Hitler, Stalin gets [informed](https://erenow.net/biographies/stalinthecourtoftheredtsar/34.php) by Sorge in May 1941 that invasion will happen on June 22nd, but he chooses to ignore that, and all other information in similar way as provocations. The truly disastrous part [comes later in 1941](https://erenow.net/biographies/stalinthecourtoftheredtsar/34.php) when Soviet Union gets informed again well in advance that Germany is preparing for immediate offensive, but Stalin quashes it all as "provocations", and continues to respond in this way even while Germans are already bombing USSR.	existing	existing	[0.68568087 0.31431916]

Iraq was not a NATO operation. The only time the relevant NATO article has been invoked is Afghanistan, after 9/11  I don’t think anyone in Europe wants to somehow “invade” Russia, everyone knows Russia has a large military.  But as a free country, Ukraine should be allowed to choose its own path. IMO NATO would reject its request to join, as it has done so far  Nobody wants war. But action against Ukraine by Russia achieves what? IMO I think this is more about Putin halting Ukraines growing ties with the EU, as he’s worried about neighbouring countries succeeding economically, and then his domestic audience asking why he isn’t delivering the same results	removed	existing	[0.685681   0.31431904]

i would like to point out that everything in Moscow here is german.  German tooth implantology, german kitchen centers, every third car is german one.   when you want to sell something for a lot of money, give it a german sounding name.  Russians love germans.  there are so many scientific coorperations, businessprojects with german partners and so on.  nobody holds a grudge against you because of something that someone else did generations ago.   you will as a german forever be welcomed, if you are able to to see beyond your antirussian conditioning.  &#x200B;  that is my personal exp. and i chose to exchange duesseldorf for moscow.	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431955]

The current Russian regime does not want to invade Ukraine proper. It will bring no benefit. Russia does not have a legit territorial claim on Ukraine. There is no population in Ukraine that wants to join Russia. No geopolitical profit can be reached by forcefully suppressing and purifying Ukraine. Their infrastructure and values are old and shabby. Their natural resources are inferior. And the expenses will be immense.	existing	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431937]
The best way that I learned is by thinking if the adjective describing the subject is a descriptive adjective or if its a definite adjective.   If its descriptive, then its like a permanent adjective about the subject - like saying Это большой дом, describing the physical nature or non-changeable traits.   When it's a definitive adjective, its describing the subject over a temporary description. Я очень голоден/на is correct because hunger is a temporary feeling or emotion.   I hope this helps, this is just my way of thinking through it	existing	existing	[0.6856814  0.31431857]

I already commented, so I’ll try to keep it short.  Our involvement in foreign affairs has set in a domino effect over 100 years old, at this point. On one hand, we might just need to suffer the consequences of ending our term of World Police and try and mind our own business, in the hope it leads to prosperity for us and others.  On the other hand, as a nation defined by it’s diversity of populations, many of us feel the need to protect the nations of our ancestors because of the power bestowed on us, though I don’t think we consciously realize that.   It’s a complicated issue that none of us really have the answer to, but I think the general view is that we made a mess that we should clean up, and cleaning up that mess creates another, and so on. I anticipate that any way in Ukraine would result in the same kind of mess later on.	existing	existing	[0.6856817  0.31431833]

Of course, it's easier to be ignorant, especially if there are sawdust in the head instead of brains!  the main difference between the Sputnik V and Pfizer vaccines:   the American vaccine was developed very quickly on a completely new basis.    As for the Russian drug, it was produced on developments since 2002, which were undergoing clinical trials on humans.   US halts coronavirus vaccine trial due to severe side effects   By the way, the United States has rich experience in killing people with its vaccines and potions, and according to the law adopted in the late 80s,    and these companies cannot be judged!!!!!   Six people have died during trials of a coronavirus vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German company BioNTech, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report says.   The entire "civilized" world hoped for the United States! You were like a ray of light in a dark realm! And now what? Will everyone have to buy an "unfinished" not "democratic", as you said, vaccine from Russia? What have you done!   For the Americans, instead of bringing their vaccine to perfection, they only had this intelligence enough to impose sanctions against six Russian laboratories and institutes. And they summed up the reason - they say, Russia, under the guise of a vaccine, is developing chemical and bacteriological weapons. And 50 countries have already lined up for the Russian vaccine!   And Phizer, which poisons the population of the planet for decades !!!!!   CNBC: Pfizer and Moderna won't be held responsible for vaccine side effects!!!!!	removed	existing	[0.68568265 0.31431738]
Biden said he would approve gender reassignment surgery for 8 year olds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The transition from woman to man intensified dramatically during the Obama and Biden years. The girls remained bald, bearded, breastless, ovarianless, with a permanently lowered voice and distorted genitals, at risk of a myriad of physical and mental problems, and their feminine identity was erased.   About 5% of all American girls can now self-identify as transgender or non-binary. About 50% or more may have a diagnosis of autism or undiagnosed autism. Some suffer from mental disorders. But gender transition is so popular right now, and the risks are so well hidden, that many young people without major mental illness or autism may be involved in it.   The American dream: change from female to male and become a passive faggot.   These are the idiots who live in the USA and want to become presidents!!!!   What about eight years? Start at the nursery! Castrate boys, sterilize girls!   Now I know what the "American dream" looks like.	removed	existing	[0.6856814  0.31431857]

The US definitely does NOT want a war. The Russians may use the “threat” that the US allegedly poses on Russia to invade Ukraine, but that is an utter lie. The truth is that all the US wants is for Russia to leave Ukraine be, withdraw their troops, and allow Ukraine to join NATO if they so desire.	removed	existing	[0.6856808 0.3143192]

Many remember the monstrous intentions of Nazi Germany in the defeated states of Europe. However, the plans of the Allies after the victory over Germany, which had been developed since 1943, were no less cruel. How did the United States and Great Britain see the future of the German people, and why did they prefer to forget about this plan?   The program for the post-war organization of Germany by the Americans was called the Morgenthau plan.   The program forever deprived Germany of independence, divided it into many states and destroyed all the industrial achievements of the Germans over the past 400 years.   The division of the Central Bank of Germany into 11 banking districts, a ban on interaction between them. A complete ban on foreign trade, import restrictions, a ban on sea fishing. The destruction of all heavy industry.   True, in 1948 the program to destroy the German nation had to be curtailed. The Morgenthau program was replaced by the Marshall Plan, which, on the contrary, was aimed at the restoration of Germany.   What influenced this decision? Cold War. The Soviet Union was not aimed at the destruction of the Germans, despite all the suffering they caused. On the contrary, the country focused on the development of German industry and the creation of a pro-Soviet government.    Franklin Roosevelt proposed the creation of five autonomous states instead of a united Germany, Winston Churchill also advocated the dismemberment of Germany, emphasizing the need to separate Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg from Germany. Churchill proposed to include these territories together with Austria and Hungary in a separate Danube confederation. Stalin opposed the division of Germany. Here are his words: "The experience of history says that the Hitlers come and go, but the German people, but the German state remains!"   https://sun9-24.userapi.com/impf/veNCmWcfxej2tDjMGOnlZgqs3TNYPkwX-3YkVQ/9myKZrmLNcQ.jpg?size=0x0&quality=90&proxy=1&sign=a3ea5b4509acad362d7102e08da6736d&c\_uniq\_tag=8awo4o7aEq-tg8kd6e9mcYVw1dNOhfg\_5xR0EVEv2vY&type=video\_thumb	removed	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431958]

It takes someone born with the eyes to see that the emperor has no clothes, and dig deeper to truly start to find the truth.

      It is hard to really say for that one at the current time. Pre-pandemic canada was amazing. Economically, many great places in Canada to go and get a good paying job. Strong middle class. The low price of oil was hurting Alberta, but economic recovery was well under way. Ever since 2010, tourism in western Canada (where I live) has rose quite sharply. I'm not a huge fan of increased crowds in national parks, but it was great for the towns that I live in.        Since the pandemic started it has been a shit show. There has been rolling lockdowns. The big concern was the lack of funding pur medical system clearly had. A lack of hospital beds. Inflation has hit us like a ton of bricks, especially in the housing market. I live in a small town in the rocky mountains, and the value of my house rose 37% in 2021. A lot of millennials and younger are worried that they will never be able to buy a house now.        I would say no one is happy with our politicians at the moment, and that spans both major parties.       That being said, I am not a great person to ask about it. I worked thru the whole pandemic, not everyone could do that. I have a great paying career with great benefits, that has almost no risk of lay offs ever. I have no desire to live in  big city, so housing prices didnt hurt me much. I love canada, but I can admit we are in for some pain before things get better.	existing	existing	[0.68568116 0.31431887]

>The goal of all this aid was to create a stable, non-aggressive Russia  I am also doubtful about this statement. US was extremely concerned about loss of a control over nukes so basically they didn't want Russia to exchange nukes for food with Iran or other adversary.

NATO is a military alliance, and every member of NATO is expected to put a percentage of their GDP into the military.  The competences defined by the treaties of the EU, do not define any military competences to the EU institutions and there is no legal framework at the moment in the treaties to create a EU army.   In fact, the EU army question has been up to debate almost a decade now, as we want less dependency from NATO and we need a cohesive policy for all the EU Member States.   It is a question that will be probably be answered when the Treaty of Lisbon is modified, and as we gradually move towards federalisation of the Union.	existing	existing	[0.6856816 0.3143184]

Anyway, it is not about US/Russia is bad or good, it is about letting Ukraine do its thing and its decision.

You say no one wants a war, and those words are fantastic to hear! - I just hope they are true, cause a lot of the stuff we see, admittedly with US origins, makes it sound like war is just around the corner.  What, in your honest opinion, does it take - from all sides, to find a peaceful solution to this?   How long do you - or Russians in general, expect this to go on?  I'm just a Dane, in the grand scheme of things my country is insignificant, but I understand that we too have a responsibility, in this because we are a member of NATO.

There was three major ways to have a taxi before Uber and Yandex apps. 1. You call a taxi service via the phone, speak where you are and destination, hear a price and estimated awaiting time and confirm your order. Then go to car, pay in cash, ride and give a recipe if you do need it. 2. You can catch a car (taxi or private driver) on the parking near any airport, railroad station, etc. Here you don't need to wait, but you must have a good negotiations skill to have a fair price. There was (and still exist) a lot of cheaters. 3. Raised hand (no thumb like hitchhiker, just hand ) on the sidewalk was a sign you need a ride. Random car from the traffic stops next to you, you speak the destination, driver speak a price, if you have a deal - you go in the car, if not - he drives away, you try to stop a next one. 1st and partly 2nd was a chance to have an official taxi, with legal permission and maybe even yellow (or white or red - depends on brand) with taxi signs. 2nd and 3rd is for illegal unemployed drivers on the regular cars. Usually this kind of driver called Бомбила (Bombila, like a Bomb) and ride around the city trying to find a passenger is Бомбить (Bombit' , to bomb).  I don't know why, but lot of people call the driver like "Начальник", "Командир" or "Шеф" (boss, commander, chief).  So, the typical dialog ten years ago might be like this : Ivan rise his hand and a old rust Lada stops immediately:  - Where we go? - driver asked  - Nevsky 72  - 300 rubles   - Let's go, chief	existing	existing	[0.68567914 0.31432092]

>I think Maths might help reassure you about the demographic situation. Let's say the aforementioned biracial couple had a child. This mixed race child would need to have children with either dark skinned or mixed race people otherwise, their children will be even lighter. Within three generations it would be near impossible to not recognise the person as European.  Firstly, there is more to race than just skin tone. Skin darkness or lightness isn’t the only feature that makes Africans, Europeans and Asians look different to one another. A mixed race child can have a fair skin tone, but his nose, lips, facial bone structure, hair texture, calf shape, etc. could still look clearly African. Google light-skinned biracial people. You can still clearly tell that they are mixed despite being light, because of their other features.  Secondly, You are not accounting for perpetual mass immigration. Sure, today no-whites in Europe might number less than 40 million in total, but by the end of the century it could be HUNDREDS of MILLIONS.  It is true that if a half black half white person has a child with a fully white person, that their child will be only 25% African and will look have various European features… but you are NOT accounting for the fact that ethnic Europeans are only 10% of the global population currently. 9 in 10 people on the planet are not European and do not look European. By the end of the century, by the year 2100, fully European people could be as little as 3-5% of the global population. 5% CANNOT mix into the other 95% and still retain their appearance. What will happen is that in the distant future, mixed race people will increasingly marry into pure non-white/non-European people and their children will have increasingly smaller European ancestry. That European ancestry will keep shrinking until it vanishes and no future people look remotely European. Some light hair or eyes might linger for a while but eventually they will also disappaer.  That’s why no Europeans today look like Africans. Because over thousands of years those African appearances got buried too far away. However, the extinction of white European looking people and our appearance will happen much faster.  >Furthermore, even if they decided to only have children with dark or mixed race people, the sheer quantity of Europeans here and trickle of immigration will not make a significant dent.  Again, you are not accounting for perpetual immigration. Look at the attitude of people on r/europe. There are thousands of morons who SUPPORT open borders or some other form of continuous non-white immigration. They are opposed to closing Europe completely to non-white immigration. So the number of Africans and Asians in Europe will continue to rise and the number of Europeans will keep decreasing because of low birthrates and race mixing.	existing	existing	[0.68568027 0.3143198 ]

     This is hurtful and accurate. The Liberals and the conservatives are the two main parties in canada, and the only two that have truly formed government federally.       But we do have 3 smaller federal parties (the New Democratic Party, the Green Party, Bloc Quebecois) and typically a few independants. Currently, they hold about 40% of the seats federally. The NDP currently has formed a team with the liberals, which makes them a "minority" government.       So even though we sort of have a two party system, there are lots of times where a smaller table gets some power and a voice on the national stage.	existing	existing	[0.6856812  0.31431878]

Quite a strange alliance of free people in which, say, one side, such as the United States opens secret torture prisons on the territory of other countries, such as, say, Poland or Lithuania. But let's say, Poland or Lithuania could not dream of having a secret prison opened especially for them on U.S. territory, where undesirable people would have their jaws drilled with an electric drill, so that the Polish or Lithuanian government would remain clean and uninvolved in the event.   Or when evacuating a country, let's call it afghinistan for example, someone will take all their troops with them but won't even provide airplane seats for the allied contingents. It seems that this is the attitude to vassal contingents of satellites in the colonial army, but what can Russians know about equal relations between free people, so I guess I will have to keep silent.   Again the person unfree and spoiled could think that when you were not even invited to the negotiations which directly concern you, it's because "why invite them at all, they don't influence anything, they will do as they are told". But this idea of the person unfamiliar with relations between people with the general values of freedom. A person who is free understands that this is because they just took care of you and decided to talk instead of you in order to save you the extra effort.

Two humorous but useful school rhymes:  Сера, сера, буква S,   Тридцать два атомный вес.   Сера в воздухе горит,    образует ангидрид.   Ангидрид да плюс вода -   это будет кислота.    (Sulfur, sulfur, its symbol is S, it has atomic weight of 32. When it burns, anhydride of sulfur is produced. If you mix it with water, you'll get acid).  Тело, впернутое в воду,   выпирает на свободу   силой выпертой воды   тела впертого туды.   (The body shoved into water is yeeted out with the force of water (in the volume) of the shoved body).	existing	existing	[0.6856802  0.31431982]

Apparently present-day Russia has a lot of people—each of whom just loves to hide behind a «we»—who'd willingly trade in human lives for goodies on the excuse of «everybody else is like that» (even if a bare assumption). I am not surprised. Entire states like the Kingdom of Dahomey or the Aztec Empire or the Assyrian Empire were founded upon and were held together by the industry of mass converting the lives of their own denizens—as well as those of their captive nations—into wealth. The Early Modern era colonial powers like Britain, Spain or the Netherlands—or the somehow no longer reviled Romans of old—apparently belong to the same club.  It's just that justifying this in 2022 seems to me a terribly vile standpoint, and even by the moral standards of the early XXth century Stalin seemed like a prodigy in evil that would put Hitler to shame.  Like killing off thousands of non-Russian citizens (Poles, Koreans, German Communist immigrants, etc.) merely because they had the potential of a culture medium for spies from said minorities' mother nations hostile to the USSR?  Gunning down millions of ethnic Russians on anonymous tips?  Secretly executing orphanage kids who got there because their dads were earlier executed on bogus charges and mums perished in death camps sent there as convicted ЧСИРs?  What kind of mundane, materialistic good could be the justification?  Русня! Вы — охуевшие звери, и ваши кукареки про «оправданность» и «эффективность» действий Сталина — лучшее тому доказательство. Никто из вас бы не отдал бы по своей воле мать, отца или детей на удобрения для целины «ради блага всей страны», а вот когда речь про соседей по лестничной клетке — всегда пожалуйста!	removed	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431937]

I don't code for work (yet) actually. I'm just a hobbyist (though if this project is successful, then I'll certainly put it in my portfolio.) There are two reasons I chose Clojure:  1. On a more abstract level, the language "gets out of the way" and lets me focus on the problem and rather than the syntax or low-level minutiae. This is a pretty common sentiment among Clojure developers, and also quite relevant for me as a self-taught developer. (I would never be able to write a program in C, for example.) It's powerful and also very expressive, in that you can perform complex manipulations of data in just a few lines of code that are much more human-readable than most programming languages.   To cite examples from this task, `group-by` and `frequencies` are core library functions in Clojure. In Python, I think the equivalent is `itertools.group()` and for counting occurrences, you have to use `collections.Counter()` and it's not very obvious at all how it works (I only learned about it last month during Advent of Code 2021).  Also, REPL-driven development means that I can interact with data and test small parts of my program live in a terminal without repeatedly compiling it or running entire scripts.   2. More concretely, **ClojureScript.** I'd been doing stuff in Clojure on and off for quite a while, but never deployed a real app or released anything out "into the wild." I once used Python for the backend of a web app several years ago (when I only knew Python), which was fine, but dealing with the constantly-changing and overpopulated JavaScript ecosystem for frontend development was not fun.   I had heard that ClojureScript makes it possible to do full-stack development in (basically) the same single language. That is, CLJS transpiles to JS, so you can make stuff happen in the browser without writing a line of JS (a language that annoys me a lot). The development experience of Clojure/ClojureScript, once you get past the initial hurdle of setting everything up, is really smooth.  More specific to this particular post, the noun case thing is kind of a side task that came up as I was preparing the data. Perhaps it would have been faster for me to a write a script in Python to parse the XML files (and I actually did write one very quickly the other day to parse an OpenCorpora text file for noun gender information), but then the parsed data would still remain external to my program and I'd still have to import it. Using Clojure to parse the XML means that I can keep on parsing the data in different ways and the output is readily usable and already in the data structures that I need.  Hope that answers your question!	existing	existing	[0.6856801 0.3143199]

This is not more that just another news company from US (like Chemical weapons in Iraq, Russian influence on US elections, etc.). Just another lie. I'm not sure about the reason of exactly this lie, but I think this is to support US-military extra-budget after withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. May be Russia has some extra forces on the boarders (to prevent provocation against pro-Russian part of Ukraine for example), but we will not start operation first. No such support from locals as it was on 2014. Real risk of heavy sanctions. Putin is not an idiot. But constantly paying attention about what we should do with our army in our country is really piss-off everyone (and Putin as well), that is why he don't give an order to replace troops.	existing	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431898]

The reason why Jews are mentioned more frequently is they were the primary target of Hitler's extermination campaign. The commissar order which did kill a lot of slavs officially stated that communists, commissars, and any Jews would be killed.  To Nazis, a jew was equivalent to a Bolshevik. One of the main reasons why Hitler despised the slavs was he believed that the Jews controlled the "inferior slavic race"	removed	existing	[0.6856797 0.3143203]

Novichok's poisoning in the UK of the Russian traitor Skripal and his daughter is another clear case of Russophobia - believing that Russia would try to kill Skripal with a biological agent that was Russia's signature is absurd!

Here are the facts: 5 countries have new bioweapons labs:   USA, UK, Sweden, Poland and Czech Republic,   We've heard the same rubber stamp allegations - "very likely" that Russia is responsible, this has been repeated over and over and as Robert Parry points out, lies are repeated over and over in the MSM until they are simply accepted as fact , truth!

That perhaps is the case..  To enter Russia for any purpose, a U.S. citizen must possess a valid U.S. passport and a bona fide visa issued by a Russian Embassy or Consulate. ... Travelers who arrive in Russia without an entry visa will not be permitted to enter the country, and face immediate return to the point of embarkation at their own expense.  Russian Embassy..  In my regard the average person seeking travel in the US can not just go to Russia and see it for what it is unless like I said under specific circumstances such as a visa..  I can jump back and fourth over to Canada and America as long as I got a passport now Russians and Americans can’t do that to Russia and the US is my point.

I'm not going to tell you to avoid Duolingo but Duolingo shouldn't be your main time investment. You're not speaking the language nearly enough through Duolingo.  I also can't recommend Rosetta Stone. It's a huge waste of money in my opinion. It won't get you started, it'll teach you useless verbs and nouns in what seems like a random order.  If you want to speed up your Russian by paying a little bit of money I can highly recommend Pimsleur. It's a paid subscription app that'll get you speaking immediately and even after a few lessons you know basic sentences. It'll teach you the important stuff first and you'll feel fluent way quicker than the other apps.  I'm not affiliated with Pimsleur, I'm just a big fan. I wasted a lot of time and money on the other apps before really picking up the language using Pimsleur.  The reason I like it is that I commute a lot by car as my job so the 30 minute spoken lessons are perfect for me. It won't teach you to read as well as other approaches, but it'll get you speaking. As for reading you can supplement with Duolingo or buy a book aimed at Russian novices and just spell your way through it.  That being said Russian Made Easy is a perfect starting point, and he has a beginner course for free.	existing	existing	[0.68567866 0.31432134]

Get a textbook with structured lessons (vocab+grammar with audio) with increasing difficulty. Beware of books that force you to learn whole phrases without understanding what its words mean separately and why they have their exact endings. Linguistics manuals aren't good either. It should have exercises with keys too. You will need a help of a native speaker from the beginning, because books don't talk and Russian pronunciation will seem ridiculously hard unless you can speak Polish.   Forget about unadapted movies and books , you have to dive deep into Grammar and linguistic stuff. Learning apps should be an addition to your learning plan, but not its core.	existing	existing	[0.6856794  0.31432068]

(ISS) is a joint international project involving 14 countries, including: the USA, Russia, Canada, Japan, as well as several European countries acting under the auspices of the European Space Agency. Its design began in 1984, with the order of US President Ronald Reagan, who ordered NASA to develop and build a new orbital space station in 10 years. By the beginning of the 90s, it became clear that the scale and high cost of the project would not allow the United States to create it on its own. The actual construction of the station began in 1998, when Russia, which joined the project, launched the first element of the ISS, the Zarya functional cargo block, into orbit.  Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and American astronaut Robert Cabana were the first to board it.   On July 26, 2000, the Zvezda service module docked with the FGB. It is these three nodes that have become the basic blocks for the start of space cooperation for more than a dozen countries of the world.   In order to fully fulfill their mission, Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd underwent four years of training and education at NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City and at the training center in Munich in Germany to refine the technology conducting many scientific experiments.   Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd established contact with mission control centers in Korolev and Houston. The ISS-1 crew ensured the docking of Progress M1-4 cargo ships in November 2000 and Progress M-44 cargo ships in February 2001 with the station. They also met American shuttles on the ISS - Endeavor in December 2000, Atlantis in February and Discovery in March 2001. In February 2001, the first crew of the ISS assisted in the integration of the American laboratory module Destiny into the ISS.	removed	existing	[0.68568146 0.3143185 ]

It makes sense though.  Biden is compd by Ukraine and this goes way back, Hunter, Maidan, everything.   China released a bio weapon with Covid and interfered in the 2020 election.  If the rumors are true that Biden isn't really in charge, and there are competing factions in the U.S. in charge, then the theory that they will build up troops together in Ukraine, then to force China's hand together somehow.  And in exchange for that, the U.S. clearly grants the concessions Putin wants about NATO, which Trump largely supported. Possibly even Germany is on board, that's why they won't allow simple things to pass through them to get to Ukraine.	existing	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431895]

Saddam kept the isis in check and executed most of the terrorists, but after the US invasion everything went to shit and ISIS stated regaining control, and guess what, the first thing to be privatised after the invasion was Iraqi _oil_.	existing	existing	[0.6856803 0.3143196]

''There's a really simple way for NATO to stop driving Ukraine into Russia's arms: leave it alone.

I get that English is probably not your first language, so now and then things can get a bit lost. But at least have the intellectual honesty to admit that to yourself and ask what I meant.   If you can answer me why the NATO countries would want to force a war with Russia and are the aggressors here please explain, because to me it seems that most European countries are divided and there is no universal 'push against Russia'. The build up of European troops and materials has only happened AFTER Russia has been starting to amass troops there. Does Russia fear an invasion?  &#x200B;  Explain to me why it is impossible that Russia is the aggressor and why they would have no benefit in taking Ukraine, and tell me how NATO countries are the aggressor and what benefit they have of it, including how  the conflicting stances of EU countries align with that assessment.	removed	existing	[0.6856793 0.3143207]

okay it's a bit hard to explain, maybe someone will do it better. увидеть is a single finished action, so "я хочу увидеть тебя" implies that it is important to the speaker to be able to see the other person once again, even if it's for a brief moment. "я хочу тебя видеть" is also a correct phrasing, but видеть is unfinished, and it implies a longer, almost endless action. i'd say the second one is more poetic, and the first one is more common and it's what you would hear in an everyday life. we can also say "я хочу увидеться с тобой", which is the same as the first one	existing	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431916]

My comment wasn’t meant to be a pissing match.  I detest my country (or rather it’s government and ideals) and wish that I hadn’t been born here.  The US federal government spends 10 times what your country does in a single year on its military, becoming a factor of over 100 each decade.  How is anyone supposed to compete with that?  The Russian Air Force is significantly smaller, doesn’t have the ability to project power from the ocean, and would run out of supplies after weeks of heavy intensity conflict.  I’m pretty sure this info is available from your own government.  How do you think Russian tanks would do against an endless stream of drones?  I’ve heard the six drones that Turkey gave Ukraine have given ground forces in Eastern Ukraine quite the hard time.  The US has thousands of them.  As far as US cities burning down due to disorder (this was mostly a lie pushed by the media, I live in one of the cities that saw police cars burnt and large scale rioting/looting…just the poor areas got messed up and they’re already filled with open air drug dealing and violent crime) and honestly I think everyone would be so scared about an impending nuclear apocalypse, that this would be a fairly unifying war.  Even if it wasn’t, it wouldn’t last long regardless of who won and I don’t know if you’ve ever looked up how many people the US throws into prison (a lot more than Russia or China…the real land of the free🙄) but our government would have no real problem crushing dissent.  They’ve done it many times before over far less.    Russia is better at going further with what they spend on their military.  It seems they’ve developed a lot of technology and tactics to help circumvent the US/NATO advantage.  A small theater war is something Russia could definitely win if they achieved objectives quickly enough but Russia does not have the resources to fight a direct war for long.  This entire scenario is unrealistic anyway.  Russia and the US will never fight a direct war.  Either side would likely resort to their strategic nuclear arms as soon as they felt they were loosing, if not starting the war with them.  Russia definitely has the advantage there (mobile ICBMs with solid-fuel boosters that can fire on short notice) but probably not to the extent where both countries wouldn’t permanently cease to exist.  Let’s just hope it never gets there and we don’t have to find out who’s right, yeah?  I’ve liked the large majority of Russian folks I’ve known (lots of people from there and other Eastern European former Soviet Republics like Belarus and Ukraine around my area/neighborhood) and have probably spent more time reading about Russian/Soviet history than I have about my own.  I think my own country has done more to escalate this situation with Ukraine than Russia has, hopefully it cools down.	existing	existing	[0.6856803  0.31431967]

Interestingly, the Palmer Raids took place in 1919-20, and the patent is from 1980s. Do you know how old was he when he got arrested? And what was the name of his father? Because the author of the patent is Konstantin Nikolaevich Marmysh, meaning that his father was Nikolay. Also, if you search with Yandex for "Мармыш Константин Николаевич" , there are some traces of leaked databases that point to Konstantin Nikolaevich Marmysh, born 1925, who lived in Minsk. The latter seems a more fitting candidate for authoring a patent in the 1980s, than the one who got arrested in 1919-20.	existing	existing	[0.6856794  0.31432068]

HAHAHAHAHAHA   BBC Fake News!!!!   BBC Cookbook: British fakers are torn between lies, self-censorship and secret duty!!!!   The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC admitted that filming the aftermath of the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma in April 2018 is nothing more than a staging. However, the staging is bloody - since the virtual "chemical attack" of Bashar al-Assad became the reason for another US cruise missile attack on Syria!   The search for "Russian influence", like obsessive Russophobia, has become a trademark of BBC news stories.   when the theme of the “hand of the Kremlin” began to be pedaled in his materials in the French anti-government speeches of the “yellow vests”. Earlier, Olga Ivshina, correspondent of the BBC Russian Service, admitted in a personal correspondence with one of the Russian correspondents in Paris that the channel’s management requires any evidence of “Russian interference” in the “yellow vests” protests in France from employees.   “The editors demand blood,” Ivshina told the stringer.   By the way, this is the same Ivshina who was noted in the story of the Boeing MH-17 flight crash in the sky over the Donbass and the subsequent BBC self-censorship. In her report from the crash site, she blabbed that local residents saw combat Ukrainian aircraft in the sky shortly before the crash.   As a result, this video was very quickly removed from the BBC Russian Service website under the pretext of "imperfect structure and due to incomplete compliance with editorial values." Not a fake - but a very characteristic feature of the British handling of information.   In order to fabricate the material required by the BBC management, Ivshina unashamedly admits that "the editors are demanding blood." The situation turned out to be so hopeless that she began to sort out the most absurd options.   Even before Trump's official inauguration, the BBC released a full-length "investigative journalism" with the telling title "Trump: the Kremlin's candidate?". In it, British journalist John Sweeney, known for his anti-Russian views, poured all the hodgepodge of rumors about Trump onto the heads of viewers, including the alleged “KGB compromising evidence” on him, thoughtful sophistication about the location of the Miss Universe pageant, and Trump’s love for Eastern European girls. All this was interspersed with statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin.   “I'm really surprised that the BBC is broadcasting fake news. There is no news."   This phrase was said in February 2017 by the head of the UK Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, leaving the BBC Breakfast program with Charlie State.   The BBC is just one of the elements, and far from the most dangerous. Goebbels, however, did such things better than the Anglo-Saxons and the BBC are doing now.

These issues can't be separated from anything else. In my opinion, Russia has huge potential. But it's wasted on confrontation and dumb things. We should be trying to take over the world economically and culturally. But instead of that we're trying to take over Ukraine and letting our corrupt politicians and oligarchs to take over our country. All things protected and built by our great ancestors belongs to oligarchs now. Things like Norilsk Nikel and Magnitogorsk MMK was built by generations of soviet people whose grandchildren live in (or close to) poverty now. Even our "great culture" now belongs to a bunch of wank stains who can gatekeep everything. And the country is moving to be even more closed and more authoritarian. And it will make all that terrible people richer and the population even poorer. Saint-Petersburg will be filled with trash continuously from now on.

You understood nothing of what I wanted to convey with my answer, let me explain it better so you get my point straigth this time.  1) Both Russia and US/NATO are doing this kind of stuff for political reason, as I stated in my previous reply "It is true that both NATO and US did bad things" I do not think that NATO is sinless, quite the opposite, but the same could be said for the russian governament (I do not want to say russians, because there is a difference between one country's population and governament).  2) Ukrainians should be free to do whatever they want, if they want to join the NATO or the EU they should be free to do so. If they want to have more close relations with Russia, than they should do that, they are free to do whatever they want.   3) As I stated here ("and the fact that they prefer to stand with NATO and EU says a lot about Ukranian-Russian relationships.") it seems to me that the russian governament doesn't really have a diplomatic way to approch this kind of problem with Ukraine, and the only thing it can do is to blame the West and use hard manners. If instead of invading and provoking Ukraine in the past Russia had done otherwise maybe we wouldn't have this kind of situation now.  4) Both Europe and Russia do not need another silly war just because of some political reasons and tension between Russian and the US. Let Ukraine decide where to stand and let's avoid another useless loss of blood and people.  Bonus) I'm in no way russophobic, I do like russian people and culture, I used to study russian to be able to speak with them. Anyway, I do make a clear distinction between the russian people and the russian governament. While I do not like what the russian governament is doing, I enjoy russian traditions and speaking with people from the biggest nation on Earth. I have nothing against russians, they are great people, and I'm sure that most of them just want to live in peace with all the rest of Europe.  Please feel free to respond, but keep in mind that just because people are from the EU/USA doesn't mean we are brain dead and we just follow blindly what our media tells us, quite the opposite. Anyone has its personal opinion about what it is happeing, but saying that disagreeing with what the russian governament is doing is "russophobic" is just bs imho.	removed	existing	[0.6856798  0.31432024]

Loved labor and PE classes at my school. And literature, too. Every summer, we had a huge list of books that we were required to read and then had to write an essay for one of them at teacher's choice in September. Also, in grades 9-11 instead of labor classes at school, we had assigned day to visit УПК- учебно производственный комбинат ( i think, in English, this would be speciality / trade college?). We were free to choose from the list of disciples such as : shoemaker, driver, automechaniks, baby sitter, welding, sewing and sculpting. I've selected automechaniks, but got transferred to driver section in grade 10 due to age. They had a rule that of you turn 17 by the time of graduation, then you can just go to the local DMV , pass exams and get your DL. normally, in Russia, they require some classes at driver's school to be completed. But since it was a part of my curriculum, i just went to testing site, passed it and got my DL early. That was really cool. Also, used to know the guy who liked welding so much that before he even graduated he already knew what to do after. He now has a welding business	existing	existing	[0.6856818  0.31431824]

The font you've shown is a regular antiqua (a serif font). Italics in those are usually modeled after the handwritten shapes, but not connected. So just pick any antiqua that has Cyrillic & Italics (Garamond, Times New Roman, Baskerville, whatever - there are hundreds).

My country ALREADY covered more than 10% of it's gas needs with “cheeper gas from the US” in order to “brake it's dependence on Gasprom”, but in reality this just ended up being six times more expensive and completely inefficient because as it turns out several ships traversing more than 1/4 of the world globe make a steady and constant supply flow to cover the needs of one whole country.  It was so inefficient in fact that that at end we just gave up and sided “alternative gas contract” with Azerbaijan.	existing	existing	[0.68568146 0.31431854]

Well, of course you'll need to know a handful of words before you start with the grammar. :) Russian grammar has six cases, or six ways in which each word can decline. It's generally recommended to learn one case at a time. It's a lot to take in--depending on how much you study and how quickly you take to it, it can take months or years to get a firm grasp on them.  I did see a B&B video where he says you don't need grammar, but I might point out that directly afterward, he rattles off a bunch of grammatical terms and does the declension of a few words as an example. I get his point--your grammar doesn't have to be perfect. ...And don't worry, it won't be, even when you're trying really hard! XD  Grammar is actually your friend. If nouns, adjectives, and verbs are your boards, nails, and glue, then grammar is your toolbox full of hammers and saws. You can try to drive a nail into the board with your hands or forehead, but in the long run it's much easier to learn to use what's in the toolbox. :D	existing	existing	[0.68567866 0.31432134]

**[Yury A. Dmitriev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_A._Dmitriev)**     >Yury Alexeyevich Dmitriev Юрий Алексеевич Дмитриев (born 28 January 1956, Petrozavodsk) is a civil rights activist and local historian in Karelia (Northwest Russia). Since the early 1990s, he has worked to locate the execution sites of Stalin's Great Terror in Karelia and, through work in the archives, to identify as many as possible of the buried victims they contain. He has worked continually since the late 1980s to compile "Books of Remembrance" for Karelia, listing all the names of those executed there. On 13 December 2016 Dmitriev was arrested and charged with making pornographic images of his foster daughter, Natasha, who was 11 at the time.   **Sandarmokh**     [New digs, an alternative hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandarmokh#New_digs,_an_alternative_hypothesis)     >Starting in 2016, there were attempts to revise this account of the shootings at Sandarmokh, and claim that among the dead were Soviet POWs shot by the invading Finns in 1941-1944. There were newspaper articles and TV broadcasts in Russia; there was also a publication in the Finnish press. In the same year, a highly controversial sexual abuse probe against Yury Dmitriyev was  launched by authorities. The motivation behind this claim and the supposed new evidence were both challenged.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	existing	existing	[0.68567586 0.31432417]

FWIW, I've seen a video of a woman who learned Russian and recommended the "method". It does make sense.  On the other hand, as one above comment said, stresses from Pushkin's time aren't 100% like today's. Though I'd estimate number of the differences is not that significant.  Truth be told, I don't think many people would read that much poetry to learn the correct accentuation spontaneously from it. E.g. I got accustomed to older prescribed accentuation in my native language only by reading a 19th century translation of Homer, so like 30k lines of poetry. God knows how much Pushkin you'd have to read to "develop an ear" for it.  I guess poetry is a great method if you enjoy it. And if you're at the level where you're still not sure how to stress "Наша Таня громко плачет", your overall knowledge might be limited enough to prevent much enjoyment. But it's up to you to try and find out. Either way, there should be enough simpler prose texts out there with marked accents, so if you can't follow poetry (which almost by definition uses more difficult language than prose, vocabulary- and syntax-wise) you still can practice accents. Besides, audio books and films and songs are also a good way to expose yourself to accents.  If you do want to try poetry, start with Pushkin and Lermontov and maybe some newer poets, and see how it suits you. I recommend leaving "silver age" (серебянный век) poets for later, they're very difficult IMO.  As for your description of the trochees, usually it's not that simple. The metrical feet do not have to correspond to words, or even to the natural stress entirely. An example from Pushkin:  >Мне мил и виноград на лозах  This is iambic tetrameter (четырёхстопный ямб, 4x combination of unstressed-stressed; in this case the verse is hypercatalectic, i.e. it has an additional unstressed syllable at the end). The natural stresses go:  >Мне **мил** и вино**град** на **ло**зах  but the meter goes:  >Мне **мил** и **ви**но**град** на **ло**зах  So, one word carries two metrical stresses, but only one grammatical. There are different explanations for why that works, why it still sounds like a regular verse, I'm not sure which is currently taken as the best, but either way I hope it illustrates how metrical regularity behaves. Consequently, you cannot discern exactly which syllable in "vinograd" is to be stressed if you've only read the verse, it might be either the first or the last one - you still need to know how the word is pronounced by itself. You won't ruin the rhythm of the poem if you stress the first syllable, but you still won't learn the correct one.	existing	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431946]
If you believe you will never know the truth, then you won't, because you will give up looking (and corrupt politicians like this).   If you believe you will find the truth, then you will find the one you like, and stop there, because you're happy with it. But it might not be truth. Corrupt politicians can work with this.   If you keep digging for the real truth, no matter what it costs you, you will die as a martyr. Because the politicians will hate you. All of them. Because all of them are corrupt. It's what they do.  Power corrupts, absolute power is kinda neat. And to become a politician one must enjoy power.  Ultimately, they don't want you to be curious.   But if everyone is curious, then there are too many martyrs for them to kill or put behind bars.   They don't like that, because we outnumber them, and that forces them to steal less and do more. They don't like that at all. It smells like a guillotine and gives them nightmares.  As to debates, they are rarely pleasant. They might not be good for you, but they might be good for all of us, as a class. They help the truth come out.

What I'll say is an unpopular opinion, but it seems pretty reasonable for me.   The whole Russia-Ukraine thing is about Putin's rating here, in Russia. The whole time of Putin's presidency (And Medvedev's too, he's just Putin's puppet) I hear same story from media - "US is an enemy, NATO is an enemy, everyone who says otherwise is an American spy". Many people believe this, as you can see above.   Putin is trying to switch people's focus from his poor inner policies to his poor outer policies, demonising EU and US in every way possible. Thanks to most Russians being racist and homophobic (not without media's help), he is successful at that. He succeeded in 2013-2014, annexing Crimea, so people were crying "Крым наш" in extase. Now he's trying to intimidate US and EU leaders showing off military power, and scare his own people with war, so nothing will be in the way of reelecting him in 2024.   Will he actually attack? No, that's suicide for him. Maybe little provocations to keep situation hot, and whole world hating us, so media could keep saying "look, everyone is against us, only Putin can save us".      Also, amount of fake news here is overwhelming. Sometimes it's obviously fake, but many still believe in this BS.	existing	existing	[0.68568003 0.31431997]
An honest question to Russians here. Do you honestly think the west wants to see Russia invade Ukraine? This would be devastating for Ukraine, Russia’s economy and would affect the entire world economy.   Putin has made a big miscalculation, even just the cost of the massive buildup along the border hurts Russia. Europe hasn’t been this united in defensive posture against Russia since the Cold War era.   Europe will now increase military build ups, NATO now has gained momentum and power. Putin miscalculated the unity of western nations and NATO. Perhaps he forgot that the Trump era is over.   If Putin changes course and walks back this blunder we all win. Americans don’t want Russian people to suffer from the effects of strong international sanctions against Russia based on the whims of a single man’s ego.   Russians deserve better than Yeltsin and Putin. Putin is strong but he has anointed himself as a czar and lives like an oligarch. He could have used his strength to build  Russia for its people but he has chosen to strengthen oligarchs and enrich himself.   I know we have similar problems in America, we are often hypocritical but at least we are able to voice our displeasure with the corruption of our leaders to try and change their behavior.   I wish you all peace and hope this doesn’t bring on tough times for your citizens and those of Ukraine.	removed	existing	[0.6856798 0.3143202]

The sentence I gave you might not be the best example, since it's a basic sentence and I know how you're supposed to say that correctly. What I mean I guess is that even if I have to write single words like for example "France" I would do something like this:  F = Фr = рa = аn = нc = ц (closest one I can think of)e = е  Which would be wrong, since I'm checking you're supposed to write it like this: Франция and not Франце  So yeah, I guess what gives me the most trouble are the letters that we have in the latin alphabet that are not in the cyrillic one (like our C, or W) and also the "new" cyrillic letters to which I'm not fully familiarized yet.	existing	existing	[0.6856784  0.31432155]
>But they are many companies doing business in Russia , I'm sure it doesn't have to go badly...  I don't think anyone is saying it will go badly, more that it's just a whole new can of worms when you deal with another country's labor laws (and then you being a foreigner on top of that.) Being a foreigner running the business could also open you up to scrutiny from authorities and scammers (people wanting to take advantage of you not knowing the ropes.)   How is your Russian language? If not fluent, you might want to consider hiring a professional translator as well. I wouldn't rely on friends, better to get someone you sign a contract with, that way if someone makes a mistake, you can hold them accountable. In the rare case you ended up in court, a court-appointed translator would be provided but they're not usually that great and probably better to have someone you trust/have an established relationship with.  You can ask your tax pro and lawyer about [СНИЛС](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNILS_(Russia)) (Russian social security program basically) because if you are working/running a business in Russia, you need that, even as a foreigner.	existing	existing	[0.6856788  0.31432122]

"They" are hinting at a Crima style "save the oppressed ethnicity" kind of operation in another strategic region.  No country needs permission to amass its troops by the border, but given recent history, Russian threatening rhetoric and the drive Russia has shown to de-estabilize by any means necessary the status quo in the western bloc, people are obviously suspicious of what may happen next.  I mean other countries like the US and China do that using similar methods, that's true, but to try and whitewash Russia's aggressive, disruptive foreign policy under the guise of "muh western media brainwashing" is questionable at best.	removed	existing	[0.6856816  0.31431836]

Okay, vaccinated guy here.  There are 2 large group of people that stand against vaccination. One are those true-antivaxers that believe that vaccine causes some illnesses like all the spread from infertility to cancer or it's underdeveloped or not tested enough. They don't believe statistics (nor Russian, nor from those countries that buy or produce our vaccine). Inside this group there's also subgroup of undereducated people which believes they install a microchip inside you or you gonna die because of 5G or simply die in two years because of vaccine.  Other group stands against vaccination because of political reason. They just don't do that because it's Putin's vaccine and they don't do that just to annoy him. Partially people of this group are actually ready to take vaccine but those like Pfiser or so and they are angry about not having a choice.	existing	existing	[0.6856816  0.31431836]
It's inaccurate to say that they have evidence if all they have is what their intelligence told them. But it is also silly to demand a proof. Obviously they cannot say how that information was obtained without endangering the source. Ultimately it all boils down to how credible the US government is and how competent their intelligence is. Definitely not pristine history, but compared to Russian government (Putin denying with a straight face that he has anything to do with the little green men is a classic) they are credible. Their intelligence is probably the best in the world. I also fail to see what they could have to gain from lying about this. Nobody is putting any sanctions before something actually happens anyway. The only real thing that we have so far is the build-up of Russian troops on the border.	removed	existing	[0.68568134 0.31431863]

"У меня осталось" is used with an object of possession (even if that object is abstract, like amount of time) -- it's a special case of the more general "у меня (есть)", a common way to express possession of something in Russian.  "Мне осталось" can be used with an action or an object. Thus, you could say: "Мне осталось восемь дней", but not "У меня осталось только упаковать...", because "упаковать" is an action, not an object.	existing	existing	[0.68568027 0.3143198 ]

According to wussy leftists in the media here in America, anything that doesn't involve mollycodding, "participation trophies", and glorifying mediocrity in the name of diversity is "abuse". Failures and disgraces shouldn't get comfort. The Russian team sacrificed a ton to the IOC to appeal to her to stay, even after further media scrutiny and international humiliations, at the risk of even undermining the integrity of the Olympics as a whole. And Valieva rewarded them by creating further media spectacles, put in a catastrophic and humiliating performance (I felt sorry for Eteri), and diverted attention from Shcherbakova (the drug-free champion).

Probably because moving supplies from USA to Kabul was entirely contingent on Pakistan as opposed to the land border the USSR shared.

It's a fundamentally different situation and we both know this. I admire the communists attempts of creating an egalitarian society in Afghanistan. I'm a closet socialist in AMerica.

Simply put the difference between the two is that ты is informal and used with someone younger or that you know. Вы is formal so you'd use it with older people or people that you don't know.   As someone else said, it can also be used ironically. I've noticed that Russians will use вы to someone they know on purpose if they're pissed at them. It's kind of like using someone's full name in English (Jeffrey instead of Jeff) when you're peeved at them. Spouses will do it to show the other person that they're not super happy at them or to a kid who maybe thinks he's older than he is.	existing	existing	[0.68567866 0.31432128]

It's pretty good for the first time, although you do have some mistakes!  &#x200B;  First, sometimes half of a letter disappears when you connect two letters. For example, in "Катюша" your "ш" merged into "а". In the word "выходила", "л" merged into "а". Try to write the letter completely and then connect it to another.  &#x200B;  You seem to confuse "и" with "й". These are different letters and you can't put that little mark above every "и".  &#x200B;  Sometimes your "о" looks like "а" when it's at the end of a word. For example, the last two "Про" look like "Пра", whereas the first looks correct.  &#x200B;  You'll get even better pretty soon if you practice regularly!	existing	existing	[0.68567824 0.31432182]

Lol the biasedness and the political agenda is strong with this one. I am not a supporter of the 5 eyes or the imperialism of the west myself, but insinuating Russia or China to be better the west shows your biasedness.   Parroting Putin's "historic and cultural experience" as a legitimate reason to conquer Crimea while ignoring international law, hell even criticizing legality altogether, shows you're spewing agenda.  If you think the sinocentric worldview consists of "harmonious relationship", then you don't understand what harmony even is. China uses its dominance to achieve that shroud of harmony. Seeing you celebrating "status hierarchies" also shows that dumbness of yours.   It's very clear that Russia and China are worse than the west, even US in most regards. To support their imperialism while making fun of legalities that oppose that imperialism is peak bootlicking.	removed	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431946]

> You my friend are an exception, until the last couple of years, I was largely taught the Soviet horde myth by television and school.  I dunno what you're watching because I watch tons of documentaries and WWII movies and didn't really see that as widespread doctrine. What I did see was underequipped (generally not rifle wise as portrayed in Enemy at the gates) Russian forces, especially early in the war, in far superior numbers go against German army's and get beaten back. Not all the time, but some of the time. It's not a secret that Germans at the start of the war had better weapons, training, strategy and more supplies.   So seeing Russian forces lose with much larger numbers on the battlefield field and experiencing much higher casualties is not really a myth. It's also not the whole picture of the whole war either. By the end of the war the Russians were pumping out great tanks in the T-34 and other designs, had better strategies to counter the Germans, and frankly steamrolled them all the way back to Berlin.   But to deny that there were battles, especially early in the war in which the Russians had far more people, and lost to much smaller German forces due to inferior weapons and tactics is just denying history. We only learn from history when we study the good and the bad. Not just that which makes us feel proud of ourselves and our people.	removed	existing	[0.68567955 0.31432045]
Well, Russia wasn't meh prior to 1917. It was the largest country and it was growing fast in economic terms. 1917 wasn't even the lowest point. The lowest was 1922 after WWI and Civil War Russia lost sizable territory and its economy and industry was in shambles. The reforms of Lenin and Stalin brought Russia back to super power level.      Main ones were education. Russia built its own technical intelligentsia from peasants. Building heavy industry and infrastructure by any means possible. That's one of the reason for famines. However, agricultural reforms ended famine cycle that was common in Eastern Europe at that time.	existing	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431937]

Funnily enough,  you're argument works for ukraine as well. Their army,  their country. So if they want to buy military supplies,  they are free to do so.   The problem is,  however,  that stationing your 100.000 troops on the border with a smaller country which you have previously invaded,  and parts of which are under occupation,  tend to escalate the situation.	removed	existing	[0.68567854 0.3143214 ]

There's also a slightly earlier Simonov's [poem](https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:%D0%A3%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE.jpg#mw-jump-to-license), which contains:  >Так убей же немца, чтоб он,  >А не ты, на земле лежал.  This poem has been edited post-war because Simonov didn't want to advocate killing anyone, so he changed the title and replaced all mentions of Germans with fascists.	existing	existing	[0.68568027 0.3143198 ]

Well the reality is that the average person (and user on Reddit) doesn’t have any sway on foreign policy or war efforts.  The sentiment here means next to nothing if the actions of a country contradict them.    The entire “war is coming” sentiment is justified based on the actions we’ve seen.  If people think literal war in Europe is coming, perhaps the responding anti war movements will tamper it.	removed	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431952]

At no point did I even remotely hint to that.    But the casualties before 1941 (the point where Soviet and Nazi Germany became enemies) and after 1945 where not committed by German Nazis.  If you check that at a certain date the population should be X and it turns out it significantly less than that then its hard to distinguish when or where that happened. The official sources claim 1.5 - 1.8 million died in Gulags but that number is extremely uncertain and not every political "dissident" lived to see a Gulag. Not to mention starvation in the 1930's and post war (which could be seen as Nazi casualties).    Is this making things clearer for you?      I do not think Nazis wanted to ethnically cleanse the Soviet Union much like the Soviet did not want to cleanse Poland. But the treatment of the civilian population and captured armed forces where extremely cruel and harsh.	removed	existing	[0.6856794  0.31432062]

I mean it’d be great if the world could just move past pretending like any western country should have any genuine interest in invading another of its neighbors ever again. I don’t really understand Russia’s concern over Ukraine and NATO, *at least* with respect to the understanding that there really isn’t any world on which the US or NATO members have any interest in threatening Russia’s territorial integrity.  It genuinely confuses me why Russia and the West still insist on being enemies. Seems like it’s purely habit and Putin’s dream of building a larger territorial empire. Again, maybe this is just ignorant of me to say, but what the hell does anyone care anymore? Not to be provocative, but there’s not much excuse for annexing new territory in Europe in this era.  If leaders (especially Putin) could chill out and just focus on productive trade and cultural relations, what the hell should anyone be worried about. Putin says it’s just western scaremongering but putting 100k troops on the border is pretty overt and doesn’t reasonably look like anything other than a pending invasion. That’s the way it’s always worked.   My longstanding belief is that Russia and the West should be allies. Seems this isn’t the case for literally no other reason than stupidity and tribalism.	removed	existing	[0.6856781  0.31432188]

I worked for a passenger transport company in 2014-2021. In a city with a population of less than a million, but according to experts by the suburbs and migrants (they live in my city, but are registered in other places), the population is about a million.   The industry is in a difficult state for a variety of reasons.   1. Low fare due to low purchasing power. Until 2015-2016 (I don't remember exactly) in my city, the fare was set by the city administration. The city administration raised the fare only with the permission of the governor. And there was always a reason not to raise prices - so as not to increase social discontent. Now many routes have the right to set their own prices for travel, but still no one raises them without the permission of the administration.   At the same time, the cost of fuel and bus maintenance is growing faster than the price of travel.   2. The high cost of buses. High-capacity buses have not been updated in my city for about 15-20 years. They are too expensive and do not pay for themselves at a low fare. Medium and small capacity buses are being bought, but they are still very expensive in recent years.   3. High requirements for transport security. Installing equipment that should be legally so expensive that many owners of transport companies prefer to pay fines for its absence is cheaper. Regulatory authorities have the right to suspend the company's activities altogether for lack of equipment, but prefer to issue fines. Someday they will be given an order and they will start banning the activities of infringing companies.   4. Many owners created their companies in 1990-2000, when the passenger transportation market was wild, many rules did not apply, and they now do not understand why they now have to comply with something there (a stupid position, but it is so). Only local carrier companies travel in my city. And if a modern company from Moscow came here, with money for new transport, no local carrier would stand up to competition.   5. There is a huge shortage of driver workers in the passenger transportation industry. They are paid little, so they go to other industries. They pay little because the fare is low. Because there are not enough drivers, drivers work longer than allowed by law. This affects safety.   Because there are few drivers, they hire everyone, so the driving culture of bus drivers is very low.   6. Insurance. Each bus is insured twice - OSGOP (passenger insurance) and OSAGO (liability insurance). Without them, the bus should not travel on the road. For an insurance company, OSAGO insurance of a passenger company is unprofitable, because according to statistics, they pay insurance payments more than they receive profits. And that's why companies illegally refuse to issue OSAGO insurance. Despite the decisions of the courts and the supervisory authorities. It is also cheaper for them to pay a fine than to execute the decision. Every year there is a problem - where to insure. You have to pay bribes for the right to insure the bus.   7. Transportation is carried out on the basis of a contract with the city. The right to conclude a contract is played out at a competition. The contract is very strict, it is impossible to fulfill all its norms, for any violation the contract can be terminated. The city administration prefers not to terminate the contract for every violation, but to keep all your violations as a way to control you. these violations are taken out of the cloth as soon as you decide to sue the city administration (there are also a lot of violations on their part).   In general, the city administration is trying to make sure that nothing changes, it doesn't get worse. It is possible to do better, but this requires decisive measures to organize the transport network. there is no money in the city budget for this.  So far this is all I remember, I can answer the questions.	existing	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431922]

Sputnik is the Russian covid-19 vaccine. Other worldwide options include pfizer, astrazeneca etc.   I ask because, depending on what you want to do in Moscow, a lot of places will only let you in if you are vaccinated with sputnik and have the required QR code you get when vaccinated.   This rule is enforced for restaurants, museums, cinemas, shops and anywhere else really. Some shops, cinemas and restaurants might accept a foreign vaccine and let you in anyway, but you can't bank on that all the time and anything state run like museums won't let you in.	existing	existing	[0.68567973 0.31432027]

When I moved to Russia from the States, I had one large carry-on and checked four luggage items and just paid the fees because it was cheaper and more convenient than having it all shipped.  I'm a musician though and so the majority of my baggage were oversized Pelican and ATA flight cases with analog synthesizers and studio equipment.  It's all sensitive and valuable electronics and everything arrived safely.  I would never have anything valuable mailed.  It's a real hassle to arrange the pick-up and yeah, I had to pay customs fees for receiving even the smallest of items. I've been living here for 3 years and have been back to the States twice, where each time I pick up more of my gear to bring back on a flight and pay the extra baggage fees.  I travel with my wife though and through Delta we each get one checked luggage item for free. Not sure how it is with your sporting gear, but it's difficult and expensive to find the same make and brands of outdoor equipment here.  I'd recommend leaving whatever clothing behind to make room for your other items that you want to have with you.  It's easy and cheap to get your wardrobe outfitted again here.	existing	existing	[0.685681   0.31431904]

For me it is pretty simple. I tend to use "ты", and not only in the internet but in general unless I want to put some borders. If you start communicating with anyone using "вы" it would be quite difficult to switch back, so it is quite useless for making friends. A person always using "вы" seems like the one who doesn't want any friends (and probably doesn't have any, being such a dick, lol). Although when you talk to any support, employees at stores, waiters, etc, it is more common to use "вы" since you clearly have borders in your relationships.	existing	existing	[0.68567866 0.31432134]

Once in Turkey in an all inclusive restaurant, in the year of 2011 or 2012 i was hearing people on the neighbouring table speaking a language that sounded like Russian - same intonations and sounds, though i wasn't hearing the exact words. It has to be mentioned that 80% of the guests were Russians, so i just subconsciously assumed they were Russians, so i asked for salt because there wasn't any salt in our table. The guy that i addressed to just went silent, and didn't event turn his head. I repeated my question a little louder so that he and his friends heard me for sure, but again the guys were looking at him, and he wasn't responding. I was confused and mumbled some excuses in English when a girl that was sitting there just passed me the salt. I thanked her and used the salt, listening closely to which language they were talking and they continued to speak Ukrainian.  So i think that's the story you wanted to hear	existing	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431898]

My dear European friend, do you know the history?   maybe you are afraid to speak or in the west it is forbidden to know and remember the history of the west?   how was NATO created? - this will be the next course of history (if you ask me to tell you)   But let's start in order, who fought for Hitler and the Wehrmacht?   The answer is the whole "civilized democratic" fascist Europe!   Every year on June 22, we remember the sad date:   On that tragic day, a war began between the great Eurasian power - the USSR and another coalition of European states, since, together with the Wehrmacht, the troops of Romania, Finland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria, in total 15 European countries invaded the territory of the USSR !!!   Russians will never forget this historical memory!   you forgot to mention the other armies of Europe!   Who fought for Hitler and the Wehrmacht?   The answer is the whole "civilized democratic" fascist Europe!   In total, more than 3.5 million people from 15 European countries fought in the Wehrmacht troops (more than half a million - the Romanian army, almost 430 thousand - Hungarian troops, more than 270 thousand - Mussolini's troops!).   Of these, during the war years, 59 divisions, 23 brigades, several separate regiments, legions and battalions were formed.   Many of them were named after state and nationality !!!   Blue Division - Spain   "Wallonia" - the division included French, Spanish and Walloon volunteers, the Walloons were in the majority. The "Blue Division" was the only unit of the Wehrmacht awarded its "own" medal established in its honor !!!   HUNGARY (MAGYARS) 430 thousand - Hungarian troops   In total, 513,767 Hungarians were taken into Soviet captivity during the war years.   "Galicia" - Ukrainians and Galicians   "Bohemia and Moravia" - Czechs from Moravia and Bohemia   "Viking" - from the Netherlands, Belgium and the Scandinavian countries   Finland was an equally important ally of Nazi Germany.   From the end of June 1941 to September 1944, there were sixteen Euro-fascist infantry divisions on the Eastern Front, a total of 740 thousand soldiers and officers, 3047 guns and mortars, 186 tanks and 407 aircraft.   "Denemark" - Danes   "Langemark" - Flemish Legion (Holland)   "Nordland" - Scandinavian SS division   "Nederland" - Dutch collaborators who fled to Germany after the Allied occupation of Holland.   The "French Infantry Regiment 638", since 1943, has been merged with the newly organized "French SS Division" Charlemagne "- the French.   Army of Bulgaria   This is not complete data, Europe is afraid to voice the archives because the numbers will increase by 2 or 3 times!	removed	existing	[0.68567854 0.3143215 ]
The difference between the Russia and Ukraine subs says it all really.  I posted the exact same thing in each sub, a simple expression of appreciation for both peoples and a wish for peace.  I was downvoted in the Ukraine sub and upvoted here.  Biden is going to get pummeled in the midterm elections and the average American is really upset over inflation. The Fed is in a corner and can not raise rates. Another senseless war where millions of Europeans kill each other would be just what they want so Biden can be a wartime President and they can keep printing trillions of dollars we do not have.  A war would only result in the rich getting richer from the catastrophic loss of human capital.  There are Americans who are very much aware of the constant russophobic propaganda and see it for what it is.  We almost went nuclear over the Cuba Missile Crisis and now we are doing the same thing to Russia and pretending we do not understand why you are upset.

According to your table *язь, словарь, букварь, строитель, апрель* are "feminine, but not always" (sometimes neuter, perhaps?).  Maybe you should read about the difference between declension and grammatical gender, before trying to invent new things?  >I didn't fully understand what you meant but ихний word doesn't exist.  A word like *йинхи* doesn't exist, but *ихний* is very well attested.  I meant that you cannot use *их* to determine the gender of a word, because it doesn't decline. *Их дом, их поле, их мать*. Compare to *ихний дом, ихнее поле, ихняя мать*, where each ending unambiguously shows gender.	existing	existing	[0.6856748 0.3143252]

Russia is still declining on all aspects though, especially democratically and economically. Providing it doesn't end the world in all out nuke attack, it will probably break up in the next decades.    I feel the West is baiting them to invade Ukraine just to accelerate that process.  Also, when Putin goes, that country will tear itself appart like it always has   If Russia had no nukes, nobody would care about that economic midget which has a smaller GDP tham Canada.    Can you imagine if Spain or Canada started acting like superpowers 😅😅😅  (I am canadian btw)    In that regard, Russia is just a bigger version of North Korea.  An irrelevant country that acts up because it has it has nukes.     Look at Russia's GDP over the years, it dropped and has been stagnating since 2014.    If Russia behaved normally and focused on its shitty standard of living, highly corrupt institutions and outdated politics, it might have slowly (over decades) turned into a major player and ally itself with the West.  Instead, it chose to isolate itself and all of that is because their dictator wants to shift the blame on external forces when he is the actual problem.

There is no way to answer the question until you explain what *you* mean by "know a language" and what your friend means by "know a language." You two might not mean the same thing.  So I don't think this is even really important. If you are at A1/A2 level, then you do not have a strong enough command of the language to get by in it, so you have a huge amount of work to do, regardless of what other people are saying.  I think your friend says you know Russian since Russians don't expect anyone who is not living in or near Russia to speak their language. They are often amazed that anyone who didn't grow up speaking Russian can say anything in Russian at all.  You could ask the same thing about whether someone is or is not fluent. My measure of this is: do you ever have to *think* about what you want to say (thinking about grammatical rules as you speak), or do suitable words come out automatically even if the accent may be heavy? If someone can speak without having to think about the process and what is said sounds basically okay, then the person is fluent. If not, then I'd say the person is not fluent. But other people may use the term "fluent" differently.	existing	existing	[0.68567604 0.31432396]

The west in a way created them by lacking the nuance to deal with Russia and allowing their own state sponsored propaganda against Russia.

Russian girls dreamed about foreigners in 1990-s  - first half of 2000-s.

Of course, this is not the absolute rule, a lot of pairs fall in love at school, university and then together make their lives, careers and heartfire. So, there is no necessity of being foreigner.

Looks good, although I’d be wary in the sense that I’ve paused to read, and it doesn’t seem like you’re learning the grammar behind the phrases.   Like you can’t use “нести” for carry as a plug and play sort of thing. It will change depending on who is saying what or to whom.   If i were you I’d write down the infinitives for each verb you come across so you know where it comes from, or better yet mark the verbs used in their cases.   I’ve studied a few languages, and my unsolicited two cents is that you’re way better off “slower”, making sure you’re building your knowledge off the right way. Otherwise you’ll have bad habits of saying words instinctively in the wrong grammar tense or form because you spent a year or two learning a word without the why kind of thing.   There’s a book called “Russian in exercises” that’s pretty good and would be a good supplement (or necessary imo) for podcasts. Or rather the podcast should supplement something like a textbook.    TL;DR It’s easy to trick yourself with learning, and learning the right way is so much easier in the long run. Slower in the beginning,  it when you really understand how the language works and not just words or phrases, you’ll learn much more exponentially faster.	existing	existing	[0.68567884 0.3143212 ]

Russian adjectives are gendered: would you want these to be feminine or masculine? "Angelic" is "ангельский" (masculine) or "ангельская" (feminine), and "heavenly" is "небесный" (masculine) or "небесная" (feminine).  A further important caveat is that if you want to describe a human as angelic, you wouldn't typically use this adjective, but rather "ангелоподобный"/"ангелоподобная" ("angel-like"). "Ангельский" is more akin go "of an angel", like "ангельское лицо" -- "angelic face".  And "небесный" is used in a wider sense than "heavenly", also encompassing all that relates to the sky (so, "небесный цвет" - "sky color").  As my standard caveat, I strongly recommend against getting a tattoo in a language you don't speak fluently. It's merely cautionary advice, and I am not judging you in any way: it's just very difficult to grasp the full cultural context and there are almost always unintentional and often unwanted connotations involved.	existing	existing	[0.68567914 0.31432086]

I haven’t been able to pinpoint who his father is but I suspect it’s a man named Pawel Marmysh. And the dates do make me think this is a different Konstanty. The one related to who would’ve been my great-grandpa was born around the 1880s, arrested January 1920, and looks like he died in a German POW camp in 1944 perhaps. I’m not familiar with the language so I can’t tell how popular the last name Marmysh/Marmish is. I’ve been trying to track 4 brothers who all came to America around the same time and 3 were arrested in the Palmer Raids. Looks like this doesn’t pertain to them though. We were debating if we think the brothers were involved in unionization efforts and that’s why they were targeted or if there was something deeper. Finding an international patent raised eyebrows but now I can say it’s at least not evidence that the shoemaker brothers were up to much more.	existing	existing	[0.6856803 0.3143196]

Before Uber-like apps taxis were somewhat of an "elite" mode of transport because of their high prices. I don't think an official taxi would take an order of less than 500 rubles in 2011, while it's common to make ~100 ruble short distance rides today (not adjusted for inflation).  Also, the drivers, especially the younger or migrant ones, would often ask the passenger, how to get to their destination, even in the age when navigation apps were available (well, smartphones and data were a bit pricier those days).  Since the industry was very fragmented (you had to pick from dozens of taxi companies to call and order a taxi), in a big city like St-Petersburg there was a considerable wait for the taxi to arrive (~20-30 minutes).  I was surprised when visiting Togliatti in 2012, a driver would show up in less than 10 minutes (usually more like 5) and the cost would rarely exceed 150 rubles even for longer trips. And all this with traditional booking by phone.	existing	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431922]

Bravo, almost all copy pasta from the wiki and I am well aware that not all types of labor camps in Soviet belonged to the same organisation.      Another quote from the wiki: "English-language speakers also use the word gulag to refer to all forced-labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union"     18.000.000 people passed through the camps between 1923 to 1961 with little to no trial. That qualifies to "quite a lot". Is that the world record? I have no idea.  10% of them died. That is pretty bad, again, is it the worst? Again have no idea.       The point I was making before you felt the need to beat your chest was that quite a lot of people died there not all of them on record. So when calculating who died of what in that time period, this is needed to be taken in to consideration.

The East believes just as much propaganda about the West, as the West does of the East.

If you want a peaceful solution - there is one actually. NATO in general and US in particular should already accept the fact that they can not dominate the world in a way they want to. The politics are getting more and more multipolar instead of bipolar system of after WW2.   Maybe if they accept the fact and the reasoning Russia gave with the stabilization project to both (US/NATO) there would be no threats. We want no war. We need no war. But we are ready to go to war if the need arises. Not like it's the first time West tries to make our coutry fall.  Better be realistic here - if there actually was any real plan on invasions and stuff - our people would have done that neat and clean (and fast enough for other countries to not have time to intervene).But we just want: a - NO weaponry or rivalry directly at our borders and b - no intervention with the unfair and unclear methods into our internal stuff.

A lot of common Russian names are actually localised versions of foreign ones. I'd say really native Russian names like Ярослав, Людмила, Владимир etc are in minority.

Thank you. It’s important to not blindly glorify any country. Of course you can be proud of where you are from and your home—it makes me really happy to see that. But being blind to a country’s faults or pinning all blame on just one country is just an attempt at erasing history. People and governments are more complex than that. My home country is very broken right now and it is horrible to see what it’s doing to the rest of the world. I wish it were different because it is embarrassing and painful. Too often these discussions turn into vile quibbling and people forget the humanity. I wish everyone could remember that we are individuals, and we don’t (nor should we) act and think exactly like our governments.

 У нас в Крыму при СССР наоборот была насаждение принуждение к украинскому языку , мы все  в классе русские и русскоговорящие, ненавидели уроки украинского языка в Школе и уж тем более украинской литературы . Это было чуждо ,казалось надругательством над ясностью и универсумом русского языка. Как это было нудно ,и уже тогда подозревал что не актуально для последующей жизни . Издавалось много украинской периодики и прессы .Моя  родная тётя была библиотекарем в сельской библиотеке и она получала буквально килограммами   украинскую прессу , но ей почти никто не интересовался и тётька называла её шлаком , которую иногда не распечатывая прямо в упаковке через некоторое время увозили в макулатуру . Но коммунисты упорно переводили лес и немалые средства в мовную периодику. Газеты на украинском ввиду их дешевизны и невостребованности уходили на растопку печек ,на кульки для семечек и обёрточной бумаги для продуктов. Мы в Крыму никогда не считали себя украинцами , мы были всегда русскими, в крайнем случае  советскими .

Crimean War (1853-1856)   The reason for the Crimean War was a dispute over the keys to holy places in Palestine between Catholics and Orthodox. The Sultan handed over the keys to the Bethlehem Church from the Orthodox Greeks to the Catholics, whose interests were protected by the Emperor of France, Napoleon III. Russian Emperor Nicholas I demanded that Turkey recognize him as the patron of all Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman Empire. On June 26, 1853, he announced the entry of Russian troops into the Danube Principalities, declaring that he would withdraw them from there only after the Russian demands were satisfied by the Turks.   On July 14, Turkey addressed a note of protest against Russia's actions to other great powers and received assurances of support from them. On October 16, Turkey declared war on Russia, and on November 9, an imperial manifesto followed on Russia declaring war on Turkey.   The Allies planned to land the main landing in the Crimea in order to deprive the Russian Black Sea Fleet of its bases. Attacks on the ports of the Baltic and White Seas and the Pacific Ocean were also envisaged. The Anglo-French fleet concentrated in the Varna region. It consisted of 34 battleships and 55 frigates, including 54 steam ones, and 300 transport ships, on which there was an expeditionary force of 61,000 soldiers and officers. The Russian Black Sea Fleet could oppose the Allies with 14 sailing battleships, 11 sailing and 11 steam frigates. The Russian army of 40 thousand people was stationed in the Crimea.............

In Soviet times Russia was investing a lot of money and resources into supporting other territories, both inside the USSR and outside. According to the statistics, if I remember correctly there were only 2 republics in the USSR which earned more money than they spent, and that surplus was going to the rest of the country. One of these two republics is RSFSR (current Russia); unfortunately I don't remember the other one. It might be Belarus but I may be mistaken.  For example, Soviet Union built a lot of manufacturing facilities and if I remember correctly some shipyards in the Baltic republics; these facilities were mainly destroyed after the secession of the Baltic states, so the people who worked there lost their jobs and had to leave these countries to look for jobs in the UK and European countries. In my opinion this is one of the many reasons for the current depopulation of the Baltic states. The Ignalina nuclear power plant was destroyed in Lithuania, and now they have energy deficit and have to spend a lot on importing LNG which is a separate funny story: they were planning to lower their dependency on Russian natural gas and ended up buying the LNG from another Russian company (Novatek); only this LNG is being sold to them as an American one while Americans buy it from Russia :))  I often visit Germany, and my German friends too confirm that there's still an economic gap between Eastern and Western part of Germany. If understand correctly, the industrial plants which were built in the Eastern part before the reunification were destroyed, but nothing significant was built there in their place - and of course it's another reason for the before-mentioned gap. In my opinion it resembles the situation in the Baltic states: everything from the past times was destroyed and not a lot had been built, here's the problems with economy and depopulation.	existing	existing	[0.68568087 0.31431916]

Yeah, I lived there for a few years and absolutely love American people and culture, but your government is a massive bully on the world stage who basically does everything they accuse foreign powers of doing.  Living outside the US now it’s just so sickening to watch it happen and then turn on the news and nothing.    When the US media talks about Russian oligarchs Americans need to learn that their media is intentionally keeping the focus off American oligarchs as an example.    I also get to watch my own government play puppet to the American government and do what they want instead of what the people want as if we’re some kind of western Belarus.  You seem open minded, so I’ll run through an opposing perspective on some current events as an example.  With the current Ukraine focus at present I think the best way to explain the eastern perspective is as follows:  Imagine Puerto Rico, American citizens living in a territory and part of the greater populous but also not in “America” depending on your definition, on the other hand we have Ukraine, also Russian citizens, until 2012 they were a CIS member and had free movement within the CIS.    Our fictional example below should help.  2012 hits and china uses non-military pressure to gain and build infrastructure projects in PR using Chinese tech and labour, there’s some outcry  but not much as it’s just good business.  Chinese money continues to pour in and china starts backing a candidate for leader.   Once elected the state is shifted from the American sphere of influence to the Chinese one gradually. Parts of PR have breakaway groups who want to go back to being part of America.  International pressure mounts and the US steps in to chase out china and protects the American citizens living in Puerto Rico.  Replace the US with the Russia, China with the US and Puerto Rico with the Ukraine and your up to speed, while the Ukraine was not a Russian oblast (state) prior to 2012 it acted as a semi autonomous region much like the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.  Of course there’s tremendous internal pressure to protect the Russians in the Ukraine, to most Russians the Ukraine is just as much part of Russia as Kazan or Moscow and probably more Russia than st Petersburg .	existing	existing	[0.685681 0.314319]

Пара бтг для вторжения и оккупации? Серьёзно? У нас что, интенсивные полёты российских бпла вдоль границ, усиление огневого контакта вдоль линии соприкосновения, для вскрытия огневых точек противника, выход флота на боевое патрулирование вдоль берегов Украины, выдвижение на передовые рубежи, создание оперативных складов ГСМ и боеприпасов вдоль границы, постоянные совещания по линии Беларусь-Москва, усиление действий разведки и контр-разведки в приграничных территориях? Я могу целый день перечислять. Тем более, что никто не будет вторгаться на Украину без первого выстрела с их стороны. Вы вообще представляете себе, что значить подготовить для удара заявленную 100 000 группировку из ВСЕХ родов войск для единого удара? Это не учитывая того, что по самым оптимистичным оценкам, для выдвижения до условной линии Днепра с последующим удержанием территории в позитивном сценарии требуется 350 (!) тысяч человек, и это не мои расчёты, а наших западных коллег (последний раз видел эту цифру на warontherocks года 2 назад, если мне не изменяет память).  Мобилизация отдельных БТГ связана с тем, чтобы отбить желание Украинской стороны устроить "маленькую победоносную войну". Никто не воспринимает Украину не всерьёз. Это было заметно хотя-бы по Иловайску и Дебальцево. Поэтому в предполагаемом вам сценарии вторжения фигурируют либо генералы-идиоты с российской стороны верующие в лёгкую победу малой кровью. Либо генералы-идоты с украинской (ну, и натовской), потому что они до сих пор не объявили частичную мобилизацию, не перебрасывают всю имеющуюся технику и персонал к предполагаемому театру военных действий, не ныкают остатки флота в натовских портах, не проводят учения ГОиЧС в приграничных с Россией областях, и вообще, ведут себя так, как будто добробаты - это неуязвимые сверхлюди на боевых мехах из 23 столетия.

The Indians of North America, once brutally driven from their native lands by European colonialists, have been forced to live on reservations for several generations.   There are 2.5 million American Indians today.   At the entrance to the reservation there was an impressive poster: “Do not invade! Violators will be shot. The survivors will be shot again!" What is this, 17th century?   By the way, links to the website of the US Bureau of Statistics, access from the territory of the Russian Federation to the site is closed!!!!!!

Isaenko reminded that the wedding is a special ceremony for the newlyweds and their relatives. Therefore, you should not interfere with loud conversations. Advertisement As for laughter, Isaenko said - the media took this phrase out of context. There really is a ban, and it applies to all loud sounds.

If you have six to nine months (!), then... Let's see here...  If you're into XVIII palaces, then the towns around St. Petersburg like Gatchina, Pushkin, Lomonosov, Strelna, Pavlovsk, maybe Shlisselburg. Valaam just a bit further East. Fort Krasnaya Gorka, too, if you like big guns.  Kizhi, for wooden architecture.  Pskov, Izborsk and Veliky Novgorod, for the history and the fortifications.  A lot to see in the Moscow Oblast, such as the Kubinka tank museum (plus Patriot Park), Monino aviation museum, and Vadim Zadorozhny Technical Museum.  Going North-East from Moscow: Sergiev Posad, Alexandrov, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Rostov Veliky, Yaroslavl, Rybinsk.  Further West: Vladimir, Bogolubovo, Suzdal, Kostroma (possible to go to Kostroma from Yaroslavl, or to Vladimir from Moscow), potentially also Murom and Nizhny Novgorod.  Kazan is definitely worth a visit, perhaps the towns around it like Sviyazhsk and Bolghar. If you have time, Yoshkar-Ola with its kitch downtown.  Volgograd, if you're into WWII history. Astrakhan further south, if you're into fishing.  The Caucasus, hoo boy, can spend quite a bit of time there, from Dagestan's ancient fortress in Derbent and Chirkey Dam to the flashy post-Olympic Sochi, past spa resort towns like Kislovodsk, Essentuki, Zheleznovodsk and Pyatigorsk, mountain resorts like Dombai and Arkhyz, and wine tourism spots like Abrau-Diurso, Lefkadia or Phanagoria.  Further West is Crimea, which is remarkable both landscape-wise and history-wise, from Kerch with its archaeological monuments in the streets and Adzhimushkay quarry, through Feodosia with Aivazovsky's gallery, Karadag volcano, Sudak with its Genoese fortress, Novy Svet preserve. Then on to the southern shore with Yalta, Livadiya and Alupka with their palaces, Ai-Petri mountain, and Foros church. Then the Western shore: Sevastopol with its military history, Yevpatoriya with the Greek ruins around it and Tartankhut; then Simferopol with its history museum and airport.  All of these are reachable from Moscow by train, but some of the listed takes quite a bit of time to reach, so you'd be better of flying (you can freely fly to Crimea since it leaves no stamps in your passport, as an internal flight). I know a few people like the idea of traversing Transsib by train, but long stretches of it aren't all that engaging, so you could as well fly if you want to see Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk with its hydroplant, Irkutsk and Baikal, and Vladivostok with its impressive bridges and fortifications.  Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Isles further East are also all spectacular as far as natural sights go, but they can be a tad bit costly to reach.	existing	existing	[0.6856785 0.3143215]

As a European who is here out of interest, why *is*  Russia moving troops to the ukranian border? From what I've seen on r/russia everyone is ridiculing the idea of an invasion, so what are the soldiers actually doing at the border??

What happened in Chechnya is very similar to what happened in Syria recently. Genocide of civilians, foreign fighters, Al-Qaeda, Islamic fundamentalism and other shit. Imagine this horror in the USA, for example in Texas. Do you think your government would not have brought in troops?   Georgia fired at our peacekeepers. What would the United States do if some country subjected a US military base to rocket and artillery fire? As for the annexation of Crimea, it was a provocation by you know who. On the one hand, we did not give up the military base, and on the other, we protected the civilian population. Compare with the horror that was staged in the DPR and LPR. Again, imagine that you have such a thing going on, for example, in Canada, where they suddenly decided to ban the English language and began to oppress everyone who has Anglo-Saxo roots. In fact, everything is more complicated than it seems. Maybe the decisions that Putin made are not the most beautiful, but other options would be much worse.	existing	existing	[0.6856792  0.31432083]

I think you shouldn't make a list of "what to learn" in a specific order but just have fun with the language instead, especially if you gave up before.  I started russian at uni and we were mainly learning grammar, conjugation and... cases. Bad idea, I drowed in all the grammar rules and gave up as soon as I stopped the courses. I only started around 1 year ago to study by myself (so 6+ years after I left school) and I still haven't really touched the cases, except a few simple videos I watched (amazing russian on youtube)  So if you restart from beginner level, I really, I mean REALLY recommend to ignore the cases! find music you like, youtube channels, easy books, Duolinguo or any app you like but don't go hard on grammar and cases and you'll understand why later.  Now after nearly 1 year I can easily understand easy sentences, talk a bit and I started reading books (with translation) cases only start to be usefull when you want to talk and for that you first need a lot of vocabulary.     Just be consistent, do something you like and enjoy, it's a long journey but it's worth it ;)	existing	existing	[0.6856793 0.3143207]

Realistically?  No.  First of all the wording is weird and not realistic.  This says if only America and Russia go to war, would you side with someone.  That’s just not gonna happen.  America and Russia starting a war with specifically the other one would have to start in like the Bering Strait, and wouldn’t make any sense whatsoever.  America and Russia have always avoided conflict because it’s just not worth it, so any start to war between the two would almost have to be a Russian invasion of a NATO state or NATO aligned state like Finland because America isn’t gonna invade Russia or Belarus any time soon.  As for the rest of the reliability of this question, this graph alone doesn’t show how many people asked, how old they were, if the question was a leading one, etc…so it’s entirely unreliable as it stands.	removed	existing	[0.6856794  0.31432062]

Not NATO...the greedy U.S. Megacorps are being dicks.  Just as wars were fought in the Middle East for oil, this conflict in Ukraine is about the country's rich, fertile agricultural land.  Starting around 2014, the U.S. Megacorps got the World Bank and IMF to use debt based diplomacy tactics on Ukraine to get the local farmers to give up their land rights the them. Then Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, etc all setup shop to start farming their toxic GMO foods. But what the Western media suppresses in the news, is how Ukraine separatists have literally attack these installations in revolt over losing their land and livelihood. So now the U.S. Megacorps want NATO to move into Ukraine to protect their installations.  This is basically American Imperialism under the guise of spreading Democracy. I don't support it as an American. It's seems once again, innocent blood will get spilt over the greed of U.S. Megacorps.

>kuban used to be a majority Ukrainian area settled with Ukrainians by Catherine the great  Catherine the Great resettled there the cossacks from Zaporozhye.

The dialect spoken in Kuban is called balachka, but suggesting to its users that they are not cossacks but cryptoukrainians is simply unsafe.  >before Ukrainian was banned by the soviets  Not only was Ukrainian never "banned by the Soviets", it was made mandatory in the Ukrainian SSR that they had created, and saw massive promotion efforts as a part of so called korenizatsiya - replacing ethnic Russian officials in the Soviet Republics with representatives of titular ethnicities.  >during the holodomor these eastern Ukrainians in kuban(but in donbass and dniepr region as well) were genocided  The very concept of Golodomor as an ethnic genocide is a malicious lie trying to capitalize on a tragedy. The failures of the Soviet collectivization efforts combined with a bad harvest produced a hunger from the Ukraine throughout the Russian Southern regions and well into Kazakhstan, claiming a large number of victims - both Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh.

да, извините, там все очень молоды, до среднего возраста 72 года буквально пару лет:  "Что у нас нынче выполняет функции советского Политбюро? Правильно, после всех поправок в Конституцию и обнулений это Совет безопасности во главе с самим нашим верховным правителем Владимиром Владимировичем Путиным, до 70-летия которого осталось, кстати, менее года. Кто там ещё состоит? 70-летний секретарь Совета безопасности Патрушев в органах КГБ СССР с 1974 года, таким опытом пренебрегать никак нельзя. 70-летний постоянный член Совета безопасности Бортников в органах КГБ СССР с 1975 года. Тоже носитель бесценных для управления современным государством знаний. Так что Долгих не одинок, эти тоже из 1970-х, смотрите, какая преемственность: "Это наша с тобою судьба, это наша с тобой биография", как пелось в одной советской песне. Первый заместитель секретаря Совета безопасности Аверьянов Юрий Тимофеевич – 71 год. Заместитель секретаря Совета безопасности Попов Михаил Михайлович – 70 лет. Другие замы – это уже молодежь: Рашид Нургалиев – 65 лет, Сергей Вахруков – 63 года, Александр Гребенкин – 67 лет, Олег Храмов – 66 лет, Юрий Коков – тоже 66. Кто все эти люди? Подробные биографии их нигде не опубликованы. Это, так сказать, аппарат.  Как и в советском Политбюро, здесь сохранена двухэтажная структура. Члены современного Политбюро теперь именуются "постоянными членами Совета Безопасности Российской Федерации", кандидаты в члены Политбюро – это просто "члены Совета безопасности". Кто там среди "постоянных", помимо уже перечисленных? Сергей Борисович Иванов – 68 лет, в КГБ СССР с 1975 года. Владимир Колокольцев – 60 лет. Сергей Лавров – 71. Ещё там состоит бывшая начальница долгожителя Долгих Валентина Ивановна Матвиенко – неловко напоминать женщинам о возрасте, но ей 72 года. Сергей Нарышкин – 67 лет. Сергей Шойгу – 66 лет. Пробежимся и по рядовым членам Совбеза, хотя это уровень пониже, судьбоносные вопросы решают без них: Беглов (65), Булавин (69), Герасимов (66), Золотов (67), Собянин (63), Трутнев (65), Устинов (68), Чайка (70)."	existing	existing	[0.6856819  0.31431812]

Occupation of Poland!   Now it is fashionable to say that the Russians did not liberate Poland, but captured it. An interesting occupation is obtained if Poland received a quarter of the territories of Germany for free: moreover, hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers shed blood for this land. Even the GDR did not want to give Szczecin to the Poles - the issue with the city was finally resolved only in 1956 under pressure from the USSR.   Jozef Lipski (Polish diplomat. In 1934-1939 he served as ambassador to Germany.)   \- If Hitler solves the Jewish question "we will erect a beautiful monument to him in Warsaw."!!!!! September 20, 1938   Already during the German occupation in December 1939, the Poles staged a Jewish pogrom in Krakow. In 1940, the Jewish Easter pogrom in Warsaw was marked. In July 1941, in the village of Jedwabne in the Bialystok region of the BSSR (now Poland), where the main population was Jews, the Poles living in the same village as a result of a pogrom organized by them killed, as witnesses stated, more than one and a half thousand Jews. Most of them were burned alive in a barn.   By the way, the Germans paid the Poles money and groceries for every Jew they caught: tobacco, sugar, liquor. In Warsaw, one head of a Jew was estimated by the Germans, in addition to everything, also at 1-1.5 kg. apple jam. And not a single Polish “Jew hunter” had anything sticky in the ass from this jam !!!   The Baltics are also greatly outraged by the occupation. It is worth remembering the current capital Vilnius also gave Lithuania to the USSR; the Lithuanian population of Vilnius was then 1%, and the Polish majority. The USSR returned to the republic the city of Klaipeda (Prussian Memel), which belonged to the Lithuanians in 1923-1939. and annexed by the Third Reich. The Lithuanian leadership condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact back in 1991, but no one returned both Vilnius to Poland and Klaipeda to the FRG.	removed	existing	[0.6856813  0.31431866]

Ah, I see.  I get that your messages are targeted for the "internal audience" of Russia, but it's really interesting to read as an outsider.  Apparently you claim to have been a Finnish citizen, and yet, you don't seem to understand even the basics of a Finnish society. Talking about gods and being fascist, which are something Finns never talk about but know that Russians do.  And it's somewhat silly to say that only Sweden and Russia genuinely like Finland. Where did the "little brother", Estonia go? Or Norway? Or Denmark? Or Iceland? Or Japan? And just that you know, Sweden is often considered to like Finland the least, of Nordic-countries. You should know at least these if you claim to have lived in Finland.  Also, you should tone down the book quotes. It's an another clue that you have no knowledge about Finnish people. Finns don't take those seriously and avoid quoting people -- because quite frankly, it's a bit dumb.

Even if he's not fully genuinely conservative about man&woman relationships, *if his friends share this conservative outlook*, a woman paying for her man on a date can be percieved kinda humiliating, making him look *as if it's him who is a girl on a date here*, or *feel inadequate as a man*, particulary in therms of not being able to provide for his woman, or looking dependant on the woman (when a conservative outlook supposes the woman to be dependant on man).  Now, I personally don't agree with such an outlook, and I'd split the bill equally at any occasion. But most of Russian men and women get some bits of this old mentality through their parents, or their social circle. The time changes, and it's getting less of a thing now, though, you shouldn't think that this is some Russian thing. It's and old mentlity thing.

>for those that want to live under Russia’s economy  Imagine that I live in country A. If I feel that I would much rather live under the economy of country B instead, then I would do my best trying to move there. Maybe country B even wants me to move there, and might offer me help in the moving process.   It makes no sense at all to silently watch as country B "step in" with military forces (ie **invade**) into sovereign country A under the pretence that some of the citizens of country A needs protection. They can simply move to country B. Country A being Ukraine here, and country A being Russia, naturally.   Also, it makes no sense in comparing Crimea with the rest of Ukraine like you seem to do. I have seen internationally independent surveys done within Crimea indicating that many of the people there wants to be part of Russia.

Thereby   the treaties concluded between   USSR and Poland. left to itself and   left without leadership, Poland has become   a convenient field for all sorts of accidents and surprises,   capable of posing a threat to the USSR. Therefore, being hitherto   neutral, the Soviet government can no longer   be neutral about these facts and   defenseless position of the Ukrainian and Belarusian   population. In view of this situation, the Soviet   The government has ordered the Chief   command of the Red Army to give orders to the troops   cross the border and take life and   property of the population of Western Belarus, Western   Ukraine.   The operation was attended by formations of Kiev and   Belarusian military districts, reinforced by units   Kalinin and Moscow military districts.

The profits aren't going to investors. Some go to CEOs, but again, not enough to explain the high cost of US healthcare.

Every sane person supports the concept of justice, including social justice. However, the radical postmodernists behind the current Western world order have perverted the concept of “social justice” to the point of where it has a completely lost its original meaning, giving  it Orwellian undertones and sinister connotations associated with mass hysterias and witch hunts. They have also redefined most of the terms associated with it and use it as a “divide & conquer tactic” against the working class, distracting it from the real injustices perpetrated against it.   Radical feminism (toxic feminine supremacism) is NOT “justice”. Making protected minorities out of sexual deviants is NOT “justice”. Making violent career criminals (like Trayvon Floyd) into saintly martyrs, while demonizing brave police officers, is NOT “justice”. Hiring practices that openly discriminate against white males via “minority quotas” is NOT “justice”. Teaching children to hate their own race (CRT) is NOT “justice”. Punishing men for disciplining their children or practicing traditional husbandry with their wives, is NOT “justice”. Re-defining the meaning of “sexual assault” to include things like spontaneous sex with your female partner and just looking at a woman with desire in your eyes, is NOT “justice”. Redefining “racism” to include things like listing open statistics on black crime, is NOT “justice”. Using my taxpayer money to support welfare queens or for  “hormone treatments” for jailed rapists is NOT “justice”. Censoring or “cancelling” (ruining) people for expressing opposing views is NOT “justice”. Undermining traditional human values, which are based on millennia worth of collective thought and wisdom, for the sake of “progress”, is NOT “justice”. Dehumanization, libel, silencing and warmongering directed at Russians, while screaming about “tolerance”, is NOT “justice”!	existing	existing	[0.68568265 0.31431738]
I concur. The worst that could happen is a war.  I was born and raised in Ukraine, live in US now. Although having a general pro-Ukraine position, I think that it's time for Zelensky to realize that Ukraine cannot be joining NATO. It's not good for anyone. Not for Ukraine, not for Russia.	existing	existing	[0.68568027 0.3143198 ]
It's not going to, but guerilla warfare in urban conditions is a pain for modern militaries. Look at Grozny.  It's a problem if any civilian can suddenly pop out of the window and begin shooting your troops only then to merge with other civilians. Plus, look. Russia cant really glass Ukraine to dust. Many Russian people have friends and relatives there, plus they are considered as "close" country. There would be a huge internal and international outrage if Russian army would just glass the cities.	existing	existing	[0.6856803 0.3143196]

Uh, sorry, I don't have a full answer, but something I can tell you is that "а" often does not mean "and", while "и" is pretty much always translated into English as "and" (maybe there are some rare exceptions though).  So, "и" is the preposition used when listing things (as well as English "and"), for example: "Настя **и** Иван идут домой" - "Nastia **and** Ivan are going home"; "Он играет футбол **и** волейбол" - "He plays football **and** volleyball"; so pretty much an analogue of "and" (note that "а" cannot be used here)  "А" has many uses, many of which I don't know how to describe, but at least one I know how to. It can be used for comparing two things in a way to emphasize their difference (an English analogue here would be "but" or just nothing). "Она*(she)* играет*(plays)* на*(on)* барабанах*(drums)*, **а** не*(not)* на*(on)* гитаре*(guitar)*" - "She plays drums, **~~and~~** not guitar" - I have marked "and" with a strikethrough because it's normally omitted (not sure if it's even allowed there); "Он любит Оксану, **а** не Светлану" - "He loves Oksana, **~~and~~** not Svetlana"; "Они*(they)* сделали*(did)* это*(it)* не*(not)* со*(because of)* злости*(anger)*, **а***(but)* из-за*(because of)* голода*(hunger)*" - "They did it not because of anger, **but** because of hunger".  Lastly, I will give you some examples where "а" actually translates into English as "and", though I can't really explain them: "**А***(and)* куда*(where to)* ты*(you)* думал*(thought)* он*(he)* пошёл*(went)*?" - "**And** where did you think he went?"; "**А***(and)* зачем*(for what)* нам*(to us/for us)* это*(this)*? - "And why do we need it?"; "**А***(and)* если*(if)* я*(I)* им*(to them)* всё*(everything)* расскажу*(will tell)*?" - "**And** what if I tell them everything?"

>we have a long history of Russian interference in our affairs.....?   are you serious ?????   In the occupied lands of the USSR, the Romanians unleashed a policy of genocide and terror against the Gypsies, Jews, "Bolsheviks". Antonescu supported Hitler's policy of "racial purity" and considered it necessary to clear the territory of "Greater Romania" from "Bolshevism" and "racially unclean" peoples. He said the following: “I will not achieve anything if I do not cleanse the Romanian nation. Not borders, but the homogeneity and purity of the race give strength to the nation: this is my highest goal. A plan was developed to exterminate all the Jews of Romania. First of all, they planned to “clean up” Bukovina, Bessarabia, Transnistria, after their “cleansing”, they planned to exterminate the Jews in Romania itself, in total there were about 700 thousand people in these territories. The process of creating ghettos, concentration camps began, the largest of them - Vertyuzhansky, Securensky and Edintsky. https://cont.ws/uploads/pic/2019/2/Romanians%20fascists.jpg   https://pastvu.com/\_p/a/i/v/2/iv277fa2zo7qpzsph3.jpg   During the occupation, the Romanians established laws that were supposed to clean out everything Russian from Odessa and other settlements. All books in Slavic languages ​​were confiscated from libraries and private collections of the city, which were later burned on a huge fire. A strict decree was issued prohibiting the use of the Russian language by civilians.   The Romanian secret police of Siguranza had instruments of torture, as did the German Gestapo.   The Romanians got the name - "Death Marches": they marched in the winter, those lagging behind and unable to walk were shot on the spot, pits were dug for every 10 km, where they buried the half-dead and the corpses of the dead. The camps of Transistria were overcrowded, a huge number of people died from hunger, cold and disease, before their execution.   The district of Golta was called the "Kingdom of Death", the largest concentration camps in Romania were located here - Bogdanovka, Domanevka, Akmachetka and Mostovoye. In the winter of 1941-1942, large-scale mass executions of prisoners were carried out in these concentration camps. Romanian executioners shot 40 thousand unfortunate prisoners in just a few days, another 5 thousand were burned alive in Bogdanovka. According to some reports, only during this period, 250 thousand Jews were destroyed here !!!!   Of the 18 Romanian divisions stationed in the southern direction, 16 suffered heavy losses, were actually defeated. In total, during the war, Romania lost 800 thousand people, of which 630 thousand people were on the Eastern Front (of which 480 thousand were killed).   However, later the USSR returned the former Romanian conductor (leader) back to Romania, where, after a trial in Bucharest, he was sentenced to death as a war criminal.   Under the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947, the USSR established an unlimited military presence in Romania.   Over the past 130 years, Russian-Romanian relations have gone through serious trials. Two world wars swept over Russia and Romania. We had to restore diplomatic ties twice. Thanks to the generosity of SSSR Transylvania finally returned to Romania.   We must remember the bloody tears of fascism, we must prevent its restoration in new forms. We must understand that any fascism is a threat to human dignity and the right to freedom!	removed	existing	[0.6856795  0.31432047]

> I think in German or English I don't really do that much with the middle of my tongue  Der Deutsche Ich-Laut ist ein palataler Konsonant (der palatale Frikativ). Die russischen Konsonanten sind palatalisiert, nicht palatal. Palatal bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge berührt den harten Gaumen, und palatalisiert bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge nähert sich ihm. Aber beide klingen sehr ähnlich.  Hast du versucht, die palatalisierten Konsonanten mit zurückgerollter Zunge auszusprechen? Das ist etwas völlig anderes.

Propaganda is how this info is presented. Get rid off the words 'banned' and 'genocide' first of all. Also at the times of Catherine there was no separated ukrainian language, there were east slavic (or russian) dialect continuum. Soviets standardized distant dialects into Ukrainian an Belorussian which were taught in the certain soviet republics. While dialects of Ukrainian an Belorussian were mainly rural, Russian was taught everywhere and has significant cultural impact.

Hi! Have you thought about finding a job over there for a year or two and then applying for a masters program? You could teach English (assuming you are a native speaker) for a while and get better at the language and then apply to a program while you’re already there.

I don't think Russia will even go to war its just threatening to get some benefits from americans. Yugoslavia fell apart because of nationalist movements and the fact that communism without Tito just stopped working. NATO stepped in to stop things like the Srebernica massacre.

Russia said they won't invade Georgia - they occupied two big areas of Georgia in 2008  Russia said they have nothing to do with Crimea - they occupied it in 2014. In 2015 they agreed that their military forced such actions and illegal referendum.  Later Russia said that they have nothing to do with Luhansk and Donetsk regions - but somehow THOUSANDS of Russian tanks are in eastern Ukraine.  Till this day Russia does not acknowledge that after WWII they have had occupied Baltic countries for more than 50 years. We are now independant for 31 years.  Russia is occupier and lier!  Such country cannot be trusted.  What they have done in Lithuania after occupation - they send 160.000+ brightest people (teachers, politicians, scientists etc) to gulafs in Siberia. Many were jailed and killed.  Just to ensure that country wouldn't resist.  We need to support Ukraine, so that the same fate wouldnt fall onto them. That's why Lithuania stands up for Ukraine and Taiwan, because we know what it means to be opressed.	removed	existing	[0.6856811 0.3143189]

But Germany did initially agree to this pipeline. And from what I can see the reason Germany rescinded is because they want a Switzerland based company to switch to Germany based (in line with German regulations).    Are we saying the gas from Russia is a god given right? Or that they are sovereign state and can do what they like?   On the border issue and the demands, it still doesn't feel that big a deal. Russia can ask for it, and we can say no.   Again, if Russia invades Ukraine that will be mental, but that isn't happening.  Fron what I'm seeing people are panicking Russia will stop supplying EU gas.

Ukraine is a bulwark to Russian aggression, and so is the rest of eastern Europe. If you allow Russia to invade Ukraine and annex the territory, then what happens when they target the Baltic states? Are you gonna sit on your isolationist ass? Sorry, but the revolution deserves to be spread in as many independent territories as possible, and allowing Russia or even China to expand without check is a massive mistake, because they'll just do the same we have done, and much worse, because they don't believe in limitations.	removed	existing	[0.6856799  0.31432015]

Russian narrative in Russia is as confusing as what Russia tells the West. Russia is not going to invade Ukraine. NATO is a threat. Ukraine shouldn't be accepted to NATO. NATO should fulfill Russian demands or face consequences. Russia is not going to invade Ukraine.  So basically propaganda is trying to justify _something_, but it's not clear what it's going to be. Pretty similar to 2014 IMO when the media were all about how Ukrainian revolution is a threat to Russia, but no one told Russia is going to invade Crimea or Donbas until it actually happened.	existing	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431916]

Russia has no reason to fight unless a 'defensive war'' of occupied territory belonging to a different sovereign country?

Of course the last being destroyed by the Russian offensive, but that is besides the point.   &#x200B;  If you think that Ukraine would willingly attack a greater force than itself in an offensive manner without hope of success, and that that will legitimize a full hostile takeover of Ukraine than I am really curious how the information you are getting through your media coincides with your rational thinking.	removed	existing	[0.68567973 0.31432024]

I've always wondered what the true opinion of the Russian was about Putin. In my eyes, who had a chance to question different versions of history, Putin is not quite bad at all. It's true and I've come across records of Putin getting rich from government bureaucracy and with issuing of permissions in one of his old jobs at a St. Peterburg port, but on the other hand I've seen Puting taking directions historically right and worthy of credit such as those directions previously taken by Alexander II in the 19th century.	existing	existing	[0.68568116 0.31431884]
Russian language is mostly uniform.  There are some regionalisms that we learn about in school.  For example, in Moscow the curb is called бордюр, and in Saint Petersburg поребрик, here in Kazan I heard both, although поребрик more often.  The entrance to residential building in Saint Petersburg are called парадная, while both in Moscow and here in Kazan it's подъезд.  A market in Kazan is often called базар (loaned from Tatar language), alongside рынок, while in the rest of Russia it's just рынок. Also we use айда (let's go), which is also a loan from Tatar language, alongside general пойдёмте.  The differences in word usage are too small to be unintelligible however, or even noticeable in most conversations. Also what the regionalisms are is often known alongside more general variants.  I've heard of there being accents, like differences in unstressed "о" vowel reduction (both unstressed "о" and unstressed "а" should sound the same is what we are taught in school). Old people in northern villages not reducing unstressed "о" (окание). Or Moscowites reducing unstressed "о" so much, that it's practically like stressed "а" (акание). The former I've never heard of in person, only in movies set in villages pre mid 20th century perhaps. The latter I thought was a myth (Moscow news anchors don't do it), before I met someone who moved from Moscow to Kazan. He indeed does the "акание". But those differences also don't prevent understanding.  There are also accents for those for whom Russian is second language, but they don't count as dialects.	existing	existing	[0.68568075 0.31431922]

Even with 150,000, that’s about 15% of their active troops. I seriously doubt there is actually that many.  Either way, why would you only send 15% of your military to invade and entire country? Seems like poor planning to me. It wouldn’t make logical sense for them to invade with their current troop setup.

The US would struggle in a conventional war with Russia. American military experience has been limited to exporting conflict abroad. Americans haven’t had a taste of war on their soil since their White House got burnt down. If we are to talk conventional war, not even total war. I would love to see the pink hair they/ them brigade take up arms.   That being said. Both sides, even without a nuclear arsenal taken into account, have enough fire power for this conflict to decimate their populations. So this theoretical armchair generalism is pointless, since it’s very very very very very unlikely that outright war will happen.	existing	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431937]

Russophobia is actively inspired by some   Western media and even governments to achieve   their political or economic goals through   Russia.   A great example is Nord Stream 2.   Any use of the term “Russian aggression” is   Russophobia.   The most striking example of Russophobia was the mental   illness of the United States Secretary of Defense   James Forrestal. Yes, this is the famous “Russians are coming”.   Russophobia refers to a deliberate attempt   blame Russia for all the troubles in the world, based on   lack of hard evidence or evidence,   distorted half-truths or even outright lies. USA   are the epicenter of Russophobia, followed by   UK, Canada, Holland, Australia, countries   Baltics and Sweden...   Downed MH17 aircraft over eastern Ukraine, before   after the plane hit the ground, the US blamed Russia,   even Putin himself!

I'm just about to learn this part of Russian history at school but looking through the book I've found that yeah, it is mentioned, not in extensive form and not necessarily dragging the USSR through the mud tho   There's a fair bit of info about the Soviet-Finnish war and that the Soviets decided to use power against the Finns when they disagreed to let the USSR move the border.     Also there's quite a bit of info about Bessarabia and stuff and that USSR basically pressured different countries to give them territory but the word "annexed" or "annexation" is never mentioned directly, which is, I'm pretty sure, just to not put too much bad light on the USSR   Check the screenshots out if you want to find out more yourself   [Screenshot from the book #1](https://paste.pics/3900ebb2550d37ed5df570807ec37438) [screenshot #2](https://paste.pics/a6f26099330f70b457b09ed5892fff58)	removed	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431943]

1. A key difference between US and Russia's governments, despite how corrupt the US might be, is we don't have Presidents in power for however long they wish to be. Putin is coming close to a dictator at this point.  2. The influence of the wealthy over Putin is incredible and the lenghts putin goes to silence his critics is well known. video for proof of what I mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrORwk\_RZLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrORwk_RZLM)    1. How many times do we see in the news some ex russian dying of mysterious circumstances and the chemical found usually being tied to russian spy/government agencies. 3. Russia's government seemingly backs the worlds most corrupt countries whether its North Korea or supporting military take over of African nations like what is currently going on in the country of Mali. Or they send troops over to quell the uprising of citizens and the dismantling of their own corrupt government like we just recently saw with Kazakhstan.

You could compare NATO as a military equivalent to the EU. The vast majority of European economies are too small to compete globally, so they’ve banded together to join forces and be able to compete on the world stage. NATO is similar. And the fact that Russia is still attempting to move West could be the argument that means NATO is still relevant.	removed	existing	[0.68567955 0.31432045]

The consequences for Russia making war against Ukraine will be irreversible. Russians have two choices; 1) Keep Putins dictatorship and his wanting to make Russia more like the old soviet, hence moving even more away from democracy, unilateral relationships and an even larger poor population. 2) Asassinate Putin and move towards becoming a more prosper and democratic(not democratic now) country.

Agreed.  It should be either:  > I *have* watched it nine times already.  or  > I watched it for the ninth time.  &nbsp;   (Putting "already" at the end would also be more of an AmE construction. BrE would more typically use *"I have already watched it..."*. Colloquial AmE is far more flexible with its use of "already" overall.)  &nbsp;   The only way the English sentence would be grammatically solid is as a response to the very specific question:   *"Would you like to watch this film for the ninth time?"*    Not the eighth or tenth time; not just "watch it again"; but very specifically "for the ninth time".  Even then, a native speaker would normally arrange the reply to that question as:   *"I already watched this film for the ninth time yesterday."*   with "yesterday" at the end as additional information not crucial to the core response.	existing	existing	[0.68567497 0.314325  ]

If the RF was going to invade, they’d do it away from media attention. Notice how both the Georgian conflict, and Crimea both caught the media off guard?   They were playing catch-up to report past events. When the media is constantly going on and on, It’s manufactured hype for views/click. I highly doubt Russia will actually invade under the current circumstances. Russia literally cannot afford a war right now.   Russia has also built up troops along their western border every year since 2015. Its “yearly training”, which is obviously intended to be “provocative” without a doubt. But it’s not as if there is an ongoing invasion? They’re just at the border, and honestly more like ~400Km from the border.   Essentially:  Russia won’t invade currently, and especially not while media attention is at its peak. They always catch the media off guard it seems (Crimea and Georgian conflict). This isn’t a new move on the behalf of the RF, it happens yearly.	existing	existing	[0.6856812  0.31431878]

I can see Putin's logic when it comes to geopolitical issues like Ukraine, Georgia, etc. Having lived in Russia in the early '90s, I can also appreciate that Putin has brought wealth and stability to Russia, and that Russians like that. As an American, I also know better than to blindly trust whatever agenda American media is pushing.  However, what I can't excuse Putin for is shutting down independent media and murdering journalists. That alone is enough to make me believe he's a dictator, regardless of how many dogs he pets.   I personally know several Russian people who worked as journalists and had their offices raided by Putin, were threatened and beaten by State forces, had to leave the country for their own safety, and had their friends and colleagues murdered. These people were not "tools of the West." These people were following the money and reporting on State corruption, and had their whole lives ruined.   If Putin is such a clean, upstanding leader who has Russia's best interests at heart, why does he shut down independent media? Why does he murder journalists? If he really has nothing to hide, he should have no problem with Russians reporting on their government.  And yes, I know the West is also corrupt. I know they also lie and cover up. But that is not the question I'm asking, here, so "the West does bad things, too" won't be a satisfying answer or absolve Putin from murdering multiple journalists and closing all independent media outlets.   I'd really like to hear an answer to my question that is not "well, America did a bad thing too." How can you believe that Putin is a good, honest leader when he murders the people asking him questions?  Thank you for your input. I hope we all have a safe and healthy year.	removed	existing	[0.6856812 0.3143188]

American here, yes. But its interesting to know that Russians are simultaneously desperate to turn Ukraine in to Russian territory, while decrying how no one would ever want them (literally just means the west to you) to be THEIR asset. And then cites nord stream to say why.   The reason nord stream occured is because Ukraine is between Russia and Europe and can tax the oil being sent through its territory. Obviously and naturally, this pissed Russia off. But then to turn around and claim "SEE! WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM!" While you're actively doing the exact opposite on the ground. Ok, then give back Crimea and never deal with Ukraine again, then? Hell, that'd even get the western sanctions off your back.  Seems like it SHOULD BE a  win win from a russian's perspective.   Furthermore, Russia has a smaller GDP (1.29 trillion, though i think thats up to 1.4 now, $8,735 per capita) than a single US state, Texas (1.7 trillion gdp, $58,000 per capita). With around 5 times as much population (29.3 million vs 144million) . So why is it the case that the same shouldn't ALSO be said of Russia, if it should be said of Ukraine in the first place?   The cold hard truth is, Russia put its self in the position its in. The cold hard truth is russians are a bit wrapped up in a superiority complex. And the cold hard truth is, the world needs the Russian people to stand up to their own government. No ill will friend, just a frustrated plea for sanity from a fellow human on this planet.	removed	existing	[0.68567955 0.31432045]

Russian Ark is incredible and very easy to follow with or without subtitles. It's a fun story through Russian history, and it was shot in a literal single-take through the Hermitage. I think it took them three attempts and they got it on the final day they were allowed to film.  So I highly recommend it, it's just great and also technically impressive.  Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears won an Oscar for Best Foreign Picture, and it's a pretty good Soviet-era film.   Morozka is a hilarious Soviet film based on old folklore. It's super campy but just watch and enjoy how utterly bizarre it is. I loved it and I'm usually a stuck up film snob lol  Another one by Tarkovsy is Andrei Rublev, it's very slow like Stalker but not as avant garde. It goes through mideaval Russia and has some amazing scenes (battles at Vladimir, naked pagans in the night, etc.) It's slow, but up there with Stalker as a masterpiece.  Some of these movies may be on youtube for free (especially Mosfilm ones, but the Criterion ones for Tarkovsy look amazing.)

Kuban dialect is easily understood unlike Ukrainian to most Russians. Kuban was populated by people from Black Sea and Don Cossack hosts. Don is considered to be Russian.      Russian language is separated by 3 dialects groups: Northern, Middle and Southern. Standard Russian is based on a Middle dialect. Southern dialect was/is spoken in Rostov. Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian form a dialectal continuum. Thus, it's not surprising Rostov dialect is closer to Ukrainian than a standard Russian. It does not sound as a standard Ukrainian any way you slice it.      Russian dialects disappearing as there was no will to protect them unlike Ukrainian that enjoyed official status in Ukrainian SSR.	existing	existing	[0.6856807 0.3143193]

Since then Ukraine has been fighting Russian separatists in the east that are oddly well funded, so well funded that they were able to get their hands on anti-air weapons and shot down a passenger plane, MH17, where over 200 people died. And now Russia started moving a lot of troops to the border of Ukraine, given past events of course Ukraine and other nations are wary of what Russia might do.	removed	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431898]

When it happened, I was a fool to condemn this Putin's proactive move of taking over Crimea until i saw the Ukrainian action in Donbass. I thought that the ukrainians should have been allowed to kill somebody in Crimea so that the whole world sees it and doesn't ask any questions when Russia interferes. I see that the world doesn't give a single fuck about any Russian or Ukrainian life in its goal to contain Russia.

Do you know why changing of ruling parties and having political opposition are important for the people? Because ruling party without opposition staying for too long in power is not so interested in doing what people elected them to do. As a result the government can do what they want regardless of people will. Authoritarian regimes tend to suppress opposition and control media since they can become dangerous for ruling party. That is why I think it is absolutely reasonable to treat current government form in Russia as regime. It has all criteria met to be called like that. On the other hand I do not state that presidential election in USA is a democracy in a nutshell. But USA has way more mature political institutions in states and lower level.

[Yuri Dimitriev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_A._Dmitriev) is a historian who was making himself notable by investigating Great Terror in Karelia and became interested in NKVD created mass graves. He was subsequently charged with blatantly false charges that even appeals court has thrown out, and then recharged again, and sentenced. There has been an attempt by regime media to revise the nature of mass graves found, and after a local museum director criticised this, he [too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandarmokh#New_digs,_an_alternative_hypothesis) was put into jail.  Most British historians I assume operate outside of purpose-given grants. There's  chaired fellows (a technical term) who benefit from blanket grants to institutions like universities, there's even people making a living off being revisionist, like infamous David Irving, and plain selling books and attracting fans. I don't think Timothy Snyder had a special purpose grant for investigating materials that formed basis for his book Bloodlands. The original claim was that NATO countries are stifling historical research and this is the only reason why nobody knows Forest Brothers were Nazi, but Timothy Snyder for example makes a point of being critical of UPA, hardly a convenient thing for the cackling villains at NATO headquarters situated on mount doom.	existing	existing	[0.68568015 0.31431982]
I don’t even know how to fucking respond to this, but nuclear threats are much more complicated and not as likely to happen due to the after effects and consequences of even just threatening to use that against a country. Americans over exaggerate a lot when it comes to this topic without even realizing who is truly going to be affected the most. Also, might I add that I am American. Yes, Americans can be concerned for what is happening, but they need to educate themselves a lot better on the situation and understand how our media also makes us feel about these current events happening. I hope nothing happens, I truly don’t. I don’t like seeing anything like this in any part of the world and I am sad. I have friends deeply affected by this and all our American peers can do is irrationalize their own fears in a situation that doesn’t hurt them as much as others due to what they have been taught.	existing	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431898]

Never do I hear 'evil Russian people'.   The same goes for Europeans dislike Putin. We see these things in media because it's what media says we should act or feel. But general perception, a countryman is going to love their country but dislike their own government (wanting change) before they 'dislike' another country and their president. Put media aside and think wow how much do I really really dislike Xi Jinping? Oh man my blood boils when I hear Naruhito, or Hasina? More than likely you don't get a rise out of them because they are not your leaders and not your country. But..media and perception.	existing	existing	[0.68568015 0.3143199 ]

Not really an “invasion” per se. Russia already had military control of Crimea, thanks to an early 90s agreement with Ukraine. Not a single person died during the takeover, which was mandated by numerous referendums by the Crimean people who never really felt “at home” in Ukraine, and really had enough of Ukrainian rule after the illegal Maidan putsch. There might have been some minor incursions into Donbas, but even that’s disputable. So, this supposed “invasion” was mostly a myth spread by the post-Maidan Ukrainian regime and its Western handlers.	existing	existing	[0.6856811  0.31431893]

It depends on what you like. You could find entertainment of any kind in Moscow. Visit Red Square, Lenins Mausoleum, Victory Parade (9th May), just walk the streets of old city.  Visit Golden Ring (cities around Moscow), Nizhniy Novgorod (don't confuse with Vilikiy Novgorod... you should visit this to, though). In summer there will be swimming event, to swim across Volga river - they stop all navigation for several hours. You could take slot for 1 km, it is quiet easy (or boats will save you if you fail). I could be interesting, to cross the largest river of Europe.   Also there are lots of good sport events in Moscow or Piter.  Dmitrov to the north is nice town with ground fortress. There is balloon club, you could fly over Dmitrov and river channels, very beautiful sight.   Kazan is fine, only 1 night at train, 4-5k roubles one way. Visit also nearby Sviyazhsk (fortress made by Ivan the Terrible to prepare for storm of Kazan), Vilikiy Bolgar (ancient capital city).

Are you really from another planet?   And this is not only in Germany, this applies to all homosexual Europe!   In Spain, an 8-year-old girl, with the support of a lawyer, won a gender reassignment trial! probably today she sewed a man's dick!   why are you surprised, alien?   A British hospital has advised its staff to refer to mothers as "birth parents", fathers as "second biological parents", and breast milk as "human milk" or "breast milk". It was decided here that too explicit indication of gender could offend people of the so-called non-binary gender, that is, who do not identify themselves as either men or women.   One of the first to get excited was female athletes. Many remember the very recent scandal with the New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard. Previously, her name was Gavin, and after the sex change, Hubbard began to compete in women's championships, immediately taking several gold and silver awards.   In Germany, Switzerland, France, Austria, Scandinavian countries, unique methods of sexual education are generally practiced: they don’t just talk about it in class, but encourage children to experiment with same-sex as early as possible, that is, first “please yourself”, and then - “ The age of sexual consent needs to be reconsidered." In Holland, a few years ago, a party of pedophiles was officially registered, which intended to participate in elections: it called for reducing the age of sexual relations to at least 10-12 years. And in Switzerland, they have already launched the production of condoms in children's size, that is, for ten-year-old boys. The argument that we, as traditionally oriented people, consider all this to be unnatural, means little to “them”. On the contrary, the more unnatural, the more desirable it is to be put into practice.	removed	existing	[0.68567973 0.31432027]

Not because of the convoy, but because the omicron wave is ending. It sounds like Saskatchewan (a province in the prairies) will end restrictions this week.	existing	existing	[0.68567955 0.31432045]

I think you’re categorizing “westerners” into a large group. Our national media doesn’t represent us.

Few people could tell you anything about Ukraine other than they’re against Russia and Russia *allegedly* “hacked” the US 2016 elections.

I didn't see this mentioned already but maybe it's worth it. The following excludes colloquialisms for куда that use the dative since we are discussing where-ness.   Где - adverb that requires nominative case to follow.  Ex - Where is your mom? Где твоя мама?   Куда - preposition that implies the locative property of the accusative case and implies movement to something. Whether it's moving the spoon to the table or walking home from school.    Ex - Where did you put the spoon? Куда ты поставила ложку? Answer - на стол.  (To) Where are you going (right now)? Куда идёшь? Домой с школы иду.	existing	existing	[0.6856807  0.31431934]
I can with an honest heart say I love the russian people, in so far as I've had any experience with them. And I see little use in joining NATO. But as a swedish soldier and teacher, I see no use in lying. I see little use in lies and thinly veiled threats.   Why should we not react when the Russian state makes such provocations? It's not like we are in a position to attack you. So these silly quips about "Estonia and Sweden are hightening the aggression"? Come on! It isn't 1698 or something! And yes, I do understand NATO wants to use us as pawns, I get that. But does that make threats directed at us any better?  And honestly, if it came to blows, to me it matters little to me that you would kill me in the end. No matter what, my native soil is mine. And no amount of death can turn wrong into right.

It depends on so much factors that it's impossible to answer: your age, your natural proficiency in acquiring languages, which material you have access to, how much time you can afford to spend on it...  The [US Foreign Service Institute](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) considers Russian a Category III language, meaning they estimate it takes 44 weeks to reach full working proficiency, which is of course quite a bit more than just being able to hold a conversation. But this is for studying the language *full-time*, they mention 1100 class hours, i.e. 25 hours a week, which is in itself already very hard for a casual leaner who has other responsibilities like study/work, but students are also expected to work on the language outside of class.  That being said, if you work consistently at least an hour every day, 6 months is very reasonable for having simple conversations.	existing	existing	[0.6856807  0.31431934]

**I will give you three perspectives on paying for dates**  **Conservative:** it is a man’s duty to care for, provide for, and protect their woman. Paying for dates falls under providing. Splitting the bill does not allow him to show he will provide for you, signifies you are not seriously interested in him, or both  **Liberal:** times have changed, men and women are more or less equal, and we must continue taking steps towards equality. Both men and women are equally capable of earning money and are therefore equally capable of paying for a date. A man paying for a woman’s date is sexist of him and shows the women is willing to accept financial control from a man; a strong independent woman pays for her own half  **Radical:** men and women are fundamentally different. Women have far more to lose (low chance of orgasm, risk of STDs, potential pregnancy) in sexual relationships. On top of this, society is dominated by men and women are routinely oppressed  A man must display that he will provide value to your life rather than exploit you. Paying for dates is one way to display that, especially when society financially favors men (men pay >>> women pay, # of men leaders >>> # of women leaders, women pay $$$ for cosmetics, body body care, etc)  Like conservatism, not paying for dates does not allow him to display his value to you, signifies you are not interested, or both  **How this relates to Russians and your situation**  Russia has both strong elements of conservatism (since forever) and radicalism (Soviet Union) from its past. This colors your boyfriend’s worldview  America, on the other hand, is a liberal society. While we are split politically, but businesses and the media solidly endorse liberalism. So this colors your worldview  I hope this offers new perspectives to you and helps guide your decision, whatever it may be.

Thats the russian propaganda version. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War  Russian troops had illicitly crossed the Russo-Georgian state border through the Roki Tunnel and advanced into the South Ossetian conflict zone by 7 August before the Georgian military response.[neutrality is disputed][note 4][38][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] Russia accused Georgia of "aggression against South Ossetia",[40] and launched a full-scale land, air and sea invasion of Georgia on 8 August which Russia called a "peace enforcement" operation.[48] Russian and South Ossetian forces fought Georgian forces in and around South Ossetia for several days, until Georgian forces retreated. Russian and Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge held by Georgia. Russian naval forces blockaded part of the Georgian coast. The Russian air force attacked targets beyond the conflict zone, in undisputed parts of Georgia. This was the first war in history in which cyber warfare coincided with military action. An information war was also waged during and after the conflict. Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, negotiated a ceasefire agreement on 12 August.  Russian forces temporarily occupied the Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti and Gori, holding on to these areas beyond the ceasefire. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August and the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. Russian international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014. In 2021, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russia maintained "direct control" over the separatist regions and was responsible for grave human rights abuses taking place there.[49][50]	existing	existing	[0.6856797  0.31432027]

Heres an easy example for you. Imagine you are living in San Diego. Joe Biden decides as a show of good faith to Mexico, gifts the territory of San Diego to Mexico. All of a sudden you have hundreds of thousands of families living under Mexico’s economy.   Corruption and cartel influence quickly sweeps over San Diego and now those families that have invested their lives towards their properties are now stuck and can’t leave without severely crippling financial consequences. Unrest breaks out and now the US government is receiving immense pressure to provide military aid. US forces begin to line up next to the border.   Ukraine was founded in 1991.

Totally agree. I was apolitical 10 years ago. I even dreamed to move to the US. But after I have started to read English freely on Reddit I became radical patriot.  And more important I started to to be more proud of my country. Now I love and respect Russia more than ever, thanks to US and western dumb propaganda.  For the past 4 years I am working in EU, and my eyes were opened how western propaganda could be much worse than Russian media.  I am thinking to move back to Moscow, because almost everything is better there back home. One downside is inflation and unstable Russian ruble. But everything else is much much better: smart people, deep culture, great social services, free healthcare, cheap taxes, cheap cost of living, very easy to live if you have education and profession.	existing	existing	[0.6856803  0.31431973]

>Let’s say Finland is invaded, will Portugal help because it is in the opposite side of the EU? Probably not, because France and Germany are stronger, and Estonia and Sweden are closer.  Contrary to the upvotes this assertion will yield you from Russians, there is no legal opt-out of the mutual defense clause on basis of geographic distance.   "If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power."  &#x200B;  >it states that the CSDP provides framework through to carry out military missions defined by the article 42.3 of the TEU; and there is probably like 10 different missions, with different participating countries in each mission. In practice, it means the EU as a whole does not have framework to unite all its Member States forces, let’s say in case of an invasion.  I am not sure how this conclusion follows from the preceding.  &#x200B;  >The competences defined by the TFEU state no military competences, and under shared competences between the EU and Member States in the article 4. (j) vaguely states “area of freedom, security, and justice” which is where the CSDP falls under with some countries actually opting-out of the military operations carried out under the CSDP.  Well this is fair enough, but also none of the current missions are based on what is legally dead set requirement.   &#x200B;  >It is extremely complex to manage a union of 27 different countries, and even though there is a framework for joint military exercices and operations, there is absolutely no framework to “what are we going to do in case we are invaded”.  So is it actual existence of contingency planning that makes NATO a military anti russian alliance, but not EU? Kind of funny.  &#x200B;  >The treaties exist for a reason, so there can be a gradual change in how institutions work and operate, and at the moment we are slowly moving towards a federalised EU.

Hola hermano colombiano, soy Argentino. Te recomiendo unos canales de youtube como Bald & Bankrupt (este va cuidad por cuidad de paises slavos no solamente Rusia y en muchos videos hace la mitica pregunta ed que si vivian mejor antes en la URSS, muy resumidamente el sentimiento por la URSS es algo meramente nostalgico pero no era mejor y nadie con menos de 30 años piensa que la URSS era mejor)     Arielosky es un chileno que literalmente copia el estilo de Bald & Bankrupt hasta inclusive la font de los subtitulos pero debo admitir que el chileno tiene su caracter que lo hace unico y se informa muy bien a cada cuidad que va, Ariel solo visita cuidades de Rusia al contrario del pelado ingles que va por muchos paises slavos.  &#x200B;  Luis Romviro es un español que hace mas videos comunes como de preguntas y respuestas sobre Rusia, esta bien para informarse un poco pero no sale de Moscu y creo que la mentalidad que tiene otra gente que vive en otras cuidades es distinta.  &#x200B;  Yeah Russia es una chica que vive khabarovsk y esta bueno para ver otra parte de Rusia mas del lado este, digamos que el este de Rusia no es nada que ver con el oeste y los sentimientos que tiene ella hacia su pais no son muy buenos, aunque ultimamente esta mucho mas positiva hubo momentos duros de "depresion" hacia su pais, me gusta porq es como ver la contra parte y no quedarse con la mirada de una sola moneda     NFKRZ es un chico que ahora mismo esta viviendo en ST Peterburg y hace videos sobre cultura moderna en Rusia, trata temas politicos y de la sociedad comun como artistas memes etc, No me gusta mucho de los que nombre aca me parece el peor pero tiene algun que otro video que es interesante, sobre todo el que va a una feria en ST Peterburgo que venden cosas sovieticas con Bald & Bankrupt     Si tenes alguna duda o queres saber algo capaz que te puedo ayudar en español, todavia no visite Rusia pero es mi plan a futuro vivir alli, las cosas como bien sabras no estan muy bien en Argentina y mi destino se que es ir a vivir alla asique estoy peleando cada dia con el idioma	removed	existing	[0.6856822  0.31431776]
You're welcome, good luck with your studies and make sure to focus on content that produces accurate Russian subtitles for Russian content if you need it and make sure this is your default language if you're using aids like Language Reactor.

Thanks for the answer. It seems I am sometimes confused with the prefixes so I have an additional question if you don't mind. Does adding a prefix to a verb always create a completely new verb?  Or are there prefixes that just slightly differ the verb but essentially it behaves the same. I don't know if this question makes sense lol but in my head you have a verb and you can add all kinds of prefixes to slightly alter it but in it's essence it's still the same verb. But seems it's not really like that	existing	existing	[0.68567955 0.31432042]

Russian has a way of phrasing things quite a bit differently than English. It may help you to translate in two ways: the literal translation and the more natural translation. For example, "She is five years old" translates to Ей пять лет, but the literal translation is "To her are five of years." Or to say "He is a mechanic," it's just Он - механик.  Don't worry, in a little while it will start to seem much more natural. It's a different system and things don't always translate 1:1. I daresay things don't *often* translate 1:1.	existing	existing	[0.6856792  0.31432083]
I have a related question, I hope it's okay to ask here.  Historical accuracy or inaccuracy notwithstanding, the main insight that I gleaned from this book was a positive message. Despite all of the hardships, it seemed to me that Ivan Denisovich had a good day. This realization changed my perspective on life.  The number of choices that Ivan made in the course of his day were astounding. Even in a labor camp, he was able in small ways to influence his surroundings, his world. It made me realize that even at their worst, things aren't so bad, and one can get used to hardship.  Did anyone else feel this way, or am I the only one? Or is this perhaps a result of my Western thought process?	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.3143195 ]

>Der Deutsche Ich-Laut ist ein palataler Konsonant (der palatale Frikativ). Die russischen Konsonanten sind palatalisiert, nicht palatal. Palatal bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge berührt den harten Gaumen, und palatalisiert bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge nähert sich ihm.  Interessant, das wusste ich nicht. Hab mich aber auch noch nie mit der deutschen Phonetik beschäftigt. Nur mit der englischen in der Uni. Da gibts ja soweit ich weiß zumindest keine palatalen oder palatalisierten Phoneme (anders als im Russischen).   Wahrscheinlich würde es sich aber mal lohnen, mir auch die deutsche Phonetik mal anzuschauen. Je besser man die Eigenheiten der eigenen Aussprache kennt, desto besser kann man dann einen starken Akzent in anderen Sprachen vermeiden.

Like many old short words, "так" has a lot of close shades of meaning. Literally, "так"="thus" is the answer to "как?"="how". But in your two examples the underlying meaning of "так" is a little different.  [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian)  In the first, it's mentioned in the wiktionary: "так и не" = "never". You can parse it literally as "You still didn't say" = "Ты так и не сказал". "Так и" has a sense of continuing the same way. "Он так и продолжал плыть по течению". "Ты так и продолжал не говорить мне, как это сделать" - a little clunky but grammatically it works.  In the second example, "I told Tom exactly this", "и" usually means that you agree with some previous statement. "Я Тому так сказал: не ешь незнакомые грибы!" (I told Tom this: don't eat unfamiliar mushrooms") is one step from a dialogue like this:  >B: Том вчера отравился грибами   >   >A: Я бы незнакомые грибы ни за что не стал есть   >   >B: Я Тому так и сказал: не ешь незнакомые грибы! (what B said to Tom doesn't need to exactly coincide with what A said to B, but B still emphasizes his agreement with A's sentiment.)   >   >B: Я Тому так и сказал! - (also works, what exactly B said to Tom is implied. In this instance it's not very clear, maybe my example is not the best, or maybe B is not clinically precise in his everyday speech)  If it seems weird that "how/thus" means "what/this", it's not rare but not very common. "Как он поступил?" = "What did he do?" (in English there is "how did he behave" which has a similar weirdness of how \~ what). It *is* especially common around verbs of speech, I don't logically understand the nuances well enough to explain it. Why is it "Так говорил Заратустра", and not "Что говорил Заратустра" or "Это говорил Заратустра"?	existing	existing	[0.6856786  0.31432137]

Oh, I forgot to add. you have lower corruption indices corny because there is lobbying (I don't know for Canada, to be honest).  although in fact it's the same thing.

Could you please clarify your point? Polish people despise Russia’s aggressions (see: Katyn, Molotov–Ribbentrop, just to name a few) and are happy to lean more to the west. We WANT to be in NATO. And all those other countries are free to choose. While I’m a fan of Russian culture, these aggressions are not deniable and I hope you understand why a country like Poland would feel safer being in NATO.	removed	existing	[0.68568003 0.31431997]

You should not give it too much attention. It's part of the 'you need to feel it' part of a language. Nobody gives a shit if you mix в and на .

It's sometimes used in regular speech: for example, "(нам) здесь не пройти" = "we can't pass here" (note that even the pronoun can be dropped - which shows that this is just an extension of Passive, not a separate construction). Or "здесь негде припарковаться" (there's nowhere to park here) - come to think of it, traffic situations seem to love Passive.  However I believe it's far more widespread in poetry. I guess the reason is that this construction sounds more final and fatalistic than a simple assumption "мы здесь не пройдём": like there's an irresistible outside force that prevents the action. Poets love the notion of fate.	existing	existing	[0.6856804  0.31431958]

Most of Ukraine thinks in Russian, but they are definitely in a phase of trying to switch most things: TV, street signs and the like into Ukrainian. So I’d say Ukraine is a poor choice if you want full immersion. In addition to Russian, you’ll have Ukrainian words here and there and both will inevitably slip into your vocabulary. And you’ll have less access to purely Russian media, as some are literally banned there. So, the people will speak Russian, but also speak a lot of Ukrainian… I think this akin to going to the US to learn English and then living in Chinatown where most people speak Chinese AND English.	existing	existing	[0.68568027 0.31431973]

Both Russians and Ukrainians are heirs of Ancient Rus.   The continuity of the Russians, in my opinion, is straighter. I am considering culture. Pre-Mongol ancient Rus is part of historical memory, part of Russian mythology.   There are epics. Several cycles of epics are known. The epics of the "Kiev cycle" are so called because ancient Kiev appears there. They were found in the north of Russia.   As far as I know, the core of the cultural mythology of Ukrainians is more recent: Polish oppression and the Cossacks.   And when you think about Russia and Ukraine. Try to draw parallels with Prussia and Bavaria.	existing	existing	[0.68568134 0.3143186 ]

These are not just a few examples, this is all that you could squeeze out of yourself. Deportation cannot under any circumstances be compared with direct genocide, rape, torture and murder of millions of people. Comparing such things and putting them in a row is a cheap trick and a substitution of concepts. I myself am a descendant of deported Estonians. My great-grandmother Adelia Rastas was deported to the Murmansk region when the war began, she became a member of a partisan detachment and fought against the Fins and the Germans.  The Katyn shooting is one of the reasons why Poles do not like Russians. They did not forgive or forget anything, as required by, for example, from the Russians in relation to the Germans. Katyn was a kind of response to Poland to how they, in turn, dealt with Soviet prisoners taken prisoner during the Polish-Soviet War of the 1919-1920s.    **From the note of the NKID of the RSFSR to the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Charge d'affaires of the Polish Republic T. Fillipovich on the situation and death of prisoners of war in Polish camps (September 9, 1921):**   "*The responsibility of the Polish Government entirely remains the indescribable horrors that are still happening with impunity in places like the Strzalkovo camp. It is enough to point out that 60,000 of 130,000 Russian prisoners of war in Poland died within two years."*   Russian historian Mikhail Meltyukhov estimates the number of dead prisoners at 60 thousand people, the same number is given by I. V. Mikhutin.   And according to the calculations of the military historian M. V. Filimoshin, the number of Red Army soldiers who died and died in Polish captivity is 82,500 people.   A. Kolpakov estimates the number of deaths in Polish captivity at 89 thousand 851 people.  I'm sure you don't care about that. When russians are killed, I'm sure it's OK for you, but when Russians start paying the same coin to their opponents, all of a sudden everyone start whining that need to forget and forgive everything, that this is a limited view that leads to eternal conflicts. Bullshit! These double standards just make me sick. Thus, there will be no Russians on Earth at all (but apparently the Europeans only want this) if we allow ourselves to be exterminated with impunity and do not fight back against our opponents.	existing	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431943]

 I did not join this sub to argue with you. Or anyone. But since  you asked.   Even if I accept (and I don't) that there was a fair vote in Crimea and they voted to join Russia, that does not give Russia the right to take it over. The sanctity of national borders is well established international law.  As to other counties joining NATO (or wanting to)...  They ARE sovereign countries. They can do what they want. And the more aggressive Russia gets with their neighbours, the more likely they are to join NATO. Russia's actions are doing the exact opposite of what Putin says he wants. If fact, it is almost like he WANTS Sweden and Finland to join NATO.	removed	existing	[0.68567944 0.31432056]

Random side note from a Baltic viewpoint: Sweden is worried about 3 extra amphibious landing ships on the Baltic Sea. They raised the alert level of troops on Gotland, called reservists to service on that island, and [sent]](https://www.dn.se/sverige/militar-utryckningsstyrka-landsatt-pa-gotland/)  additional troops to Gotland by air transport today.  Translating:  > "On Friday, the rapidly deteriorating world situation prompted the Armed Forces to deploy its operational contingency unit on Gotland. Equipment and personnel flew with an American C-17 plane, an international collaboration in which Sweden has a share. The plane took off from the base Papá in Hungary and flew to Kallax in Norrbotten."  Sweden is neutral - has been neutral for many generations. Last participated in a war in 1814. It does not depend on foreign tech, produces its own energy, makes its own planes and boats... it has no reason to bluff for anyone.  I am concerned. If non-aligned governments are making defensive moves that cost significant effort, serious miscalculations might be about to really happen. :(	removed	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431922]

The trap is if you borrow *before* you has already grown, you are considered risky and the money is expensive for you. Automatically, to pay the higher rates, you have to conduct more risky business. It is a common knowledge that the higher is the risk, the higher is the possible reward, i don't have a single link to provide you to prove this point.

Do you mean the lands that belonged to the Russian Empire a century before Finland was even created?        The winter war happened as a result of Finland allying with nazi Germany. Not to mention that USSR tried to solve the issue with Leningrad protection diplomatically.        And no, Russia didn't "demand" that you won't join NATO. The only thing Russia states is that it'll react to it. Like, of course, it would. Moreover, literally every time, Russia notes that it values the independence and neutrality of Finland. I guess, unlike your government.        Soviet military base? Do you mean the one USSR rented and closed in the '50s as a showing of goodwill?        Influencing your policy? A big neighbor would always influence the policy of every country. That doesn't mean that Russia tells you what to do.        As far as I can see, even according to Finland, all airspace violations are minor intersections of far ilands when Russian planes conduct pre-declared flights. Nothing like Russia trying to intimidate Finland with its military capabilities. To be clear, I don't justify it. Every such incident is a fuck up from our military. I just don't see them as intentional ones.        As far as I can see, your recent history is following the steps of baltic states.

This question is a clear proof of how the west succeeded in minimizing the roles and losses Russia and China in WWII（Each losing 27 million and 28 million people，while the US 600 thousand people。There's NO ONE FAMILY in Russia that hasn't lost at least one relative in WWII）in defeating Germany and Japan。Russia and China are COMPLETELY out of the frame of anything about WWII remembrance till the point that in 2014，Angela Merkel（the chancellor of the country these leaders are celebrating the defeat of） was invited to V day remembrance ceremony but NOT Vladimir putin or Xi ginping。Western revisionism is very effective in minimizing the suffering of others（even though it's much MUCH greater than theirs，if there's any to speak of）while shutting down any conversation of other people's suffering，especially if it was them who caused / are causing the suffering，which is the case in most cases。Just look at the Refugee crises and how theyre being talked about（not talking about the suffering of mil lions in wars that their countries started，just talking about their hate to brown people and how theyre rapists）。Look at 9/11 and the complete horror it brought to middle Eastern countries via American imperialism。No monuments to the 3 million dead，42 million displaced，but MANY ones for the 3,000 that died on that day。I pity westerners and what remained of their humanity，and l wish they regain it in the next 200 years	existing	existing	[0.68568134 0.3143186 ]
I am russian and i think it's a stretch to say that Red Army saved Poland. Afaik there was a Soviet-Polish war prior to WW2 so it was reasonable to be hostile to USSR for poles. USSR was as brutal to it's own subjects as to other nations.  In broader historical context though i would argue Russia was not nearly as bad as some of our neighbours claim.	existing	existing	[0.68568003 0.31431994]

>Би-би-си  HAHAHAHAHAHA   BBC Fake News!!!!   BBC Cookbook: British fakers are torn between lies, self-censorship and secret duty!!!!   The British Broadcasting Corporation BBC admitted that filming the aftermath of the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma in April 2018 is nothing more than a staging. However, the staging is bloody - since the virtual "chemical attack" of Bashar al-Assad became the reason for another US cruise missile attack on Syria!   The search for "Russian influence", like obsessive Russophobia, has become a trademark of BBC news stories.   when the theme of the “hand of the Kremlin” began to be pedaled in his materials in the French anti-government speeches of the “yellow vests”. Earlier, Olga Ivshina, correspondent of the BBC Russian Service, admitted in a personal correspondence with one of the Russian correspondents in Paris that the channel’s management requires any evidence of “Russian interference” in the “yellow vests” protests in France from employees.   “The editors demand blood,” Ivshina told the stringer.   By the way, this is the same Ivshina who was noted in the story of the Boeing MH-17 flight crash in the sky over the Donbass and the subsequent BBC self-censorship. In her report from the crash site, she blabbed that local residents saw combat Ukrainian aircraft in the sky shortly before the crash.   As a result, this video was very quickly removed from the BBC Russian Service website under the pretext of "imperfect structure and due to incomplete compliance with editorial values." Not a fake - but a very characteristic feature of the British handling of information.   In order to fabricate the material required by the BBC management, Ivshina unashamedly admits that "the editors are demanding blood." The situation turned out to be so hopeless that she began to sort out the most absurd options.   Even before Trump's official inauguration, the BBC released a full-length "investigative journalism" with the telling title "Trump: the Kremlin's candidate?". In it, British journalist John Sweeney, known for his anti-Russian views, poured all the hodgepodge of rumors about Trump onto the heads of viewers, including the alleged “KGB compromising evidence” on him, thoughtful sophistication about the location of the Miss Universe pageant, and Trump’s love for Eastern European girls. All this was interspersed with statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin.   “I'm really surprised that the BBC is broadcasting fake news. There is no news."   This phrase was said in February 2017 by the head of the UK Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn, leaving the BBC Breakfast program with Charlie State.   The BBC is just one of the elements, and far from the most dangerous. Goebbels, however, did such things better than the Anglo-Saxons and the BBC are doing now.	removed	existing	[0.6856804  0.31431958]

At the moment troops of russian army is in Crimea, which de jure considered Ukrainian territory. I know that you probably won’t agree with that and I suggest not to discuss Crimea’s affiliation.  Russian troops are also on Ukrainian - Belarus border. And that is far away from Russian territory. I mean it looks like Ukraine reacts on it quite reasonably.

It's easier for the europeans to be just "critical" of a nation with an extremely scarce history of conquest, that also resides on the other side of the world with only peaceful neighbours. Than it is to just be "critical" of a historically expansionist country that only recently (historically speaking) occupied or puppeted half of them, and said state has also been seemingly returning to that policy. Georgia and now the Ukraine. You can't really compare the two as equals, as they aren't. The US has been the leading hegemony for a long time now, and they haven't expanded militarily at all during that time.   I'm not saying that russia is some crazy imperialist like so many countries were a hundred years ago, but even if one might not like it, the different responses the US and Russia gets is understandable.  Oh and it does not help the fact that one country is led by what is basically a dictator (even if the other ones "democracy" is faaaar from perfect).	removed	existing	[0.6856795  0.31432047]

We must sprint this distance in ten years. Either we do it or we get crushed   He foresaw the future war for ten years before, and was mistaken in his calculations for only 4 months!

Yep, and it was for the sake of defending the motherland against the Nazi aggressors, of which the USSR predicted would end with fascist Finland losing against the Third Reich. So rather than sit back and do nothing they had hoped to trade territory to create a buffer between Leningrad and its border. The Fins obviously refused, lost against the Nazis and eventually joined them, proving the Soviets correct in their fear of the German war machine.	existing	existing	[0.68568057 0.31431946]

I don't know Kentucky's liquor laws but if you have bevmo or total wine, check out their import section. They typically have a number of (mainstream) Russian beers, including the famous 9% Baltika 9!   I went back to Russia for the first time in 9 years a couple of summers ago and the craft brewery scene has taken off. The IPAs were IMHO underwhelming compared to American, but the breweries I frequented excelled in sour styles (including sour IPAs) and dark beers like stouts.

(ISS) is a joint international project involving 14 countries, including: the USA, Russia, Canada, Japan, as well as several European countries acting under the auspices of the European Space Agency. Its design began in 1984, with the order of US President Ronald Reagan, who ordered NASA to develop and build a new orbital space station in 10 years. By the beginning of the 90s, it became clear that the scale and high cost of the project would not allow the United States to create it on its own. The actual construction of the station began in 1998, when Russia, which joined the project, launched the first element of the ISS, the Zarya functional cargo block, into orbit.  Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and American astronaut Robert Cabana were the first to board it.   On July 26, 2000, the Zvezda service module docked with the FGB. It is these three nodes that have become the basic blocks for the start of space cooperation for more than a dozen countries of the world.   In order to fully fulfill their mission, Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd underwent four years of training and education at NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City and at the training center in Munich in Germany to refine the technology conducting many scientific experiments.   Gidzenko, Krikalev and Shepherd established contact with mission control centers in Korolev and Houston. The ISS-1 crew ensured the docking of Progress M1-4 cargo ships in November 2000 and Progress M-44 cargo ships in February 2001 with the station. They also met American shuttles on the ISS - Endeavor in December 2000, Atlantis in February and Discovery in March 2001. In February 2001, the first crew of the ISS assisted in the integration of the American laboratory module Destiny into the ISS.	removed	existing	[0.68568146 0.3143185 ]

I can do the same in Spanish…  Think of a world where most people learn a language of a bordering country that they frequent quite a bit with. For instance, the US with Mexico (Spanish), English with France (French), France with Germany (German), etc. then you have Russia that borders no English speaking countries other than maybe Magadan with Anchorage and English is taught frequently in Russia. That right there proves that Russia is at a failed state in the world sphere.  Russia has a rough history and I really wish we all could be friends, but when your country has the same GDP of Florida…it’s hard to take it seriously in a conventional war. Russia is not the USSR of the late 40s-60s, sure it could get back there. However, it would have to take multiple acts of aggression that NATO + the US will not allow in this day and age.  Sure, hold on to the glories of the past and take over territories forcefully rather than working on making your country prosper and have a higher GDP of fucking Florida.	removed	existing	[0.68567926 0.31432077]

Of course this is all about politics for both sides (Russian and NATO), but ukrainians should be free to choose where to stand, and the fact that they prefer to stand with NATO and EU says a lot about Ukranian-Russian relationships.

Ehh.. Your military force are in an country where they don't belong, killing innocent Ukrainian people. For what purpose? What right does a country have to invade a neighboring country? What right does Russia have to interfere with neighboring politics?   The whole purpose behind Nato is to be a collective force against this unpredictable militaristic behavior, from a country within Europe that still hasn't turned into a true democracy, despite all cultural influences through mass media and all the revolts during the former Soviet Union. The  leader still elects himself by changing the law.   We could have thousands of years of peace in Europe. We could buy your Gas, respect your cultures, visit your country, learn from each other, come closer, connect infrastructure, take away the mistrust. But this paranoid military behavior drives us millions of kilometers apart. It even forces us to seek an ally on the other side of the world, who touches some of our cultural values, but is a whole different nation, and sometimes pushes it too far.   There is however 0 intent throughout Europe to attack or invade Russia. Nobody has that need or urge to make your country smaller, to take a square centimeter of your soil. Russia belongs to the Rus, as it has been for hundreds of years.   But breaking these laws, where you steal back lands that previously belonged to you (krimea) (without asking for international permission, how it should go) And now attacking Ukraine, or any possible other country, could ignite World War 3, thousands could die by this stupid bluffing game. In an era where we agreed to never use wars again to solve diplomatic differences. But here we are today, one paranoid country that has trust issues, disrupting an entire continent. Europe cannot let this go, nobody wants war anymore, but there are lines no country should cross for the sake of our own safety. Borders are there to be respected, countries have formed and shouldn't be altered anymore, especially not by external force and demand, this is what we agreed upon after World War 2, *"This no more"*. Apes fight for territory and power, we're hopefully smarter than that.	removed	existing	[0.6856813  0.31431872]

NATO charter does not define any military competences for NATO as an organisation either, only defines obligations of member states.

Nevertheless, joint EU command exists as an evolving legal and operational [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Security_and_Defence_Policy)   Anyhow, I just found it interesting because as I mentioned, Ukraine got de facto invaded on basis of its EU aspirations while now Russian justifications shifted to alleged and imaginary military threats.	existing	existing	[0.6856809 0.3143191]

Just for your information: the word "Negro" is not offensive. As for you, think about the fact that in relation to Russians, the use of the words "commie", "rusnya", "redneck" is an analogue of the word "nigger" for Negroes. Oh, yes - and hints of the "slave mentality of Russians" - which your politicians allow themselves - are a direct analogue of instructions like "your ancestors were worthless niggers" - taking into account the fact that about 80% of the population of imperial Russia were serfs - that is, in fact slaves.

There’s a few things to unpack here.  I found Russian much easier to learn initially than other languages as a Dyslexic as I find the words more distinguishable from one another compared to French or Spanish. The fact that it is 95% phonetic (almost 100% at a beginner level) will help.  Saying that, if you struggle with languages Russian may not be the best to learn depending on your native language: Check out the USA’s state department table on languages, they need to train staff in foreign languages for certain foreign roles and so have spent a lot of time examining how many hours it takes to learn a language. Even without Dyslexia it’s a very time consuming language to learn and despite enjoying it in hindsight it would have been more productive/useful to learn another language. Getting fluent is all about immersion and it’s hard to immerse yourself in Russian, and I live in Central Europe in a country with a high % of Russian speaker and with a Russian girlfriend.   Also, Dyslexia by its definition covers a number of different learning difficulties and is personal to the individual, advice or techniques for one person generally does not apply to all… People try to sell books to desperate parents by claiming there is specific solutions they can apply to all Dyslexics. It’s marketing. If you have been diagnosed by an Educational Psychologist or Psychiatrist they will be able to tailor learning approaches specific to you and the same goes for languages. You can speak to specialists in language learning that may be able to give you better advice.	existing	existing	[0.68567973 0.31432027]

Yes, I think this is important to point out.  I myself am an American (I want it to be clear I’m an outsider in this sub) who has very negative opinions about my government as well as the sensibilities of many of my fellow citizens.    The government of Putin has been a strong one and has seen the country develop quite a bit since the 90s (from what I understand) but they’ve also engaged in many hostile actions abroad as well as crushing dissent against their rule at home.  The Upper Class, whether they be Russian or American, cares little for those in the working class and often have corrupt ambitions of power and riches.	existing	existing	[0.6856811  0.31431893]
Ok, I've read it in its entirety.  Putin at no point says that Ukraine should be part of Russia.  His points are that:  - the very concept of Ukraine as a country, is rather novel and the birth of the country post ww1 was driven by western powers seeking for a buffer that would counterbalance the newly formed Polish state and the Soviet Russia. He provides a quite detailed explanation behind his points with sources and events.  It's hard to deny much of this point, afterall Ukraine never existed before 1918, differently from countries that were born just 50 years earlier  (like Germany or Italy that completed their reunification process in late 1800s) and had centuries or millenia of a concept of their nation.  - He says that Russia was robbed of territories and he makes quite clear examples: (Crimea, Bessarabia, Galicia, Carpathia, South Eastern Ukraine and some more) that have been incorporated into newly formed Ukrainian state, thanks to the soviets, not "in spite of". He clearly says that Russia was "robbed" because it lost historically Russian territory (pointing to the east and crimea) in a time where Bolsheviks didn't care about internal borders of the soviet union, and he points at how some of these events were even unlawful (like the 1954 gift of Crimea) under soviet law.  While I don't hide the idea that Russia has always had imperialistic ambitions and always considered itself sort of a protector of all slavs, I don't think that many of his points are invalid. Both Yugoslavia and USSR redefined borders at a time of unity, once this unity felt people simply found themselves in "foreign" countries. People bring Georgia up all of the time, but they never ask Abkhazians or Ossetians how do they feel about being Georgians because Stalin decided so 70 years ago.	existing	existing	[0.6856809  0.31431907]

The Pacific Fleet's Volkhov Project 636.2 diesel submarine in the Sea of Japan launched a Kalibr cruise missile that hit a target 1,000 km away. To assess the strike precision, the explosive element was removed from the cruise missile so that it only hit the target with kinetic force.

No one is threatening Russia sovereignty or existence.   I really can't imagine any circumstance in which Russia's sovereignty or existence is threatened. Can you? Seriously? I'd would very much appreciate your thoughts on this.   I am talking about taking over portions of other countries.   And I will pre-empt your argument. Even if I accept (and I don't) that there was a fair vote in Crimea and they voted to join Russia, that does not give Russia the right to take it over. The sanctity of national borders is well established international law.   And we will see what happens with the current situation. I am not at all qualified to have an opinion but I would not be surprised if, this time next year, much of Donbas will be part of Russia. And there will be more sanctions against Russia...hurting the Russian people but not those that have made the decisions that affect them.   And to what end? How has taking over Crimea helped the Russian people? Improve their lives? How will taking over Donbas? What is the point of the rivalry between Russia and Western Europe? How is it helping anyone - particularly in Russia where there is much opportunity to dramatically improve the standard of living.	removed	existing	[0.6856796  0.31432036]

If it does, it probably won't happen for a while though.  The decline of the Roman Empire is said to have spanned from the reign of Commodus (AD 192) to approximately AD 476, but this was at a time when sufficient numbers of people with pitchforks could effectively topple a local governor.  With modern technology, it's a lot more difficult.  Perhaps America is on its decline, but even if they split, I would hardly see any of the successors sinking any lower than say the French or Spanish empires to what France and Spain are today.  France and Spain are still relatively wealthy compared to other countries.  It's just that they aren't globally prominent.  You might have at worst something like Yugoslavia and perhaps they'd lose Hawaii or some Pacific Islands, but I don't see anything going further than that.	existing	existing	[0.68568075 0.31431922]

Salad "VINAIGRETTE"   Thoroughly washed potatoes, beets and carrots boil in a saucepan, and then peel.

The order of preparation:   The cooled vegetables are peeled, cut into cubes, put in a convenient salad bowl.   Sauerkraut get rid of excess liquid, wringing it out with your hands beforehand, add it to other vegetables.   We discard the peas on a sieve, letting the excess liquid drain, pour it into the other ingredients of the vinaigrette.   Now we proceed to the preparation of the dressing, for this we mix lemon juice, spices, herbs, green onion feathers and vegetable oil in a separate bowl.   Fill the vegetables with dressing and mix thoroughly.   Let the salad stand in the refrigerator for about half an hour.	removed	existing	[0.6856808  0.31431916]

Thank you for this answer. I understand some of your arguments here, especially the one regarding Crimeans and self-identification etc. However, the process of making Crimea russian again was kind of suspicious… Lots of armed personell without any identification(?) and then of course the election afterwards… Anyway… that aside…   Do you not contradict yourself here? In one way you say Russia can do whatever it wants with its own troops in its own country. And that this is not provocative. But at the same time you say Ukraine cant do what it wants(?) - it surely cant join nato because rockets and stuff would represent a treath to Russia. But why can Russia place large amounts of troops at the border without being provocative, while Ukraine cannot arm themselfes and be part of an alliance? Also, why does NATO represent a treath to Russia as long as it exists? Noone has interest in invading Russia. European nations part of NATO are part of NATO because they would be unable to defend against a superpower like Russia without it. It is not because countries like Norway or Finland, or Germany or Ukraine wants to invade Russia…	existing	existing	[0.68568015 0.31431982]

Russian gas isn't a "god given right".  However reality of it is that Putin uses this gas as a political tool.   Gazprom is not business, it's politics. We should treat it as such.  What that means is that Gazprom will do things that make no business sense, like not supplying Europe with gas when gas prices are astronomical = loosing out on high profits for Gazprom, and Russia.  There's a long list of people who are to blame for dependence - most of them are ignorant western businessmen and politicians.

Not a russian but a finn here.  From my perspective it looks like Russian goverment tries to play the victim and tries to convey the story where the Big Bad US is pulling the strings and tries to oppress Russia with NATO.  The narrative however completely forgets the fact that in the last 100 years Russia has occipied or tried to occupy most of its western neighbours and those nations were not treated that well during the occupation.   So maybe its not that NATO is being a dick and trying to aggressively expand near Russia borders but that the countries near Russia actively seeking protection so that history could not protect itself.	removed	existing	[0.6856814  0.31431857]
It’s not invasion that they are worried about. It’s shifting the balance of strategic power from parity to US by enabling US to hypothetically strike Moscow with missiles in less than 5 minutes, virtually holding a gun to Russia’s head and thus having huge political and military/strategic advantage. It may be surprising for some western observers but right now strategically US and Russia have parity - both in nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and nuclear triad - submarines, land based systems and strategic bombers. Thus ensuring mutual assured destruction. Furthermore, Ukraine can be used as a launchpad to incite separatism movement inside Russia and thus destabilise Russia. All of this makes Russia to perceive NATO as existential threat to it. Not forgetting that NATO was conceived as a military alliance against Moscow.	existing	existing	[0.68568116 0.3143188 ]

Can't see any possible reason Putin needs to be so involved with Ukraine, it's a seperate country, let it do what it wants. There's no good reason why he gets so defensive about Ukraine and its politics. And the excuse of "It was an ex-Soviet country, practically the same as Russia" is shit and we just need to look at Holodomor to see that.	removed	existing	[0.6856798  0.31432024]

>If it's truly real and they're modern weapon systems, yeah they probably utilized this program. But again there are realistic looking fakes they can rent/buy/make. They can use CGI, they can do any number of things. The best thing would be to watch the credits at the end and see if there is a "Special Thanks to the Department of Defense"  CGI can do many things, but it looks cheap on screen. That is why even new Marvel movies (which I consider shit, but they are popular), who have a really great CGI, do work with US Army.	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431958]

While basically all military actions of the US – or NATO in general since 9/11 – were just a shitshow based on lies or geopolitical interests, I don't get the Yugoslavia thing. Yes, they didn't have a UN mandate (at least as far as I know) but in contrast to lets say Iraq in the 2000s there was and an ongoing war with many war crimes like the Račak massacre right at the borders of NATO states, commited by people who were already responsible for a genocide (for example the Srebrenica massacre, declared as genocide by the International Court of Justice). So the NATO had basically the same goals, as Russia in the past (Georgia) and today. No threat and a somehow stable situation at direct borders. In this case I just can't say if it was good or bad.   Being dragged in a conflict over a region / country or whatever based on lies, geopolitical goals of a single nation or whatever, what happened basically the last 20 years, is a whole other level.   Regarding Ukrain, I'm again not sure what to think about it. The approval of NATO by the Ukrainians was somewhere around 25%. After Russia sent some funny green and black man to Crimea and supports Ukrainian separatists with weapons and maybe soldiers "on vaccation" (maybe the NATO should have sent soldiers on vaccation to Yugoslavia),  you wonder why Ukranians want to move closer to or even join the NATO because they feel threatened? Seriously... I just don't get it..   They only thing I see right now: Some politicians, millionaires or billionaires and some of their friends (from both sides) doing some dick fencing and putting thousands or even millions in danger.	existing	existing	[0.6856808 0.3143192]

Едь, езжай, поезжай are interchangeable. Often may be used with -ка suffix: едь-ка, езжай-ка, поезжай-ка. What's the difference? The latter sounds more informal IMO. Also, the former is informal too - applied to people you call "ты". If you want to say the same to a person you call "вы", or you say it to a group of people, you better use едте/езжайте/поезжайте. And again, you can use - ка here witch makes it a bit more informal.	existing	existing	[0.6856784  0.31432164]
