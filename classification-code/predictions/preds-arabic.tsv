>U can find a lot of sources for this one, just Google "خيانة أمير عبد القادر"  Are you even serious, the emir literally resisted thanks to Moroccan help all of his guns were from morocco, once Morocco stopped helping him (after Isly), he lost in literally 3 weeks.

You want to be clean.. go ahead.

I don't find it depressing that our existence has a purpose that expands beyond our own lives, to be honest.

Yes-ish: I find the causes are noble in theory and in practice can be pretty bad (for example, I don’t like Israeli occupation at all but then it’s really hard to look at the Palestinian Authority and think this represents freedom); also how does one quite define Arab causes?

I am not a radical leftist, I’m more of a centre left. My surroundings (Egyptian society) are more on the conservative side ik that. But I don’t have to be part of it, nor does Mohamed Salah.   This society is toxic because it rejects any kind of change or anything new to it basically, you can stay conservative all you want, you have the freedom to do so, but I want the freedom to be different and I don’t want this society to keep trying to bring people like me back the societal and cultural norms. You be you and I’ll be me, except I can’t be me when everyone keeps oppressing people like me this way, that’s on the society part.   Anywho, this is Reddit, you can say your opinion, like I just said mine, but irl we’d have more peace if there was actual freedom of speech and criticism.   And yeah non binaries exist and also genderqueers, my views on that part of the far left are mixed tbh but either way, I let them be who they wanna be, freely, and I expect them to do the same for me.	existing	existing	[0.6856794  0.31432068]

Idk maybe my family should make Haj before start  normalising with Isr@el like their friend UAE. To all my fellow South Asian muslims,they aren't what you think they are(also add extreme racism towards others,idk who their stupid scholars think they are before calling others slaves and second class muslims,when in reality if Saudi doesn't have money they are nothing more than dessert roming bedouins,idk where this pride comes from), they won't do shit for any of us for the islamic cause,their only cause is money. They sold their brothers in Palestine and Yemen,you think they'll care about us and our problems? Just make your religious visit and come back,if you want to make money, Canada is a much better option(they give you PR). If you're making hijra there,I'm sorry my friend you're making a huge mistake(they probably won't even let you stay without a job). You should rather move to Houston or Illinois,their you can practice better by living among muslim communities.

Also the healthiest with abundance of food. This is arguably a way better time. Hell, Isra;el's crime is the most exposed it ever been since 1948.

We have words from latin, greek and persian languages. You can literally google it.   >Not really, the arabic script may be descendant from the aramaic script but that too was descendant from the phonecian script which was also descendant from the Proto - sinaitic script all the way back to the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

I'm an expat in Riyadh.  I agree with the comments that say you should judge the 'vibe' of the person. It is ok to speak to a woman if you need to (e.g. if they left their card in an ATM). I would avoid small talk if you see a woman in a supermarket etc. It just puts them in a slightly uncomfortable position. Of course if they initiate it that's fine.  I know some Saudi women who wear a veil in front of Saudi men but not in front of me (a Western man).   In the workplace most of my female colleagues are very friendly.

I might do something like that and make it in both Arabic and English. Anarchy wouldn't just help Arabs, it will help everyone except the politicians. I will explain how anarchy would function, in summary, the state is an inefficient monopoly on protection and justice, there is no protector other them or their agents, and no judge other than their judges, they have the final say, and you can't opt out, they will extract the money they need using force like a protection racket. Obviously since it is a monopoly it is very inefficient and expensive, the "protection" they provide in most cases is very low quality and in many cases they do the opposite of protection, to ensure they are the only ones that can "protect" they disarm the population to make it harder for people to fight back. If the state makes a bad choice or something bad intentionally, they rarely get punished. So the obvious solution is to abolish all states, let people live their lives, the government is not good at planning and individuals know what is best for them more than any central planner. People can organize and live freely, there is no monopoly planner or state to dictate how they live their lives for example some people want to live in communes where everything is organized democratically (as long as no one is forced to join) some want to live a traditional life in a rural area. What matters is the individuals to live free from aggression because initiation of aggression is illegitimate. many of the issues we see today are caused by wars between states, state indoctrination, some of technologies that we have created, and state policies that make people a high time preference (care only for the present and not about the future) Once the state is removed there will be an increase in wealth and quality of life, competition between individuals and firms to provide a better service for a lower price without government regulation to create monopolies or unfair conditions, no one will be forced to participate in this, since not everyone likes the way these firms operate or wants to live a different lifestyle. Of course this will be very hard as more and more of our lives is being controlled by the state, if we don't stop this we are heading towards a tyrannical dystopia and we might reach a point of no return of statist slavery	existing	existing	[0.6856798  0.31432024]

I wouldn’t advocate marrying someone like that.   Your husband should respect you, treat you kindly and cover all the financial aspects.  You should obey him, take care of the housework and raise the kids.   Respect is expected at all times I don’t see where I mentioned being disrespectful.   I don’t believe in equality I believe each spouse has rights and roles.   When each spouse handles their business the marriage will be easy by Allāh’s permission.	removed	existing	[0.6856798  0.31432024]
Yea so you can't criticize a government that's allowing musicians to come over and is openly letting the sexes mix etc waging a war on another Muslim country ..

Also I don't care about Sufism and I am no scholar of Islam but I do know this I would put the Qur'an above anything else even ahadiths I believe ahadiths are susceptible to misinterpretations and misrepresentations ..and also if you want someone to come to your religion you should be a little more kind rather than mocking Their faith .. explain to them in a nice an polite way that this is not the way guide them .. do not criticize them for that may turn them further away from the religion..	removed	existing	[0.68567973 0.31432027]

That's exactly the whole point we are talking about.  What is sold locally is of a much lower quality than what is sold abroad.  You argument is that it should be so since locally it is cheaper? (Even though that's not quite the case, food in Germany is comparable to the prices in Egypt, especially when it comes to things they produce locally like apples for example)   In the end the government (Ministry of Agriculture) is responsible for providing the local market with good quality food (comparable to the exported quality).  >Unless you want the farmers work for you for free  They are already being paid pennies btw.

I don't really agree.   The United States was the first country to recognize Israel after it declared its independence. The first country to do so was actually the USSR. At the time, Stalin felt that Israel would be a "natural" ally of the USSR because the vast majority of Israel's early elite political leaders subscribed to the ideology of Labor Zionism, which was a form of Zionism fused with socialist economic beliefs. Israel did not have a PM who did not belong to the Labor Party until the late 1970s, 30 years into the country's existence. On top of that, Stalin believed that many European Ashkenazi Jews would be grateful towards the USSR for stopping the Holocaust.   What really brought Israel and the US together, IMO, was Israel's relationship with the UK and France, who were America's key Cold War allies. And what brought Israel together with the UK and France was Nasser.	existing	existing	[0.6856804  0.31431958]

No one is saying that zionists is the only problem. We are saying that zionists are part of Western neo-colonial structure that helps them to maintain status quo and all those regimes. The only reason Saudi, Zayed and other "royal" families are still alive is protection of those neo-colonists. If it wasn't for them, we would be a one Arab country 70-80 years ago.   This neo-colonisalism works through so-called "family capitalism" because it's easier to control those families who contro the population, then controlling the population itself.   Do you really think there are any sane Arabs who want to have a bunch of USA\\UK or any other non-Arab pigs with weapons in their lands? Or they want to live in tribial based borders?

Plus any mainstream Shawarma Restauraunt like Mama Nourah or Shawarma House gives Falafel sandwichs, just ask without Egg and you're good to go. Oh speaking of Mama Nourah, do try their Hummus and the oven baked bread they provide with it, I've verified countless times and it's fine too!	existing	existing	[0.68567866 0.31432134]
I think any remote job for a company based in any developed country will earn you such figures. It's just that software engineering is what's most in demand + is easy to perform remotely.

But is the rate of violence against LGBT in the US the same as Egypt? Definitely not. If Egyptians accept or hate LGBT at the same rate as Americans, why do people seek asylum to the US to avoid discrimination for being queer? Why did Sarah Hegazi need to go to Canada?   Why would my mom threaten to send me back to Egypt when she found out I was gay? because she knew I would not have the same freedoms I have in the US.   Also, why do people in this sub always tell queer people not to visit or not show their queerness? It’s because we are waaaaay less friendly and accepting than the majority of other countries, with few exceptions.	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431952]

There is some quota system set in place by the Saudi government and other Islamic countries, in which a set number of pilgrims are granted for every country, and it's set relative to the size of a said country. Deciding who is going is the responsibility of the other countries, so for example, Egypt has a raffle system to determine who will go for Hajj. For anyone who lives in the KSA, a Hajj permit is granted once every Five years, and a citizen or an expat can see his/her Hajj status in Absher.	existing	existing	[0.6856818  0.31431818]

>It’s 7th century, when Arabia is made up of rival, feuding tribes, disunited and forever at each other’s throats. Emperor Kisra (Kingsley) has a fearsome reputation for being utterly ruthless. But when the Arabian Princess Hind (Hart) refuses to become the emperor’s concubine, the stage is set for an epic confrontation. It is a battle that, by its conclusion, will have changed the region forever and echo throughout history. Escaping with her father, King Numan (Massoud) into the vast and unforgiving desert, Hind is pursued by Kisra’s seasoned mercenary Jalabzeen and his bloodthirsty troops.	existing	existing	[0.68568075 0.31431928]

LGBT and atheists don’t have a cause. They just want to be allowed to exist peacefully without being jailed or attacked. Nobody is trying to spread any ideology. If it was that easy to change people’s minds, why am I still gay after only being exposed to straight people most of my life? Because it doesn’t work that way. Atheists don’t care about converting people either.   It’s ridiculous that you think people with different ideas than you are “enemies of the state” (which I can’t really blame you for because that’s how you were raised) but don’t you think it would be more beneficial for us as a country to focus on improving our healthcare, education, quality of life, there are SO MANY THINGS we can focus and work on instead of what people like to do in their bedrooms and if they believe in God or not.   Just an FYI, ancient Egypt has a few records of gay relationships in royalty. Medieval Islamic Egypt was known to be a lot less strict than other Islamic countries, and they tolerated LGBT more than modern Egypt. Lastly, homoerotic narratives were popular across the Muslim world in the 8th century.

Sure some of the Saudi youth are very lazy and only here for the money but seeing more and more ambitious and qualified people unlike before.

Bro are you just giving me a sugarcoated answer? Can a Chinese man who converted let’s say, three years ago. Actually get an Israeli passport? If so, perhaps you have such an example?   As far as I know, actual Semites from Ethiopia aren’t seen as jews, get forcibly sterilised and aren’t given citizenship. So how can someone who isn’t a semite nor a Jew get the Israeli passport?   “Converts are just as Jewish as any other Jews” Realistically, how many number of Jews agree with you on this? Maybe 200?   What you are telling me is hardly a reflection of reality.	existing	existing	[0.6856799  0.31432006]

if you're interested i can show u a lot more.  Feyruz herself was a practising maronite:  https://youtu.be/wq_FHyVyB1g  You might notice the presence of musical instruments in maronite chants, but not in orthodox ones. Many socio/historical/political theories as to why that is, but could be just a coincidence.  >I found older Arabic Christian music is stronger than modern English Christian music.  Yes, for a reason. In the west it got modified down by so many political changes, not faith related purposes. You had louis 14 claiming to be a descent of god for instance and the entire lutheran church being a political psyop.  The faith was changed there. Here it didn't. Eastern Christianity is the closest you'll ever get, with the closest of them being the Syriacs (not syrians) in my opinion.  Islam is not really that far off from Eastern Christianity. It just is less symbolic.	existing	existing	[0.68567955 0.31432042]

It is not a problem of any religion per se. It specifically is a problem with religions that denounce the material world in the favor of a heaven.   The Ancient Egyptians religion was their land. Their heaven was to take care of the reeds and the golden wheat fields they sowed in life. Their religion incentivised treating the land and the people as blessings given to you by the Gods to keep them safe and happy. Thats why they built wonders and created wonders. Because they loved themselves and their lands. Even if life was much much much more difficult physically, economically and politicaly.   The modern religion though that incentivises ditching the material world for the sake of the immaterial, and not just ditching but actively constraining everything on everybody and creating bad conditions to leverage their political support with the need of Egyptians to go to "jannah". Well, you can see the results of a thousand years of that religion right now. You can look into all the other different countries that use it and you can find it more or less the same.  I am not hear to debate religions though. I've said my mind and if you have a problem with what I said then I am sorry about that but I am not willinh to discuss further.	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431955]

Short answer: Education and personality. What was said in the comments are right though, people will not throw trash if the street is clean, they will if it's already dirty.  Long(er) answer: People don't believe the country is "theirs" as they have before, or on a more deep level, they don't see any benefit of treating "public" assets well. People treat public places abroad as something that is shared and should be taken care of for the good of the people. This feeling / thought does not extend in Egypt any longer. People see it was a service being given for free (or cheap) that they will use till it is no longer usable then they will move on to the next. People don't see the public domain as "theirs" any more.  Rich areas basically afford to keep their areas clean, and can pay money to make sure it's kept spotless. Poorer ones can't, and one they fall into disarray, it keeps getting worse. A pile of trash only grows from that point.	existing	existing	[0.685681   0.31431904]

Dont get married until you are settled in. My opinion is to wait until you graduate and land a job in saudi honestly.  If your main worry is that you dont want to be alone, thats not a good reason to get married. Its a lot of responsibility.  Keep in mind that whoever you get married to would have to spend a lot of time away from her family, which she is probably not used to, so it will be difficult on her and on you.   Honestly just go to university, get your degree and land a job, then think about marriage.	existing	existing	[0.68567854 0.31432143]

If you are sending it through a courier service (like FedEx, DHL, UPS...etc), then it shouldn't be a problem. But if you're sending it through Saudi Post or regular postal service, then you should get the National Address. That's the address registered to the receiver. Saudi Post also has a service called EMS which is similar to courier, that should be fine too. Bottom line, if it's tracked, it should be OK with the address where it contains the house number and street name. Again, I'd contact the receiver and make sure.	existing	existing	[0.6856784  0.31432158]

It’s nonsense that anyone would dare suggest that the celebration of the Lupercalia has anything to do with what Valentines Day represents today. That’s what’s nonsensical about it. It’s a pathetic attempt at discrediting anything about the west from revisionist Wahabis and Salafis.   Be honest with yourself, do you really think buying the one you love a teddy bear means you support slaughtering a goat and forcibly slapping women with the entrails of that goat?

1st gen immigrant here ( moved to the US When i was 13). Honestly, from my observations on people my age or 2nd gen kids i can start to spot the cultural differences between them and same age categories back home. One of the issues is no matter how much the kids will know arabic they’ll still prefer english in their daily lives making the barrier thicker in terms of understanding religion and culture. The barrier just keeps getting thicker down the generations. Unfortunately, we’ve seen cases where parents tried to keep their kids muslim and arab like they’re in home countries but that almost always didn’t work and sometimes took a reverse direction in the internal personalities of these kids because they see something very liberal in schools and with their friends but the exact opposite at home.   Don’t ever expect to see your children acting and thinking like your cousins children who stayed in their home countries. I’m not saying it’s necessarily a negative thing but usually it’s. Trying to maintain the goods of both cultures will make you a great human being but chances of that happening is slim. I tried to that with myself and fortunately it worked but i still missed out on many experiences during my childhood during my time in the US because I wanted to stay away from haram things which to most friends sounded like the norm. I came out of high school and college with zero real friends and not much memories.	existing	existing	[0.68568134 0.3143186 ]

The Egyptian film industry has been in a state of decline for some decades, but Syria’s television industry was thriving for a while for the war. Lebanese producers have also put out some very good film/TV. Not to mention some quality shows from the 5aleej.   There many, many new independent Arab artists that are pumping out innovative & authentic music of all genres, only now starting to get exposure.  There is soo much potential and the state of our entertainment industry is inadequate at best, but I feel like you’re being somewhat unfair. We just need more deliberate, coordinated efforts on local, regional, and Arab World levels.  The Mao comparison certainly does not foster a sensible discussion. We need bridge between our rich heritage/traditions and an open-minded future.	existing	existing	[0.68568116 0.3143189 ]

OMG, I'm from a different Arabic country ( Libya ) and I've noticed the same as you , I've always wondered why,  here in Libya most of the Filipino I've met are feminine, I swear to god I'm not exaggerating at all, I always said to myself, maybe it's just cultural differences, but I've met Filipino who are very straight.  Another reason is that the  vast majority of Filipino who came in our country start working as nurses in the hospitals( is it the same in saudi arabia ? ), which is a female predominant job, and one of the careers that many gays choose to pursue worldwide " even the Arabs ". One of the stereotypes about men who work as a nurse is being feminine, which is relatively true!    not all of them though.  &#x200B;  صاحب المنشور ماقال حاجة عنصرية، هو فقط يسأل لماذا تتواجد هذه الظاهرة ! ووضح وجهة نظره، ابتعدوا عن المثاليات، كل شيء قابل للنقاش والراجل وضح انه لايقصد العنصرية ولا يعمم	existing	existing	[0.68568015 0.3143199 ]

First, i will say once you have children you don't want to raise them in environment where disbelief and sin is rampant - if you want to raise your children on the faith that's not the environment for it. Second, even before you have kids, you should strive always for what's good , not necessarily what's easy or hard, and attempt to earn allah's approval in everything you do - and you don't necessarily want to be tested on your faith. If living in America allows you to earn a much better income than overseas and with that income you can support your family and donate much of it to starving muslims overseas, then there's good in that (but if it's merely to hoard wealth or waste it on luxuries then that's not the right path to take). If you can also at the same time be a good role model as what islam looks like, for example by helping your neighbors (smile, greet them, shovel their driveway, give them gifts, invite them over for dinners) and spread dawah to people who are receptive of it then there's even greater good in that.  So living in a country like America can be better or it can be worse for you, it can bring you closer to Allah or further - depending on your actions. For most unfortunately it is worse for them.  قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّىٰهَا  وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّىٰهَا	existing	existing	[0.68567777 0.3143222 ]

Those targeted by such violence are believed to violate heteronormative rules and contravene perceived protocols of gender and sexual roles. People who are perceived to be LGBT may also be targeted.

So Ethiopian Jews just need to convert to Judaism to be allowed to come to Israel? Hahahaha what a huge insult to black Jews. I still remember that Ethiopian Jew in uniform getting beat up by two Jewish cops. What a sad reality for black Jews. Can’t even get citizenship, and the few that do, get treated as second class citizens.   I’m indeed most definitely not a Jew, and I thank God for that.   Being a semite doesn’t make me superior either, contrary to many Jews who believe they are God’s chosen people and therefore superior.   There are indeed very few Yemenite Jews between the period where they were carried to Israel and today. Because, thank God, the vast majority converted to Islam over 1400 years ago. Including my ancestors.   Also, where did I say Jews are racist? Why are you putting words in my mouth? All I did was highlight practises of the Israeli state towards Ethiopian Jews and how Israeli society treats them.   Also, please enlighten me about the slavery problem? What are you referring to?

>Let’s break this misconception down because you seem to have this belief that “Jew = Zionist.” I’  lol what?  >The period you are referring to up till 1914 is what’s known as the Second Aliyah.  Aliyah is not a period. It is just the act of immigration  >Zionism had little to do with the Second Aliyah.   Wtf are you on about? All immigration to Palestine was motivated by zionism    >you failed to explain how the the Ottomans “sold” Palestine when it was the British themselves who explicitly mentioned in the Balfour declaration of supporting a Jewish state.   I never once used the phrase "sold Palestine". All I argued was that Ottomans allowed Zionists to settle in Palestine; an indisputable fact to anyone with half  a brain.  >the Ottomans were deporting Jews.  Already dealt with the point. They deported Jews on a very limited scale in the latter years because of Turkish nationalism. Nothing to do with Zionist aspirations in Palestine   >The British had a policy of creating a Jewish state that they spelled out in the Balfour declaration. The guy who they made as the first governor of Mandatory Palestine was Herbert Samuel, the guy who the Balfour declaration originated from. Britains intentions couldn’t be more obvious. They could have ended the Mandate prior to 1933 before the Nazis got to power. Mandatory Iraq ended in 1932. Why not Palestine? Contrast with the Ottoman Sultan who was bribed and flat out refused Herzl’s offer. Here’s the World Jewish Congress stressing how important the Balfour declaration was.   what does any of that have to do with anything? I did not argue the British did not attempt to create a Jewish home. All I said was when you compare Jews population growth under Ottomans and under the mandate the difference was mostly due to the rise of the Nazis. Had the Nazis rose to power when Ottomans were in control their policy of allowing Jewish settlement would have had a similar effect.  >Uganda was literally brought up in Sixth Zionist Congress in 1903 because they failed to get Ottomans to agree and who refused Herzl’s offer for Palestine.  Exactly brought up and immediately rejected. it was not a serious scheme. Stop pretending the Ottomans were some kind of bulwark, they literally gave Herzl a medal.  >The last sentence you just made up.   You literally just confirmed you know nothing about the history of Palestinian cause  >The registration laws and the corollary concentration of land-title holdings contributed to the conflict between Jews and Arabs in several ways. Eisenman notes that the frequent failure of individuals to gain recognition of their land rights (when eventually they discovered they needed such recognition) was an important root of "hostile sentiments and antagonisms that were later to erupt between Arabs and Jews during the Mandate."32  >These "hostile sentiments and antagonisms" developed not merely as a result of the "numerous and prolonged lawsuits" fought over land ownership33  but even more directly as a result of the eviction of hundreds of tenant families from lands they considered their own when large landholders sold their holdings to Jews. Most of the two million dunams (200,000 hectares) of land owned by Jews at the end of the Mandate were acquired through purchases from large landowners    >does not mean it was an Ottoman policy to “sell Palestine to the Zionists.”   you keep saying that as if those are word i used. You even place them in quotation marks like a fucking liar.  >Ottomans did their best to limit Jewish settlements.  No they didn't. Even the British took steps in their 1939 to restrict Jewish immigration, that doesn't change anything with regards to their overall policy.  >The US didn’t install the Communists in Russia. The British didn’t subsidize the Russian Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution. Britain subsidized the Arab Revolt and installed the Hashemites who were unelected by the Arabs. The fact you’re defending the Hashemites is really pathetic.    Who the fuck is defending the hashemites? Stop putting words in my mouth you pathetic loser. You made a retarded claim that a country supporting two different actors made them indistinguishable from each other. I gave you a counter example. The distinctions you are making are irrelevant.  >Did you read the article kid or you just saw a name and had a hissy fit?   Efraim Karsh...lol   >According to British historian David Murphy, the Bedouins would not fight unless paid in advance with gold coin and by the end of 1916, the French spent 1.25 million gold francs subsidizing the revolt. By 1918, the British spent 220,000 pounds a MONTH subsidizing the revolt. Wow. What kind of revolt needs France and Britain to pay people to “revolt?”   Soldiers expect to be paid. Particularly bedouins who were rebelling on behalf of settled populations in the hijaz and levant. The same thing happened when ibn Saud sponsored bedouins to join his movement with British money. Doesn't mean his conquest was fictional. What kind of a retarded claim is that? And fyi the Ottomans tried to pay bedouins and failed to attract them. Arbs in the Ottoman army also had a notoriously high desertion rate. so it wasn't as if they were invested in that...  > I need to remind you that it was the British and French who were doing most of the fighting. Not the Arabs who were supposedly “revolting.”  Nonsense. Arabs were exclusively fighting a guerilla war in the hijaz. Most the port cities in Hijaz, Aqaba all the way up to Jordanian territories were taken exclusively by Arab forces. One of the largest battles was the battle of Tafileh fought almost exclusively by Arab forces. Allied efforts intensified in the final stages  >Even when the British were occupying Palestine, the Palestinians showed their allegiance to the Ottomans. The British military governor of Jerusalem asked the local Mukhtars who they hated - the British or Turks. The Mukhtars replied “I say I hate you and I love the Turks…because of my religion, my culture, my principles. You are our enemies, how can I love you?” Source Page 28  lool you little Ottoman dick sucker. So according to you because the Mukhtars preferred their co-religionists over a colonial power that was "allegiance to the Ottomans". That's your standard lool  Fact: The Arab revolt happened after nearly 50 minor revolts and decades of nationalist Arab sentiments rising.    Anyway...Honestly i wasted enough on this nonsense.

What company is this with? Never seen results presented like this. The results themselves are also totally bizarre. Fennoscandia and Tuva and southeast India and Orkney islands and Austronesia and Greenland Eskimos.... a7a  Generally speaking, these are autosomal results. They represent the last 7-10 generations, or about 128 grandparents. [This table](https://i0.wp.com/dna-explained.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Generation-percent-DNA.jpg?ssl=1) illustrates it very well.  For people who are highly mixed, the algorithms make certain assumptions and can vary a lot. For example, my mother is Nordic, and on some sites I get a big chunk of Hungarian or Slovenian or northern Italian, and on other sites I get zero from those areas. On Gedmatch you could view your results based on 2 parents from the same country or 2 parents from different countries, or all 4 grandparents from different countries. When I set it to both parents from the same country, I [would get Slovenian or northern Italian or Ashkenazi Jewish](https://imgur.com/ncwlyhu) + a confidence percentage (lower is better). When I set it to 2 parents from different countries, [I would get](https://imgur.com/HqL1B5y) 50% Palestinian or Jordanian or Yemeni and 50% Swedish or Finnish. And [when I set it to 4 grandparents from different countries](https://imgur.com/w7iEJlw) I'd get 25% Yemeni 25% Lebanese 25% Swedish 25% Finnish.  On 23andme I get nothing from central or eastern Europe, but in Familytreedna I get like 30% "Magyar". So it's important to keep in mind the limitations of these tests. FTDNA is most likely conflating some of my Nordic and some of my Arab ancestry as central European because Hungary and Romania and Italy are the most likely European areas to find a mixture of both Nordic and Middle Eastern genes.  For a look into more ancient ancestry, ask him what his Y-haplogroup or subclade is. If he gets something like J-M267 or one of its subclades then the story will become very clear for him. For example, [these Moroccans and Algerians](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/252896110_903917030509920_3941351554602171907_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=b9115d&_nc_ohc=8cGCRsHmsc8AX-d5irs&_nc_oc=AQnSYNGV-bvRRpL6t_nHCNg12fHsybkuJiTM62YNKnQUX_OWQsxvvYTp4FL3DWIMBCY&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=00_AT84hFxUelXYxxTS40i0Gzzwhj5_CHv58RRBsCPUartCVw&oe=61F3FB82) all belong to recent subclades of an Arabian haplogroup. Or for example, [these Germans and Austrians](https://scontent-lhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/271715454_446531553617183_7163904013559452753_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=825194&_nc_ohc=ZORZkhhn2TQAX_CIxrh&tn=FUj98UTFgkSNrdxm&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&oh=00_AT_RU-j7ypm8xLp0mQCkuwM0onACk9zDOxFY8l6bm_GJeQ&oe=61F5CFF9) have crystal clear evidence that they descend paternally from an Arabian person. Their TMRCA (time to most recent common ancestor) is precisely 1,500 years ago, so i think quite strong evidence of Islamic invasion period through Spain. But lots of people get random haplogroups with no clear point of origin, groups such as T or I or G and certain subclades of E that are argued about endlessly. So if he's lucky he'll get a major group with a strong link to an ethnic group or region. If he's unlucky he'll get a weird group that's still unclear.  The mitochondrial haplogroup, or Mtdna, is also interesting, but it is less informative because maternal haplogroups are much less tied to ethnicities than y-haplogroups are.	existing	existing	[0.68568045 0.31431952]

Between Riyadh and Sharqiyyah is Judah, Judah is fun and has plateaus to stargaze from a higher ekevation. Go to the north of the central region and you find Sudair, Tumair, Majma'aah, and go north far enough and you hit Ha'il, which all good places to stargaze. I saw the 2012 Leonid meteor shower in Sudair.  The south also has high elevation and lots of places to stargaze from. I am not knowledgeable enough on it to recommend an area.    If you dont care about elevation and want something relatively close, and have a reliable 4x4 vehicle, there's the area between Uqayr port in Al Ahsaa and the Salwa area on the border with Qatar. You may need a permission from Border Guard to camp or chill by the seaside.	existing	existing	[0.68567926 0.31432077]

That’s why it’s important to read each one in context as well. The crimes of the Ottomans were mainly against Christians and other non-Muslim minorities.	existing	existing	[0.6856792  0.31432083]

Feel? No no. They simply aren't enough. Minimum wage doesn't get a you Normal decent standard of life nor is working in labour or simple jobs.  Even higher paying jobs are losing their value. The inflation is high but the salaries are the same or lower. The prices and greed are still high. Taxes are still high, rent just doubled in Jeddah. Simply having a decent life has become a dream that's getting further and further away to many youth and adults.  Yes it's similar in other countries due to global inflation.	existing	existing	[0.6856799  0.31432006]

True, Egypt's carbon footprint on the world is miniscule compared to China, India, and the West. But we produce some of the highest carbon emissions in Africa.  And just because there are others worse than us, doesn't mean we should continue doing something that's inherently bad. We should try to be better.  There is no excuse for fossil fuels in Egypt. Our efforts should be transitioning QUICKLY to solar and wind power. We should focus on energy efficiency and waste management and sustainability. Our homes and cities can totally run on renewable energy in less than a decade.  Fossil fuels are not profitable or efficient in the long run. We'll eventually collapse economically if we continue down that path. Protecting nature and biodiversity and ushering in a Green Industrial Revolution will bring more value and prosperity in the long run. Not to mention help Egypt become a developed country.	existing	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431898]

Ah, of course you had to start with 'pedophile.' You know what a Pedophile is.. someone who rapes children in secret. These girls, and boys also if we're talking about the church, often grow up with mental issues, need years of therapy, etc. It's so common in America that it's a running joke to have a creepy, molesty uncle in the family.     However, when we talk about Aisha and her marriage to Prophet Muhammad, she reached puberty. This is the natural dividing line to start child-bearing age. It isn't some number drawn out of a hat from some old men in an office doesn't take into consideration each individual person's ability or identity. The Prophet died when she was only about 19 years old. Not only was she not a mental wreck, but she was proud of her position as the mother of the believers and continued on after his death for over 40 years teaching his message. She is responsible for about 30% of Islamic law that she continued teaching for many, many years.     So, say what you will.. if that's what you need to make yourself feel better about yourself.	removed	existing	[0.68567914 0.3143209 ]

>Jewish population in Palestine was 59,000 in 1914 and was 7% of the population. Source  Jewish population was 43000 in 1890 and became 94000 in 1914 [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region\))  It doubled again to 175000 by 1931.   Both the above and the figures you're quoting are estimates but the above is the most recent.  >When the British took over Palestine from the Ottomans in 1917,   The British were still at war in 1917. The takeover did not complete until 1918 and the mandate started in 1920.  >in the 30 years the Jewish population jumped from 7% to 32% by 1947.  Most of it after 1931 as a result of Nazis rise to power as I already noted.  >Because they couldn’t establish a foothold in Palestine under the Ottomans  Uganada was only very briefly considered at the start of Zionism and was discounted for reasons that have nothing to do with the Ottomans. Zionists did set foothold during Ottoman era and Ottoman land laws allowed the dispossession of tens of thousands of Fellahin from their lands which is how Palestinian antagonism  to Zionism started  >The Hashemites and Zionists were backed by the same colonial power - the British. They are one in the same  That is dumb. According to this logic since the US backed Russia and Britain during WW2 then they are one and the same. Alliances are made based on the intersection of interests. It was in the interest of Arabs to ally with the side that won WW1, regardless of any other considerations.  >That’s a myth  Did you just unironically link to a paper by Efraim Karsh kid? There was no myth; the tribes in hijaz rebelled backed by organizations in the levant.   >The Hashemites met secretly with the Zionists  Decades after the events being discussed.  >Sorry to burst your bubble.

Oh my god so much of this video is just confidently expressed conjecture and nonsense. Haplogroup J doesn't originate in the Arabian peninsula. It originates in the Caucasus or Eastern Anatolia. Some put it as far south as Mesopotamia. There are no adequate studies of South Arabians or Yemenis or Omanis that would allow us to confidently claim anything, especially that 80% of Modern South Arabians belong to J. Then he makes confident claims about the phenotypes of South Arabians as if he has visited southern Yemen himself or as if there's a phenotype database somewhere. He also claims they share "slim noses" like their neighbouring Arabs. Ok? Having been to Oman, I can tell you that lots of Arabs do not have "slim noses". At 7:00 he shows a photo of a typical South Arabian looking guy who is neither dark nor has a slim nose. This is garbage pseudoscience. It's like you can say any outdated nonsense you want if you add the word "phenotype" to it.  And where is he getting this claim that Mehris don't have African admixture like other Yemenis? Who has published these studies? I literally just saw [a Mehri guy online](https://twitter.com/AlmehriAman/status/1478120131209441280?t=A5ZWAbNlD9AoBFyVv9W_ug&s=19) who is not J and is mostly East African. Nearly all of his sources are blogs, not actual studies. He only cites 1 study. It's about Soqotra and is from 2009, a millennium in the timeframe of genetic studies. What's funny is that that study found Qataris, Omanis, Emaratis to be closer to Egyptians, Lebanese, and Tunisians, than to Soqotris. Nevertheless people insist on using Modern South Arabians as a sample for "pure" Arabian peninsula genetics.	existing	existing	[0.68568105 0.31431895]

So basically this is what I'm hearing.  "Please give us a state because we can't make one of our own". Jews worked hard to make this land what it is today, it was a deserted wasteland and it became an agricultural and technological paradise that gave the world that same technology you use now to bash it relentlessly. We're not going to give it away because just like Gaza and the West Bank it's going to revert back to a hell hole. Also what does Israel have in it's power? Did you know that the PA makes arrests for Israel inside it's own territory sometimes? Because the PA has a police so it does the work.  You can't built 2 terrible states and accept Israel to come in and fix the problem. Also would you be willing to come and fight to dismantle the PA and Hamas? because I'm surely not gonna die for the failures of the Palestinians.	existing	existing	[0.68567944 0.31432056]

أولًا خليك عارف كويس أن مافيش مشكلة في تربيتك أنت اللي صح وهم اللي نفسهم يبقوا زيك علشان كدا بيرخموا عليك.  ثانيًا أنت مش لوحدك لأن فيه ناس كتير متربية في بيئة زي اللي أنت اتربيت فيها أغلبهم هتلاقيهم جايين من الخليج.  ثالثًا هقول لك نفس الكلام اللي الناس هنا قايلاه واللي بقوله لأي حد قريبي داخل جامعة: في الجامعة هتلاقي من كل الأشكال، استنضف الأشكال اللي تبقى حواليك وابعد عن أي حد مش محترم تمامًا وحط مسافة بينك وبين أي حد لغاية ما تقرر أنت عايز تصاحب مين.  غير كدا أنت اعتبر أن المرحلة دي تدريب لذكائك الاجتماعي في حاجات كتير زي أنك تعرف توقف الناس عند حدها لو تجاوزته وازاي تاخد حقك بأدب لأن دي مهارات هتحتاجها في المستقبل أكتر من احتياجك ليها دلوقتي سواء في مصر أو برة مصر. وربنا يوفقك.	existing	existing	[0.68568075 0.31431925]
But I do think that being in a place surrounded by sin and it being so easy to commit sin counts for something, ya know? Like life is so much harder in the US, more difficult to keep the faith when surrounded by disbelief. So if you're able to keep your faith, even when surrounded by kufar, then I think there is more blessing in it. It is more of a test, the mountain is steeper and the reward greater. If you're surrounded by Islam life is easier, harder to commit haram, less temptation, obv there is benefit but less tests and difficulty. My teacher used to say tie a dog to a lamppost and it will fast. Doesn't make it a believer. For me it's so hard to be Muslim in a redneck country... just some additional thoughts.	existing	existing	[0.6856803  0.31431973]

It's known I lived in Spain, France and Germany. And France is by far the most toxic towards Muslims and Arabs, and the worst thing is that they don't even know it.  Their laicite thing is just a hidden way to attack Muslims. They claim that to preserve separation between state and religion (which is understandable) but they use it to ban hijabi girls from sport lol.

---  السلام عليكم    أبي ضرب أمي ومش عارف كيف أتعامل مع الموضوع    عمري 23 سنة، خرّيج جديد من الجامعة، ولا زلت ساكن مع أهلي ومعتمد عليهم حتى أحصل على عمل. عندي 4 إخوان، واحد أكبر مني ومستقل تماماً، وثلاثة أصغر مني ولا يزالون في المدرسة أو الجامعة.    حياتنا العائلية دائما كانت سالمة وخالية من المشاكل تماما، لم نواجه أي مشاكل كبيرة من قبل. والدي طيب جدا معنا، يصرف علينا ويهتم بنا ويدعمنا ويشجعنا. في حب واحترام كبير بيننا. وعلاقة أبي وأمي دائماً كانت سلمية وودية تماما، يقضون أوقات طويلة مع بعض كل يوم، يضحكون ويشربون القهوة ويفعلون أغلب الأشياء مع بعض. يختلفون أحيانا، لكن هذه الاختلافات دائما ما تكون خفيفة وسطحية ويتصالحون في نفس اليوم.    البارحة في الليل، سمعت أصوات عالية جاية من غرفتهم. لما اقتربت، سمعتهم يتخاصمون وفجأة سمعت صوت أبي وهو يضرب أمي.. ضربة واحدة فقط. حتى الآن مش متأكد كيف ضربها لكنني متأكد أنه ضربها، لأن أمي ردت عليه وقالت "ليش ضربتني". هم عارفين أني سمعت اللي صار لأني على طول بعد الضربة طرقت على الباب وسألتهم إذا كل شيء تمام، قالولي أيوا كله تمام وبعدها خفّضوا أصواتهم ولم أستطع أن أسمع ما حدث بعدها.      اليوم الصبح واجهت أمي وسألتها عن امبارح.. في البداية رفضَت تخبرني عن التفاصيل لكن لما أصررت قالت لي أن هذه كانت المرة الوحيدة اللي مد يده عليها وأنهم تصالحوا بعدها. أنا صراحة مش مصدق كلامها تماما لأني عارف أن أولويتها استقرار العائلة فطبعا حتحاول تقلل من حجم الموضوع وعارفة أني إذا عرفت التفاصيل حزعل وممكن تصير خلافات أكبر في العائلة. كلمت أبي شوية اليوم لكن ما جاب الموضوع على الإطلاق، رغم أنه عارف أني سمعت كل شيء.    حقيقةً أنا انفجعت ومش قادر أنام من امبارح.. حاس بأن حياتي انقلبت فجأة. ولا لحظة في حياتي تخيلت أن أبي ممكن يكون من النوعية اللي يضرب زوجته. وأمي هي أغلى وأهم إنسانة في حياتي، فزعلت بشكل غير عادي. فقدت احترام كبير لأبي. علاقتي به قوية جداً لكن صعب جدا علي أن أتقبل إساءته وعنفه تجاه أمي. حتى إذا كانت مرة واحدة، تجاوز حد ما توقعت أنه يتجاوزه أبدا...    سؤالي هو كيف تنصحونني في التعامل مع الوضع؟ إذا واجهت أبي، مش عارف كيف أكلمه في الموضوع ولأن هذا الشأن حساس جدا، إذا أخطأت في طريقة إلقائي للموضوع، قد تكون العواقب وخيمة، وممكن يكون في خطر أن تزيد الخلافات  والموضوع قد يتفاقم و (لا قدر الله) تتفرّق العائلة، وهذه حتكون مصيبة لنا. أو هل من الأفضل أني أتجاهل الموضوع وأتصرف أنه لم يحدث من الأساس؟    شكراً لكم	existing	existing	[0.6856819  0.31431812]

That's why Rumi said don't escape but face them. Sit with them, you'll realise it's only in your head, once you see that then you are free from them. That's why I. Tasawuf there is this thing called muragaba which is watching the thoughts and going within yourself to understand why you have these desires or fears. If you wait for someone to make you happy then you are relying on others to help you escape your thoughts temporarily, but you'll soon realise no matter how many people are around you, you are essential alone on this path called life, that's why when things get hard not many people stick around to help.you out. It's good to have friend and people to love yes, but you have to know that Allah gave you the power to decide to be happy or sad, it's all up to you and no one else. Look withing. I suggest looking at Mustafa Mahmood who is an Egyptian speaker that talks about the nafs and soul and how to find your true purpose. Truly beautiful stuff.	existing	existing	[0.685678   0.31432196]

Fair enough, it’s not going to be for everyone. I’ve not tasted the other place you mentioned and maybe they are better, but I’ve not had better than al baik personally.  I’m not saying it’s the best in the world, just the best I’ve had from the few countries I’ve had similar food at the places I’ve tried. Another thing is al baik weren’t even doing broast when I was there, it was only their burgers, sandwiches and shrimp available. So for all I know the broast isn’t great but it’s not something I typically order from anywhere to be honest, so I wouldn’t have got it either way. With how busy they are aswell, it wouldn’t surprise me if the quality of items aren’t quite up to scratch sometimes.	existing	existing	[0.68567914 0.3143209 ]

There are very different connotations of secularism in the West.   In France, there is latice. This means that the individual rights of people to express their religion in public is suppressed by the state. The state, in other words, controls religion in the French culture.   In the English-speaking countries, there is free exercise of religion and it is views as both an individual right and a minority protection issue.   Thus, in the United States, a public ban on the hijab would immediately be struck down by the Courts as a blatant violation of the First Amendment.	existing	existing	[0.68568236 0.31431764]

>You're delusional if you think FSA was better than Assad at the moment.   I didn't sey that, they're all war criminals.  I said some of them were, the In fighting began after Nusra (funded by Turkey) claim that everyone is a funded by foreign forces so they were the enemy, I think they single-handedly destroyed and eradicated 15 other groups, which severely weakened thier fighting capabilities.  They turned on each other when they were defeated in late 2012 [Battle of Damascus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Damascus_(2012)), the lack of funding & supplies, made them turn on each other.  >USA supported them and so-called "SDF" because they wanted to destroy Syria, not to take out Assad. If FSA won, we would have had a zionist-loyal dog as a head of Syria now.  No, the USA only supported the SDF (which is made up by Arabs, Assyrians and mostly Kurds) to fight ISIS (which the US also allowed the Saudis and the Emiratis to supply with guns and weapons with no consequence), after that the US betrayed the SDF by allowing turkey to invade them.   The US only supplies the most radical with guns & weapons; That's why you find the most radical succeeding in the war especially after 2013 and until 2017 or 16 (when's that funding stopped; because ISIS became a real threat to US interest in the region, I know it's an oxymoron Because the US doesn't want one single group to dominate everyone it prefers different warring factions).  >It's amazing how you guys always twist the fact that no one supported Assad himself, they supported him only as the least evil option in this mess.  What?! Are you an idiot? The ones that supported Assad where the ones to benefit from keeping him in power, from Russia that had a base in Syria to Iran that has vested interest in making a direct influence line in the region (fertile crescent) & from the people (Are the other Allawi's who benefited from keeping their guy in a position of power).  No one thinks of the "least evil", everyone looks out for their interest.  >FSA lost not because of Russia, but because of: 1)them being sectarian lunatics(most of them are just ISIS in suits); 2)taking money and stuff from USA, and letting USA to use them as an excuse to occupy the country; 3)having ties with zionists, 4)taking resources from gulf regimes. These things turned population away from them and it is well deserved.  They lost in March 2013 because of lack of funding and weapons, disorganization And of course the Hezbollah supporting Assad when he was cornered, that made them turn on each other even more and their United Front was crushed.  They were on even footing (Even controlled more cities and provinces than the Syrian regime) until 2015 came with the Russian support.  Then the Gulf States succeeded in funding ISIS in July 2013 making them grow faster than any other group.	existing	existing	[0.68567884 0.31432116]

Hello there, from your description of your present state of mind I think from my own experience in the same situations as yours you are probably having anxiety/ depression or under spell of black magic.Or it can be a combination of both...what I mean is that if you are affected by black magic over a long period anxiety/ depression may result.Because most of the symptoms of black magic are similar to anxiety/depression. It's best to get help for your black magic spell then followed with professional help from a psychiatrist.Or you can concurrently get help from both sides.Before seeing a psychiatrist you may need to see a GP and he may refer you to a mental specialist... I hope you would get well soon,InshaAllah....	removed	existing	[0.68568003 0.31432003]

It's a conversation about an interview with the Egyptian footballer's (Abou Gabal's) mother, where she says dabal instead of gabal.  ‏‎‎‎‎ابويا بيقولي زمان في الانتخابات كانوا بيقولوا والرادل الدد يحب الدد .احسن ناس حقيقي<  And apparently Abou Gabal's mother also asked her son:  ‏‎ اصابتك واعره يا ولدى ؟   What on earth is going on here with this dialect...

Man, first the source you are sharing is a conference I've watched it twice and post it in this sub just recently [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/arabs/comments/s9ys9h/fantastic_conference_about_the_history_of_arabic/)  I said Arabic *as we know it* emerged in the 4th-5th CE, and It is the same thing said by Ahmad Al-Jallad, and  you can see from the conference how Arabic will emerge feature by feature starting by that Old Arabic inscription.  One interesting thing from that old Arabic first inscription, is that the people were praying to Canaanite gods.. and there are Canaanite  letters on the inscription itself that remains undeciphered. You can also notice the use of ha which was an important feature in Northwestern Semitic but the study of old Arabic showed that Ha was used and got abandoned later.  We should keep an open mind, Arabic was part of South Semitic languages, now it is Central Semitic. The current knowledge is probably not the ultimate truth.   I will share later a post after reading more and organizing my ideas.	existing	existing	[0.6856759  0.31432408]

It’s important we don’t discredit an entire sect because the West finances one or two movements within them. An example would be some Shia sheikhs in Britain. Those guys are unequivocally traitors and rats looking to sow fitna in the Ummah. They’ve been given medals by the UK for their “achievements.” At the same time, you have Israel, the UK, and the US financing Wahhabi sheikhs. I’ve seen a few sermons by Saudi sheikhs saying that Israel is a “state” created by the chosen people of God and to speak against them is to speak against God or something along those lines.  I’m sure you know this, but a friendly reminder is important. :)	existing	existing	[0.68567926 0.31432077]

Then you are by definition, a traitor to your homeland. You and your 'Arab Israeli commanders' are responsible of the ethnic cleansing and the destruction of the Arab homeland. Your state is perpetuating neo colonialism in places like Lebanon, Syria, Sudan, etc. How dare you look at your Palestinian brothers like that? Why are you so willing to serve a genocidal entity. Do you not know what is happening in Gaza or the West bank? Do you not know how many millions of people who you are related to are thrown in camps with no food, electicity, or basic human rights?

If you read the article, it was done by the [Karmanli dynasty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamanli_dynasty) who ruled Libya as an independent state like Mohammed Ali with Egypt. It was only nominally part of the Ottoman Empire. The guy who ordered the massacre [kicked the Ottomans out of Libya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripolitanian_civil_war) in 1790s starting the dynasty. Not saying Ottomans were good or bad, but if you did basic research you would known there is more to this than just “Ottomans massacred Arabs.” That’s lazy.	existing	existing	[0.685679 0.314321]

I worked in sharm el sheikh for 35 days "hotel clinic". Let me tell ya i basically saw everything that sharm had to offer in the first 5 days. The rest of my stay's outings consisted of me just going to bars and clubs with friends which got tedious near the end of my stay but the friends there made it worth it. Ngl there aint much to do in sharm at all unless you plan on going to dahab/nuwebai for a weekend which sadly i couldnt do. Hurghada is like an actual city.
