There are so many other variables involved in atmospheric density and pressure, let alone flight, that a general answer is impossible. There are a lot of interrelated factors like the amount of atmosphere, gravity, composition, temperature, etc. The relationships are not even absolute--for example lower gravity does not necessarily imply a lower pressure or density. Atmospheres depend on a lot more than gravity and magnetic fields, and we have a lot more to learn. For fictional or hypothetical purposes there are a lot of possibilities. Even the limited sample size of our solar system has different examples to consider.  For level, constant-air-speed flight, the sum of the lift, weight, drag, and thrust vectors must be zero. In the simplest scenario of level flight, lift cancels weight and thrust cancels drag. Weight is linearly proportional to gravity, and lift and drag (at a given velocity) are linearly proportional to air density. Thrust comes from the aircraft engine.  [https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg)  It is indeed possible for flight to be much easier in a low gravity environment. The air pressure at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan (with surface gravity less than 1/7 of Earth's) is \~1.5 atmospheres. Titan's atmosphere is about 20 percent more massive than Earth's, despite having only 40 percent of the radius and 16 percent of its surface area. The surface air is four to five times denser than Earth's because it it is so cold (around -180 C). Generally it is easier to fly on Titan because of the low gravity (lower weight) and denser air (higher lift). (But the higher drag means more thrust is needed.) NASA will be sending a rotorcraft drone to fly around Titan, one much bigger than the Ingenuity demonstrator sent to Mars. Supposedly--all other difficulties like cold unbreathable air aside--a person could even strap on wings and fly on Titan. The cold temperatures cause other problems, though. For example, due to the cold temperature the speed of sound on Titan is \~190 m/s, much lower than the speed of sound on Earth (\~340 m/s at room temperature, \~300 m/s in the cold stratosphere). As an aircraft, or parts of it (i.e. propeller or rotor blades), approaches the speed of sound the aerodynamics become more complicated and difficult to deal with (sound barrier).  Take Venus as another example. At its surface, the air pressure is over 90 atmospheres. The density is over 50 times that of Earth air at sea level (and 1/15 that of liquid water). It is less than 90 because gas density decreases with temperature. The gravity is slightly lower than Earth. Practically speaking, though, flight near the surface of Venus would be much harder than for Earth. The high temperature weakens, in some cases even melts, most materials, especially common electronics. The high pressure necessitates heavier construction more like a submarine than an aircraft. And furthermore, the "air" at the surface of Venus is not even really a gas. Because of the temperature and pressure the CO2 is a [supercritical fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid) with properties of both liquids and gases. At high altitudes, the density and temperature drop, becoming almost Earthlike (though not both temperature and density/pressure at the same altitude, and there is the little matter of sulfuric acid clouds). Flight there would be more or less as difficult as on Earth--though so far the only aircraft on Venus were a couple Soviet balloons.  Another factor is that most powered flight on Earth uses combustion engines, which only work in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. You need to rely on electric power from batteries (for prolonged flight charged by solar or nuclear) to power a propeller or rotor, which (with today's technology at least) increases weight. Or you could bring your own oxidizer and use a rocket, but that would be even less efficient.  Flight is indeed much more difficult on Mars because of the low air density (\~1.6 percent that at Earth's surface), despite the low gravity (38 percent of Earth's surface). The thin air also can't carry heat away as rapidly, so overheating of motors is a major concern. Again, the cold decreases the speed of sound, decreasing the maximum speed the rotors can be allowed to rotate.  Note, though, that Titan is much less massive than Mars, and both Mars and Venus lack an internally generated magnetic field. There is a lot more to having and retaining a significant atmosphere than surface gravity and magnetic fields.  Edit: Planned or completed non-rocket flights on other worlds include:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega\_program#Balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_program#Balloon)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity\_(helicopter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter))  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(spacecraft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(spacecraft))	existing	existing	[0.86518025 0.13481972]

Answer:👇  Sadly, it’s the West that’s been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia’s doorstep.  Putin hasn’t been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It’s been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What’s happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‘RESPONDED’ by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets’ military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America’s nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn’t having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn’t fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we’re a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.👇  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	removed	removed	[0.28797168 0.7120283 ]

Hi! I also hope that this doesn’t break the sub rules, but considering that this is a more technical than historical question and also clearly asked tongue-in-cheek, I hope I can provide an answer based on my personal expertise as an electrical engineer.   In short, no, there is absolutely no way a regular person could get 1 or 2 Farads of capacitance in 1955. At the time, commercially available electrical components would primarily be sold in hobbyist stores and catalogs aimed at amateur radio operators. On page 64 of this [Radio Shack catalog from 1955](https://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/flipbook/1955_radioshack_catalog.html) you can see the “postage stamp mica” capacitors available at the time. The values in this particular catalog are around 0.05 mF, which is 1/20,000 of 1 Farad. In order to get the 16 Farads in the comment above, you would have to lay out approximately a 50 ft x 50ft array of 320,000 capacitors.  But none of that even matters because the poster above mentioned charging these off of 220 V. Even in modern day, a 220 V capacitor (which is usually used for jump starting motors and the like) will only go up to 50ish mF. I expect to be corrected since this is the Internet, but I am not aware of any commercially available way to achieve that much capacitance with that high of a voltage rating even today.  A modern commercially available supercapacitor, though, will run you about $7 and fit in the palm of your hand https://sci-supply.com/super-capacitor-1-farad/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIq6Gsx8KI9gIVlkWGCh0FNwB6EAQYAyABEgL-pfD_BwE.	removed	existing	[0.50429296 0.49570706]

Not on a wide scale, no.   There are a few types of tests:  Antigen and PCR tests used to specifically look for the presence of covid proteins or RNA, respectively.   Covid PCR based sequencing test used to specifically amplify up the covid genome, and sequence it to determine which variant it is.  Respiratory viral infection panel sequencing tests, used to sequence multiple viruses including covid. This can find presence/absence of a number of viruses, and determine variants. It is however not widely used compared to the ones above.  So there’s some data on other viruses coming from covid tests, but overall not much because the diagnostic tests are primarily the ones specifically looking at covid, not the panel.	removed	removed	[0.46710682 0.5328932 ]

 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	removed	existing	[0.5908035 0.4091965]

This depends a lot on the yield and type of the warhead, and it's not just the physical blast and pressure wave that does most of the damage.  Yes, the blast and pressure wave is overstated.  But if we're talking full strength Cold War era 1-5 megaton thermonuclear airburst it will basically light everything on fire within line of sight of the blast out to as much as a 100 miles from ground zero, with one of the main limitations being the curvature of the earth and horizon distance from the height of the airburst.  And then there's going to be a massive fire storm from that like you just carpet-bombed an entire metropolitan city with incendiary bombs non stop for a month, except it would happen almost instantly. Imagine a major city just suddenly bursting into flames everywhere there's an exposed flammable surface facing the blast. Even the paint on concrete will catch fire.  It's also going to destroy just about anything with a transistor in it at even farther ranges with the EMP.  And that's just one warhead. One warhead on a populated area would be a total catastrophe all by itself, but most ICBMs these days are MIRVs and there will be more than one warhead going with target spreads designed to cover a much wider area.  Repeat this with hundreds or possibly thousands of ICBMs each carrying MIRV payloads and it quickly adds up to capabilities that can wipe every major city in the US, Russia or even the entire planet right off the map with the combined effects and send us all right back to the stone age.  This is even before we start talking about fallout or nuclear winter from a large scale nuclear war.  Sure, it's not really possible to exterminate the human race, and life in general will go on with or without humans, but at this point even a relatively limited nuclear exchange would effectively end modern human civilization as we know it.	removed	removed	[0.13878416 0.8612159 ]

To me, your two examples are the same exact thing. Whether you believe a talking head that is espousing conspiracy theories, or if you believe the "powerful people", you still aren't thinking for yourself.   The opposite of a conspiracy theorist is someone that actually thinks for themself, and makes decisions based on their own internal wisdom.

In my home country they won't induce if you go to 41/42 weeks. Some women in my country wear this "I arrived at 42 weeks and I had a 24hrs labor" like a badge of honor.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

There was this anime about rakugo performers where a lot of emphasis is put on their names: the name they were given when they became apprentices, the one they were given (or chose) when they became full fledged performers, and the struggles about inheriting the master's name. Basically, the names define both who you are now and your vision of your art and future artistic routes. The Anime is set in the showa era, so very recent, but rakugo, sumo, tea cerimony, etc, those are all perceived traditional arts.

Gravity affecting time is well demonstrated. If you take an atomic clock on a plane and fly around the world, and compare it with one which stayed still, they will disagree. However, discrepancy is the "wrong" way. Einstein's special theory of relativity says that the traveling clock should be behind. In fact, the experiment shows the opposite, the flying clock is ahead. This is because of the effect of gravity, which is weaker further from the surface of the earth, is actually more significant and more than cancels out the effect of velocity in this experiment.  &#x200B;  Prototype next generation atomic clocks have been built which are accurate enough to show the effect time dilation due to gravity, simply by lifting a clock up a few centimeters further from the surface of the earth.	existing	existing	[0.68316895 0.31683105]

Very basic answer:Anemia causes tissues to become mildly hypoxic. The kidney can sense this and releases erythropoietin, a protein that goes and tells your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Why? Because red blood cells are what carry oxygen to tissues.   There are tons of different types of anemia though.   There's sickle cell anemia, where you might have normal hemoglobin but your red blood cells are sickle shaped so they don't have the ability to bind oxygen. There are other anemias caused by deformities of the red blood cells as well.   There are anemias of chronic disease, like if you had poor kidney function you wouldn't make enough erythropoietin to maintain a constant level needed to maintain rbc production homeostasis, leading to decreases hemoglobin in the long run.   There are anemias caused by iron, folate, and B12 deficiencies. These are anemias where you are missing certain vital factors in the RBC building, or hemoglobin building, process. Eventually your body stores run out of these things and you fail to make sufficient RBCs, again leading to hypoxia of the tissues.   There are other types as well, but these are very, very basic overviews of some of the most common types.	existing	existing	[0.5134607 0.4865393]

I work at a big company. Our company had $7 billion in revenue last year. They pay every hourly employee the same, regardless of age, race, experience, gender, or role, everyone gets the same pay. The gender wage gap is a cancer theory designed by super wealthy elites to keep the poor folks at each other's throats, to prevent them from uniting and demanding fair wages for all. As long as the ultra rich can keep us distracted from the real wage gap (between rich and poor) they will continue to get fat and rich off of our hard work, and they will sit around laughing smoking $1000 cigars, drinking $10000 liquor, while poor working class folks struggle to survive on their meager wages.

I’ve seen it too. All I have to say about that is… My ass. The only thing feminism has ever done in terms of making male victims unheard of is **encouraging** it.   In 2010, feminists in Israel **opposed** changes to rape laws that would make it so that women could be convicted of rape. In 2013, feminists in India pressured the government into rewriting rape laws so that only men could be convicted of rape.  More importantly, why isn’t there any feminist outcry against male rape victims and female rapists? Oh right… because it’s only an issue if the victim is a woman and the perpetrator is a man.  And yet, people still think feminism will fix it. Considering the whole mindset feminists have about looking at only one side of gender-neutral issues, it **won’t** unless oppressing male rape victims and defending female rapists even more is what you’re talking about.	existing	existing	[0.9375631  0.06243689]

An excellent example is food poisoning from rice that is stored improperly. Cooking rice can activate bacillus spores present in the dry rice. After the rice is cooked, bacillus will grow if the rice is not maintained at a sufficiently high temperature. During this time, the bacillus produces a heat-stable toxin that can cause gastrointestinal illness. This toxin is not destroyed by reheating. So rice that is cooked for a meal, left on the counter to cool a long time before being refrigerated, then reheated the next day can result in food poisoning.	existing	existing	[0.70702344 0.29297662]

You’re a liar if you say the government / organisations are always providing accurate long term results for sexual violence gender ratios.   For starters these are the same groups of people who set up undeniably anti male policies and undermine the rights of men & boys. They also defined the rape definition to specifically exclude female-onto-male forced penetration meaning almost all cases of women raping men do not count without an object being used. It’s a little odd to claim women get raped more then exclude men from rape statistics, isn’t it?   Governments also set up male only drafts and female only allocated DV shelters that discriminate against men.

Sometimes our manned space program has almost a torture-like feel to it.

>But why is free will inherently better then no free will? Why is free will essential for God's design?   Followed by:  >Therefore, if he willed it, he could decide that free will is bad and that creating a determiniatic reality free of suffering is good.  And that's where you tripped up a bit i think. You admit that the evidence suggests god has determined it's necessary for his design. Obviously based on your questions you don't know what his design is or why it's important. And you THEN conclude he could have done differently.   But - what if doing so did not allow his design to work? What if this reality is necessary to fulfill that design?  Your argument kind of falls apart at that point. Unless you can show what his design is and how a 'free will free' universe of nothing but good would still achieve it, you cannot argue that he could have done differently and achieved his design.	existing	existing	[0.81002486 0.1899751 ]

Lol I’m already disabled. So there goes that strawman.   You’re full of hate and ignorance and you’re content being that way. But that’s okay. It doesn’t matter really to me what an idiot says online to or about me. What matters is that I’m happy. It also matters that you’re happy, too. Having so much hatred in your heart for a certain type of people can lead you to dark places.   I truly hope you decide to educate yourself on this topic. I know it’s hard to understand when you’re not experiencing it. Before I understood the feelings that I had suppressed for so long, I was also extremely transphobic. (It doesn’t mean a fear of, but a hatred of.) I used the same arguments, too. I tried to convince myself that I was only imagining these feelings, or that everyone felt this way but suppressed them. It was only when someone (on Reddit actually!) decided to educate me and explain it to me, rather than be hateful back. I’m so glad they did.  Because I realized that these feelings of “something being off” actually had a reason.   I’m still in the wrong body. It makes it hard for me to look in the mirror. Usually I have trouble showering because it’s no longer hidden under my clothes. My body is my own, yes, but it should be different. I guess you could argue that physically disabled people are also in the wrong body, but it’s a different state of their body’s functionality.  My wrong body is that of I know it should’ve been different. If I get an mri my brain will be structured more as a man, and not a woman. Usually being trans is caused by the hormones in the womb. If the parent has a lot of testosterone but is carrying a female, those hormones could actually impact the brains development, thus causing the kid to end up being ftm (female to male) transgender. And vice versa. There’s science to back up being trans, and not just the “we have to humor these people or else we are bigots” type. I truly implore you to attempt to understand and be a bit more sympathetic toward peoples live struggles, even if you cannot relate to them. Being able to empathize with others is a huge part of what makes us the human race.   You can ask questions and I’ll answer them to the best of my ability.

No, it is worse. It is purpose-built so it is practically impossible to “comparison shop,” or even find out what providers pay for things. Hospitals purchase their supplies through purchasing associations, who  1. Add another layer of profit on top of already bloated prices  2. Can conceal actual costs as “trade secrets.”  So when the hospital charges you $8 for a single Tylenol, there’s no way to know if the hospital paid  $.01 or $7.99. The lack of transparency prevents the existence of a competitive market and keeps prices high. Keeping in mind, in many situations in health care the consumer does not have the luxury of researching the most cost-effective treatment options, following a car wreck or heart attack.	removed	removed	[0.47137132 0.5286287 ]

I don't think there is any numbers on _how many_ historians "take it seriously," but Marxist historiography is alive and well; I count myself in the tradition. Plenty of recognised and important historians nowadays are Marxists; but, I know it doesn't bode well for my point, think about a name such as Eric Hobsbawm(died 2012), one of the most important and influential historians in recent years. Eugene Genovese, who died the same year, was also a hugely influential figure. Robert Brenner, he is still alive and well, and also a key figure in history, even having a whole debacle named after him, i.e. "the Brenner Debates." Perry Anderson, also an important figure, still alive. Dave Renton, an important historian when it comes to fascism, is also a Marxist. Enzo Traverso is also a Marxist who has written extensively and important works. Edgar Hartwig is a German name I could mention. Gerald Horne is a contemporary and active American name. Chris Wickam is another name that has some weight to it.  But the short answer is, that yes, Marxism is still alive and well among historians nowadays. It is taken serious by most, even among non-Marxists, and Marxists are recognised in ways such as receiving positions and awards regularly.	removed	removed	[0.35937464 0.6406253 ]

Ex-smoker here. Most people who quit smoking don't quit for good on the first or even the fifth try. That's okay. Reframe your attempts as learning experiences instead of failures. That's what finally worked for me.   Make a mental note of when the cravings become overwhelming and then have a plan of how to deal with them beforehand. One thing that I found important was to remember that I could inhale deeply without pulling smoke into my lungs. Deep, calming breaths and waiting 90 seconds for the strongest part of that addictive pull to pass got me through.  Physical addiction is only the first 72 hours. After that, you have pure heme pumping through your veins sans nicotine. Be aware that caffeine and nicotine co-metabolize, so any caffeine you intake will effect you stronger than you're used to. Take it easy during those first three days and feed yourself nutritious food. After that, it's all psychological and fades with time.  Mostly, don't beat yourself up if this time isn't THE time. You can try again and you'll be armed with better tools from your last attempt.   Good luck and don't give up!	existing	existing	[0.71145874 0.28854123]

I'm not sure if I understand you, so please tell me if you meant something else.  Yes, most Marxists subscribe to the idea that the conditions of a society's production, or in Marxist terms a society's productive forces and relations of production, fundamentally shape and influences society's organisation, including the political commitments, cultural ideas and values that dominate in any society. And yes, while some ideas, like "the Asiatic mode of production" have fallen out of favour, rightfully so, most Marxist's agree on, if we agree that we are talking simplified and generalised, a progression from pre-civilisation over despotic or slave societies, into feudalism, into capitalism. Ofc. these distinctions are not set in stone, there are variations, and the progression isn't as linear as I make it sound here, no Marxist would claim so.  And ofc. Marxists may refer back the Marx's value form analysis, if it should it be relevant. It is part of the broader Marxist analysis, and important when discussing capitalist society.	removed	existing	[0.58007026 0.4199298 ]

The usual analogy is describing an ant on a string. From our perspective, it's a one dimensional system - the ant can go left or right. But to the ant, that string is a great cable and it can go around and around in either direction as well as left and right. Or another way is to think of videogames like asteroids or star control (dating myself) where when you go out the left you come in on the right and vice versa. No imagine your monitor getting more and more narrow - as you shrink the width, eventually "left side" and "right side" become effectively one. It's only when you get down to the one pixel level does left/right position become meaningful. Does that help?	existing	existing	[0.82228196 0.177718  ]

I just wanted to provide a little addendum to explain a little bit of the martial arts community's internal role in these martial arts myths. As a historian and a martial artist myself (nidan, Shitou-ryuu karate) this is something that I've looked into in a semi-amateurish, semi-professional (in that I'm equipped with the historian's toolset) fashion, and the study of the self-perception of martial arts is a somewhat fertile, if limited, academic field right now. While nothing that I'm going to say I think is particularly groundbreaking, I think it's still worth saying because the discourse surrounding martial arts, especially in the western hemisphere and probably *particularly* in internet circles, often has a rather poor grasp on this admittedly somewhat emergent area of study. The work on this sort of thing is ongoing by people like Paul Bowman, his colleague and co-editor Benjamin Judkins (whose [blog](https://chinesemartialstudies.com/) I highly recommend to anyone interested), and others, many of whom are mentioned in your bibliography.  Pretty much all modern martial arts disciplines are based on some kind of internal conceit, usually to do with lineage and authenticity. There are practical reasons for this. It's important to demonstrate how your school or style has been battle-tested/is more effective/is derived from authentic techniques for the same reasons that it's important for a university to be accredited. This holds as true for East Asian martial arts, which typically demonstrate this authenticity with reference to lineages (even when they're imagined), as it is for the recent contemporary practice of HEMA, which in the absence of a living tradition to refer to instead utilizes period manuals and practical demonstrations to prove the same point. Martial arts styles are, at their core, systems of techniques built around a central philosophy for how hand-to-hand combat should work. Pretty much all modern martial arts systems, regardless of country of origin or type, are mixed systems, drawing from countless other systems that have in turn been influenced by the very same systems that they influence, or their predecessors. This is almost trivially easy to demonstrate, and has been shown repeatedly by Bowman et al. It's also acknowledged openly in many schools, although others downplay it. A textbook example is in karate, which is a combination (mainly) of indigenous Ryuukyuuan techniques, southern Chinese styles (predominantly Fujian White Crane), and indigenous Japanese techniques, among many others. Different periods of karate's development show a greater or lesser influence of different parts, and different styles emphasize or de-emphasize different elements. Many traditional Shoutoukan doujou, for example, de-emphasize the Chinese aspect of karate, while instead emphasizing the deep, stable stances and longer-range strikes that typify Shoutoukan as being "traditional" but which are relatively recent additions to the curriculum. In many ways a style like Shitou-ryuu, while being technically more recent, can claim to be more "authentic," in that its creators combined several different styles together and were to a certain extent trying to "recover" an older form of the martial art as it had been practiced in the Ryuukyuu Islands before coming to mainland Japan.   It's in this context that the imagined origins and lineage of karate develop. Many people have heard, for example, the myth that karate developed because Okinawan peasants were forbidden from owning weapons or practicing martial arts and instead developed empty-handed techniques that mimicked weapon techniques, which they hid in elaborate dance-like kata. Both parts of this are, of course, untrue: karate's traditional weapons are police weapons, not converted farming gear, and the martial art's Ryuukyuuan roots derive mostly from anti-riot techniques, which is why there's so much of an emphasis in most styles on multi-directional combat against poorly-armed opponents. Likewise, students are often surprised to discover that this supposedly Japanese (or at best, "Okinawan") martial art uses Chinese names for most of its high-ranking kata, and that the idea of the kata itself as practiced in karate (where it's a lengthy solo routine rather than a partner-based practice of a single technique as is typical in mainland Japanese martial arts) is a Chinese development--indeed, prior to Funakoshi-sensei's changing of the writing to the homophonic 空手 the name of the martial art was originally written 唐手 "Tang (i.e. Chinese) hand," which is still used by the Korean, Shoutoukan-derived martial art Tang Soo Do. Why isn't this better known in karate doujou? The origins of the habit are certainly to a large part nationalistic--Funakoshi-sensei found the Chinese influence, which at the time of karate's arrival in mainland Japan was very strong, on the martial art embarrassing, and more importantly a near-insurmountable obstacle to its adoption in Japan--but with karate a globally practiced martial art it's hard to see how this would continue to perpetuate. To a certain extent there are again practical explanations rooted in the evolution of martial arts. Contrary to the common view in the western hemisphere, which has long dismissed East Asian martial arts as impractical and rooted in unchanging traditions, these styles evolve, and they evolve quite rapidly. Within less than a generation of Funakoshi-sensei's rebranding of karate, much of the style's internal philosophy had changed, replacing much of the southern Chinese-derived dynamic movement and wide, circular motions with simpler, more powerful strikes and more of an emphasis on set piece movements, converting from its essentially combat-focused roots to a more competition-based form. In that sense, then, the mythical origin of karate as a populist, secret martial art that, the story goes, became increasingly more ritualized and frozen reinforces the martial art's own internal philosophy, regardless of whether it's actually true or not.	existing	removed	[0.4476084 0.5523916]

It is a problem, and we have started addressing it. It is not limited to humans either, if you want to stop a crop that is not the most common variety then you can impact your results based on the similarity to the reference genome. We call this a reference bias, and there are [lots of ways](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02229-3) of trying to reduce it. Even when you know the true diversity of genomes in a population, it can be hard to integrate that data into your analysis.   The lack of sequencing of African American genomes in the US has caused [real harm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-019-0111-x) as we are less aware of varients more present in those populations that lead to dissease.  We now have sequenced thousands of human genomes, so we have a much better idea of the true diversity that is present across human populations.	existing	existing	[0.53178746 0.46821257]

On the bright side, that class awakened me to the sickness in politics and turned me to see out the Founders who were Anti-Federalist. Smart people, it turns out.

My two cents, as an internet stranger -   Continue to do kind things that are "effortless" for you, cause, you know, you are a kind person.   Think about kind things that you do that are hard for you - and maybe drop them, if you feel like you're being a sucker (slowly building resentment) instead of being a saint.   Think about also the community(s) that you're in. It's also possible that these are toxic communities where your gestures aren't appreciated and get taken advantage of, but there may be other communities where these are acknowledged. We can get used to toxic environments and not realize there are better waters out there.	existing	existing	[0.70374876 0.29625124]

It's an old scribe short hand,  it was later changed to a period when the printing press was popularized .  Using the strike would require a full set of additional characters for the printer and would cost money.  So it would be 1<strike>m</strike>.   It's important to note it was traditionally 2 strike lines.  Also note that being historical it changed over time and rules changed.   Some of these rules we have in place are due to specific popular books published for example.  The strike for money stayed because of printed log books that made using 1 character much faster than writing out dollar.	existing	existing	[0.7702304  0.22976956]

It's the same reason those are also sectioned off on the inside. The chambers connect so the fluid can fill everything but by having rows inside they can help control the sloshing which helps keep the weight load in a consistent place vs against one side as its going around a corner for instance.

It's would be better to say that the centrifugal force is the force of gravity. Centrifugal force isn't an actual force, it's a type of net force that results in circular motion. You still need to have an actual force acting perpendicular to the direction of travel to provide this centrifugal force. In a simple circular orbit, this force is provided by gravity.

In case this comment was meant in good faith, there's nothing to celebrate about increasingly heavier cars. In the context of developed countries, the US is one of the most dangerous to drive in, and overall traffic fatalities are on the upswing.  A bigger car is only protective until an even bigger car comes along and hits you, and so on. Meanwhile, these vehicles perform worse in icy conditions, are more prone to rollovers, cause more road damage, are more likely to kill or maim all other road users, and get worse gas mileage than their lighter counterparts.  Im case your comment was meant in good faith and you're not a complete fucking troll, you're absolute incorrect. Traffic fatalities have essentially [flatlined](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year#/media/File%3AUS_traffic_deaths_per_VMT%2C_VMT%2C_per_capita%2C_and_total_annual_deaths.png) since the early twentieth century. Even in just the last two decades, traffic fatalities relative to miles driven are down nearly 30%--all while cars have gotten heavier.  Fuel efficiency has [increased](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/images/2021-11/2021-f-3.png)--all while vehicle weight has increased.

It's not semantics. The point of agile development isn't to deliver broken products or products that buyers are unhappy with. It's just an iterative way to develop software, the idea of which is that you'll deliver more useful things sooner. Whether that actually gets release or not is another matter. You can have an agile process without actually releasing the thing to the general public until it's in a decent state.  *Bugs* will be in complex software regardless of development process.	existing	existing	[0.7706718  0.22932822]

>about 4% of humans are sociopaths, should i avoid everyone then?  Rationale like this probably won't make much impact on a feminist. Remember, they're intentionally being idiots with examples like this.  Either  1) They truly believe 1/3 men are rapists, which ignores all statistics.   2) They're pushing an agenda to limit rights of men.  And in either of these cases, the likelihood that they've faced serious impact from a sociopath is quite low. So in they're mind they'll just tell themselves "well I've never seen anything happen with a sociopath in my life so I can ignore it but my friend on twitter made a #MeToo so clearly rapes are more common"  Some things to point out:  1) The poisonous cake example is a fallacious argument in two aspects. One is that it ignores facts, and two is that it's a false equivalence. A cake that will immediately kill you upon eating it vs being asked out by a man is not the same thing. Flip it around and say "if you had 10000 cakes and one of them would give you a stomach ache, would you eat one?"  2) If this fails and they truly believe 1/3 men are evil, they will almost definitely have more than 3 men in their lives. Further, they're generalizing an entire group off a minority that even they recognize is still a minority in all their delusions. "So your husband, father, grandfather, uncle, friends are all rapists?"  3) Flip the script. "So I can say all women are gold diggers?" "Women use sex to advance in business which means they're less qualified than men who succeed on skill and results." If they can generalize all men from a minority of men, why can't we?   Remember that your goal is not to attack women, it's to highlight the fallacies that they're using in a way that they can understand.	existing	existing	[0.94012666 0.05987339]

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	removed	removed	[0.3036538  0.69634616]

Sorry that this happened to you. It is technically rape, yes. I think you need to talk to a therapist, work through how you feel about all of this, and decide the proper course of action.   Given that it was her 16th birthday, there is a lot of expectations and pressure around that bday, especially for young women, and she probably had this built up in her head as her sweet 16 where she has sex at the end of the night and it's a big deal, etc. She also probably thought that you were just scared to have sex and she'd change your mind by you both being naked, etc. etc. All that said, the way she went about it without your consent is completely wrong, manipulative, and harmful to you. It's obvious she had a plan and while she probably thought you'd change your mind and get into it, it sounds like you didn't go along with it or change your mind at any point, which means ultimately, it is definitely a form of rape.   Finding an adult you can trust to talk to is a good idea, but I can see how you might be conflicted or want to not say anything so as to not get the law involved since this is somebody you've known for so long. So talking to a professional who is not directly emotionally tied to you may be good, because they will be less reactive.   On the religious side of things - if there is a god, and that God is just, this won't be held against you since it wasn't your fault. So I know you feel horrible about breaking your vow, but if this happened the way you said it did, it was out of your control.   Do you have mental health resources through school or anything? There are hotlines as well - it may be possible to get connected to a good therapist relatively anonymously to help you process this and then decide the right course of action.   Also, have you talked to her since? Does she feel bad? Has she apologized? Not that it would make up for what she did at all, but it will surely influence how you decide to proceed. It may be wise to take some distance to help you think clearly about what you want and what's best for you at this point.	removed	existing	[0.92908764 0.07091232]

I know you disagree with him, but in reality it’s his body his choice. When getting a vaccine, you sign a contract understanding the risks associated and basically if one of these risks harm you then you can’t sue for damages. If he’s unwilling to sign that agreement, and take on those risks, that’s his choice. It’s annoying, but it’s his choice. Perhaps maybe instead of being annoyed and angry, try talking to him. I talked to my friend who isn’t anti-vaccines she just doesn’t trust the covid-19 vaccines. I don’t agree with her, but I can see why she’s concerned. I myself do not trust the Pfizer vaccine, but I made the decision to get the AstraZeneca vaccine instead. By listening to her concerns and not immediately calling her a conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxer, danger to society, I made her feel comfortable and safe to talk about it. She hasn’t been vaccinated yet, but she is about to once this new vaccine, that I encouraged her to research, comes out in my country. We have to accept some people are not comfortable doing things, but we should be accomodating and positive and make them feel safe to talk about their concerns instead of just calling them an idiot. I love my friend, and I empathise with her concerns, and I have helped her find a way to be both vaccinated and comfortable with the situation to accept the risks and sign that contract. Mandates are also proven to lower vaccination rates, the famous case being britain enforcing a vaccine mandate I think it was in the 70s or 90s. Try talking to your dad and maybe you’ll be able to convince him and he’ll be able to get his job back.	removed	existing	[0.8046353 0.1953647]

He’s also the type to brag about how good he is in bed, and how many women he’s had.  Which is supposedly a lot.  Another thing I don’t buy.

Not to be mean but this is a straw man. They don't not believe in stars or planets. They believe they are not what NASA claims they are.

Stars stay in the same place but planets move and are in different places every night. They believe this because of what it says in Genesis in the creation account.

I was tested clean last year and then 1 new partner, a girl I dated and I thought I could trust for 6 months and we recently broke up.  Got tested because was having issues peeing and got a big sore on the head of my penis like 2 weeks ago that never turned into a blister (just now drying out after 2 weeks) and some smaller red marks on my penis and scrotum but I blood tested positive for HSV1, negative for HSV2 a week ago.  Positive for Chlamydia as well and took antibiotic for that.    Virtual visit doctor told me don't worry too much about it (The HSV1 blood result).  I told him about the sores and he told me to get the sores swabbed like 4 days ago so I did that and that came back negative for both HSV1 and HSV2.  The doctor who swabbed me also immediately put me onto antivirals (400mg acyclovir) so I assumed I def had it after she looked at it while swabbing.   What is the likelihood that they were both false negatives?  Should I get retested in a few weeks?  I imagine I won't be able to swab test if there isn't any sores present but will blood work be more clear?  Thanks for any advice this has been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  I have a history of getting a rash on the shaft of my penis that doctors gave me cream for but never on the head.	existing	existing	[0.7291551  0.27084488]

About the mental health: I too suffer from some mental health issues and have family members that also have mental health issues, but that is no excuse.

From what you are describing, he is basically behaving like a child, you are parenting him. Buying him things/offering awards to get him to help do basic household chores? Nope. And if that is the way he will act, then punishing him like a child (turning off wifi, confiscating his console etc.) is not unreasonable. Don't treat him like an adult until he acts like one.  Good on you for putting your foot down. Don't let him get away with this, don't feel guilty for any of the things you did to "punish" him. I don't like commenting on how you should deal with him but this is such a big red flag that it would be visible from outer space. He will not change until he has to, meaning until he is forced to do these things he won't. And that probably won't happen as long as you live in the same household.

I am married to an INTJ, and let me tell you, emotional stuff isn't his strong point. He has been making more of an effort, though, especially after I shared with him some statements that would be comforting and validating for me whenever I'm going through stuff. It's been a big help for my husband because he's more aware now that for me, being comforted means having my emotions acknowledged instead of being given advice. My husband is very solution-oriented, so his instinct really is to try to fix things even when I don't really need to do so right away.   Maybe you can tell your friend about specific statements that she can tell you whenever you're going through something. Or you can share with her the type of comfort you need (e.g., acknowledgement of emotions instead of advice/logical assumptions).	existing	existing	[0.9290068  0.07099316]

The Korean king Hyeonjong (r. 1009-1031) came to power through a coup. The previous king, Mokjong (r. 997-1009), had very little power over his kingdom. Goryeo (the Korean kingdom at the time) was effectively ruled by Mokjong's mother, Queen Dowager Cheonchu, and her lover Kim Chi-yang. There were many in the kingdom who weren't happy about this. Cheonchu and Kim Chi-yang had a son who they allegedly wanted to succeed the childless Mokjong, and the queen tried to have her nephew Hyeonjong killed since he was the only other one in line to be king.  During Mokjong's reign, Goryeo had achieved a tentative peace with the Khitans who ruled the Liao Empire to their north. They had agreed to submit to the Khitan emperor Shengzong instead of the Song (Han Chinese) emperor. This meant they paid tribute to him and also that they let Shengzong (or his representative) perform the official investiture of King Mokjong.  In 1009, though, Mokjong was overthrown in a coup. There were factions who wanted Hyeonjong to succeed Mokjong instead of Cheonchu's son with Kim Chi-yang. They deposed Mokjong, killed Kim Chi-yang and his son, and exiled Mokjong and the queen. During their flight from the capital, Mokjong was assassinated even though he had agreed to make Hyeonjong his successor. Hyeonjong was installed on the throne without knowing that Mokjong had been killed for it.  Meanwhile, the Khitan had been waiting for an opportunity to re-invade Goryeo. They had settled their war with the Song in 1005 with the Treaty of Shanyuan, so they were eager to claim more territory on their southern border with Korea. After being informed of Hyeonjong's succession to the throne, the Khitan invaded Korea. They claimed that the Koreans were guilty of regicide, which especially angered them since Shengzong had been the one to invest Mokjong.  Years of brutal war followed. Between 1020 and 1022, peace was eventually negotiated. Not coincidentally, in 1022, Hyeonjong had his envoys report to the Khitan that he was dead and had been succeeded by his son. In reality, Hyeonjong did not die until 1031; his son Deokjong was made Crown Prince in 1022 but did not succeed him until 1031. If Hyeonjong had not faked his own death to his Khitan overlords, they may not have been satisfied with the peace negotiations.  **See**: Vermeersch, Sem, "Royal Ancestor Worship and Buddhist Politics: The Hyonhwa-sa Stele and the Origins of the First Koryo Tripitaka", *The Journal of Korean Studies* 18:1 (2013), 115-146.	existing	existing	[0.5339541  0.46604592]

I'm not a trot, but I like what he said in Fascism: What It Is And How To Fight It: >But the petty bourgeoisie can also find a leader in the proletariat. This was demonstrated in Russia and partially in Spain. In Italy, in Germany, and in Austria, the petty bourgeoisie gravitated in this direction. But the parties of the proletariat did not rise to their historic task.  >To bring the petty bourgeoisie to its side, the proletariat must win its confidence. And for that it must have confidence in its own strength.  >It must have a clear program of action and must be ready to struggle for power by all possible means. Tempered by it revolutionary party for a decisive and pitiless struggle, the proletariat says to the peasants and petty bourgeoisie of the cities:  >“We are struggling for power. Here is our program. We are ready to discuss with you changes in this program. We will employ violence only against big capital and its lackeys, but with you toilers, we desire to conclude an alliance on the basis of a given program.”  >The peasants will understand such language. Only, they must have faith in the capacity of the proletariat to seize power.  >But for that it is necessary to purge the united front of all equivocation, of all indecision, of all hollow phrases. It is necessary to understand the situation and to place oneself seriously on the revolutionary road.	existing	existing	[0.8097741  0.19022588]

We also never had the same scientific abilities. The current number of active researches and scientists (in general) is assumed to be bigger than the \*overall total of scientists ever\*. Again, not sure what the source for that information, but considering how high level education and production have entwined in the last century, it sure at least hits close to reality.  The spanish flue wasn’t that different from Covid-19, but we had in no way the understanding or the technological abilities to achieve such a deep inside into the illness, or it’s progress through human society, to the point that nobody can prove how it somehow stopped after a few years (most of the “develops into less aggressive strain” theories are just that, theories; we have a good idea why it might happen, but no data to really underly that).  So from a perspective of history theory of science, this is all very interesting; how to we build an understanding of the world compared to before, and how does it influence society, good and bad?  Because what has enabled us to this deeper insight is, at the same time, what partly made Covid harder on the world; due to the much higher mobility and world-wide entanglement, things spread faster and deeper - which is true both for information and contagious diseases.	existing	existing	[0.7760729  0.22392711]

The accuracy of measurement is related to the energy of collision used to interact with it.  Higher energy, shorter wavelength, greater accuracy.  At a wavelength as short as planks length, the energy of collision is so high as to create a black hole.  Any higher energy would merely result in additional / larger black holes.

Discipline is forgoing the short term for long term rewards (dealing with the pain of a run now to become fitter later)  Being fat is undesirable for health and social reasons and given the choice to be at a healthy weight through a magic pill all fat people would chose as such as it has only objective benefits.   Taking a magic pill to learn a second language or draw well is a false equivalency as not being a good drawer/ only knowing one language isn’t undesirable and only has subjective benefits.  Losing weight is painful in the short term but has great long term benefits.   The only reason fat people are fat is because they don’t have the discipline to put up with the short term pain of a caloric deficit/ avoid the short term pleasure of eating dessert/ bad food in order to achieve the long term healthy weight. (This is further shown by the existence of gastric bi pass surgery. An invasive surgery that takes discipline out of the equation).	existing	existing	[0.7318889  0.26811114]

While this is true in the sense that a low A1C can be an indicator of episodes of dangerously low blood sugars - there's some information missing here and I don't think this answers OPs questions about RBC and A1C in normal bodies. To clarify your points about diabetics though (as I don't have answers for OP) an A1C of less than 7 in Type 2 diabetics is considered the goal of their medical treatment so I have to assume you mean type 1s. In Type 1 diabetics, it is no longer considered an immediate cause for alarm. While it can indicate lower overall blood sugars or repeated episodes of very low blood sugar, today's technology has allowed many type 1 diabetics to reach near normal glucose levels safely. Additionally, while the overall 'low kills fast/high kills slowly' is very true - there are some considerations. A low that requires medical intervention is extremely dangerous and can cause death, coma, or other severe medical conditions. The term low for diabetics means a lot of things, though. Lows into the 70m/dL range are often considered trivial. Below 70 many many type 1s can treat a low on their own without medical intervention and treatment of these lows does not cause permanent harm. Sustained high blood glucose levels does cause harm that is potentially permanent and increases risk for complications and comorbidities that decrease quality of life and chance of death. So a low A1C in type 1s is generally considered a reason for celebration and a high A1C is considered reason for medical intervention.

The reason why you were banned probably has to do with the fact that your initial question was answered and rather than accept the answer given, you dug your heels in and initiated what could be considered a debate.  Granted you weren't being rude, but rule #6 of the sub is "no questions or debates." You broke the rules more than once. It is not a debate sub or an educational sub. Also there's a rule in the sub against criticizing AES, as it is a sub for criticizing liberals.  You probably wouldn't of been banned had you not continued your line of questioning which was answered very well by a comrade.  Also the way you formulated your questions could lead to them being taken in bad faith, in my opinion. Your first question was answered and than you asked "how do you explain the poverty in China?"   You literally started from the assumption that China is impoverished, rather than asking if its true that China is impoverished. (It isn't btw look into poverty elevation in China) Had you not framed the question like this and began asking questions/debating, you'd probably be left alone.	existing	existing	[0.7499036  0.25009638]

Thanks, I really appreciate these conversations too. I understand how it might seem like in a perfect world, rapists would be punished in the industry, but sadly that isn’t the case. In the same way that drug cartels continuously operate despite being illegal, so do rapists.  I highly recommend reading this blog post, it has lots of great information with sources:  https://artemis-the-protector.tumblr.com/post/669540544643530752/yeah-because-you-can-totally-tell-how-smart-i-am  Some key takeaways from it are the realities of the porn industry. Human trafficking, child sex abuse, rape, coercion, etc. are rampant in the industry. This often goes unpunished due to lack of regulation and the victims not being taken seriously. You can see this in the testimonials from real porn actresses in the linked post. Because that’s what they are… actresses. Of course they’re going to pretend everything is fine when the camera is rolling.  You can also see the misogynistic attitudes. Yes, most of those aggressive acts are directed towards women. You have titles like “dirty teen whore gets anally destroyed” and similar. Very misogynistic in nature. You said something about how men might make degrading comments about women in porn but it’s ok “because it’s porn” and I ask… why does that make it ok? Isn’t it worse that saying degrading things about women and their bodies turns you on? If you weren’t a misogynist, why would porn appeal to you when most of it involves women being tossed around, slapped, choked, and generally just treated like objects?  Also, there’s this:  https://artemis-the-protector.tumblr.com/post/670758316208685056/blackswanenthusiast-we-know-that-tell-that-to  This post contains links where men who direct and buy sex talk about women. You can see the misogynistic attitudes plain as day. You also have to consider that by supporting this industry, these men are also supporting the rampant rape and trafficking of the industry.  So yes, I believe porn is inherently misogynistic. The subject matter itself glorifies the degradation and pain of women, and the industry itself routinely exploits and abuses the women working in it.	existing	existing	[0.6812732  0.31872675]

What argument? I replied because you said  "lots of Muslim countries don't jail you for being gay either" and "There are many Muslim countries above non-Muslim countries on the LGBTQ+ safety rating"     23 out of the 26 Islamic countries would jail you or worse for being gay. So, you're wrong.     Admittingly, I think the other point is trash. Yes, technically all Muslim countries are above Nigeria--which itself is a primarily Muslim country by population. But none of the primarily Muslim countries are above the bottom third, most are in the bottom 20. Whatever statement about safety you're trying to make is meaningless what you're comparing is danger to danger     You've provided no examples.

Yeah volleys do their best, the problem is their best can’t hold a candle to what a well trained career Fire crew can do.    If you tried to attack a structure fire with zero fitness and zero training you’re more likely to hurt yourself and endanger everybody else on scene than anything else.  Ladders are the least of the physical challenges involved in structure fire operations.  A 1 3/4” handline weighs roughly 60 pounds charged up and running at 50 psi with a smooth bore nozzle the force exerted on the firemen operating it is roughly 75lbs.  And now you need to move while spraying.  If you don’t know and train with proper technique that handline is going flying.	existing	removed	[0.34535566 0.65464437]

You would have to look up torque converter to get the complete answer.   As for your question.  That Torque converter acts like if you had 2 fans facing each other closely and you would pit power to one of them.   The other would start to spin a bit, raise the power of the first fan more and the second one would start spinning more.   The goal of the torque converter is to allow the engine to keep spinning while stopped but be linked (via ciculation) when it spins faster.    For the convenience of everyone, the converter is set so that at idle, the engine give just enough torque to move at parking speed(10mp/h).   Without this, you would have to always press the gas (even on a slight hill) to move forward and this would get annoying or dangerous for those limited enough to prefer focusing on accelerator/brakes and steering only.	existing	existing	[0.87571526 0.12428474]

If you read my comment you'll see that wasn't the only factor. I also talked about the "types" of crimes. I'm not being naive. I think police brutality has a lot more to do with individuals within the police force being terrible people and doing a terrible thing, and/or the individual getting arrested and how he/she acts.  It's more likely there are shitty people in the police force, that do shitty things to anyone in their way, than there is some underlying agenda to inflict extra brutal force upon men and minorities. Or, that the individual getting arrested forces officers into using lethal force, or split second decision, etc  Another way to look at it: if a woman resists, does she pose as much of a threat as a man? On average, no. Most male police officers would be able to restrain a woman without the use of a fire arm or taser (and men are more likely to be able to resist the taser). There's just more threat. (I still think this is a factor, but I concede the overall arguments premise)  I'm all for not killing people, I don't see how anyone would want the police to gun someone down, but assigning sexism(I concede this point, I think it's a major factor) and racial prejudice as the reason for the difference in police shootings(divided by race it actually isn't that different, nowhere near the male/female divide). There are way more factors, just like with the "wage gap"(women think the wage gap is just sexism, but that's not what it is, there's way more to it).   I believe racial prejudice is one of the smallest factors in police brutality. In the George Floyd incident, the officer was known for doing that exact same "leg on the back of the neck" move before this. Other policemen have been known to do it too. Jacob Blake, also wasn't shot for racial reasons. Neither was the incident that led to the Ferguson riots. All of it was media outlets lying, and spreading misinformation. Every time one of these cases comes under scrutiny, it falls apart. Jussie Smulletts case also turned out to be a hoax. (Not police brutality, but media sources lying)   So no, I don't believe racism, or sexism(point conceded), are what have to do with police brutality, i think there are a lot of factors leading to it, one of them being the types of crimes, and the circumstances involved during the actual arrest (ie, trying to climb in an SUV [a dangerous machine, that someone just recently used to run over multiple people in a parade] full of kids, that aren't yours, with a knife in your hands, while the children's mother screams, "my kids are in the car!", while police are screaming to get down, to put down the knife, have tackled you, and tased you... All because they were responding to a call naming Jacob Blake [who had a warrant out at the time], and staying he wouldn't give back the keys to her car).  Honestly, I can see police brutality not happening to women anywhere near as much because of sexism. So many men would never even hit a woman. Most men I know wouldn't. I'll actually concede the sexism point. But, the racial prejudice, I disagree with. Racism is not just shunned in society, it's completely black listed, 0 tolerance.	existing	existing	[0.633016 0.366984]

I don't know which country you live in, but in  in every developed country and many of the less developed, rape and sexual assualt are illega.  And further, the sexualization of the opposet sex is mostly not cultural, it's biological, the differences we see between the sexualization of men and the sexualization of women are also, probably, mostly biological. As in men seem to do it more.   You also seem to be implying there is some culture where rape and sexual assault are not problems. Off the top of my head, the country with the lowest incidence of rape and sexual assault is Japan, not exactly a progressive paradise.   Look at how crazy people get when you repress their sexuality and treat sex like a bad thing. Those people develop sexual complexes and are crazy. And then act out in unhealthy ways, like the Taliban.	existing	existing	[0.9326862  0.06731374]

It gets more interesting. As I'm sure you know the pound was divided into shillings and pence until 1971. So up to that point, the abbreviations were £ for pounds, s for shillings, and d for pence. Hence why boomers think it's funny to refer to old money as "LSD". The s and d come from the old Roman coins "solidus" and "denarius".  The [long letter s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s) was sometimes used interchangeably with an oblique mark / to separate groups of numbers. It would be common to see prices written like 5/6 to mean 5s6d. Even though in the modern world the / sign is more commonly referred to as a "slash/stroke/forward slash", the technical term in Unicode is still solidus.  Then decimal currency came along in 1971 and we can use a normal abbreviation like "p" for pence, rendering all of that totally useless.	existing	existing	[0.56754667 0.4324533 ]

We have to get to the facts of why women were forced to breed in that way - there has to be motivation for that. Maintaining power and keeping the lineage running was important back then for powerbrokers. History is far too complex for such simpleton female-oriented conclusions like "muh freedumz". Humanity and civilization rose from burning lava to reach this point. The path was not easy. Was there collateral damage? Fuck yes. Women, men and children everywhere suffered to maintain status quos all over the world. Each tribe, each kingdom fighting for existence and to flourish beyond simple survival. And that meant any means necessary. Men can't be blamed for that.	existing	existing	[0.6659842  0.33401576]

That number means nothing about the vaccine because it is missing information on the population sampled.  There are other areas where almost all hospitalizations and deaths are of people who are vaccinated, because in those areas almost everyone is vaccinated.  If 90% of people were unvaccinated that number would mean no effect, and if 95% of people were unvaccinated that number would mean the vaccine puts people at greater risk. It is not enough information to make a valid conclusion.  The stat you need is hospitalization and deaths per Capita. So comparing 100k vaccinated people to 100k unvaccinated people.  I would assume the per Capita stat would make being unvaccinated look even worse than the number you put, but that's not the point.  Regardless of if you arrive at the correct conclusion, using bad stats is misinformation.	existing	removed	[0.49401692 0.5059831 ]

Its not anyone's fault for giving up but your own. I'm 24 and I've been incarcerated 8 different times, I've been monitored by the state since I was 13. Ive been in multiple group homes and multiple juvenile centers.Both of my parents were physically abusive and I left at 15 and never looked back. I had to sell drugs to eat for my first year on my own because nobody would give me enough hours. My first job was literally flipping burgers. I dropped out of school because I couldn't afford a living and go at the same time. To this day I only have my GED. I tried to kill myself at 16 with an attempt at slitting my throat. Most of the people I grew up with are dead from drug overdoses or have been sentenced to real criminal time. The few friends around are some of the best people I ever met though. Would kill for me and I for them. My parents respect me now because I didn't take it as a chip and I went out and earned everything I have. I've forgiven them because I was really the only one abused and they had me at 18 and broke up before I was born. Theres no book to this shit. They wronged me, people have wronged me, and I've taken it in stride. The state took my license for having weed in my blood while driving. My best friend is my co worker thank God. Right now I'm learning how to renovate houses. Never had any trade experience and now I can remodle a house. I've learned how to machine, program, mold and fire restoration, I've even cleaned up dead bodies. I was a Frontline worker in the beginning of covid, literally decontaminating covid sites. I've seen a lot of fucked up shit in my 24 years. Kids who are murderers, bodies, people stealing from me, parents who weren't there when I need them to be, exs who fucked with my head to control me, the government striping me of my rights. I still barely have 1000 dollars to my name. But I know that my girl loves me, my friends are there for me, my family understands me, and I am one step closer from leaving all of that shit behind me. This world doesn't care whats happened to you. The point is you make something of it and you call it your own. Nothings ever given. And there's been more humans whove given up before they've given themselves a proper chance than any of us would like to admit. You're 20 years old. You could get off this app right now and start learning real things that have value. The internet is an ocean of information and if you use it right, it can tremendously benefit your life. Stop being self conscious, remember that even though our lives are cushy, with our internet and massive beds, this is survival. Giving up is irrelevant, you'll die at the end of this no matter what you do. The point is to take every single fucking moment that you experience as one worth experiencing, because it is.  Sorry for the book but I feel like you needed it. Hope it helps.	existing	removed	[0.29222533 0.7077747 ]

Wisconsin, and Milwaukee in particular, became a base of socialism for three major reasons.   The first was that in the United States, there's a swath of the country stretching from Minneapolis through the Upper Midwest and Mid-Atlantic into New England where almost all of America's early industry was headquartered . This is for a lot of reasons (proximity to iron and coal deposits, access to easy shipping via the Great Lakes, large pools of immigrant labor, etc), but the point is that along with industry went large and highly militant labor movements.   The second was the large German-American population that settled in major Midwestern cities like Milwaukee. This is not unique to Milwaukee, of course, there were other major centers of German immigration in Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Saint Louis. The significance of this is that in the mid-19th century, most of these German immigrants were fleeing from the aftermath of the failed 1848 German Revolution. These immigrants, who were almost entirely leftists who had been exposed to socialist ideas in Germany, brought them to America and continued to consume the latest left-wing thought coming out of Europe. (Interestingly, Karl Marx was almost one of these immigrants, seriously considering moving to Texas a few years before the publication of the Communist Manifesto).  So that explains why there was a lot of left-wing energy in Midwestern cities. But why were they particularly successful in Milwaukee? That's at least partly due to a movement called "sewer socialism", referencing the high-quality public sewer system they created. The sewer socialists, based mostly in Milwaukee, sought to focus on practical municipal reforms over revolution. When Milwaukee socialists found themselves in municipal positions, they pushed for improved public services and cleaner neighborhoods, avoiding the sort of machine corruption common in other American cities. This was a popular approach, and Milwaukee was governed by socialist mayors from 1910-1912, 1916-1940, and 1948-1960, as well as electing the first ever socialist to the House of Representatives in 1910.	removed	existing	[0.72141194 0.27858803]

 A couple of comments.  Have you seen the size of Europe?  It’s quite big.  Lots of individual countries, but still quite big.  Europe is a bit bigger than the USA. 10.2 million sq km vs 9.8 million sq km). So, similar sizes. My last paragraph is relevant to this comparatively equal size.  My second comment is one of “do you know why the USA does not have much in the way of public transport?”  There are a number of reasons including low density population centres, urban sprawl, the American dream of large houses, large backyards/gardens and motor vehicles.  Also GM & the Koch brothers didn’t help. Oh yes, politics as well. Many Americans see public transport as being a part of a welfare system and they are politically against welfare systems.  The most common myth on why Americans doesn’t have great mass transit is that the country is too huge, but a look at Canada, and Europe, and China, contradicts this theory. Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver all have buses, rapid transit, and commuter rails. Canada still manages to have adequate transport in all its major cities.  Europe has public transportation systems that cross borders and boundaries.	existing	existing	[0.75332713 0.24667287]

>What’s wrong is you are actively disparaging women for their clothing choices, which is the opposite of you being happy with everyone living their lives any way they see fit.  This discussion originally begin with a conversation about whether it's okay for a man to leave his girlfriend because she wants to go to a party dressed like a prostitute. First, people like yourself were arguing that makes him a sexist.  Then I argued that if women have the choice to dress however they like, men should have the choice to not be in relationships with women that dress like hoes, because that's equality. Isn't that what Feminism was fighting for?  Then, people like yourself asked me to explain why I wouldn't be in a relationship with a woman who dressed like a prostitute, and thus we ended up here. In other words, the goalposts have been moved. I do think everyone has the right to live life as they see fit. This includes that women can do whatever they want, and men can do whatever they want in response. Based on my experience, good men aren't going to be in relationships with women that dress like prostitutes, for reasons I've already explained. [Sexual objectification hurts women](https://wp.nyu.edu/steinhardt-appsych_opus/the-effects-of-sexual-objectification-on-womens-mental-health/), this is a fact that has been proven over and over again and cannot be denied. It doesn't make any difference if it's the woman sexually objectifying herself, in fact that's arguably even worse.  You're free to disagree with that. But honestly, the fact that so many people have been upset with what I've said (good men aren't going to be in relationships with women who dress like hoes) means I've struck a nerve. People don't become emotionally invested in a conversation like this unless on some level, they know there's truth to the claim being made. All you're doing is proving my point.  &#x200B;  >Plenty of women who wear revealing clothing are in happy, healthy relationships so you making a blanket statement like that is not only inaccurate, it’s just laughable.  I don't know any women who dress like prostitutes who are in happy, healthy relationships, nor do I know any good, high quality men that would put up with that when they have plenty of options of women who have self-respect and dignity and who do not treat their own bodies like an object.

In the case of dropping both balls off a cliff without any resistance from air or friction from the ground, they will hit the bottom at the same time as they both accelerate at the same rate. Once you add in friction and air resistance then you muddy the waters and will likely change the outcome. I could be totally wrong but I think I remember that lesson from years back when I was in school. If I remember correctly, if you do add in air resistance, a ball vs a sheet of paper it'd change but both objects will still reach the same speed if you provide enough distance as you reach terminal velocity ie the fastest an object can free fall.

Can confirm. Been to the most remote reaches of Zambia. Food is not a problem there; it grows everywhere. The problem is infrastructure. There is fresh guava and greens and grains, and it’s all delicious and could easily be enjoyed by the whole population if only there was a way to reliably transport it. But there isn’t enough food in the city, and there is no such thing as healthcare outside of the city. And all of this, you could argue, could be abated simply by investing more into infrastructure and transportation, because the only way my group had access to that food was because a local delivered it to us by motorcycle.	existing	existing	[0.9104831  0.08951683]

Well in short, very. But it did depend, on the commander, the environment, and of course the period. Legionaries under General (and Consul) Marius for instance we’re called ‘Marius’ mules’ for how hard he worked them.  But they were (often) required to March an average of 20-25 miles a day, with 25kg then build a fort at the end of it. So would have been pretty tough.  Saying that, the fitness of a lot of other soldiers in the ancient world would also have been pretty impressive.	removed	removed	[0.4333679 0.5666321]

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	removed	removed	[0.26255283 0.7374472 ]

I don't think that is true.  The gravitational force a body sees is delayed by the time it takes for the gravity wave to travel from the source to the target.  So two bodies in orbit each have a delayed response to the others influence on gravity based on their separation distance and the speed of light (gravity).  The delay between the sun and the earth is about 8 minutes.  The target is always being pulled towards where the body was at the time of the emission of the gravity wave.	removed	removed	[0.48966497 0.510335  ]

1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	removed	removed	[0.26403135 0.73596865]

My best guess - I think that most solar systems have to have \~1 gas planet and \~1 solid planet. If you think about star formation, after the star begins going, there is matter left in the  gas dust swirl around it - that has to aggregate. If it is too close to the 'sun' it falls in. If it is further, it merges / coagulates into planets. The close matter has to become a solid planet or the solar wind would blow the gas planet away. The further material must become a gas planet because it becomes so large that pressure at the center creates heat with forces some gases not to solidify.	removed	existing	[0.7201194 0.2798806]

1. If you want to be scientific here’s some science: the vaccine has side effects. Yes, rare. But they exist.  2. People have the right to measure the risks of the vaccine vs. the risks of the virus and act according what they see fit. If what they see fit is “unscientific”, does that make them less human? People believe all unscientific things - astrology, for ex. - and we don’t get a free pass for dehumanizing them because of it. “Oh but they are putting publich health in danger”, how so? The vaccine does not stop transmission. In fact I know a couple of cases of vaccinated people being the source of infection for unvaccinated people. If unvaccinated people are the ones with more severe symptoms, then maybe we should prohibit vaccinated people from entering places, no? They are the ones putting unvaccinated at risk.

For me (I’m fully vaxxed and I wear 2 masks but I have a blood clotting disorder and I’m very fearful of catching Covid) I just watch this shit show and feel so sad.   So sad that so many people have died and suffered, so many families have empty chairs at the dinner table. Hospitals are full, declaring emergencies, can’t see everyone who’s emergently ill, people with emergencies not related to Covid are dying when they otherwise wouldn’t because of care issues. Crime is up. Way up. People are calling the police and they don’t show. They’re understaffed and exhausted. Inflation is way up at a time when people are struggling with money issues, job issues, isolation and loneliness and…  So many people are looking for arguments and fighting with each other when we all need to help each other. We all need to help one another right now, seriously. So grateful for those that do help, but there needs to be more. This should be an effort where most people look out for one another. But everyone’s gotten so mean. Even people that I have known my whole life, people I love and care about, it’s like I don’t know them anymore, they are online name calling and being nasty. I don’t see them the same way anymore.   I had a blood clots all over my lungs late last year. Not a good time for a medical emergency. Everyone made it about the vaccines. It was the vaccine, it wasn’t the vaccine, are you going to get your booster? All of this dumb arguing and I’m freaking out, suffering, scared for my life.

I can't remember where I read it, but also the body only needs 5 mins of stretching per muscle group a day to optimize flexibility. It really isn't about intensity, as you say, it is about getting a good stretch in that slowly progresses you safely.  When you go gentle but keep progress pressure and days in a row consistent, it's sort of mind blowing how quickly one gains flexibility. Just 2 or 3 weeks into a new stretch routine to help with leg flexibility and I'm already doing things with my body I thought my muscles would outright prevent forever because I lift weights too much.

Can I tell you exactly what The Left does that damages Women, and completely devalues SA and Rape as crimes(specifically Feminism, but you could apply it to The Left in general)...  Remove the meaning of everything, and conflate everything together...  You know the stat which says "97% of Women will be SA'd in their life? That comes from a study which defined SA as anything from Rape to "A guy said I looked pretty". Now whether this was intentional or not, Feminism/The Left absolutely RAN with this. Speaking to someone is SA. Making an inappropriate joke, is SA. Touching a Womans shoulder, is SA. In fact, an autistic teen was CONVICTED of SEXUAL Assault for doing exactly that. Shoulders are Sexual now?  On the flip side is the Feminist idea that Boobs ARENT Sexual, and are just normal and should be allowed out in public. Now thats fine if you believe that, but you HAVE to keep consistency. If boobs arent Sexual, then touching without consent ISNT SA. Sounds pretty dangerous to Women there, but what do I know, I cant stand Feminism...  All this is moot btw. Forget all this "Telling Women that SA ruins their lives" and take it back a step: Telling Women that theyve been raped when LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENED is probably going to fuck with them more, psychologically speaking. Reverse gaslighting, is that a thing? Because thats whats happening!  This is gonna sound really harsh, and is gonna get me downvoted to fuck, but every single time I hear a story about someone be "Abused" or "Assaulted" I have to ask if anything ACTUALLY HAPPENED. And that applies to both Sexual cases and normal Assault cases. This is partially why the conviction rates are so low. Not only is it a hard crime to prove, but you cant prove something when its not what you mean.  Youve also got Rape by Regret: ie "I was more than happy to have sex with him, till I woke up and realized hes an ugly dude, so I can just say he raped me to save face". Very extreme example yes, but also another example of Feminism/Leftists supporting the whole "Lets change the meaning of words for shits n giggs lol"  You want Women to be able to confidently come out and tell the world IF they get SA'd? Well start by putting consistent firm meanings on the actual terms involved. If you (Feminism or The Left) cant do that, then youve got no hope of un-fucking-up Women...	removed	existing	[0.9383309  0.06166906]

Assuming Sinema is essentially a GOP operative sitting in a Dem seat - it probably helps the GOP in the long term to keep a GOP voting 'Democrat' (Sinema) in the seat while Biden is president.      I'm not including Manchin in this because he never advertised himself as a progressive or anything left of center whereas Sinema campaigned on a more left leaning ticket in comparison before her hard turn once in the seat.     It will help the GOP during their respective senate races/long term if they can point to a slow ineffective Democrat majority - rather than having Sinema switch early to the GOP and switching control, basically putting their obstructing tendencies in a more obvious light and potentially igniting Democrat voters during voting season. This way GOP senators can essentially fund raise and meander while Sinema (and Manchin) does their work for them.	existing	existing	[0.9159031  0.08409692]

Look into the John Money experiment. Look into more egalitarian societies (like Sweden) and what occupations do the 2 genders occupy. Ask the hard question: why are feminists obsessed with occupations with power? Why dont they seek equal representation on all levels of workforce? Why dont they seek equal representation in electricians or plumbers?  Because they dont seek equality. They dont do that for the same reason they never bring up any men's issues. Feminists dont work for equality. They work for superiority. Dont let them talk with their words. Look at their actions and those actions will speak for themselves.	existing	existing	[0.9281646  0.07183537]
Don't fuck. You a choice. Many men don't have a choice. They have to put their lives on the line. And no one's ever going to care. Atleast you can cry about it and get sympathy, there are homeless men who were war veterans, who lost their limbs. If men can't provide productive work they are discarded by the society. No man even the ones suffering, cry about it. Because no one will listen.   Feminists are selfish. You don't appreciate the men at the bottom who keep everything running, just so that you can seethe on reddit. More men die every year than women, more men self delete than women.

If people wanna use veggies as an alternative to meat sometimes that's fine, but it's fair from the only thing you can use veggies for.

The USA, UK, and France recognised the communist threat to the East, and West Germany was the bulwark against them. So the Marshall Plan where the USA provided billions to Western Europe helped a lot. The Allies also acted very benevolently to Germany. Before after a war, you would ruin the conquered enemy. This is exactly what the Treaty of Versailles achieved. Clearly that didn't work out, and so the Allies sought to strengthen Germany. There were no reprisals. No punishment.  Also I think being bombed to absolute shit gave Germany a blank slate to build back up. Compared to a lot of France and the UK that has remained largely the same for centuries, Germany had to start anew. They were able to undo a lot of the problems from old city planning and infrastructure.	removed	removed	[0.3917865 0.6082135]
Ok, so it's the same amount, 714b, your just comparing it to a different number. Good job. By what mectric are you saying we spend too much on defense?   How much do you believe we should spend on defense, and why. What would you cut and why?  The us is the wealthiest country in the world(double the wealth of chine which is #2). We have the 3rd highest population in the world, and we only spend about 3.7% of gdp on defense, I think we're ranked 4th in the world behind Israel, SA, and Russia. We also have the highest GDP in the world about 30% more than china.   It also seems arbitrary to pick on defense, when 60% of discretionary spending is not defense. There is tons of government waste that I'm all for eliminating both defense and non defense discretionary and non-discretionary. Honestly all spending needs sunsetting clauses.   The biggest issue with budget is once something passes it will never be removed regardless of whether it's needed. That how we've ended up with the massive beurocracies we have today.	existing	existing	[0.83847994 0.16152003]

When it it suites the interests of the media and politicians for it to end.  I'm not saying it's fake or not a concern. I'm saying that even if COVID "ended" and it's impact was significantly less damaging, most media companies will still be incentives to keep selling stories of COVID doom regardless of it being true or not. This goes for both sides too. COVID is essentially an endless supply of ammunition for political parties to fire at with one another and something like that is what is keeping news companies clinging to life so they're going to keep pumping it out as well, leading to the overall public perspective to remain fixated on it one way or another. It will never end with a rational scientific understanding that COVID is no longer a threat for us to go back to normal. Only once it becomes a useless tool for news companies and politicians will we no longer see it's effects.	existing	existing	[0.6026387 0.3973613]

I mean. I look at it like this. The Government hasn’t been the most trustworthy sources of information. Now before people get their pitch forks out, I am vaccinated with the booster. But besides the whole Qanon aspect, there are many legitimate reasons to not trust government.  Example: The Tuskegee Syphillus experiment which was conducted on an entire population of my fellow African Americans. Which if I remember was government sanctioned. So for a variety of people I can see their reluctance to trust something like that. That being said to each their own. No one is going to do something that they don’t want to do, especially when it involves sticking something into their own body.  It’s kinda shit your dad got fired wish their could have been a compromise. But public safety is public safety.   Apologies for this happening.	removed	removed	[0.13110349 0.8688965 ]
They also did a study to show how women and men are perceived when asking for a promotion. Men were seen as “brave, strong, etc” and women were “bitchy, rude, condescending”. And they were given the same script.   And plenty of employers don’t look at 10 resumes at a time and go one by one. It’s very possible for two people to have similar resumes.   I understand most of you guys significantly dislike or hate feminists, and as a feminist, I can understand some of that.  But I don’t think it helps anyone to disregard gender bias just because you dislike feminists.	existing	existing	[0.9089312  0.09106878]

**[Russell's teapot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot)**     >Russell's teapot is an analogy, formulated by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making empirically unfalsifiable claims, rather than shifting the burden of disproof to others. Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion. He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a teapot, too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	existing	removed	[0.31345102 0.686549  ]

That theory is General Relativity.  The gravitational field is not just dependent on where the object is, but it's also dependent on its velocity and (to some extent) its acceleration.

You don't have to use the subscription though. They still will track your workout performance and are good exercise bikes albeit at a higher price range.

I think they need to price at the $1,200 range that is the current going rate for a really nice exercise bike and then hope people stay in the subscription too.

What she doesn't want to do is be a bangmaid. What she doesn't want to do is play mommy to a moron. What she doesn't want to do is hitch her wagon to a pornsick, non-communicative, childish loser.   Peterson NEVER addresses the fact that many women are very willing to get married. His own daughter did and then got divorced -- what was the problem there, JP?   We show up. We make an effort.

Adding to this: The public understanding of ADHD is still developing. Even today, there is a large contingent of people who refuse to accept that ADHD exists and that by diagnosing and medicating children, we're pathologizing 'kids being kids.' And the different presentations of ADHD may make it appear that something else is happening instead.   I was diagnosed with depression early in my life, and also have ADHD-inattentive. Because the inattentive expression of ADHD was less commonly known, no one (parents, teachers, doctors) ever thought to get me checked for it. I wasn't bouncing off the walls hyper - I don't get hyperactive symptoms - but I'm a textbook case of inattentive ADHD if anyone had known to look for it.   Because I'd already been diagnosed with depression, and there's a lot of overlap in how ADHD-I and depression are expressed outwardly, I didn't even think to get tested until a couple of years ago.   Depression didn't cause my ADHD, but my ADHD looked like, and was often hidden by, my depression.	removed	removed	[0.48521698 0.514783  ]

I would still argue that the government was unjustified in their acts.  They sent in the army, which is a direct attempt at escalation.   While I'm not entirely sure about the political leanings of the protesters, (I've heard a lot, and I'm sure there was a great mix) one must recognize that fighting back against the army being sent in to a protest is reasonable.   Even if the army had yet fired a shot, *they are the army* their job is to kill. It's reasonable to assume they are there for violence.	existing	removed	[0.27144843 0.72855157]

The problem for Japan was their commitment to the war in China, in which they were bogged down and extremely low on resources (there are very few natural resources in Japan, and they relied on imports for their war effort).  But, America had put a coal and iron ore embargo on Japan, amongst other economic sanctions in order to curtail their expansion (desiring free trade with China).  The position Japan was in was therefore untenable. They could either discontinue their war in China (which the Japanese military industrial complex was already committed), or take the materials by force, namely, from oil fields in the Philippines (under US mandate in 1941). This obviously meant war with America.  The idea at pearl harbour was to knock out the US pacific fleet, at which they believed America would then sue for peace, being what they perceived essentially to be a ‘decadent’, liberal democracy, with no stomach for war - this obviously proved a massive underestimation.  So in hindsight, although this seemed suicidal, and in truth, perhaps never winnable in the long term, the important thing to remember is that it didn’t come out of the blue, Japan had their reasons.  (Please note, this is an extremely summarised version of a very complex issue!)	removed	removed	[0.45292273 0.54707724]
Thanks for being open minded.  Fighting ONLY for women's issues is not a problem, problem is WHEN THEY SAY THE FIGHT FOR BOTH GENDERS AND STILL IGNORE MEN.   Also many feminists actively fight against men's rights. For example when there are speeches of men's rights or men's rights laws are being passed they protest. So not helping men's rights and going against men's rights are different things.  Also there are multiple points which has caused the wage gap to be debunked.  Here is a list of points I remember currently. I might add more points if I remember them. Points:  MOST IMPORTANT POINT HERE- If women could be paid less for the exact same work then why would companies hire men at all, when they  could get employees with similar or even better work for same cost.  According to statistics, men on average pursue higher paying careers (like STEM) while women pursue lower paying ones (like psychology).  According to statistics, men work longer (through overtime) on average than women do.  According to statistics, women hesitate negotiating for a higher salary because of fear that they might be rejected from the job for taking too much money while men try to get as much money as possible and don't even fear losing their job for asking too much if there are other job options available.  According to statistics, men ask for raises in salary more often.  According to statistics, women retire earlier than men do.  So yeah, because of these reasons men get paid more on average, but feminists twisted it a little bit to say men get paid more FOR THE SAME WORK.	existing	existing	[0.9407931 0.0592069]

Home schooling would be a good alternative, I agree.  Teachers aren't teaching anymore - they're indoctrinating future cult members.

Encouraging diversity of thought while increasing education standards (not standardizing, but we can't let kids pass grade levels when they are 10 years old and can barely read) would be another fix.

I think it is really unfortunate that there are very few options for men who need shelter in the UK. However I don't think the solution is to take essential funding away from women's only shelters or force women's only shelters to become gender neutral in order to keep funding.   Surely any reasonable person can admit that there is a dire need for both women's only shelters, (which despite existing 'everywhere' are being forced to turn women away because they can't meet the increasing demand caused by the pandemic) and gender neutral shelters.  You're fighting the wrong battle by attacking women's charities for trying to keep the funding they need. You should be demanding that the government provide ample funding for both gender neutral and single sex women's shelters.	existing	existing	[0.9372606  0.06273935]

It’s about placement. I cant speak for liberals but personally, I believe history should be memorialized and remembered and thoroughly studied. But I believe that the darker parts of our history should be confined to museums and the like, not on public display. What we choose to display publicly reflects our values and virtues.   Erasing history is what will lead us back towards old patterns. We do that enough as a collective on our own, we don’t need to catalyze it.

A young teen can be trusted to choose a restaurant; they can't be trusted to avoid unsafe sexual situations.

In a word, no. In one sense it wouldn't be hard for any medieval person to design a house, as at most levels of society houses were very formuliac and heirarchical. They were based around an open hall, often served by a buttery and pantry at the low (or service end) and a private parlour accessed from the high end. Above either of the rooms at either end you may also have had chambers (bedrooms).   Whilst every medieval person would have been familiar with the layout of a medieval house and where they fitted into it, houses were built by skilled craftsmen. For example there are countless examples of surviving medieaval houses in the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. These are mostly timber-framed and were built by skilled carpenters. Some of them have been dismantled and re-erected at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum.   If you're interested in learning more there is a huge amount of literature on the subject, but it's a very diverse topic as medieval architecture differs a lot by region. RW Brunskill's *Vernacular Architecture* is a good starting point.  *The House Within: Interpreting Medieval Houses in Kent* by the RCHME demonstrates just how sophisticated medieval carpentry was and how localised different building traditions were.  Huge caveat: As with most social history, the lower down the social ladder you go, the less evidence you have, particularly the further back in time you go. For various reasons there are plenty of surviving houses from well-off peasants upwards, but truly humble houses rarely survive above ground. There are a few examples of small low-status houses (such as lady row in York) but these were still built by carpenters.	removed	existing	[0.85112673 0.14887327]

A few anecdotes from the era that shine light on some of the topics raised:  Here is the highly regarded and probably shrewdest foreign policy analyst under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations (had his opinion carried the day there would have been escalation of Vietnam War), George Ball:  >"You never know when the Japanese are going to go ape"...He described the Japanese "as repeatedly unpredictable and irrational".  [http://japanwatching.com/environment/78-dont-cry-for-me-kyoto](http://japanwatching.com/environment/78-dont-cry-for-me-kyoto)  In John Dower's classic, *War Without Mercy*, the Japanese were very quickly turned into "harmless children" (infamous quote of General MacArthur to that effect) under US occupation (shown via cartoons and other depictions), and I was struck by persistence of that stereotype (esp. in enchantment with electronics and gadgets) when I once was browsing through *Life* Magazine's special on 1964 Tokyo Olympics:  >During the war Westerners were told of the "child mind of the Jap conscript." After the war, the same newspapers and magazines spoke of "Seventy Million Problem Children"; and cartoonists had a field day depicting the Japanese as infants in the crib or, more often, children attending General MacArthur's School of Democracy. Such paternalism was unquestionably the essence of MacArthur's attitude toward the Japanese- and Oriental people in general. His guiding philosophy during the occupation, he stated widely in publicized Senate hearings in 1951, after President Truman had recalled him from Asia, had been to treat the Japanese as twelve-year-olds. This was not an incautious remark, for the former supreme commander went on to expound his position at some length, explaining in the process why he believed the Japanese might be more receptive to American-style democratic ideas than the "mature" Germans. "The German problem is a completely and entirely different one from the Japanese problem," MacArthur informed the senators. "The German people were a mature race. If the Anglo-Saxon was say 45 years of age in his development, in the sciences, the arts, divinity, culture, the Germans were quite as mature. The Japanese, however, in spite of their their antiquity measured by time, were in a very tuitionary condition. Measured by the standards of modern civilization, they would be like a boy of 12 as compared with our development of 45 years. Like any tuitionary period, they were susceptible to following new models, new ideas. You can implant basic concepts there. They were still close enough to origin to be elastic and acceptable to new concepts..."  [https://www.amazon.com/War-without-Mercy-PACIFIC-WAR-ebook/dp/B007GZKQCY](https://www.amazon.com/War-without-Mercy-PACIFIC-WAR-ebook/dp/B007GZKQCY)  [https://theolympians.co/tag/life-magazine](https://theolympians.co/tag/life-magazine)  Sean Connery was also in news in a way movie publicity departments would not have preferred concerning 'You Only Live Twice':  >After the movie was shot, Sean Connery was asked by Japanese reporters whether he found Japanese women sexy. His answer "No" was not very popular in Japan, and the Japanese started giving him bad names.

FACT: This Covid vaccine is the 1st mRNA vaccines in history - it’s completely brand-new vaccine technology. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines turn your body into a spike protein-producing factory.  FACT: All other vaccines in history have used traditional means such as live virus or attenuated virus instead.  FACT: There’s NO long-term safety data because clinical trials for both Pfizer and Moderna end in 2023.  FACT: This Covid mRNA vaccine does NOT prevent infection nor stop transmission of the coronavirus.  FACT: It simply promises to prevent hospitalization and death, except for “rare” breakthrough cases. Omicron has infected SOOO many vaccinated people that “rare” is not an accurate description.  FACT: Survival rate of Covid is 99.97%. For people under 40, that number is way, way higher. So there’s no need to inject healthy children or teenagers with it!  FACT: Sweden, France, Iceland, and Nordic nations are against giving Moderna shot to young under age 30 due to myocarditis (heart inflammation) risk. Some have even banned it for that age group.  FACT: US hasn’t banned Moderna for young people under 30. Why? Maybe because NIH owns 1/2 of Moderna’s mRNA patent.  FACT: Children and teenagers have higher risk of suffering myocarditis from the mRNA vaccine than from Covid itself.  FACT: 18,000+ deaths due to Covid vaccines are recorded in VAERS. Harvard study estimates that VAERS underreports actual vaccine adverse effects by as much as 100x. So true mortality rate of Covid vaccines may be 1,800,000. By contrast, In 1976, when the Swine Flu vaccine caused 50 deaths, it was pulled from the US market.  FACT: If you get vaccinated with the 2nd experimental mRNA injection and die within 14 days, you will be considered an unvaccinated death per the CDC.  FACT: Pfizer & Moderna mRNA trials do NOT have any IRB or Independent Safety Board.  FACT: Pfizer and Moderna initially promised 2 shots would be enough. They were wrong. Now it’s booster shots every 6 months for life.  FACT: Vaccine makers promised that spike proteins would not migrate throughout your body, especially not your reproductive organs. Now research has confirmed that mRNA shots have affected menstrual cycles.  FACT: FDA took 108 days to review Pfizer mRNA vaccine data before issuing it EUA (Emergency Use Authorization)- But now it wants 75 YEARS to release this safety data to the public.  FACT: If you suffer any serious side effects of the mRNA vaccine, you CAN’T sue the vaccine manufacturer. They have ZERO LIABILITY.  FACT: Even if 100% of the entire human population on earth is vaccinated for Covid, variants will still mutate and spread. Why? Because the coronavirus has an animal reservoir. That means wild animals can get Covid. That’s why you’ve been hearing lately in the news that we need to resign ourselves to Covid being endemic.  FACT: Sub-Saharan African nations who have been taking IVERMECTIN as a preventative FOR YEARS have not suffered a Covid crisis - & that’s despite VERY LOW vaccination rates.  FACT: Ivermectin won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for treating HUMAN BEINGS in 3rd World countries for tropical diseases. It has been used for more than 20 years and is EXTREMELY SAFE. It’s off-patent and very cheap too. It’s sold over-the-counter without a prescription in many countries.  FACT: 140 research studies worldwide show ivermectin’s effectiveness in both preventing and treating Covid. See c19study.com	removed	removed	[0.27006528 0.72993475]

Two senators per state. I'm not sure why that's so fucking hard to understand.  US Representatives (and electoral college votes with a minimum of three) are allocated by population.

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	removed	existing	[0.9324736  0.06752636]

You may think you remember bits and pieces, but once you start detailing certain things that happened, you will start to remember more details.  It's not that you don't have those memories.  They just aren't easily available and need to be recalled back to the forefront of your mind.  Think of your brain like a computer (simplistically).  Your short term/easy recall memory is like the cached RAM (rapid access memory).  You have it on hand, but what's included changes day by day, depending on your needs.  Then, you have somewhat long term memory, like the last few years of your life and extremely crucial events from before, which is like a hard drive.  You have to think about it for a bit, but you can recall stuff with relative ease, and then it sticks in your short term memory for a bit, until it is no longer useful/relevant to you.   Then, you have the bulk of insignificant or distant memories that are essentially archived, like stuff stored in the cloud.  You have to dredge through it, download whatever necessary, transfer it to your hard drive, and then actually cache it in your RAM.	removed	removed	[0.34286213 0.6571379 ]

>How does any of this make sense. Someone please explain  The problem with this argument and others like it is that it uses systemic racism to explain each and every disparity we see in society. It has become a pervasive societal bias and one that many cannot seem to recognize that they have. I don't think that you will find many people who fail to recognize the horrific racial history in this county. However, in talking to liberals it would seem that we are living in 1922 instead of 2022. This view is just not consistent with reality. If you need an example, look at the minorities attending elite liberal universities that proclaim to have suffered the ill effects of systemic and personal racism. I think you would be genuinely hard pressed to look at a black college student attending Harvard and argue in good faith that racism has negatively impacted their life. You do recognize that crying racism (or systemic racism) has become a valuable form of social currency?

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.

You are mixing two different stories.     There was a pipe burst @ 6am in the morning, it was taken care of in a couple of hours.     @ 11pm opening the envelopes stopped, which observers are supposed to be there for.  Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.

This is spot on. Good explanation. I am a very big defender of liberty and against state force. However personally I’d prefer to live in a voluntary community of like minded people that share responsibilities and follow rules we’ve created. Not quite a commune but close. And those two ideals are perfectly harmonious. As long as people who don’t agree can voluntarily leave if they want and the outside world doesn’t impose their rules on those of us inside the community.	existing	existing	[0.89008653 0.10991347]
What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water. The healthier they, the more they can work. And citizens who know their government has their backs are more likely to be happy, and provide more output.   That said, I'd probably just model it after Canada's or Germany's system. They have proven to be robust, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.	removed	existing	[0.7342625  0.26573744]

It really is the economics of it all though. Run of the mill insurance will give you a $5k-$10k bill for a run of the mill childbirth at a run of the mill hospital. Back in MD and here in WA childcare can easily run $800-$1,200/mo/kid while a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment will run $2,400 on the lower end. Median income is $38k/year/person before taxes so let's go ahead and take those out and $30,400/year/person.  Let's go with two median income adults giving them a post-tax household income of \~$61k/year. Rent's going to be \~$29k so they're already down to $32k for the year. Let's go with a modest $200/mo in utilities so down to \~$31k. Now let's add in childcare for one at the middle ground of $1k/mo so $12k, they're now down to \~$19k for the year. But now we can't forget that if you work and live in America, you're not getting around without a car because of bastardized public transportation except in NYC, DC, and a few others so let's throw in just one $200/mo car payment and $100/mo insurance to compensate for WFH. Car bills for the year would be $3,600 so now they're down to $15k for the year.  Now don't forget the kid themself, as infants they'll probably run you at least $300/mo in formula and diapers alone but I'll keep sticking with lowball conservative values. Well that's another $3,600/year so now they're down to \~$11k for the year. Oh wait, we forgot groceries! $200/mo for 3 will take away $2,400/year so now they're down to $8k for the year. Great! Now this couple has $8k to worry about literally every other financial unknown and need which will \*totally\* leave them with enough to save and invest assuming no medical, car, or child emergencies.  tl;dr if your median income workers (largest socioeconomic group of adults, 128.5 million households earn less than $75k/year before taxes) can't afford a kid, you'll bet that those in even poorer situations will be even more trepidatious and rely on the state (not saying it's a bad thing but it would be necessary in such cases). Even those of us making more will think thrice before having one in this economy.  Plus there's already 8 billion of us apes and to keep these living standards for this many people we either need non-existent technology and highly resource conscious governments or we can simply continue to overharvest the planet until the rich are the only ones left in their bunkers. Less of us probably isn't a bad thing at this point until we go nuclear with pathways to full renewables, ban non-recyclable disposables, take more active approaches in maintaining the health of natural habitats and mega-ecosystems like the oceans and Amazon, and etc.	existing	removed	[0.4001577 0.5998423]

Not that I know of, that's something I'd definitely ask a doctor about. Even if the doctor says no, I guess it's still possible. But children and babies tend to get a lot of different vaccines around the same time, right? I'd think if it were really dangerous for your immune system, less people would live past their childhood years.  I'm actually a person with multiple sensitivities so I completely understand how angry the vaccine must have made you. I feel that way towards antidepressants for the same reason. I had to learn after a while that, while doctors want what's best for your health and they truly are the best source of health info, they can only know so much about YOUR body in particular. So while they mean well, a lot of them seem to not realize that YOU are more aware of how your body reacts to things than they are in some cases. They usually think of it as you just "being anxious" and "since it doesn't make sense to them for this to be harmful, it probably isn't".   The funny thing about medicine is that it's considered a science, when it should actually be considered more of a mix of science and art. Because there are standards for everything, but our bodied individually are different. Your reaction to the vaccine was unique. It's probably hard to accept because it was so severe, but most other people truly are not being harmed by the vaccine nearly to the same extent that you were. So even though you feel like you're doing the right thing by warning people about things they may not have considered about the vaccine, you could still be doing more harm than good. The same way doctors think they're doing the right thing by trying to convince you to still take the vaccine.	existing	removed	[0.4153847 0.5846153]

I am considering the harm to society and the individual   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin#/media/File:HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg   I am interested in the total harm so the harm to the one taking the substance and the secondary effects such as drink driving or drug fuelled assault, I am interested in the substances as they are not there current place in our society so for example I would ignore the additional issues all illegal drugs have the main one being inconsistency and quality as its blackmarket product so it is often adulterated making it inconsistent. with the point being that all drugs should be legalised in a similar way to alcohol, although ideally i think alcohol and tobacco as well as all other drugs should be sold in drug shops and not in your face while getting groceries or advertised on tv etc, and possibly the addition of a drug licence like a driving licence (although this would be very easy and free to acquire) which would simply involve a short course about the pro’s and con’s of the drug so you know what you are getting into before hand, and then for example this might be affected if you do something bad for example you start a fight while drunk, you would have your licence suspended for a week and maybe the specific drug that was involved suspended for a month, the same if you are caught drink driving you might have your right to buy alcohol suspended for a short time, and maybe be required to take another short course to reestablish your right to buy the drug.	existing	existing	[0.7924084  0.20759158]

FACT: This Covid vaccine is the 1st mRNA vaccines in history - it’s completely brand-new vaccine technology. Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines turn your body into a spike protein-producing factory.  FACT: All other vaccines in history have used traditional means such as live virus or attenuated virus instead.  FACT: There’s NO long-term safety data because clinical trials for both Pfizer and Moderna end in 2023.  FACT: This Covid mRNA vaccine does NOT prevent infection nor stop transmission of the coronavirus.  FACT: It simply promises to prevent hospitalization and death, except for “rare” breakthrough cases. Omicron has infected SOOO many vaccinated people that “rare” is not an accurate description.  FACT: Survival rate of Covid is 99.97%. For people under 40, that number is way, way higher. So there’s no need to inject healthy children or teenagers with it!  FACT: Sweden, France, Iceland, and Nordic nations are against giving Moderna shot to young under age 30 due to myocarditis (heart inflammation) risk. Some have even banned it for that age group.  FACT: US hasn’t banned Moderna for young people under 30. Why? Maybe because NIH owns 1/2 of Moderna’s mRNA patent.  FACT: Children and teenagers have higher risk of suffering myocarditis from the mRNA vaccine than from Covid itself.  FACT: 18,000+ deaths due to Covid vaccines are recorded in VAERS. Harvard study estimates that VAERS underreports actual vaccine adverse effects by as much as 100x. So true mortality rate of Covid vaccines may be 1,800,000. By contrast, In 1976, when the Swine Flu vaccine caused 50 deaths, it was pulled from the US market.  FACT: If you get vaccinated with the 2nd experimental mRNA injection and die within 14 days, you will be considered an unvaccinated death per the CDC.  FACT: Pfizer & Moderna mRNA trials do NOT have any IRB or Independent Safety Board.  FACT: Pfizer and Moderna initially promised 2 shots would be enough. They were wrong. Now it’s booster shots every 6 months for life.  FACT: Vaccine makers promised that spike proteins would not migrate throughout your body, especially not your reproductive organs. Now research has confirmed that mRNA shots have affected menstrual cycles.  FACT: FDA took 108 days to review Pfizer mRNA vaccine data before issuing it EUA (Emergency Use Authorization)- But now it wants 75 YEARS to release this safety data to the public.  FACT: If you suffer any serious side effects of the mRNA vaccine, you CAN’T sue the vaccine manufacturer. They have ZERO LIABILITY.  FACT: Even if 100% of the entire human population on earth is vaccinated for Covid, variants will still mutate and spread. Why? Because the coronavirus has an animal reservoir. That means wild animals can get Covid. That’s why you’ve been hearing lately in the news that we need to resign ourselves to Covid being endemic.  FACT: Sub-Saharan African nations who have been taking IVERMECTIN as a preventative FOR YEARS have not suffered a Covid crisis - & that’s despite VERY LOW vaccination rates.  FACT: Ivermectin won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for treating HUMAN BEINGS in 3rd World countries for tropical diseases. It has been used for more than 20 years and is EXTREMELY SAFE. It’s off-patent and very cheap too. It’s sold over-the-counter without a prescription in many countries.  FACT: 140 research studies worldwide show ivermectin’s effectiveness in both preventing and treating Covid. See c19study.com	removed	removed	[0.27006528 0.72993475]

No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	removed	removed	[0.4575404 0.5424596]

We lived in Bali for 3 years. One of my proudest moments was being told I didn't have an identifiable Australian accent.

Still isnt a human in any case.  >Now youre just being rude. You dont care about having a discussion. You have the mentality that you are right and anyone who believes otherwise is 'braineashed'. You are closed minded regarding this issue.   just being honest, if it hit too close to home maybe you should evaluate what youve been "taught". christians believing that life begins at conception have been brainwashed since i guarantee they didnt conclude that themselves.  >Prove the fetus is not a person. Define 'personhood'. The christians have a definition, both a spiritual, AND biological. Spiritual = conception. Biological = unique human DNA. Either way, by the time the mother is 2 weeks pregnant, there is a human being inside her and to perform an abortion, is morally a murder. And also a violation if the NAP.   Christians have a definition of a lot of things, theyre still just following fanfiction, that doesnt mean others have to follow your definition.

You're right to put "original" in quotation marks as if you want to be pedantic you could say that the original London Bridge was built by the Romans, and was made of wood. When people refer to the old London Bridge they often refer to the medieval bridge which had buildings on it and stood until the early nineteenth century when it made way for the New London Bridge. New London Bridge was replaced in 1973 with the current, rather boring looking London Bridge. Incidently the old New London Bridge now sits in Lake Havasu in the USA.   I hate to disapoint you, but looking at historical images of both bridges, neither appeared to have carved keystones like this. It would be interesting to ask what the source of the rumour is. In my experience rumours tend to develop easily around buildings or bits of buildings. Common examples are houses made from ship's timbers (very rare in reality) or everything in London being designed by Christopher Wren. In fact, Ye Olde Watling, a pub in the city of London claims to be built from ship's timbers by Christopher Wren, despite being made of brick!	removed	removed	[0.46110004 0.53889996]

What a dumb generalization. There have always been parents who care. They volunteer at school events, get on school boards, help fundraise for events, check their kids homework and make them study.

There are a couple reasons. First and foremost, the military is the hotbed for technological advancement. The federal government pays big bucks to private companies to develop technology for the armed forces. Next is the US' strategic and diplomatic plan requires the deployment of troops to many locations around the world. This allows the US to maintain a constant political pressure and influence over certain areas. Though it's framed as "protecting America's interests abroad." Finally, no politician ever lost a lot of political points "defending the nation" so it's a safe investment to score some free influence with the public. Meaning budget measures for military spending are fairly easy to pass.	existing	existing	[0.8053387  0.19466135]

There’s a Nat Geo documentary called Lost Cities of the Amazon. Or you could look up terra preta.  Long story short, I would say all the Amazon is man-made but there is evidence to suggest large tracts of it were cultivated like parklands or silvaculture.

You just argued for a reason the Russians are the bad guys here.  You're right, Ukraine can't join nato while in conflict. The whole Russian argument is that they'll be "forced" to invade unless the US promises no one else will join nato, the fantasy being that the US is going to have Ukraine join NATO then Ukraine will invoke article 5 and start WW3. Which is patently ridiculous for reasons you literally just pointed out.  Ukraine didn't even really want to join Nato until Russia violated the Minsk accords in 2014. Ukraine wants to join NATO now because it's rightfully concerned about its sovereignty.

If gender were entirely a cultural phenomenon then we could take a child and arbitrarily raise them as any gender and they'd be perfectly happy with that gender. However that's not how things work. Back in the 70s surgeons tried this. They'd take infant boys who had birth defects with their penis and surgically remove the penis. These children were then raised as girls. These children never had any experience of being boys. They had no memory of ever having a penis at all. They had been raised as girls their entire lives. The majority of these children rejected being labeled as girls. They somehow knew that something wasn't right about their bodies and that they should have been boys. Most transitioned as adults because of the pervasive feeling of wrongness.  There's something about human brains that is built deeply in and has a sense of some kind about what kind of body it should be hooked up to. We also see this with children who were born without limbs. They often have phantom sensations from a limb they have never actually had. But the Brian still expects input from this limb so they feel pain from a limb they never had. The brain expects a particular type of body to be attached to it and when the actual body is not compatible, sometimes the brain freaks out and weird things happen.  We can't arbitrarily assign infants to a gender because gender isn't entirely cultural. There are aspects that are inbuilt into the brain. This doesn't mean that there aren't accidents where incompatible brains and bodies end up together. It does mean that it's not just a cultural phenomenon.	existing	existing	[0.50219864 0.49780136]

To put it simply the US was divided at times but the white population was of a singular nationality, held together by expansion and creating the "other" in Native Americans and African Americans. The Soviet Union was made up of independent nationalities prior to the Soviet Union, through the Soviet Union and afterwards. In other words the US created their National identity as they grew while the Soviet Union never created a singular National Identity, and rather created a confederation of National Identities.	removed	existing	[0.7768678  0.22313215]

Pressure versus temperature is much of a muchness, but one way of looking at it is that stellar core pressure is not really the direct cause of fusion -- it leads to high temperature and high temperature is the cause.  Basically, inasmuch as temperature is a way of talking about how fast particles are zooming around, high temperatures are what make atomic nucleii bonk together hard enough to fuse.  If it were "just" pressure (if that were somehow possible without also getting high termperatures), you would eventually end up with something like a neutron star -- super compacted atomic matter just sitting there, chilling.  So for us on Earth, trying to ignite nuclear fusion artificially, a high-pressure mechanism is just one of many possible ways to achieve the high temperatures we want.  And it turns out it's not very efficient compared to other ways of getting to a high temperature.  So we mostly focus on those other ways.	removed	existing	[0.7080507  0.29194927]

I cannot answer the actual historical question, but I think it's interesting that the premise of the question is the basis for a very old Zen koan. There seems to be an inherent mystery in why a Buddhist patriarch would leave India to bring teachings to China (and then from there to Japan). See the Blue Cliff Record Case 17 for one example of this koan.

Being a healthy weight is neither a virtue or vice. It’s neither commendable nor condemnable. It’s neither attractive or unattractive. It is standard. That’s the point, it is the baseline. You dismissing my magic pill analogy with wanting to attain any *skill* is false as being a healthy weight isn’t a skill. It’s standard.  >I don’t mind being fat as much as I mind a caloric deficit.   That’s the key right there. That’s what discipline is!  Discipline is either going through short term “pain” in order to achieve long term “pleasure” / avoid long term “pain” (studying for an exam to get good results). Or avoiding short term “pleasure” in order to achieve long term “pleasure”/ avoid long term “pain” (not eating sugar as a diabetic to avoid losing a foot). That’s what disciplined people are good at, putting off the short term in favour for the long term. So saying someone would rather be fat forever (something we both agree people would rather not be) rather than eating in a “painful” caloric deficit in the short term.	existing	existing	[0.89619017 0.10380983]

I don’t know the details, but to me, canceling current student loans must come _with_ a reform of the whole college fee system going forward.

Simply looking at who has their own troops where is not really the most useful way of judging a situation, although it is a popular framing in the U.S. because of how good they are at utilising proxies.	existing	existing	[0.6761908  0.32380918]

Well, the world just goes in without you really. So you either pay your bills from prison, set up something before you're incarcerated, or default on the bills when they arent paid. Then they can sue you in prison and eventually follow the usual eviction procedure for whatever state you're in.

A big part of being inflexible is that your body naturally generates a pain response and contracts muscles that are being stretched in an attempt to keep them from being overstretched and damaged.

Looks like something close to that.   https://kustomrama.com/wiki/Potvin\_Automotive#Extracting\_Nitroglycerin  >Otto Ryssman lived on an orange farm and was able to buy dynamite for land clearing purposes. Chuck would often have Otto buy a half-dozen cases of dynamite to extract nitroglycerin from. He would somehow safely heat up the dynamite, separating the nitro out of the dynamite sticks, he would then mix it together with alcohol and end up with a formula for a highly potent fuel. A life long friend of Chuck, Leslie Long recalls that in the early 1990's, the local news media reported that several cases of abandoned dynamite discovered in an old lady's garage in Anaheim, which was the same garage Chuck rented as a storage several years earlier.  Vincent J. Monteleone gives "grease" as slang for Nitroglycerin in his book *Criminal Slang* on page 106, published 1949.	removed	removed	[0.12196794 0.8780321 ]

My closet friend actually. At the beginning of 2021, I realized I needed to start putting myself first before anyone else. I really needed to work on taking better care of myself and focus on making things right with my sister. We had been having a rough go of it.   Because of realizing I needed to do better for myself, my relationship with her changed a bit. I wasn’t around to hang out all the time and listen to her issues, etc. I also stopped going to her house because I chose not to be around her husband anymore who I feel is controlling and a jerk to everyone. Especially to her.  I couldn’t tell her why I stopped coming by. Telling her I hate her husband would just ruin our friendship.   In June, my dad, who was my hero passed away unexpectedly. Left me broken and I really pulled away from everyone to just be with my family and grieve. I still made sure to text her. To check in on her because I didn’t want her to think I didn’t care about her.   I spent the summer trying to keep up with work. Be there for the rest of my family and grieve.   She began icing me out of our friend group. Inviting everyone else except me. When she found out another friend invited me to one event. She got very upset and yelled at her asking why the hell would she invite me, etc. proceeded to tell our friends how terrible I’ve been to her and how I haven’t met her son yet. Who was about six weeks old.    I figured. Hey. She just had a baby, her hormones are all over the place. I’ll let it go.   Then her birthday rolls around and I was actually invited to the dinner. A dinner I didn’t feel emotionally ready for but I forced myself to go because I knew that would be an even bigger rift if I didn’t. It somehow happens that at the end of dinner, it ends up just being the two of us. She was very intoxicated and suddenly starts screaming at me.   Telling me that I haven’t been there for here when she has needed me so much. Accused me of pulling away Bec I am jealous of her baby because I had a miscarriage two years ago. How I’ve been nothing but a selfish friend. Accused me of hating her child.   AITA? Am I selfish? Am I a terrible friend?  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Screaming and coughing involve an open mouth and or nose. I'm talking about events isolated to a (relatively) closed sinus system. There are a few examples of internally generated sounds being perceived as louder ny the person generating the sound. The volume of your ears "popping"/creaking or quietly humming are perceived as very loud by the person doing the act. They are entirely inaudible by any other person, even from a very close distance.   I can very easily and confidently whisper and or scream within my inner dialog. However, it's evident it mostly has to do with inflection rather than "volume".	removed	existing	[0.5332023  0.46679774]

The whole idea of "most guys would kill for this," is very, very untrue. I've come across a lot of boys/men who aren't looking for this kind of thing. I would say that most men I've met aren't looking for this kind of thing. It's a false idea that is very dangerous to society.   Just because it was a female that committed the rape doesn't excuse it. To say "this happens all day with young girls." That's bullshit too. As a woman, I try to be very consideration of my partners wishes and boundaries. Any human being who is told "no" but then has sex with someone without consent is committing rape.   It is not uncommon for men to be raped, it is under-reported.   OP, please please find an adult you trust and get help.

First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	removed	existing	[0.6852624  0.31473756]

In hindsight I overlooked red flags because I was a pickme back then. But essentially, one day he got angry at me and started calling me names and the downhill descent began. Suddenly I was the root cause for all of the misery in his life and I had to go.   I have since realized he’s a covert narcissist and he began love bombing, devaluing, discarding and hoovering in cycles.  It was really bewildering how one moment he despised me and the next he couldn’t let me go.  He got really nasty and uncaring at the end.   I had to be the one to file for divorce, since he requested it but refused to discuss how we should move forward and how we should draft a settlement agreement to hasten the divorce. If I asked him whether he wanted to stay married instead he wouldn’t respond or express indecision. Indecision is a decision imo, if it’s not an enthusiastic YES, its a hell no.

Oddly enough, it wasn't feminism that won women the right to vote even if that's the narrative feminists love to perpetuate.

I’m new to Reddit. I was seeking out feminist subreddits and saw FDS being bashed as being extremist, so of course, being curious, I had to see for myself. Far from seeing hate-filled discourse, I was pleasantly surprised to find like-minded women, taking back their power and creating a space for themselves in an oppressive and misogynistic online world.   I’m not dating, so at first I questioned whether I should even be here but I’m so encouraged to see women here knowing and respecting their worth, it has ignited a small flame in my heart. In the short time I’ve been participating in this group, I’ve learned concepts and language for things that I haven’t been able to articulate in my entire 57 years of life.   Someone on here recommended the book “How He Gets into Her Head”. I grew up in the context of a family where DV occurred. I questioned why my mother stayed and settled upon lack of financial resources and social supports (it was the 70’s) as being the reasons. I never really understood what psychological processes might be going on. I’m 4 chapters into the book and light bulbs have been going off over my head like crazy.   I learned term “p0rn sick” here in FDS. I’ll be forever grateful for learning a term and defining a concept for something I’ve been grappling with ever since I was exposed to p0rn0graphy as a young child when my father’s Pl@yBoy  magazines were kept in stack in the bathroom. Even as a young child, I felt a sense of shame and devaluation that was something I couldn’t define in words.   I’ve been learning other concepts here and re-examining my life choices in light of them. Probably not a lot I can change about some circumstances in my life at this point, but I can change my mindset. I can also pass on knowledge to my daughter and my female co-workers.   I’m grateful for FDS and the work the moderators do to keep this a protected space. 🙏	removed	existing	[0.94106424 0.05893581]

It's more acceptable for women to sexualize men, but that doesn't mean the sexualization had equal consequences for these two specific sexes.  Sexualization of women by men can lead to these men doing harmful actions towards women, the opposite does happen but to a much lesser extent.  Neither is okay though, I find a lot of women fetishize gay men and I find it disgusting personally.	existing	existing	[0.9299139  0.07008615]

The eardrum isn't what hears.   The eardrum is a pressure sensor. It detects pressure fluctuations in the atmosphere, and transmits these fluctuations (by way of some of the tiniest bones and weakest muscles) to your inner ear, where a bunch of finely tuned hair start vibrating if and only if there's a pressure fluctuation that matches their resonant frequency.   These vibration trigger nerve signals that the brain interprets as sound.	existing	removed	[0.37071562 0.62928444]

All you need to track a solar year is some way of keeping track of how high the Sun rises and its movement over the course of the year. Which is nothing more complicated than a stick in the ground that casts a shadow (a gnomon), or even just a rock with a hole in it that you can view from a consistent angle from day to day (Stone Henge has alignments like this). Given the importance of the solar year to things like the seasons, and given the importance of the seasons to many aspects of prehistoric cultural and material existence, there are many reasons to suspect that this is a genuinely prehistoric thing and probably was figured out by many different people over many different periods of time. Certainly many prehistoric structures and artifacts display an awareness of equinoxes, solstices, and so on, which are exactly this phenomena.	existing	existing	[0.8072606  0.19273943]

We can't have a "national divorce"--by which I assume you mean red states and blue states breaking off into their own countries--because the concept of red states and blue states isn't *real*. What we really have is an urban/rural divide. Big population centers, even in red states, tend to be more Democratic, and rural areas, even in blue states, tend to be more Republican. Because of this, dividing things between red states and blue states is not going to solve the problems, because there is still a lot of conflict *within* states.   For example, I live in Oregon. It's a very solidly blue state, because the vast majority of the population is concentrated in and around Portland, an extremely liberal city. But if you go...pretty much anywhere outside of Portland, you have a lot of small towns and farming communities that are very right wing. We've had a lot of issues during the pandemic, for example, because the vaccination rate is very high in Portland but very low in the rest of the state, which has made it difficult to keep case numbers and hospitalizations low. We also have had several instances of of right-wing representatives just walking out of the state legislature in protest of certain bills. The same thing has happened in red states with left-wing representatives.   If we have a national divorce in the way you're asking for, we're just going to have the same exact conflicts play out on a smaller scale.	existing	existing	[0.9047317  0.09526835]

>Saying that we're still dealing with the original relay race that started before the change is implying that in the last 70 years our country has made zero progress when it comes to dealing with race. Sorry but I think there's been a ton of change. There's even been massive corrections to assist with the wrong doings of the ones before us. Affirmative action is definitely one of them. So I think it's unfair to say that nothing has ever been done to correct the original unfair relay race.  I'm not saying that there's been no progress at all, nor was I advocating for or against any specific policy.  I was just saying that "race blind" policies generally aren't super great for addressing inequality by race.  You list affirmative action as an example of of an attempt to address racial inequality, and I agree.  That's also a policy that is explicitly *not* race blind.  But it's also worth noting that the past few decades have also included policies that have exacerbated or created inequality by race, such as the war on drugs and "tough on crime" policies.  >Also, systemic inequality is to political of a term. Why are some black people able to make it out of bad situations with no issues while others struggle? The answer is that it's the same exact situation as a white person who grows up in a bad situation. The only real difference between the two is that the white person typically isn't being held back by their own culture.  I mean it's way more complicated than just saying that black people are held back by their "culture" whatever that means.	existing	existing	[0.5201024  0.47989756]

Dude has no idea what he's talking about. Russia hasn't been communist in name in decades and even longer in practice. It's a kleptocratic oligarchy where the rich and powerful siphon off billions in public wealth and let the peasants wallow in poverty and decaying infrastructure.   It's the exact situation that on paper Communism seeks to avoid, but Russian society is built on corruption and authoritarian governance and that shit is stronger than philosophical ideals.    But to answer your question, socialism is a vague term used to describe governments with heavy social safety nets, worker protections, and state owned public corporations. To give an example, a socialist economy may have one government controlled oil company, like Venezuela or Norway, whose profits are used to pay for government services instead of a bunch of private for profit oil companies that make a few people very rich. Communism is the extremist far left form of economic organization where private ownership of capital and the means of production are completely banned and the state owns it all. There's no private oil companies, or any companies, allowed. There's no rich people, but there's also no "poor" people. Everyone is allocated the same amount and quality of stuff, and nobody is left wanting for anything, at least on paper.   In practice, the societies that have experienced extreme enough situations to swing that far towards communism have waaaaay too much baggage to actually pull it off and it ends up drowning in corruption and authoritarian government abuse. Not that those are traits/outcomes exclusive to communism, there's plenty of free market capitalist countries that end up with the exact same kind of guy in charge thanks to said societal baggage.	removed	removed	[0.4609473  0.53905267]

Ah yes it's the truckers fault that the medical system is in shambles. I would love to see how you connect those dots.    ------------  This has been fascinating to watch. I'm old enough to have seen the left and right fight over the propaganda controls and have seen it when both are in control of them.   Most just go along with the government programming. It used to be right wing talking points were all you could see and most people just repeated them and when they didn't make sense they would just stare and not talk and then  repeat them again. I fought hard against that decades ago. Now it is the same thing but it is leftist marxism being spouted and the exact same people are eating it up. Amazing to see. Doesn't exactly give me hope for the future.   I used to think that all the left wing free speech and freedom protests and political groups would usher in a society where people are judged by the content of their character and not their race, creed, religion or similar. I was dead wrong as we have all learned. The left just decided that since they have the power they will use it just as unethically as the right. I really believed they would take the high road but I was foolish to say the least.   The pendulum swings back and forth. The right really pushed it their way, and now the left has it and is going even further in their own direction. Like they think they can have some sort of "final victory" where half the population never gets to speak again and are totally barred from having any political input or representation in any way shape, or form. That should end well. I mean it is at a point where the left wing is regularly calling for violence and death even to children.

Host cells basically can't tell the difference between virus DNA/RNA and their own, so all they see is "oh, crap, this thing is broken, I gotta put it back together!"  Actually, it's slightly worse than that, because really it's not even that conscious - there's just unthinking molecular machines that recognize when the strand ends weirdly and try to find the matching weird end of a different strand to glue them back together. The cell builds those to make sure when it sends out instructions to build machines, those machines are built fully, and you don't get half-baked crap when a factory tries to process a list of instructions that's been torn in half.  From that point of view, all a virus is is a machine that attaches to a cell and inserts the instructions for how to build a copy of the machine. Sometimes those instructions come with secondary machines that sneak them into the cell's filing cabinet with all the instructions, so the cell will have them forever, sometimes they're just the temporary copies the cell sends out when it wants machines made. Eventually though, the factory picks up those instructions, starts fabricating the machines (the factory doesn't question what it's told to build, it's job is to build shit not to think), and eventually either the cell is so full of the machines that it explodes, or otherwise the machines get released into the body.  Then, they drift around, waiting to bump into another cell and be switched on...	existing	existing	[0.61554676 0.38445324]

You are technically correct but the average voter doesn’t understand how this works.  God love ‘em but most people are Joe Six Pack dipshits who perceive national debt like the credit card debt which is currently choking their personal finances. This causes them additional economic anxiety and fuels division and radicalism which fights against spending and causes damage to society.

Some of my best memories are from VR, I met absolutely breathtaking and talented people there that I would have 0 chance of meeting in my poor underdeveloped country. It changed my life for so much better. People fear what they don't understand and despite being a simulation it's amazing. You don't know what VR is before you try a quality headset and visit the good worlds.  From my perspective you are talking about VR like people used to talk about the internet and advocating talking to people in real life yet here you are in a virtual space on a website speaking to others in words instead of talking to them face to face. You would never reach any of the people currently present without the technology and the platform. Before the internet it was books that people also hated and  before the books it was songs and speech too smart for the common folk to understand and them being scared of evil magic people able to "spell".   Although I do agree that anything made by Meta\\Facebook is going to be a privacy nightmare. Thankfully there are so many more of other more developed metaverses like VRChat, Neos VR and Helios VR made by indie developers that are motivated by passion for creativity instead of money, Meta is not VR and Meta is not the METAVERSE. They are assholes for using that name for themselves trying to pretend like they are where it's all at.  Not everyone will be able to afford going to space or having fun on a yacht. lets be honest 99.8% of the current world population will never have access to such luxury and that's a good thing. The pollution created by such needless endeavors on a dying planet is disgusting and VR can show you so much more in a safer environment with the data we have. It's a cheap way to provide access to otherwise impossible experiences for everyone. The sad reality is we cannot continue to live like we did before due to the ever increasing density of the population.   We need alternatives to reduce consumption and this is the way.	existing	existing	[0.91838866 0.08161137]

>Myth 4: You don’t need to wear a mask.   >Although early guidance on masks from the CDC and the WHO was confusing and inconsistent, **there is now a strong consensus among public health authorities—supported by numerous studies—that wearing a face covering can limit the transmission of the coronavirus through small exhaled droplets.** Masks have long been known as an effective means of source control (preventing a sick patient from spreading a disease to others), but the early guidance was based, in part, on the fact that there was a shortage of high-quality “N95” and surgical masks. We now know that cloth face masks can be an effective alternative. But despite the evidence, many people still refuse to wear one, considering it a violation of civil liberties or emasculating. Georgia’s governor Brian Kemp went so far as to sign an executive order banning city governments from implementing mask mandates. And he sued Atlanta’s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms when she instituted one, although he has now dropped the lawsuit. But as coronavirus cases have spiked around the U.S. in recent months, even states that were once staunch holdouts have now implemented mask orders.  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nine-covid-19-myths-that-just-wont-go-away/    https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext   [Anders Tegnell, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, also said last June that, with hindsight, more measures were needed.](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-coronavirus-face-mask-wearers-describe-suspicion-abuse-2021-6)   >A study examining the association between face mask policies and a reduction in COVID-19 deaths found that **countries that enacted national mask mandates at the beginning of the pandemic had significantly lower death rates per million people than countries that did not enforce any mask rules**, which researchers say supports the use of face masks to prevent excess coronavirus deaths and should “be advised during airborne disease epidemics.”  >Published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine last month, the study examined 44 countries in Asia and Europe, including Greece, Germany, South Korea, Italy, the U.K., **Sweden** and Hong Kong.  https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/countries-with-national-mask-mandates-had-lower-covid-19-death-rates-global-study-finds-1.5711916   What's this about no evidence????	existing	removed	[0.389983 0.610017]

I think you're getting this backwards.   You see a fat person, you assume that they lack discipline and willpower. And this is wrong. Actually, you have no fucking clue who that person is. You don't get to assume anything of them. Maybe the reason that they're fat is that they spend 60 hours in a hospital, having spent nearly a decade in higher education, and all that this really indicates is that they're stressed out, don't have time for proper exercise, and perhaps the only indulgence that they get is to eat something that tastes nice once in a while. I would suggest that you couldn't argue that this person doesn't have discipline, and doesn't have willpower. They just have higher priorities. And actually, so do most people in professional careers. They're disciplined about the things that matter.  I think the thing you're trying to argue is that by doing this exercise, by forcing yourself to do things that you don't necessarily like, you create discipline. And this can be true. But also. A lot of deadbeats who are dumb as fuck and are a mess have bulging muscles. There's clearly more to it than that. And it's that you have no discipline if you can do this. You only have discipline if you have discipline everywhere. You only have willpower if you have the power to will yourself to do everything.	existing	removed	[0.4851019  0.51489806]

Okay well the finance people certainly aren't designing the products so maybe that's another 5 people, and then there's the managers, another 5, etc.   You have to remember that the infrastructure is already there. It's setup ready to go. The company can already make a profit.   There's a shareholders meeting and it's deliberated how people get paid. Yeah, the workers will not stand for the ceo to get 300x pay. So he gets pay taken away, and everyone else gets a raise. The company is still there.   Maybe the ceo quits. He's mad. Okay, then a manager that was below him gets voted in.  People still want a salary. I think someone could make a convincing enough argument to workers that make nothing - "Hey, your getting double pay and benefits now. Just keep doing what you're doing"   If the company goes under, they don't have a job. They know that. Obviously it's in their best interest to put someone in charge that knows wtf they're doing.	existing	existing	[0.8679805  0.13201949]

We could just dissolve the federal government, and allow states to rule themselves in cooperation. Since all states are larger in population now than the country was in the 1700's it makes sense for them to government themselves totally.

Exactly.. people who truly fight for mens issues distance themselves from feminism.      Some women just 'virtue signal' to men, without actually raising the main issues.. Social and legal biases against men...  They hope that men will 'rise' above this crisis and become better men. All without society not taking any action to correct its bigotry and misandry.  Not gonna happen. There is no 'masculinity crisis'. Men are still acting masculine.      One of biggest strengths of masculinity is the ability of walking away from a toxic situation..     That's what some men are doing.       Feminists are panicking because, they know their tax-based welfare utopia wont last of enough men (taxpayers) walk away.

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	removed	existing	[0.8438896 0.1561104]

You're putting words into my mouth, and I didn't bite the onion.  Whether the article as it is presented here actually was posted on their twitter is pretty irrelevant; the sentiment and agenda behind it are both very real.  Look up "World Economic Forum bugs."  They're not shy about it.  Bugs being nutritious and cheap does not make them any less disgusting, and we have better means of solving world hunger.  Do you know why famine is such an ongoing problem in places like Africa?  It has much less to do with the availability of food - at least for now - and much more to do with the fact that there is no infrastructure to get it to the people who need it.  Bureaucracy, corruption and mismanagement are far bigger issues, all of which are a big part of organizations like the WEF.  Also, I do enjoy the Newmanian appeal to lobsters.

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	removed	existing	[0.6592841  0.34071586]

You are crossing inequality based in skin tone with inequality based on social class.  There is a racism problem *and* a socio-economic problem. The poor and lower class aren't just one race, no, but the biggest issues with crime and poor education and poor Healthcare resides within those communities, and those communities are not predominantly white by percentage.  You have to remember, 100 white people in America affected by something and 100 black people affected by something in America are two wildly different things, because there are way more white people here, so per capita the percentage of whites affected by poverty, violent crimes, and preventable health issues is far lower than pretty much every other race.	existing	existing	[0.86323744 0.13676254]

One of the other problems I haven't seen mentioned is that the nature of eucalypts is that they produce oils that over time seep into the soil around the roots that prevents other plants/trees growing unless they are sympathetic. Which isn't that likely in non-native environments that haven't had the evolution time to develop tolerance to the oil. The oil is a well known anti-biotic useful for dry wounds in particular.  It would be interesting to see if there have been any studies on the effects of the koala and dropbears on eucalyptus growth and in particular whether or not the dropping numbers of koalas and the at least stable numbers of dropbears is having an effect. It's quite possible that the koala populations were keeping the dropbears in check. And the decline in koalas could be opening a niche for the dropbears to exploit.	removed	removed	[0.23620558 0.7637944 ]

Each yearly flu vaccine is a variation on the ones that came before. There are special approval processes that allow the new flu shot to be admitted without having to go through the full set of clinical trials.   The covid-19 vaccine was developed quickly. A month after receiving the genetic code of the virus, researchers had the vaccine ready for first tests. By far the most time between discovery of the disease and rollout of the vaccine was spent on clinical trials: Proving that the vaccine is safe and effective. What further slowed down the full rollout is that the vaccine uses new technology, for which there wasn't a large amount of production capacity ready to go. Highly complex production chains had to be scaled up from zero to producing billions of doses.  Finally, a Delta-specific vaccine was never rolled out because the conclusion was that the protection offered by the existing vaccines against Delta was good enough and that it was more beneficial to keep up the high rate of deliveries than it would've been to switch to a new formulation.	existing	removed	[0.29940903 0.70059097]
If she is spreading that detail as a means to convince others NOT to vaccinate? Then fuck her she deserves removed. The fact that people can spread it while vaccinated is why EVERYONE SHOULD BE VACCINATED. With a booster your odds of catching covid and having a bad time are incredibly low.    &nbsp;  The vaccine is our safest way to combat this issue, and the non compliance of people like you and those here, are why we are so fucked.

I think the confusion here comes from the term "compassionate leave." The employer may personally be compassionate, but that's not what the leave is about.  Mom died, and my employer (I'm in the USA, employment here is barbaric and that's probably an insult to barbarians) gave me some time off.   My employer is a large organization. Compassion is a thing a human being has, not a large organization.  My employer gave me that time off because of contract terms, and because an employee who has just suffered a significant loss tends to be rather useless anyway. Also, I'm the only close relative capable of arranging her funeral and putting her affairs in order, so I would have needed a few days off for that, but they could have made me use vacation or sick days.  Compassion, other than possibly an awareness that a certain amount of consideration will get me back to my normal effectiveness and reduce the likelihood that I'll quit and make them hire a replacement, had nothing to do with it.  Compassion on the part of my coworkers might factor into it, but not the whole organization.	existing	existing	[0.7829538  0.21704617]

>Not sure the difference between Bavarian German and High German  There is none, actually.   (A bit hyperbole) There are two German language groups, Low German (the lowlands, in the North) and High German (the highlands, in the South).  \*Standard\* German is an artificial dialect based on High German varieties and replaced the Low German varieties.  Actual Low German is far more removed from Standard Germany than Bavarian German.   Basically Northern Germans had to make a full switch and then there were middle regions like the Ruhr Area, which became a melting pot, so the Bavarians got to keep their dialects.  Since Bavaria draws a lot of Germans from other places since they became the economic powerhouse instead of Western Germany, it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.  My brother in law is from Northern Germany, his wife from Eastern German, from a Middle German region. As far as I can tell their kids speak mostly standard German with local mannerism, kind of like we do in Northern Germany – understandable to all with some words pinpointing them.  They use use “gell” a lot (basically the same as “right" at the end of a language, while up here it would be more like “nich” ((is it) not, basically the same idea).	existing	existing	[0.6294394  0.37056065]

Interestingly I was part of the reason for this to come into effect with Rowing. In the 90’s I was part of ‘project Oarsome’, a junior rowing scheme in the UK. I did loads of sweep rowing as part of a coxless pair. From the ages of 15 to 17 I trained exclusively on stroke side and as a result developed heavily uneven muscles. Eventually it caused my pelvis to fuse with my hip bone on my right hand side. I’m now in my 40’s and still have a right leg that is a few inches longer than my left.

Yes, ethically this is 100% rape. I’m so sorry this happened to you. Realistically, you may not have much legal recourse. You’d have to contend with deeply ingrained gender stereotypes that will work against you, and state laws (if you’re in the US) vary widely in how they define and punish rape. Taking it to court can be retraumatizing for many victims, even though we all want to stop rapists from hurting more people. I would look into your state’s sexual assault laws and see how they define rape and sexual assault. I was raped but my state did not consider it rape (intoxication and coercion type of situation).  Your reaction of freezing up and letting things happen is completely normal and it does NOT mean you consented. She knew the limits of your consent and willingly chose to violate them. That’s rape.   Rape is not sex. It is a crime. You did not lose your virginity—you did not have sex, you were raped. It makes complete sense that you feel even more violated and hurt because you wanted to wait until marriage. Just know that you don’t need to bear any guilt for the virginity side of things. Virginity is a social construct, not biological. I sincerely hope you find healing and peace.	removed	existing	[0.8285385  0.17146152]

Nevermind that every one of her complaints about me were direct results of a severe hormone imbalanced i had lived with all my life.

I don't disagree, but also ...  we blame mothers when men turn out a certain way...  Why would mothers of daughters be exempt?  Single moms? Married moms whose husbands override their parenting?   The reality of single motherhood is that (a) moms who have the kids (no dad around) are usually dealing with poverty.  Raising kids in poverty is HARD.   (b) moms who don't have their kids are usually leaving abusers (abusers and molesters are statistically FAR more likely to request - and get - sole custody of their kids).   Recovering from DV is HARD.  Building a life after a divorce is hard.  Building a life after DV, divorce, and the brutal court-forced loss of your children?  Living every day knowing your children are alone, forever, with the man who tortured you for years?  It breaks many of these women.   That means, by the time mom leaves, she's often traumatized.  She may be physically ill from sleep deprivation and overwork.  if she wasn't already isolated, single motherhood means losing most of her former married friends (even today - it's one of the most brutal parts of a divorce) and having to find time and people who would socialize with a single mom. Dating introduces so many risks on the step-dad front, so her "love life" may be neglected as a result.  If she left an abuser, most of them continue to abuse from a distance, either through the kids, the courts, the finances, the social network, or all of these simultaneously.   the shocking thing isn't that single moms tend to have flaws.  It's that so many women do so well.  In this study, that controlled for poverty and prior domestic violence, kids raised by single moms did as well as kids from healthy two-parent families.  Which means the real issue all along has been poverty and male intimate violence.  [https://www.families.com/study-kids-raised-single-moms-well-kids-raised-two-parents](https://www.families.com/study-kids-raised-single-moms-well-kids-raised-two-parents)   (I've also noted that friends who grew up with abusive dads tend to be deeply resentful of their mothers for not leaving their dads.  Even in situations where the family courts of their region / time would almost certainly have handed them over solely to their dad post-divorce anyway.)	existing	existing	[0.8992533  0.10074665]

I appreciate your response. I am vaccinated. I reject the totalitarian direction the country is heading in. Again we are seeing higher cases than ever and more people are vaccinated than ever. Why is that? It isn’t logical to suggest more people vaccinated means the virus transmission is reduced just based on that evidence.   People seem to have forgotten all about early 20th century history and seem of the impression we can’t get there again. Freedom should be valued and protected. It’s much harder to get freedom back than it is to retain it. But this whole cycle has manipulated people into thinking these freedom restrictions are acceptable.

Dude, figure out what is special to the two of you. I mean legit special, absolute perfection kinda thing.  It doesn't have to involve the all the world's money, it's the effort and thought, the love, you use to create that one moment of asking that counts.  Your girl has shown you a ring she likes, great! Now you know what to look for. Is it silver or gold? Is it a chunky ring, or a slender ring? Take the styling cue and have a hunt for what you think is the best ring you can realistically afford.  I'd suggest only using your own cash, it shows that you respect her money is her money, and that she is worth spending your money on, cuz no doubt she's awesome!  The evening I proposed we were hanging about home after dinner, I gave her a hug and asked if she'd like to walk down the valley to the beach with me. It's like a 15min walk, and we chatted about the stars, small mammals (specifically musterlids and pugs) and how lovely the evening was. At the beach there's a bench next to an old ships propeller, we sat listening to waves for a bit then I slipped her hand into mine and just asked her if she would marry me. She said yes and I pulled the ring from my pocket. We sat listening to waves a little longer before wandering back home, continuing the mammal conversation. Once back home I hugged her again, told her that I love her then made pancakes for pudding.  For us it was perfect. We both remember the night fondly, I even remember which way the Southern Cross was pointing.   The ring was made by a long time jeweler friend of ours. Its silver with tree bark texture and a single moonstone. Her favourite precious metal, her favourite gemstone and tree bark because trees be cool. It cost me $220. Yeah, I had a discounted price, rrp was $250.  I could have taken her away for a romantic getaway and popped the question over a luxurious meal, but I didn't need to. Our perfect moment was just the local beach with a cheap ring made by a friend.   Figure that moment out, and no matter what you'll be set.  Enjoy the rest of your lives together, best of luck to ya.	existing	existing	[0.9223507  0.07764933]

I’m not a biologist, but: it’s also important to note that DNA is digital, not analog. If the code to make an animal were analog, then like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy, if there were any change of information it would quickly render the animal unviable. Darwin had no knowledge of DNA, and without understanding that mechanism, his theory was fundamentally incomplete: he could say “this is what I think is happening, and how, and why” at the macro level, but had no explanation for what enabled the processes he envisioned.   DNA being quaternary (a “bit” in DNA can have four values: AT, TA, CG, and GC) digital information allows for error correction, and without that, evolution would be (nearly?) impossible.   Darwin and the rest of the 1800s had no idea of any of this. The nature of DNA wasn’t discovered until about a hundred years later, and many of the concepts of digital information were unknown at Darwin’s time.   I think, but don’t have a cite, that Darwin even described this problem, and said that he didn’t have an answer to how animals and plants could change but conserve their nature as he was proposing. And he had the courage to say that if such method didn’t exist/ couldn’t be found then it would disprove his theory.   Reading on the digital nature of DNA. Warning: many links you will find in searched for digital DNA are creationists trying to twist the digital nature of DNA into an argument for an intelligent designer.   https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-history-mendel-dna-yafeng-shan  https://resolution-kelvin2514.blogspot.com/2012/02/essentials-atcg-abcs-of-dna.html?m=1	removed	removed	[0.4149843 0.5850157]

You are correct the websites/schools currently have that right. I'm arguing that we should take away that right. To condense my reason, it's that when corporations grow large enough, their power within society becomes comparable to that of a government. When a student attends a private school, the school power within that individuals life becomes comparable to that of a government. Thus, it becomes reasonable to restrict these institutions they same way we restrict governments. We don't yet, but I think we should (not necessarily with a constitutional amendment either, a regular law would probably be more appropriate).  Back when Facebook was small/uninfluential and only allowed specific university students, they weren't at the stage of being comparable in power to a government, and thus the "private property" argument carries more weight, but when they become one of the few avenues via which one can speak, ensuring people are able to speak becomes more important.	existing	existing	[0.8635402  0.13645984]

An ancient historic are was deeply affected by world war one trench building - but it was not in an active war zone.  Salisbury plain - the area that includes Stonehenge - is an area of intense historic interest. Since 1897 it was also home, to series of military bases, that was hugely expanded upon the outbreak of the First World War. The area hosted one of the largest military training ground in Britain as well as an aerodrome. There was intense concern about damage to Stonehenge itself as well as other historic artifacts (e.g. barrows) due to this activity. The digging of trenches for example, and use of munitions, had a significant effect on the area. The Society of Works, Wiltshire Archeology Society amid others did try to document the area and monitor the impact of military activities but this was largely based on the archeology of the time that focused more on external structures as opposed to earthworks; George Englehart of the Wiltshire Archeology Society noted that two soldiers who removed soil from a barrow promised to put it back afterwards!   The war did galvanise an existing campaign to protect Stonehenge: the aerodrome was dismantled after the war, amid a campaign to 'restore' Stonehenge into a preserved area of national importance, absent of military or commercial (farming) activity  M Barber (2014) Stonehenge Aerodrome and the Stonehenge Landscape; English Heritage Research Dept Report 007/2014 Historic England  Walker, K.

So, there are actually **two** kinds of accounting firms, and they do different things.  One type of accounting firm does things like pay bills and book invoices and prepare financial statements. It's actually more common for *medium* and smaller firms to use these kinds of accounting firms. Bigger companies often do this work in-house, though they may *centralize* it, so there's one office where all the accounting is done, even when the company has multiple locations.   The other type of accounting firm is an **auditing** firm. Those firms are engaged to *review* a company's existing books and financial statements for accuracy and completeness. They don't actually "do" the accounting for a company, but they *certify* that the company's financial statements and reports are correctly stated, not leaving anything out or misrepresenting anything.   When a company has investors, or stockholders, or even has large loans to a bank, those parties (the bank, the stockholders, the investors) want to have assurances that the company's financial reporting is true and accurate, so the company hires 3rd party outside firm to audit and certify their accounting. Any publicly-traded company **must** do this as a condition for being able to offer their stock.	removed	existing	[0.9322193 0.0677807]

>saying 'I'm a doctor!' and then acting as if they were a medical professional is a problem of them misrepresenting themselves and their qualifications  I agree.

Yes, they did spoke latin in Maghreb, which evolved in its own unique way, but not enough is known to know if it came to be a separate language. While we now little about it, we know that by 386 Augustine of Hippo, who was native to the region, complains in his work how his pronunciation is criticized by his peers from Italy, and how he founds faults with theirs. Though, was the language spoken in North Africa at that point different enough to be already considered a separate language is unknown. Other people such as Publius Consentius and saint Jerome also mention the differences. There are also some inscriptions thought to be written in the North African dialect. Another possible remnant of this dialect/language remain in different Berber languages and Maghrebi Arabic as loan words, though not all words of romance origin are thought to be descendant from the North African dialect/language.  If you're interested in the topic, I would suggest 2007 book from J N Adams titled "The Regional Diversification of Latin 200bc - 600ad".	removed	removed	[0.48354593 0.51645404]

>I understand that the way a rich person does this to avoid taxes is to not take a salary. Instead, they get paid in stocks.  The reason they do this is because Capital gains are taxed at a different rate than wages, not because they can defer paying taxes forever. The top bracket for capital gains tops out at 20%, whereas the top bracket for wages tops out at 37%. So, taking payment in stock, and then selling the stock cuts the tax rate paid on income by 17%.  >Stocks aren't taxed until you sell them.  Yes, the same way that the equity on your house and the land it sits on isn't taxed until you sell it.  >Loans aren't taxed as income.  Loans aren't income at all, which is lucky for anyone using a credit card to pay for stuff.  >I get that instead of selling them, they take out a loan against the stock value. So they've converted their stock salary into real money in a way that doesn't get taxed.  The reason this is done isn't because it's cheaper than just taking income from capital gains, it's because of *market timing*. Stocks fluctuate, and using your stock as collateral for a secured loan gives you a good interest rate, but you still have to make payments, and the money you will spend to make those payments will have to come from somewhere, and will be taxed, in the exact same manner the money you use to pay off your Visa bill is taxed.  So, the question is, why not just take the money out of your stock, and sell it directly, and not pay the 2% interest or whatever to the bank? The answer is simple: Stocks are **VOLATILE**, and if you're the officer of a publicly traded company, the circumstances in which you're permitted to sell stocks are very strictly regulated. In other words, if you're Bobby Kotick, you can't just dump all your stocks the day after you announced that your company is being acquired by Microsoft, and cash out on the huge jump in stock price which results from the announcement.  It's very, very important that, as someone with a large portfolio, that you're able to make your trades based on the trading price, rather than just "when you need money". So, that's why they borrow money. It is not a magical means of making your money somehow concealed from the taxman.  The way the media covers the taxes paid by wealthy people is... somewhat deceptive, IMO. So, for example, if AMZN goes up in price by 10%, then yes, Jeff Bezos' net worth goes up by 15 million dollars. But that isn't *income*, for the exact same reason that when, in 2021, the price of California homes went up by 20%, every California homeowner didn't have to declare an extra $146,000 of income that year. It's still the same house it was in 2020, the family's standard of living hasn't changed, so it doesn't really make sense for the government to tap them for $21,900 on their tax bill immediately. What if home prices revert to normal the next year? That's why the Government counts capital gains when they're *realized*, not theoretical gains based on market fluctuations of unsold property.  Now you could have a discussion about **WHY** capital gains are taxed at a different from wages, but that's somewhat outside the scope of the question you asked, so I'll leave it be. If you want me to answer that question, go ahead and reply.	existing	existing	[0.9352999  0.06470014]

It’s a racial slur in the direct sense that it’s a word used to refer to a member of a race with a negative connotation.   Due to the feelings it actually engenders and the history involved, it’s not on the same level as the n-word.   And etymology doesn’t determine meaning, but still raises one point worth mentioning: although it’s often claimed to derive from the idea of white slaveowners and overseers cracking whips, it actually came from a term used by well-off white people for people they regarded as ‘white trash’.   The development was broadly from ‘to crack’ meaning ‘to engage in fun conversation’ (cracking a joke, etc.), and then to ‘brag’, which goes back to Shakespeare, and then developed to mean poor white trash with airs of being more than they are. The southern American white elite referred to crackers in a few recorded cases from the early 19th century. Eventually this was adopted by black people to refer to ‘poor white trash’, and then gradually white people in general, and was used less by white people, until it became an ‘ethnic slur’ of sorts.	existing	existing	[0.90406376 0.09593624]

Anecdote time!  I worked at Fuddruckers for like 6 or 7 years. For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.  I understand VERY WELL that parents need a break, but not at the expense of random people I don't know.	removed	existing	[0.84408844 0.15591161]

I've had similar experiences.  For most of my life I've been pretty flexible doing some of the more common things. Like touching my toes (wrapping hands around the bottom of my feet) with knees extended sort of thing. Nothing particularly amazing, although I do know there are people who struggle with this one.  Over the past year, I took a recommendation from Kelly Starrett, DPT. He recommended doing this one stretch every night before bed. It's basically a pigeon stretch with the foot elevated on something, but really trying to maximize that hip flexion. So I did just that using my bed to elevate my foot. I would do 1 min each side, no dramas.   Now when I try the stretch as a warmup on the floor, I can get my shoulder to touch my opposite foot while touching one of my sit bones to the floor as well. To clarify by example: flex left hip, left foot in the pigeon position (right foot/leg reaching behind me), lay forward, right shoulder touches instep of left foot; meanwhile, left sit bone is touching the floor as well. It's not perfect (my spine could probably be straighter) but it's actually happening for me! As an older guy, this is a bit surreal.  To be clear: I didn't just start doing the pigeon stretch for the first time this past year. I've been doing them fairly frequently for the better part of a decade now. It's the nightly stretching which managed to improve my hip ROM even further.	removed	removed	[0.21733831 0.7826617 ]

"even if plausible, it's unprovable" is the best bet here, although admittedly it does not make for much of an answer.   Mary Beard has a treatment of the whole affair in SPQR. She points out that the death of Caligula is one of the best-documented killings in Roman history, but a lot of it is mysterious. She seems quite dubious of the official story that Claudius had no ambitions and was chosen by the Praetorians when they found him hiding behind a curtain. She points out that a show of reluctance can often cover ruthless ambition, and that all the stories about how awful Caligula was and how innocent Claudius was were written down during the reign of Claudius.   Claudius, of course, came to power after the bloody murder of his own nephew and his wife and their daughter and a lot of other people. She points out that a -lot- of the stories about bad emperors were written down during the reigns of the successors. These successors often came to power after bloodshed. (the list of emperors who died of natural causes is short) These emperors would often, like Claudius, have the motivation to encourage the writing of stories that made them look good. She tends to treat almost all the stories about succession and palace politics as stories that tell us about what Romans thought and said, not as things you can rely on to be true. So even if there was a plot that Claudius was in on, you would not expect to find much evidence.   &#x200B;       Beard, Mary. SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome. Reprint edition.

I have read the rules regarding responses, and I don’t want to fall afoul of them, but I have to take issue with the premise of the question, “being called a gorilla is a common insult in Japan.” I have a degree in Japanese literature (albeit post-war, not ancient), am employed as a translator, and have lived in Japan since 2004. Though I’m not sure how you would measure such a thing, being called a gorilla as an insult in Japanese would be no more or less common than being called a gorilla as an insult in English. There is even a gorilla in Higashiyama Zoo named Shabani who is famous for how handsome he is. He’s somewhat of an unofficial mascot for the city of Nagoya, where I live, as he’s been used by the city in municipal advertisements. I have also never encountered in my academic studies, professional work, or personal life a negative reputation attributed to gorillas. Babies and people with relatively “simian” features such as large ears are sometimes referred to as “猿”(saru), meaning “monkey” in general, but the reputation of monkeys as a whole doesn’t suffer from this.

Depends on interest rates but generally no, as the interest rate to borrow is generally lower than you can get from investing the money. Today, definitely not.  You can get a 30 year mortgage on a house for like 3.5%, or a 15 year for like 3% (granted these vary by credit score and location). So, you want to buy a $400,000 house and you happen to have $400,000 sitting around.   You could buy the house outright and save yourself from having to pay any interest.  OR you could put 20% down ($80,000) and borrow the remaining $320,000 at 3.5% APR... And then invest that $320,000 in the stock market. While the returns are not guaranteed, index funds have returned more like 8-10% historically.	existing	existing	[0.9288875  0.07111256]

It's been a while since I did biology (6 or so years) so I may get some facts wrong or mixed but here goes. Some B/T cells can get out of the main blood stream as your capillaries, which diffuse nutrients into the surrounding area and waste out, can become 'leaky' meaning that these cells which usually stay in the bloodstream can migrate. This is usually caused by stress hormones from the cells in the area that are under attack and draws the immune response there. This is also why infected areas can sometimes swell, as water from the leaky capillaries seeps out. B/T cells that migrate out usually die after a few hours/days since they don't have an effective way to return into the body.	removed	existing	[0.53585976 0.46414024]

The problem with this is that by completely ignoring race we ignore the systematic oppression of minorities still existing today.  Kids must be made aware of this to know when someone is being racist, to understand the roots and how it is vitally entwined with the history of the USA. Kids need to know how to spot racism and avoid falling into that mindset themselves from peer influence.   Racists will always exist. Oppression will exist for much longer than any of us will live.

The Great Depression and the second world war I would say are the major points.  The Great Depression of the 1930s unlike the very big depressions of the 19th century was the first time citizens turned to their governments looking for them to change things rather than just seeing them as phenomena akin to natural catastrophes which you could do nothing about.   During the second world war the apparatus of national accounting (caluclating GDP etc.) was created to help prosecute the war. On the basis that you only care about what you can measure, the post war period cared about GDP growth as they could then actually measure it.	removed	existing	[0.6463145  0.35368553]

Study by "Everytown for Gun Safety"?  And labels like "National Failures"?  It seems like common sense and I definitely would believe it, but it's a bit like a "Nuts Are Good For You" study by the American Nut Association.  Their methodology seems a little suspect, too, with some gun laws given what seem like arbitrary values - there's no given justification why any law is any given level.  They also say they give more points for "stronger" versions of the law, but that seems like it could be subjective.  EDIT: To be clear, I support stronger gun laws.

You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game.

Now, I knew that ALL air traffic, helicopter or fixed wing, was required to follow the Potomac River to get to National Airport or the Pentagon, period.  And I had lived there for years, and never once saw or heard a helicopter go overhead.  So this was definitely unusual.   I figured that something really calamitous had just happened, and somebody was trying to get to (or out of) the Pentagon....rules be damned.  So I laid there waiting for the world to end, but it didn't.  For the next few days I scoured the news to see if I could see something that might have caused someone to say "I don't give a damn what the rules are....get me to the Pentagon NOW".   Never did.	removed	existing	[0.5579492 0.4420508]

You whine more than a kid at a restaurant.   You don’t own the world, you’re not owed a child-free restaurant any more than parents are owed a night out with their family.  Go to a different restaurant or work somewhere else if you can’t handle it.  How are parents supposed to teach their kids how to act in public if they never bring them out in public?   You’re evidently child-free, so why don’t you go enjoy your water in a place that doesn’t allow children?	removed	removed	[0.21319923 0.7868008 ]

NTA don't invite someone you don't want to be there. Social etiquette about inviting longterm partners is all fine and dandy, but only as long as one partner is not an abusive person likely to ruin the day by causing a scene. In those cases it's perfectly acceptable to just not invite the problematic part of the couple.  I would have a talk with the friend in question before and tell him that she is not welcome, but he is as long as he doesn't bring her along. Also tell him that it's fine if he doesn't want to attend under those conditions, but you will not be budging on this. From what you have written I think it's very likely that she will cause trouble if she attends and I would also be prepared for her pulling something else when she learns she is not invited.	existing	existing	[0.92807466 0.07192532]

The ACA was literally written by the Heritage Foundation as the 1993's HEART Act to be the small government approach to healthcare, as I stated originally.  It was literally written by a far right think tank as the fiscally conservative option to healthcare reform.  If we're gatekeeping the literal heritage foundation from fiscal conservatism, then I guess words just don't have meaning anymore.  And your citation is specious at best.  It for some reason conflates .gov internal spending and internal regulation requirements with private market regulation, and that's the only way it ends up with greater regulation overhead than reduced.  That's about what I expect out of a blog from a right wing think tank.  An you still haven't answered which policies have they passed that aren't in line with neoliberalism, unless you're trying to make the incredibly vacuous claim that the ACA counts.	existing	removed	[0.43629497 0.563705  ]

You'd have to shake your head extremely violently to actually cause brain damage.

I work for a company that collects a lot of the clinical data for some of the big pharmaceutical companies to run drug trials, including some of the new COVID vaccines. The answer is that yes, their is a ton of data collected about each patient as part of a clinical trial that looks at all sorts of data points. Things like biometric data, medical history, any new diagnosis or prognosis. I don't think a lot of respondents realize the amount of data that's required in order to get FDA approval. When it comes to drug trials these aren't a couple of small data points we're dealing with, we're talking extensive clinical data that in many cases contains decades of data on the same subject.   &#x200B;  To answer your question directly...yes our clients have teams of of data scientists who scour the data and are looking at anything that might be significant regardless of the intended purpose of the data collection. If you have this incredibly rich data set you would be incredibly stupid not to see if their are other significant findings you can get out of the data.	removed	removed	[0.41389316 0.58610684]

>False claim. I only criticized the parts that didn't make sense. The fact that every line of your comment had a flaw in it does not prove that I was trying to read your comment line by line or disagree with it line by line.  The absolute brainlessness required to say "False claim" and then admit to doing exactly what you were of accused means that I doubt any kind of real dialogue can happen here.   Especially when you said this:  >I already took your whole argument as it was by examining all premises within your argument and pointing out the flaws within them.   Three of your 'responses' were just highlight a word or phrase and saying "I don't know what this means". Creationists not understandign evolution does not refute evolution. You being unable to google the word 'racialise' doesn't 'refute' anything at all, and the fact you claimed it did means I think you're really here for conversation.

This is an entirely semantic argument so we have to look at definitions.  Privilege: A special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group.  So based on that definition, an advantage available only to a specific group is a privilege. Disadvantage is just an acronym for advantage. If POC have a disadvantage, then white people as a group could be said to have an advantage; ergo, white people have a privilege.  These are just two different ways of saying the same thing.	existing	existing	[0.9359998  0.06400016]

Hey, sorry about the "warm welcome" you got from the other user. I'm a month late but whatever. I just stumbled upon your post and figured "what the hell, let's reply". It's scary af how much I can relate to the first part of the text. Even the same age. As for the rest I cannot say much, since I never became good looking, lol. Not ugly either, just meh. I don't complain tho, I like being as noticible as a blank wall.  I hope the ending brackets in your post worked out well, the whole friendship thing I mean.    It makes sense you were hated a lot, since you achieved a lot while everyone else stood behind. It's kind of a paradox. Authorities came out and assured the community, with proof, that you're a good person with great qualities, who's worth loving and be loved by, which got you hate from your equals instead.  I mean, when I play Mario Kart (yeah, I'm using that as an analogy) I just hate the guy that's in first place. Not even one second into the game, I hate him, since I'm in the race, worse yet, that just means I hate the race. I don't even need to know the guy's face to get an evil satisfaction when throwing a blue shell. Me hating you is nothing personal, I'm just trying to heal the tragic fact I don't like racing, and yet, I'm stuck in a race.   You just need to love good qualities in people (loving good qualities, not people alone. Any good quality in anyrhing) more than you hate bad qualities in people. It's necessary, it's an advantage. Master this and it will lead you to love all your good qualities more than you hate the hate it may attract.   Idk man. I'm not a psychologist, I don't even speak english. I'm just giving you a picture of what getting out of the hole looks like in theory.

Realistically, the filibuster came about because of a change in senate rules, and has since been used as a method to stall debate. It’s not really “meant” to be a thing whatsoever, at least not until the 70’s.

Sure but when there's a strong cultural bias against your identity as was the case with transgenderism during Obama's political rise the moral weight of deceiving others is much lower when it's necessary to protect yourself from harm.

What you were saying makes sense. I often think about how real estate works, when buying a home here in the United States you are looking at roughly 6% to cover all the fees and commissions. I don’t understand why there aren’t flat fees to begin with because the paperwork work is relatively the same whether it’s a cheap one bedroom or a fancy 5-bedroom home in a nicer neighborhood. Look at all the crypto exchanges making serious bank by charging a commission on activity instead of a flat fee.

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics. This ended up being quite electorally advantageous for him as no one on either side of the political spectrum had preexisting negative perceptions of him to burden his candidacy.   While his wife on the other hand by proxy of her husband’s current obvious familiarity to the public would not be able to dupe many on the right. She couldn’t still easily benefit politically amongst the left from a similar lack of preconceptions of her. Especially since a plurality of the left and many independents still hold her husband’s tenure as president in a delusionally nostalgic amount of high esteem relative to the other possible democratic candidates.	removed	existing	[0.9131731  0.08682688]

I pointed out that my preferred age range for matches was 40-something. (I don't remember exactly what I set it to, but it would have included 38-year-olds. I was okay with that at the time.) And he comes back with "but I wasn't specifically looking for YOU but for younger women in general" or whatever.  Like, was I the only premenopausal woman on the entire site willing to date a 38-year-old? I highly, highly doubt it.  I truly didn't care about his age. But his dishonesty was a deal-breaker. And the fact that he deliberately set out to get a hypothetical young woman to fall in love with him before revealing that he wasn't what she wanted, what she thought he was -- yeah, hell to the no with that manipulative bullshit.	existing	existing	[0.64701605 0.35298395]

You're the most retarded person I've ever heard bag out Christianity:  1. You're applying modern ethno-religious guidelines from Rabbinical Judaism to early Christians/Second Temple Jews. You do understand the reason Christians were persecuted is because they didn't receive the same protections as Jews when it came to the requirement of sacrificing to/for the Roman emperor? That's because the Jews of the time kicked up a fuss and made it clear that they wanted nothing to do with Christians who they didn't consider Jews. They even stopped using the Septuagint and scrapped together a Hebrew based scripture (later used by Protestants) because they didn't want to use the same scripture as Christians. 2. Even if you were right you've failed to address the fact that modern scholars believe the Bible wasn't written in the 1st century but the 3rd or 4th. So all you've done is deflect from reality as someone who supposedly doesn't believe in Christianity you have a pretty good understanding of Sola Scriptura 3. One of the disciples is literally called Simon the Zealot as in the sect of Jews independent of Pharisees as explained by the Jewish historian Josephus who literally witnessed the political events of the time. 4. What is your evidence that Jesus was a Pharisee when the Essenes understanding of the Messiah as both a religious and temporal leader is much closer to the Jesus's teachings. They even practiced the same forms of strict asceticism (as both Jesus and John the Baptist) out in the dessert which last time I checked wasn't something the Pharisees ever practiced.   There you are, you literally admitted you're a deceitful Jew at the end of your little rant. Who would have guessed? And like all Jews you block out the history that doesn't make you look good and lie about your own scripture in order to try and deceive the Goyim.	removed	removed	[0.1785925  0.82140756]

We’ll never be able to achieve the pressures in the core of the sun in a terrestrial reactor. And such high pressures aren’t necessary anyway.  The thermonuclear reaction rate has a much stronger dependence on temperature than on pressure. It’s linear in the density, which is proportional to the pressure, with fixed temperature. But it’s generally some power law in the temperature, so ~ T^(p), where p is some fairly large positive power.  So your plasma can be at a much smaller pressure, but a moderately larger temperature, and still get the same reaction rate per particle as you’d have with a stellar temperature and pressure.	existing	existing	[0.6696337 0.3303663]

The forces involved are weight (W), buoyancy (B), and drag (D).  Applying Newton’s second law, we find that W + D = B, or D = B - W.  The buoyant force is ρ*_f_*gV, where ρ*_f_* is the density of the fluid. The weight is ρgV, where ρ is the density of the object. And the drag is some function of the velocity; we can assume linear drag for low Reynolds number flows, so D = bv.  So the terminal velocity is calculated at steady state, when these forces are all balanced, and the result is v*_t_* = (ρ*_f_* - ρ)gV/b.  So it increases with the density difference, and decreases with the linear drag coefficient of the object.	existing	removed	[0.43576422 0.56423575]

The issue with discussing this is that the modern/woke whatever definition of gender is that **Gender is not tied to sex**. Normally genders are just common colloquialisms used to have a single word describe multiple attributes E.g. the gender of "**man**" is an "**adult human** ***male***", "**boy**" as "**adolescent human** ***male***", etc. These are the same as for animals such as bitch/dog, ewe/ram, fawn/kid/calf. These are just common colloquialisms, using *objective* fact to describe and categorize the world to each other. Whereas modern definition of genders are circular and subjective, rendering themselves utterly useless with no descriptive power and serving no purpose other than to stroke the ego of those who *declare* they "*identify*" as it.  It is extremely naïve to say that sex will be some "obscure medical trait" that "has zero influence over the 99.9% of your life that you spend outside of a doctor's office", humans are dioecious organisms, our 2 sexes are important to us not just as a species but as an organism, it results in drastic difference mentally and physically, and is required for reproduction.   >people who say "only sex should matter", will end up expecting that sex should still matter in plenty of social contexts like sport events, bathroom segregartion, dating, etc.  Are you saying you don't think sex should be a factor in dating? Dating which ultimately is for finding a **sexual** partner for **reproduction**. Also do you believe that sexualities are not based on sex? E.g. a heterosexual male is a male sexually attracted to females. I'm very confused, humans aren't attracted to subjective socially constructed genders, the foundation is sex, anything else is a preference. If someone says they don't care about the sex of someone for a sexual partner, thats ok... its called being bisexual.   Sports being split by sex made sense historically, and naturally occurred as sex is the first way you can split humans into categories, the next probably being race. I don't like sports, but I understands that sports such as those features in the Olympics for example (not chess etc.) are about pitting human physical abilities against each other, so when you have 2 clearly objectively separate categories of humans (male/female) with objective differences which affect physical abilities, it obviously makes sense to segregate sports based on that. Same way no one gives a shit that boxing has weight classes, or 6 year olds can't compete against adults in the 100m sprint. Physical reality is real and affects peoples abilities.   Sure you can get rid of sports segregation, but people will be mad when males win 99% of all physical sports.      Bathroom/changing room segregation is interesting, as most make the safety argument, but a rebuttal is that well gay/lesbians exist and can be perves or rapists. Sadly the fact is the vast majority of people are heterosexual, and when you're working with large population you have to go with the solution which protects the majority. The ideal solution actually being separate single person rooms accessible from a public location, essentially like a bathroom in your home. Bathrooms are also interesting when it comes to gender as bathrooms split by gender makes zero sense, why does a male saying they're a woman mean they can go into the woman's bathroom, the segregation was put in place based on sex.	existing	existing	[0.6347576  0.36524248]

I don’t have the patience these days to go through and debunk your points - not likely the skill required. It seems you are quite convinced there is a co piracy afoot to push climate issues - although the proposed motive seems shaky when balanced against the overwhelming consensus of academics. That’s just my opinion, someone who still respects experts in their fields.  My only question to you is - what if you’re wrong? It seems to me that if you’re right then the world would have spent grant money and effort in renewable energy and attempting to preserve the planet - although there may be some drawback in powerful elites or some such thing that you have posited - although I still fail to see the true drawback.  But if you’re wrong - then mankind may very well struggle to exist in the future at all, if not all life.  I just don’t understand the risk/reward that you are operating at. Seems more like a fear of a slippery slope boogeyman than actual concern over trying to avoid catastrophe.  But yeah, I don’t mean to move the goalposts. My point was you are railing against something that is not the same as your original post. You have described lying - not pseudo science. The scientific method is absolute — assuming we are trusting reality and human observation — and there is not really a way around that. It’s important to shape the discourse properly so people don’t begin to equate the scientific method as corrupted itself — it can’t be. If there was an issue with the data around climate change - which I have yet to be compelled to believe there is personally - then that is either due to a lack of evidence or as you detail in your post (fictional or real) legitimate undermining and lying.	removed	existing	[0.75819767 0.24180229]

Certainly!   There's a pretty big difference in the conclusions drawn by studies that look at gun control cross-sectionally versus studies that look at effects of gun control legislation on trends.   Studies that look at the effects of gun control policies on trends tend to show that these policies only affect suicide, not homicide (gun-related or otherwise). This is true whether the study takes place in the [US](https://www.law.virginia.edu/news/2003_spr/cook.htm), [Australia](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1736501,00.html), [Canada](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234457), or other countries.   Studies that compare country X with country Y (or state X with state Y), tend to find lots of associations. Generally, these analyses fuel arguments as to whether the difference is explained by gun legislation, healthcare availability, social support networks, or some other factor.	existing	existing	[0.917834   0.08216606]

In the 3D case, as with GPS, one satellite will give you a sphere that you could be anywhere on the surface of.  Two satellites intersects two spheres, giving you a planar circle that you could be anywhere on.  Adding a third satellite intersects another sphere with that circle, leaving two possible positions that you could be at, and a fourth satellite narrows down your location to which of those two positions is correct.  Including additional satellites beyond four in your fix just averages out the signal errors to improve the accuracy of the fix.	removed	removed	[0.4021571 0.5978429]

I'm going to try to take this in a slightly different way.    By attacking Pearl Harbor, they set in motion their complete and total defeat.  By being so militarily devastated after the war, the Japanese were able to rebuild and focus their economy on industry and technology, without having to spend excessive amounts of money that would have been needed during the Cold War on their military, thus putting them in position to be one of the largest economies in the world by 2000.	removed	removed	[0.24320056 0.75679946]
Some of my situation is similar to u/ryan30z: refractory, atypical childhood ongoing depression, diagnosis as an adult of ADD (no hyperactive component), hypnagogia (violently acting out in sleep, unrelated to sleepwalking), high IQ, and very creative. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved ineffective and in a couple of meds, even dangerous.  Treatment is now centered around Emsam (12mg selegiline patch), which mitigates both depression and hypnagogia. After problems with ADD drugs, I've returned to self-medicating with prodigious amounts of caffeine to concentrate and sleep, and consider ADD not a handicap but a superpower for creativity.

I have two sons - 24 and 16. With the oldest, I was already teaching him basic cooking skills, how to clean the house properly (no weaponized incompetence here). He already knew how to do laundry and fold clothes Japanese-style (Kondo) by the time he was in middle school. He saw the value in it when at school the teachers asked to fold their class shirts and he impressed them with his simple but very precise folding. When they both started working at 16, their bosses were impressed that they knew how to mop and do dishes correctly. This made my oldest level up faster and now works at a boujee gym.   Both of them would whine and say… why do I have to do this? Men shouldn’t be cleaning … blah blah blah. Esp since I was a SAHM for a long time. I reminded them that if they wanted to stay happily married, they needed to be able to do 50% of labor in the household. Also, majority women now work so men have to be able to keep up their half of running a household. I wanted my future daughter in laws to gain a partner and not another child they had to care for. I want my future grandchildren to have the best chances of being raised in a two parent HAPPY household.   Showing your sons how to balance home, school and work life is the best way to keep your legacy and family intact. One of the best ways of teaching respect for “unseen” housework is making them do it so they understand it doesn’t magically clean up on its own.	existing	existing	[0.7434504  0.25654957]

> one with a focus on modern history, the Holocaust, or or anything along those lines would probably be a good bet.  And don't forget military museums, either. [The Airborne Museum](https://www.asomf.org/visit-the-museum/) is small, but remarkably good for it's size and the sheer scope of its history. It covers the Airborne from their inception in WWII right up to some of their deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.  As someone who has lived in northern France, their depiction of the French towns that the Airborne landed in during D-Day and the Allied push on the Western Front is spot on and accurate enough to give me a chilling sense of nostalgia.	removed	removed	[0.49436077 0.50563926]

This explanation is completely wrong.  Airplanes will fly at about the same velocity relative to their air no matter which direction. If there is no wind then air speed is the same as ground speed, and their travel time is simply (ground distance)/(airspeed), which is the same in both directions.  The rotation of Earth leads to a wind pattern that can favor one direction, but that's not what OP asked about.	existing	existing	[0.7561856  0.24381438]

I stated above why there is one for women. More studies and knowledge is available for men so websites that aren't gender specific use data and information are from men's studies except in areas like pregnancy. (Example: girls and women are less likely to get an adhd diagnoses because average symptoms are different for both and the studies were done on boys and men so that information is what is published on websites for both genders. Women and girls have been diagnosed more since there have been more studies and knowledge but they're still not posting it on the majority of websites.   If women weren't affected by the information being overwhelmingly for men then it would make sense to get angry over it. There should be one for both but that is why there is one for women. Not because women's health is more important but because there are issues because of other websites geared toward men's side effects, symptoms, dosage etc.	existing	existing	[0.89922315 0.10077688]

While your answer makes sense logically, it technically doesn't make it true. Just letting you know. Like you said, its unknown. What you're suggesting is a logical possibility that dictates safety/concern with each strain, and that is by far the smart choice. However, there is no proof that the probability of long covid from infection remains the same across all strains/variants afaik. If there is proof, we haven't found it yet.	existing	removed	[0.49032292 0.5096771 ]

I can only give you assumptions as a chemist.  You take all of the urine throughout the day to produce a composite sample. Biological samples  have variation dependent on metabolism and many other factors throughout the day. taking the whole days sample and mixing it gives an average of the whole day and makes it more reproducible. As for bacteria urine is mostly sterile if you refrigerate it there should be no significant growth in a day or two.	existing	existing	[0.5314515  0.46854848]

Yes but they were called grotesques because the word was already in usage elsewhere referring to deformed things. (paintings, illuminations etc) IE something deformed was grotesque. The word itself was derived in Italy after excavations of artwork in the Domus Arena and because they were found "in a cave" or "in a grotto" it became grotto-esque (literally grottesco). Later (1600s) Chimaera may have had a "grotesque" quality but we wouldnt understand it to be "a grotesque" until much later. Hence the 1800s comment. Source for that is the CNRTL link where they link early common usage.	removed	removed	[0.36568034 0.6343197 ]

Ohhhh yeah.	existing	existing	[0.636509   0.36349097]
An issue of language on this topic is whether sex and gender are synonymous. I think gender either needs its definitional foundation to be based on sex, or we just abolish gender all together.   Genders for the vast majority of people are just common colloquialisms used to have a single word describe multiple attributes E.g. the gender of "man" is an "adult human male", "boy" as "adolescent human male", etc. These are the same as for animals such as bitch/dog, ewe/ram, fawn/kid/calf. These are just common colloquialisms, using objective fact to describe and categorize the world to each other. Whereas modern definition of genders are circular and subjective, rendering themselves utterly useless with no descriptive power and serving no purpose other than to stroke the ego of those who declare they "identify" as it.  There is no benefit to language/commination by allowing people to self identify with a gender based on subjectivity. Genders are nouns, but more and more the "woke" view is that a gender is whatever you want, so as soon as they're subjective someone can just declare they're something, and they can no longer be used to describe or externally identify anything. Someone saying they're a "woman" is now useless as its now literally meaningless, without a link to sex, no definition of woman can be given which isn't circular.   I'd rather these people came up with a new word instead of "gender" as what they're talking about isn't "gender", or its more akin to personality types, someone's reasoning for being a "woman" could be because they like dresses, and hate China, theres literally no foundation to say thats not valid.   Categorizing people based on arbitrary subjective labels they've given **themselves** is useless. Declaring yourself an two-spirit AMAB gender-fluid lesbian trans woman just makes communication more difficult, it obscures reality. Its like someone saying "2 times e to the 2 i pi" instead of just "2" or in this case a heterosexual male.	existing	existing	[0.81806177 0.1819382 ]

Eat shit retard.  > Sex play with friends of the same sex is common during the childhood years (DeLamater & Freidrich, 2002; Sandnabba et al., 2003) In fact, during this time, when separation of the sexes is particularly strong, same-sex activity is probably more common than heterosexual encounters (DeLamater & Freidrich, 2002; Martinson, 1994)   https://imgur.com/a/965hIo4  > Interpersonal sexual play often occurs between children of the same sex and can include siblings.16,37,38 Experiencing sexual play at least once during childhood appears prevalent (reported by more than 66% to 80% of adults in retrospective research) and can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years.

I'm not the previous commenter, but you basically did do exactly that. "the US isn't invading its neighbors" as a defense against accusations of US imperialism demonstrates a total denial or ignorance of the way US imperialism works.  The US isn't currently invading its neighbors because it already controls or isolates its neighbors to a satisfactory degree.   Take Mexico. There is no need to invade Mexico and annex it, because the benefits of annexation to the empire would be limited, and the cost of any war to achieve such an end, not to mention the eventual enfranchisement of the Mexican people would substantially outweigh what limited benefits there might be. The US already has more than enough influence over Mexico through monetary means to achieve its aims.  It's incredibly easy to see which countries currently fall sufficiently under its influence by simply identifying which ones US officials and media are critical of. Cuba, for example, is emphatically not in the club. So we punish them by a failed invasion, by permanently strangling their economy, and by more or less constant little projects to attempt to demonize and undermine the authority of their present government.  Or Bolivia. We don't like the party in power very much because they're not fond of bending over for American business interests, so we back false narratives questioning the legitimacy of their elections, which independent investigations have subsequently completely debunked. Then we back a right wing military coup on the pretense that those elections we helped delegitimize were fake. Fortunately for Bolivia, pressure from the people convinced the Bolivian military to compromise on just removing Morales (whom they fear) from power, but allowing elections to take place again as long as he couldn't run (despite the fact that both the people and the courts favored altering the constitution to allow him to do so).   These are just a couple of the myriad publicly known ways American imperial power is actually deployed. It seldom requires invasions. The fact that Russia has to rattle their sabers manually and the US doesn't is merely evidence of greater and more sophisticated American imperial power, not some fundamental moral difference.	removed	existing	[0.5227023  0.47729772]

My SIL has never been the same which is understandable but she has refused to seek help and the family have not pushed her in this matter.  Four months ago my husband and I had a beautiful little girl, it was a bittersweet moment for the family after the loss of my niece but we all love her and the wound my niece's death left is not as raw for most of us, but i'm aware that this is a different matter for my SIL and I told her she didn't need to be around my daughter more than she felt comfortable with and if she ever needed to talk I was always there, she insisted she was fine and I took her at her word.  However, sometimes she'd slip up and use the wrong name for my daughter, calling her the name of her daughter....I overlooked it at first as she'd always correct herself and seem embarrassed, but when she and her partner would babysit despite the fact I always included extra clothes in case of accidents i'd find my daughter dressed in clothes that belonged to my niece when I went to pick her up.  This was the final straw for me and the entire situation makes me uncomfortable, i've told my Husband I don't want his sister around our daughter until she gets help as it's clear she is not coping well and trying to use our daughter to replace hers even if its unconsciously. He thinks I am overreacting and his sister is just grieving still and needs time, I understand that and if I was in her position i'd be devastated if we lost our girl.  I put my foot down on this matter however and am not allowing her to babysit anymore until she gets help which has hurt her and had other members of his family coming to her defence trying to tell me it was harmless and she just needed time, that it wasn't hurting anyone...I strongly disagree on this matter, it's not healthy for her or my daughter am I the asshole for pushing on this matter?  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Other facts: -haven’t been sick since winter 2018.  -haven’t worn a mask since May 2021.  -I’ve been around lots of people throughout the entire pandemic -two cross country road trips in 2021 -haven’t washed my hands in years, besides after a messy poo (shit happens), or when working with food. -haven’t used hand sanitizer in over a decade  Where the hell is this thing and when is it going to put me out of my misery, living in this dystopian nightmare?	existing	existing	[0.7375445  0.26245558]

Yes, but what if the father does want the child but the mother does? The father shouldn’t be force to provide for a child he had no way of denying. (After conception, I know you could use contraceptives. What I mean is if the mother doesn’t want the child she has/had abortion, but if the father doesn’t want the child he can’t abort the baby unless the mother also wants an abortion.)	removed	removed	[0.25773716 0.74226284]

I have a son who is almost 2 years old. We all know what mothers go through during pregnancy and child birth. When my wife was pregnant, I made her food every day. She ordered pre-packaged meals meant to help the baby grow that I prepared 2 to 3 times daily for about 12 weeks. I looked after her when she was unwell. I did the groceries, cooking, house cleaning, dishes, etc. I gave her massages wherever she felt sore or just to help her relax. I did what I could to take the burden off her. All this while studying full time and working part time to make ends meet. It was physically and mentally exhausting, but I did what I had to do because that was ***my*** role.  I'm sure most men do this for their partners and it is almost always overlooked. All my female friends say "*she had to carry the baby so she has more rights*". I don't like this since it undermines my efforts. I didn't carry my son for 9 months, but I did my best to ensure they were both looked after. My wife and I both suffered and endured in different ways, and we both love our son equally.	existing	existing	[0.8485685  0.15143149]

Yes. The Russian revolution, the Soviet Union, Stalin, eastern European socialism… all that was a massive propaganda campaign running decades long to smear socialism.  Tbf, there has been propaganda for sure, but it hasn’t been 1 way only. An entire generation of intellectuals in the interwar period as well as right after ww2, were socialists. People like Oppenheimer, for instance. How could they not be? They witnessed the great Depression, and they hoped to build a better world.   It was the reality of socialist life in the Soviet Union, and many years later the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that changed their minds. Socialism became a dirty word.   Sure enough, we are in an era similar to the 1920s, with great income disparity, injustice, upheaval. So it’s not surprising that socialism is fashionable again. “We’ve never tried it,” right?	removed	removed	[0.23583111 0.7641689 ]

Hitler saw himself as German, being a ‘pan-German’ Austrian, with German parentage, he was ideologically allied to the German state, whilst he looked down on the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungarian empire (having lived in Vienna, which was particularly multi-ethnic).  He was however in Munich when war broke out, and signed up to the German army. He lied on his application, and the checks were not very thorough (they wanted as many as possible to sign up, as you can imagine). He had even dodged national service in Austria in the month preceding, and was wanted by Austrian authorities for doing so, but he soon disappeared amid the millions of others on western front.	removed	removed	[0.33717236 0.6628277 ]

I've been there.  Ex was extremely emotionally, verbally, and financially abusive. Guess what? Nobody knew. My parents had a small idea as they witnessed some of our arguments. But even they were blown away by just how bad it was.  I was so depressed because of him that I thought the only way out was by me not being alive. Luckily, I reached out to my dad one night when those thoughts got more intense. I told him everything and he helped me start making a game plan to get out.  My ex still has a lot of people fooled. Sometimes the mask breaks and people see him for who he really is. Narcissists are scary.

I am interested in this as well.  I am living the part of Indiana jones where they box up the lost ark and put it into storage.  I am working on a daughters of the American revolution book on for the 250 anniversary of American revolution (2026) my chapter is working on a book that Is what happened to our area (we have a French and Indian war fort) during the revolution. So we are explaining what happened after the French and Indian war, to make this more confusing the records call this American rev war Fort the same name as the British fort.   Basically its an ego trip of 2 women especially. I am sitting there with several more 20 somethings as the assistants.   they are looking for a powder horn that someone found and donated to Fort X (its French and Indian) its carved with Fort X with date 1776 so its actually the American revolution fort. with an etching of a fort on it. literally has the name of it.  Long story short Fort X left it go on display at another museum so my team is contacting 4 other places to find out where is Fort X (still owns it) powder horn. I swear we are going to these musueum and look into their storage ourselves.  I have told people and all they said was we do not work for a newspaper like I want to write a fantasy story. I wish.

I've tried to express this to people numerous times.  I'm from California, lived in the bay area and southern California.  $20 is still $20 for the most part, but when you start looking at the cost of living 100k isn't really a lot.  Like, it's enough to be comfortable, but you aren't going to be buying a house with that.    And everyone saying "Just move to not-california where it's a lot cheaper".  That's actually a lot harder than people realize.  As soon as you move out you are going to be makinng less money, which means moving back would be hard, and I love California.  Also, there aren't a lot of jobs for someone like me just randomly scattered through the country, I don't have a huge amount of "work from home" options in my field.  Like, I have a lot of options to do some work from home, but I need to be close to the lab/office so I can still go in.  Also, I would probably get depressed living in a super flat, not much to do region.  I know everywhere offers something, but, there honestly just isn't going to be much for me in Kansas.  I like where I live, it's pretty fucking expensive, especially because of how close to the ocean I want to live, which still is like a mile away, and it's shitty, but the weather is mostly good so I don't need a hhouse with a ton of beneficial things to it.    Like, I would prefer to make ~500k where I live now, especially if I was starting a family.  100k is enough, but it's stretching things thin and giving up a lot, 250k is on the lower end of house buying power around here, but I think that would be fairly comfortable, and a decent bench mark.  We can take buying a house out of consideration for this argument, because while I do want to buy, the market is pretty fucking skewed right now, which, might change in the future, but it also might not.	removed	existing	[0.76567703 0.234323  ]

That is incorrect. Everything from that example to the bill of rights itself is a government regulation.

Yes, but there's also what happens to me: I speak 4 romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portugues). This means that I can understand almost  Catalan pretty well.

Example:  Catalan: *Aquest edifici és la meva residència.* Italian: *Quel palazzo è la mia residenza.* French: *Ce bâtiment est ma residence.* Spanish: *Ese edificio es mia residencia.* Portuguese: *Aquele edifício é a minha residência.*  So when I encounter the Catalan sentence, it is pretty easy to understand; but how could I guess which mangled version from which language becomes the corresponding Catalan word, had I not seen it before?	removed	existing	[0.89288557 0.10711441]

You can, at least partially. This is usually what mineral supplements do. For example iron supplements given to women on their period or people donating blood among other thing is not much more then rusted iron. And animals do have an instinct of eating dirt or licking rocks when they are suffering from mineral deficiency. However it is not that simple. It is not enough to just get the minerals into the body but they often need to be chemically bonded to the right elements in the right way to make the molecules we need. And although we can do this ourselves, at least for most chemicals, we are more tuned to getting these mineral containing chemicals through our digestive system. Plants, bacteria and fungi is much better at binding these minerals into usable forms.  Although not quite a mineral the most known such element is nitrogen. It makes up 78% of our atmosphere in its elemental form. However there is no way for us to convert it into compounds usable to our biological process such as nitrate. Even plants struggle with this and have symbiotic relationships with bacteria and fungi to fixate the nitrogen from the air into nitrate which is used for almost every biological molecule. And although not to the same extent a lot of minerals are the same way.	existing	existing	[0.90387684 0.0961232 ]

Ohhh boy, I have a spare who barked similar health issues and has said similar things about therapy. Granted, there are therapists who are not good at their jobs. There is also a need to have a good therapist-patient fit and rapport. However, if he's convinced therapy won't help - based on a single experience - then he's basically saying he's unwilling to try to be better.  There are lots of kinds of therapy. If he's had one experience, he hasn't exhausted this as an avenue. He *just doesn't want to do the hard work.* Therapy isn't easy. It's not taking a pill. It's WORK, which I think could be the issue for both of our partners.   I finally asked my partner what goals he's had in therapy and there have been none. Good therapy should have goals. Developing coping skills for depression and anxiety, learning to build meaningful routines, helping you to reframe issues so they're workable, etc. Or if they've had post trauma, helping to get to a place where their trauma response isn't taking over their life.   I wouldn't fault you for waking away at this point. I wouldn't fault you for trying to salvage it. What I personally need to see is *effort* and progress, but everyone is different. Even with his mental health issues, my partner wouldn't leave our child in filth to take a nap. It is ok for you to have needs. It is ok for you to have standards and boundaries. You are not responsible for his actions or for saving him. You are responsible for making sure your children have a safe caregiver and right now that's not him.   I wish you luck OP.

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They’ll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape. Not to mention,   > Domestic violence is more common than any other health problem among women during pregnancy.   https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy  I sincerely hope I don’t get banned for posting this link. I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety.

It's a combination of factors; pre-made sculptural elements are very cheap but it is difficult to make them work naturally within a space. Either you dedicate yourself to picking features that all blend together in a coherent historical style (which would just be a revival) or you try and blend different elements at the risk of looking "tacky". Custom sculptural elements can look quite beautiful, but doing custom stonework/woodwork is significantly more expensive now than it was 100 years ago.  I've done a cursory search and the closest thing I can find to "modern" gargoyles comes from the Art Deco period.

That's not correct, it's not an equilibrium distribution. In fact, as the kappa factor approaches 3/2, it becomes "anti-equilibrium", and as kappa approaches infinity, it becomes Maxwellian (which is equilrium).  They're used in Space physics, because they better model the high-energy tail that's caused by a lack of collisions which generally mediate the energy transfer in a normal gas and which generally bring it back to Maxwellian. Think of it as a Maxwellian with one more variable in it, so instead of just (n, T), you have (n, T, kappa) allowing you to define the possible distributions.

People who won't have to carry or birth a child either pretending or do not know the physical, emotional and economic toll of being pregnant and giving birth.

(Not a top-level answer ...)  Most of the answers here seem to be guilty of "resulting," i.e. judging a decision by its actual outcome, rather than by the reality of the time.   The reality of the late 1930s is that Japan, a nation with few natural resources and reliant on imports, was in a near economic blockade by the US and other great powers. They had to do *something*, and after [losing to the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol), decided to instead to fight the US. Was Japan favored to win? Perhaps not. Could they conceivably have won, and would they have prospered from winning? Yes. Were there other alternatives to going to war? Maybe - I'm sure professional historians argue about this.

And despite all this exposure to all forms of Western democracy, satisfaction with the CPC has *increased*. Scientists and professionals that have been living in the US for decades are now moving *back.* That should tell you something. From my own personal experience, people there are not expressing satisfaction simply because they have no other choice. That doesn't even really make any sense. Are you saying that Chinese people don't know what's good for them? That's infantilizing and racist.

Depending on the legal system, you could be guilty on paper for murder. By pulling the lever, you chose to kill and act upon that choice. That meets the definition of murder.   In many places, justification is a valid legal defense. Justification is when you commit a crime in order to avoid a larger wrong. From example, if you were lost in the woods and broke into someone's hunting cabin in order to avoid freezing during the winter, you could argue justification and be found not guilty of a crime. However, justification often does not apply to murder. The law may say that a person is never justified in committing murder, so a person would in theory not be justified in killing one person to save others.  All that being said, laws are not automatic and you have to consider the extra-legal human factor. Let's say that you pull the level, the following may happen:  * The police do not file a report * The Crown/state chooses not to prosecute * The Crown/state charges the person with the absolute most minor crime they can * The jury refuses to convict (jury nullification) * The judge gives the lightest possible sentences, and suspends it * The governor immediately pardons the person  So, although on paper is criminal and you could be charged and convicted of murder, there are many ways in which you could realistically escape that. [Gary Plauche](https://www.efootage.com/videos/90742/victims-father-shoots-attacker) is a good example of that. He straight up shot someone on video; he should have been charged with murder in the first degree. However, the court sympathized with him and he got a seven year suspended sentence. So, what the law says and what the law does does not always intersect.	existing	existing	[0.7875266  0.21247344]

Feminism at first was a good thing. I would've even called myself a feminist if I was around back then. Women should have the right to vote and the right to stray from traditional gender roles.   I hate gender roles and stereotypes more then anything. A core reason I'm so against feminism is that they perpetuate negative stereotypes for men.

Maybe if feminism put a little more attention into breaking the negative stereotypes of men, rather than encouraging them, I'd be a lot less hostile.	existing	existing	[0.93407124 0.06592871]

speed of sound is greater in warmer air as warm air molecules have higher energy , due to high energy the molecules collide faster allowing the sound to propagate faster.

A fat guy will coast faster than a skinny guy, if that’s what your question is.   To simplify as best as I can. There are two main forces: Gravity making you go fast, wind resistance slowing you down. Being heavier = more force from gravity = more speed. But a fat guy will have more wind resistance than a skinny guy and while true, it’s not an equivalent relationship so net result is a higher terminal velocity, or simply, more speed. This is assuming both people are as aerodynamic as they can possibly be.   Now, to complicate things a little bit, wind resistance increases exponentially with speed and force from gravity doesn’t with increased mass. So at some point you need a whole lot more mass to make small increases in speed. Dunno at what speed that happens in a real life cycling situation tho.	removed	existing	[0.83506674 0.16493328]

For anarchists, they wish to immediately abolish the state. This is what most other leftist ideologies have a problem with, as it is quite utopian sounding.

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple.

There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.

id agree in normal times, but in this case the said +1 is obviously going to find the first excuse to run a tantrum at the wedding : she yells at OP everytime the attention goes on her and OBVIOUSLY the attention is going to go on her at *her own wedding*? so is it a dick move to not invite someone that openly and wildly insults you at any occasion they find? i dont think so. she totally lacks of respect and therefore is not entitled to respect in return.  BUT  the friend is apparently causing no issue, so it would be a dick move to not talk about it with him BEFORE the invitations go out, so that he doesnt discover it through a random mail. to just calmly explain him that for obvious reason his GF presence at the wedding is not wished and if he wishes to attend, he is more than welcomed, but it will have to be without her, and then he can make the choice with all cards in hands. if he's the cool guy OP describes, he should understand.  no one should have to handle hostility and insults at their wedding, its supposed to be the best day of your life and lots of ppl only got one.

It was poorly marketed and came out at an awkward time for a new console. PS1 and N64 had gained a strong foothold in the market.

Where did you learn this fun fact kid? Outside of some cases with gentic origin, literally no one knows what causes autism. I’m going to be overly sensitive on this one because you need to educate yourself.  If you tell that to your mother, you’re a giant clown. You honestly have no right to tell her or conclude that cigarettes caused his autism unless you have a peer reviewed research study with that as the conclusion….I looked it up for you https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5489536/#Abs1title - in summary, the super brilliant scientists could not correlate smoking to causing autism….but you magically can??  My oldest 2 are neurotypical and my youngest 2 are autistic. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs and neither does my SO.   If someone rolled up to me and said “you did such and such so it’s your fault they have autism.” They’d look like the world’s biggest assholes because they literally are.

One problem with the fertility thing - you can end up with two species that diverge in opposite directions from a centre one. Then the two divergent species can’t breed with each other, but both divergent species can still breed with the centre one.  I can’t think of a real example off the top of my head, so pretend this is true: Great Danes and Chihuahuas are too far apart to produce fertile offspring. However, they can both produce viable offspring with Golden Retrievers. (Again, I’m like 99.9% sure this specific example I’d false, but illustrates the point well.)	removed	removed	[0.3286466 0.6713534]

I don't care who is in power I believe that having an id in not asking too much to prove who you are to vote. How is it asking too much to prove who you are to take part in the most important part of our democratic elections?   So I will respond quickly to the point of popular vote vs electoral. The electorial college is/was great forethought by the founding of fathers, it allows for the smaller states to have a voice and not be ruled by the more populated ones. Having all federal elections controlled by 2or 3 larger states goes against all the ideals behind this great republic. The "fly over states" hold different values and deserve to have their voices heard as well.   The other roadblocks you mentioned, sound like a bit of hyperbole, but if you got proof for your claims then they need to be addressed. There should not be any foul play on either side. But there are plenty of blue states that have far more restricted voting access than the new Jim Crow 2.0 nonsense. And btw over 70% of people agree that voter id laws are fine. Blue states with no early voting, and red states like Georgia with over 2 weeks of early voting, including weekends.	existing	existing	[0.77942157 0.22057846]

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***  My husband (35) and I have been together for about 3 years now and married for 4 months. We are in an interracial marriage, him being white (German) and me black. We both speak English as our home language, however, his family speaks German as their first language.   I’ve gone on holidays with his family when we were dating and even stayed with his parents for two months before we purchased our house. Whenever I’ve been around his family the language spoken was 85% English and 15% German, I understand basic German words. For our first holiday as a married couple we decided to spend about 5 days with my family and 10 with his as his sister flew down especially for this holiday. Now the problem is that since we’ve been on holiday his family speaks 95% German and only 5% English on the dinner table, alienating me from the conversation.  I raised this with him and he said he’d fix it. Yesterday during dinner he started replying to his family in English, hoping they would also switch to English but this never happened, it was still 95% German. I lost my cool this morning when we were all having breakfast and his mom prayed in German, she mentioned everyone on the table except for me during the prayer. The conversation then proceeded to be 100% German with absolutely no English. I finished my breakfast, got up and went straight to pack my bags. My husband could tell that I was upset. I told him I’m going home to enjoy the last 7 days of my holiday in peace. He proceeded to say I’m overreacting & that everyone just forgets to switch to English, it’s not personal and he’s gonna fix it. He had 3 days to fix it and did nothing.   AITA for cutting the holidays short as my husband also left when I did. He’s now upset that we could have stayed and I should have told everyone how I feel.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I mean I guess that's true, but the dynamic between the Nazis and socialism is a far more diametrically opposed one while an antiimperialist government that actually serves its people in some respects should be critically supported by leftists, so using this comparison in this case is a bit harsh, rhetorically.  "No matter what classes, parties, individuals in an oppressed nation join the revolution, and no matter whether they are conscious of it, so long as they oppose imperialism, their revolution becomes part of the socialist world revolution and they become its allies." - Mao  I'd argue Syria is both oppressed and resisting imperialism, so this analysis feels applicable.	existing	removed	[0.38904625 0.61095375]

So privileged that we were equated to children? So privileged we didn't have basic rights like being able to vote, or work, or open a bank account, so privileged that our husbands were legally allowed to rape us, so priviledged that men literally thought women didn't orgasm, and that when women started showing signs of mental illness from being treated like shit and literally going insane from being stir crazy, they assumed it was hysteria and put them in mental hospitals.

> They feel like they should be entirely within the scope, given the person that provoked it.  Sure, if you really want to.  > Like, we both agree that you should be able to post child porn on twitter, right? Or direct threats? What about gore videos and the like? Doxxing?  Child porn and direct threats all also be illegal in the mouth-moving-noise-making form of speech. Doxxing usually would be as well since in context it's usually a direct threat or an incitement to commit violence. Gore videos are mostly allowed on Twitter. So these are some poor examples.  What I'm thinking of is something more akin to the existing legal concept of "protected classes" of people. For example, it's already illegal for a business to ban all black people, because black people are a protected class. But it's not illegal for a business to ban all tall people (except in Michigan as it turns out). What I'm proposing would be similar, e.g. some forms of speech, lets say "criticism of the government" would a "protected speech class" and sites would not be allowed to ban it. But a site could still, for example, be a knitting forum and ban "all non-knitting discussion". This happens to include "criticism of the government", but that isn't a problem.  > Because to be clear, MTG was removed for repeatedly spreading dangerous medical misinformation during a pandemic. I'd argue that what she did is one of the most dangerous yet legally permissible forms of speech. There is a possibility that her stupidity or malice have led to actual deaths, which probably makes it worse than something like actual death threats, something I assume you'd agree twitter has a right to ban her.  I agree MTG should be banned. Twitter did not go too far in this case, but I think it has in other cases, and I think the concept of "Twitter going too far" in a banning has merit, and Twitter should be prevented from "going too far" for some definition for "too far" that is TBD.  > This is why I think the above is important. Because you're making what amounts to a slippery slope argument, but your starting point is "Famously ignorant and racist congresswoman lies about deadly disease". > > I don't think anyone would particularly disagree with the idea that there should be limitations on private platforms ability to arbitrarily restrict speech that is not to their benefit. If twitter and Facebook started banning all the lefty politicians who criticize them, I think that would be horrific and might be worthy of some sort of reform. >  > But you're using a hypothetical future danger to excuse us permitting actual real and present dangers. >  > In the status quo, Facebook, Twitter, and Google would be within their rights to accept the money and do as requested, but to me that sounds like a terrible situation and I don't think they should have the right to do that. >  > This isn't deplatforming. Not really. >  > More to the point, this is again an example of the extreme disconnect between your fears and reality. You're afraid that one day these platforms might restrict meaningful public information ( which is unlikely, given that they probably benefit more from sharing it than they would from the public backlash when it is inevitably revealed that they buried it for money, people can't keep secrets for shit). But this isn't what happens. >  > The reality of deplatforming is a bunch of nazi fucks want to incite violence and spread dangerous misinformation, and those platforms jump through hoop after hoop to try and let them keep doing it, until at last one of them does something so egregious that they have to do something. >  > MTG was on her 5th suspension for spreading medical misinformation related to an ongoing pandemic. They bent over ass backward to let her keep threatening her coworkers on twitter, or talking about jewish space lasers or whatever other dumb shit she wanted to say. But eventually it becomes more of an embarassment than it is worth.  I admit, I've been thinking about posting this CMV for awhile and deliberately timed it for when there was a relevant event still in the news cycle in the hopes that I would get more discussion this way. I don't actually think MTG should be unbanned, I do actually think some people should be unbanned.	existing	existing	[0.5677825  0.43221748]

Why are opioids not used more in psychiatry?  As a patient with both chronic pain and depression, I noticed that a low opioid dose completely eliminates pretty severe depression - for a short time. (After 1 - 4 months, the anti-depressing effect fades, even though it still works as a painkiller.)  Usage suggestion, just as a patient: Use for max. 4 weeks, while starting treatment with an anti-depressant. Then, the anti-depressant needs to "take over".  Obviously, this method has the same addiction potential as when used as a painkiller. So it would only be viable when closely monitored, no contraindication for opioids exists (e. g. addiction in the past), and only when the patient really, really can't make it through the next few weeks otherwise.  I did pretty much exactly that "by accident"; however made the mistake to keep taking the opioid long after the anti-depressant was effective, thus making withdrawal from the opioid unnecessarily unpleasant.	existing	existing	[0.7643947  0.23560527]

I've been there, and around the same time in our relationship. It takes a lot of looking inward and deciding who you really are, what your want, and what you see in your future.  There was a time I wasn't sure if I really loved my husband Bernie we got married. I didn't know if I was still with him because we had been together so long (7 years) and he was easy, or if I was with him because I really wanted to be. I never told him about this because I didn't rant to hurt his feelings. I thought long and hard, literally months, about what it was I really wanted, and if I really wanted him to be a part of it. Ultimately I decided yes. I couldn't ever imagine a scenario where he wasn't part of my life in the future. The thought of losing him was so painful. I really couldn't imagine life without him. That's when I realized that I really loved him deeply.    Now you may not come to that same decision. You may realize that they're not the one you want in your future. That you're too different now and you haven't grown into be people together. I think that has a lot to do with couples staying together so long. They grew up, and old, together. Sometimes as we grow we end up growing apart. It's just a fact if life that can occur. I'm not sure if any of this is really helpful to you, but I hope whatever the outcome is for you it's whatever you want.	existing	existing	[0.88559467 0.11440533]

If Ukraine requests help, the US has a moral obligation to help. A lot of people forget that after the breakup of the USSR, the newly independent Ukraine inherited the 3rd largest nuclear arsenal in the world. But instead of keeping the stockpile for deterrence, they signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum giving up everything in exchange for security assurances from the US, UK, and Russia.  If the US and UK don't back up their assurances, we can kiss goodbye any hope of a world free of nuclear weapons.

As this is a legal question it really depends on where you are as to what kinds of laws apply.  That said, most places don't have laws that impose a duty to help. Helping people in a dangerous situation can itself be dangerous, and usually the law won't force people to endanger themselves if they don't want to. It also isn't even guaranteed that the person knows what the lever does, so not pulling the lever is unlikely to get people in legal trouble.  Many jurisdictions also have laws that protect people making good-faith attempts to help. An example is someone rendering first aid to someone who is injured, the law wants people to feel safe providing medical aid instead of fearing they might bear legal responsibility for the outcome. A while back China lacked these kinds of protections and it was blamed for contributing to the culture of completely ignoring injured people.  Under the circumstances it seems unlikely you would be charged with anything because you would have a strong defense that you were trying to make the situation better. Ultimately of course the question of "could you be charged" is always "yes". You can be charged with anything at any time, there is no prerequisite of having any prayer of the prosecution winning to file the charges.	existing	existing	[0.8743699  0.12563004]

I'd add that they have to be carefully structured so that they take into account things like the length of the marriage (someone who stops working or sacrifices their career as part of the marriage gets increasingly more dependent on the earner, so they'd be entitled to more and more of the mutual wealth).  And if the marriage is very short, they'd get less of the wealth because they presumably can still have a career and earn money for themselves.  If you don't allow for the above, you'd increase the chances that the pre-nup will be voided for being unfair.	existing	existing	[0.91162866 0.08837137]
As a society have acknowledged the fact that males have high testosterone levels,  and women have low levels.  This leads to different mindsets around sex. Generally women want a commitment and love when have sex. Men are just happy to have sex.  Since girl students are not going to get commitment and love we see that they have been taken advantage of.

If you've ever survived an abusive relationship, you're tougher than millions of people who have never had to ever experience one.  I also hate how the term "narcissist" is just thrown around these days. It's pathologizing the abuser by giving them something that on the DSM rather than just calling abuse, abuse. It's also misused so now anyone with bad behavior is a "narcissist". Suddenly millions of people getting divorced are divorcing a "narcissist". Your ex cheated on you, suddenly that's abuse. Uhh, no... your ex was a scrote, but unless you have legitimately experienced abuse (coercive or physical), you have no idea how difficult it is to simply leave or what women have had to do to survive. Your ex abused you but was a "good dad"? No such thing. An abusive ex will use your children against you, will eventually abuse your female children, IS NEVER a good father.  One of my criticisms of lib fems is that they have used the terminology for toxic masculinity to suit men's agendas by weaponizing male feelings. So if a man tries to manipulate you by crying, you can't call it manipulation, because you're reinforcing toxic masculinity. No, actually that's just a toxic man using feminism against you.  And to bring this back to the OP's topic, the 13th steppers in AA, are just weaponizing the ideas of AA to take advantage of vulnerable women. They are in an environment where they get to share their deepest uncensored feelings and failings. Some of them will just lie about their intentions so they can find out a woman's weaknesses in order to manipulate them into sex.	existing	existing	[0.8960559  0.10394415]

Vaccinated & boosted people still get Covid. They also still spread it.   Majority of Americans are vaccinated and we’re the most vaccinated we’ve ever been but it’s not stopping Covid.   You only have a 1-5% chance of being hospitalized per CDC and less than 2% chance of dying from Covid per CDC.    The odds of getting hospitalized and dying are so small already.   So without the vaccine you have a 98.2% chance of living per CDC.  If you get vaccinated let say you get like 1% bump in protection against death so now 99% vs 98.2%. We know Vaccinated people have died so it’s not 100%.   Maybe it gives you 2-3% against hospitalization.   That’s pretty much it.   Vaccinated and boosted people still spread it. We are the most vaccinated we’ve ever been but cases are the highest.  The people really affected by Covid were the obese (3x more likely to end up in hospital) and the elderly.

Vikings avoided battles as much as they could, especially with the Franks due to their superior cavalry and weaponry. Instead they excelled in amphibious warfare. Danes did their best to achieve wealth through regular raiding without having to fight costly battles. They operated in small, independent war bands. They targeted soft targets, such as churches, abbeys and trading centres. They also struck towns when festivals and holidays were being celebrated for greater haul of treasure. For example, Danes raided Tours three days before the feast of Saint Martin in 1853. They also took political and ecclesiastical hostages and held them for ransom. This was all made possible by the use of narrow longships that were perfect for both sea and river voyages so were able to penetrate deeply into the Frankish interior. For example, a viking fleet rowed 210 miles up the Garonne river to Toulouse in 1844.  Therefore, the reason for their success was that viking bands were fast, adaptable and cleverly opportunistic. They were able to attack  where they knew the rewards were great and the defenses weak. They knew  when to fight and when to escape, when to approach by ship and when to  ride overland, when to accept tribute and when to plunder. Several groups of  vikings could band together quickly when needed and go their separate ways  when this served them better. Indeed, a warrior band could even take employment with a European ruler to stave off another viking band or to fight his  other enemies, even his own family members: “To Sigfrid and Gorm and their  accomplices he \[Charles the Fat in 882\] gave several thousand pounds of silver  and gold which he had seized from the treasury of St-Stephen at Metz and from  the resting-places of other saints, and he gave them permission to stay so that  they could go on ravaging a part of his cousin’s kingdom as they had before.”  One example of viking defeat against the Franks is oddly the one that ended in setting up Normandy: the Siege of Chartres (911). Here the vikings significantly outnumbered the Franks, but were defeated with notable loses. However, Charles the simple, King of West Francia, was looking for more permanent solution to the viking problem, so he offered Rollo and his companions land centred on Rouen in return for serving as a buffer against future viking raids up the river. Rollo and his companions gladly accepted, being cleverly opportunistic as usual. The viking rus themselves were badly defeated by the Byzantines in the battle of Arcadiopolis and battle of dorostopol.  And if we’re focusing on 11th century Normans, it has to be said that they were more likely French than viking by then, especially in Hastings.  >It is also interesting to note that few of the participating nobles in the Battle of Hastings were from the Cotentin Peninsula. Moreover, and none were reported to have supplied ships.This would suggest a clear demarcation between Lower Normandy and the Cotentin Peninsula. In part, this demarcation could reflect continued resentment of William’s rule within this region, insofar as the revolt of 1047 discussed earlier was in fact led by a prominent Cotentin lord. Still another trend which is of interest is the relationship between the nobles’ and knights’ origins and the relative density of early Viking settlement in the duchy. According to a map of settlement names, there was a high density of Viking settlers in the Cotentin Peninsula and the Pays de Caux region. It is in precisely these regions where fewer Norman combatants originated, as opposed to the Bessin region around Bayeux which had far fewer Viking settlement names and thus fewer descendants of viking settlers. Therefore, the Normans who fought at the Battle of Hastings were more likely to have possessed French than Viking/Nordic ancestry.  Of course, this is not to say that vikings were bad warriors. I don’t think anyone claims that, but they were not superior militarily to their enemies.  Sources:  Medieval Maritime Warfare, Charles D.Stanton  Viking tactics in West Francia, William E.

Like many places throughout Europe before the rise of Nationalism that followed the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon, countries were mostly formed of smaller regions loosely formed into a national identity. Before the revolution, France was separated into these regional identities. Most of these regions spoke languages that were based on the same family as French but had differences in accents, pronunciations, and even words.    These "langauges" would be things such as Picard, Burgundy, Alastian, Dauphiois, Bearnais, Bressan Champenois, Orléanais, ect. Totalling about 28 or so with some even sharing similar parts with German in regions bordering the German regions. The unification of the French under a common language started doing the revolution. Revolutionary Leaders such as Henri Grégoire reported that around 6 million Frenchmen didn't know the language and another 6 million or so could barely hold a conversation in it. Out of all the departments of France, only around sixth of them spoke French outside of Paris.   Part of Napoleon education policies in the Code Napoleon took steps to unify the population under one singular language as well. This happened through the outlawing of newspapers in regional dialects and the teaching of french in his new education system. This offers some irony as Napoleon famously had a hard grasp of the language himself and spoke with a thick accent due to his lineage and birth in Corsica, which language is closer to Italian. The need for unification under a language and common comprehension  was nessissary to properly rum an empire and military the size of Frances under Napoleon.    A good book that touches on the subject and is where some of my information comes from is Stuart Woolf's book Napoleon's Intergration of Europe.	removed	existing	[0.5755445  0.42445555]

Feminism doesn't really have clearly defined groups because one of the inherent traits of feminism is resistance to definition and a lack of self-awareness.     When this dichotomy first appeared in feminists there were individual feminist icons that took a clear side in the debate, but since then there hasn't really been an effort to "separate" the two "sides". You can see how they have done this with TERFs; where a large portion of feminist adherents kind of globally accepted that there needs to be a way to differentiate feminists who are pro-trans and anti-trans, but there hasn't really been the same effort for sex-positive vs sex-negative. Most of the differentiation happens *within* feminist circles as a way to discuss differences in opinion.  There are certainly ideas that blend the two concepts, and even in the act of that blending, you see different conclusions.      One example is female prostitutes should be free to do as they wish and their prostitution is legal, *however,* men who purchase sex from prostitutes should be criminalised. Female promiscuity and female sexuality are sacrosanct, but any man who dares to participate in aspects of it (namely the purchase of it) is a villain. Yes, this baffles me too.      On the other hand, one of the other stunning feats of mental gymnastics is that the difference between onlyfans and "objectification of women" is that onlyfans is an expression of the power of the individual, the woman engaging in it profits from it, and consents to it - whereas other places where the objectification of women occurs is subjugating the individual, etc, etc. So for these people, sexual objectification of women is wrong, unless the woman is directly profiting from it... from which the logical conclusion would be the act of sexual objectification isn't sinful in the first place - so what exactly are women liberating themselves from and how is sexual objectification harming women...? Yes, this also baffles me.	existing	existing	[0.9417979  0.05820213]

The answer is no. There is no such evidence, and there is nothing that even comes close to suggesting anything romantic between the two. The way Engels and Marx wrote to each other, was well within the norm for how men wrote to each other at that time. This idea that Marx and Engels should've had some homoerotic affair has no foundation in reality. Furthermore, compare Karl's letters to Jenny with his letters to Engels; Marx is far, _far_ more romantic and loving in those letters, writing poems, describing her beauty, his longing, and so-on, even in periods where they were separated in less than a month. To Engels, you find maybe a "Dearest Friend" or "Life-friend," normal forms of address among 19th century German friends. Maybe signed a "yours truly" or "your friend," but nothing nearly as loving as we see with Jenny. The same goes the other way around; Engels wrote to Marx well within what was acceptable for the 19th century gentleman of Engels' standing. In addition, Engels was a known to have little respect for marriage, and had plenty of extra-marital affairs with other women; something that was at odds with Marx's far more romantic ideas about love, and at times meant that Jenny Marx wouldn't talk to him, if he brought his mistress to the Marx's home.  On the story of the illegitimate child, I assume you're referring to the child of *Lenchen*, aka Helene Demuth, the Marx family housekeeper, and Friedrich Engels. There is nothing that proves that Karl Marx should be father of Friedrich Demuth, the child, and Engels himself claimed fathership. We also know that Lenchen and Engels were each others confidants, that Engels wasn't the type to stay within the confines of his marriage, and that the two, later in life, formed a professional couple, along with Lenchen moving to the Engels estate, to take on the position of housekeeper. I'm repeating myself here, but there is nothing that, in any way, supports the claim that Marx should be the father of Friedrich Demuth.   The final point I want to raise, is that the idea that Engels' (and Helene Demuth's) work with publishing _Capital_ should be an expression of some love, makes no sense. Engels and Marx were lifelong companions and comrades, they worked on many of their works together. It was only obvious, that Engels would organise and publish the two other volumes of _Capital_. To claim that it was an expression of love, would you also say that the young Karl Kautsky, who met Marx in London, had some feeling of romantic or sexual attraction towards the older Marx, since Kautsky was responsible for publishing _Theories of Surplus Value_?  ***  Sources:  III.

It shouldn’t be surprising that there are drugs that affect mood.  Alcohol increases dopamine in the brain, cocaine is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and even caffeine activates noradrenaline neurons and seems to affect the local release of dopamine. .    Serotonin is another neurotransmitter that impacts mood.  Apparently more serotonin in the synapse of brain neurons helps some people lift their mood or decrease anxiety.  Depression and anxiety are both examples of mood disorders.  SSRI’s have been shown to be effective treatments for mood disorders.  This doesn’t mean they help everyone.  There are treatment resistant individuals who may benefit from other treatments.  Finally, it’s widely accepted that SSRI’s work best in combination with therapy like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).	existing	removed	[0.36843094 0.6315691 ]

Great post but it was Split that should have James an award.   I personally thought Glass was very disappointing.   Ya it was cool to see Bruces Character and his son return but for him to die in a small puddle of water was a joke.  The actual ending seeing the society was interesting.   From seeing Unbreakable in the theatres so long ago (still one of the best trailers and concepts ever: how many times In your life have you been sick & beautifully shot w over 10 “Oner” scenes) to the underrated masterpiece of Split, Glass was just bad. Very disappointing end to the trilogy.   I honestly can’t think of one good thing about the film. Ana Taylor Joy didn’t even seem like the same character.   I liked the opening. Ya. That first scene with father and son being superheros with the son being the Guy In The Chair was cool.   Downhill from there.	existing	existing	[0.59615296 0.40384704]

You've got some really interesting and refreshing points around fairness and representation of different races and how POC simplifies issues and actually potentially makes some people invisible.  However, the term POC is not racist against white people. What a better point here would be is how skin colour is a spectrum and there are white POC who are invisible. Ultimately generalising everyone as white or not white is not entirely helpful.  American race issues are much deeper than those which run in the rest of the world. Racism and inequality exist everywhere but US influence of the rest of the world further perpetuates issues and doesn't consider nuances of different cultures.  It also could prevent change in other issues such as how different races receive racism and discrimination from not just white people.	existing	existing	[0.9194025  0.08059754]

> You don't need an NFT to do what Square Enix is doing.   You are absolutely right that you don't need NFTs to have unique items or anything like that.   You are also right, it's absolutely possible to keep track of all these things in a traditional database model, be it SQL or NOSQL, or something custom.  That's not really in question.  The thing is, those databases still need to be controlled by the company, and generally run on hardware via resources owned or rented by the company.  The biggest expense in running an MMO is the data center, power and cooling are huge expenses. The Amazon MMO ran in AWS.  That is a massive expense for amazon, and even more massive expense for some other company to rent that from amazon.  > They are doing it for the attention and that is what people are mad at. They are doing NFTs because they know they will get outrage and news attention so that they get more people talking about their game and keeping it in the front of conversation in the MMO industry.   I tend to not hold much stock when someone suggests that an individual is doing something "For attention"  - but it's absolutely true that companies will do that.  Is that what is going on here?   I dunno.  If we look at the problems with FFXIV (i'm an active player, and a wow refugee) - lack of hardware resources caused congestion.  Each MMO user has a computer capable of a lot of things, leveraging that seems to be a major gold that solves a major issue with the business and with the technology. But security is a huge concern - a distributed client can be compromised. The underlying technologies could be part of a way to offload the datacenter expense onto the user, and I can totally see an MMO developer being very excited about these technologies.  The attention aspect doesn't feel compelling because the timing is wrong.    They don't really need to keep this trending, the game is so popular that they not only stopped stales, they even stopped advertising too. If this was a coordinated effort to generate marketing buzz, i think it would wait until some period of time when endwalker was less popular and they opened up sales of the game and started allowing new players.	existing	existing	[0.9389158  0.06108415]

Great questions!  German Western reenactors before 1939 commonly developed roles play around both white cowboy and Native roles or *personas;* the first generations of Western reenactors were often inspired by, and were fans of the novels of Karl May.  In West Germany, they continued to do so after 1945.  Indeed, in West Germany reenactors diversified their white roles, developing reenactment as fur trappers, mountain men, etc.  In East Germany after 1948, the fundamental problem with both May's novels and Western role reenactment was they were set in the United States, which was the opponent of the Soviet Union.  Karl May's stories were set in a time and place that East German authorities took a dim view of; stories that celebrated American characters and settings were thus very politically sticky in East Germany.  East German authorities did not allow May's novels to be republished in East Germany until the 1980s, and they could not be imported.  Thousands of East Germans did own copies already, however, and passed them from person to person.  And the Western reenacters applied for permission to refound their clubs and continue their hobbies.  When they first applied, East German reenactors ran into some resistance from authorities, who were taken aback by role play set in the United States.  Authorities suggested to reenactors who lived near Dresden that they might do better to study and recreate the lifestyles of Indigenous peoples in Siberia, who (under the leadership of Stalin) were allegedly marching towards a better future. But East German hobbyists persisted in their focus on the American West, and ultimately got permission to resume their hobby, as a sort of ethnological research on North American Indigenous cultures.    Cowboy role play did not fit well into this rationale, and in order to avoid pressure from the secret police, East German hobbyists gradually dropped the white Western roles, and focused only on the reenactment of Indigenous cultures and roles.  Some older members persisted in performing cowboy roles in private; "after it got dark," some recalled later, "we would take off the feather headdresses and put on the cowboy hats."  But the East German secret police confiscated their revolvers (seen as important for any cowboy role play) and raided their clubs.  Gradually, East German hobbyists dropped the cowboy role play, and became widely accepted by East German authorities, when they gave public performances or demonstrations in their Indigenous roles. As far as I was able to determine, these East German reenactors came from all walks of life in East Germany; involvement in clubs was seen by many of them as an escape daily life in East Germany.	existing	existing	[0.87534416 0.12465582]

I’d say that initially this doesn’t seem like such a bad idea, but the thing is, this paper misses two really crucial things. Those things being that consent can be withdrawn anytime and neither the man or woman using contraception. As far as consent goes, I know a lot of times people in here like to just claim that women will change their mind afterwards, but that’s not the case a lot of times. Does it happen? Yes it unfortunately does. But a big problem is that people don’t understand consent isn’t a simple yes or no. I see that you have a checklist of activities and that’s a good start, but as I said earlier, consent can be revoked any time during the sexual act itself. This is because many times partners try something new and the other may find that it is not comfortable. If the other partner is comfortable with is, then there’s no problem, but if they find an activity physically painful and the other does not stop what they’re doing after being told to, then yeah that is classified as rape.   As for contraception, both men and women have been found to tamper with it. On this form, both partners could easily lie and say yes. And at the same time, contraception is is not 100% effective especially if used the wrong way, so even if you do use contraception, getting pregnant isn’t necessarily a give away that holes were poked in the condom of that the pills weren’t taken.   Not saying that it isn’t a good thing to get consent written down, but when it comes to one of the partners not stopping an activity that is harmful, then yeah that’s where this paper falls down hill.	existing	existing	[0.87974244 0.12025754]

So… you posted a link about hotter air and higher speed of sound then in the next sentence talk about hotter air being less dense than cooler air. Click the link please. The top of it talks about how IF PRESSURE IS CONSTANT this occurs. Yes ADDING heat to air causes it to expand and generally be less dense and rise etc. HOWEVER, if you added heat to air in a fixed size container it would heat up but the DENSITY would remain the same. Instead the PRESSURE would rise. There are many situations where you could have air at different DENSITY but the same TEMPERATURE. DENSITY does not equal PRESSURE.  As to why it’s faster in hotter air I will leave that up to people with more knowledge than myself.	removed	existing	[0.882185   0.11781501]
I've had to redo this reply many times to try and be succinct. I'm not going to get into a useless debate about why Christianity and what the Bible says is reality with you. I'm only interested in the people who are open-minded enough and most of the way there already. It's an exercise in futility to try to convince someone that their worldview is completely wrong on Reddit. This is many years of experience talking with many different accounts. If you're of the understanding that conspiracy is really just trying to discover truth and we live in a world of lies and that it all points to something bigger which is good versus evil then I'll talk to you about Jesus but if you're not there already if you don't already have a good idea that that's what this is really all about there's no point in me trying to convince you. I have your best interests at heart, I hope you come to the realization that Jesus is the only way to heaven and that hell is a real place the Bible is a guidebook on how to get from this life to the next but I'm definitely not going to have a debate about why I think Christianity is right I'll just tell you this. God talk to me and not in the way most people would say that they heard from God but in an actual that was unlike anything I had ever experienced in my 50 something years on this planet and it was in a direct response to a question I had asked him. If you haven't had an experience on this kind of level I don't know what to tell you honestly but you'll never find him unless you seek him he'll never reveal himself to you unless you're willing to accept the possibility that you could be wrong and that the Bible is right and that he is God I don't know I'm just dictating into my phone and I hope that one day we can talk in heaven.

SoS approval rating means nothing for approval rating as a presidential candidate.  And the Right vilified her entirely, often for misogynistic reasons which is terrible.  Plenty of the Left and independents didn't like her either a wide variety of reasons.  And the emails are actually an issue. It reeks of political elitism and entitlement in the vein of "rules for thee, none for me". NO ONE is any administration should be using a private email address or a private email server to do state business. The government literally has whole departments to run those things for very specific reasons. Trump's people who immediately did the same thing (and Colin Powell before Clinton) should all be scrutinized equally for the same issue -- a national security one.  And her glib response about "wiping it with a cloth" just show how little importance she put on the issue, which again, is a real national security issue, especially for a top level official like SoS that WOULD be the target for cyberattacks.	existing	existing	[0.6876475  0.31235245]

YTA. A huge, huge asshole that I hope he breaks up with. It's a pretty common habit for people to cry when they find out their loved ones (yes, including their pets) have cancer. I'd be more concerned if someone heard shocking news like that and went about with their lives without even a tiny bit of shock or sadness. He's allowed to cry, he literally just got the news and barely had the time to brace it or process it. You think people don't cry in hospitals? You're the more embarassing one for not comforting him during such a low period in his life. Medical staff are used to people sobbing in front of them  when their loved ones and pets have terminal illnesses.	existing	existing	[0.9276134  0.07238664]

This will undoubtedly sound callous, but I don't care, at least any more than I care about deaths from any other cause. Life happens, and death happens as a part of it. The "if it saves one life" mantra is unrealistic and downright irresponsible when factored against economically depressing effects and quality of life degradation for hundreds of millions of people.  Cardiovascular disease is on track to have killed, in 2021 alone, almost as many Americans as died of Covid ("with" Covid? "of" Covid? Will we ever get honest numbers?) in 2020 and 2021. Where is the outrage? I continue to challenge anyone who purports to care about raw numbers of American deaths: Where have you been for the last few decades of our citizens eating themselves to death? And why do you think that a government which watched fitness and nutrition related medical disasters unfold for decades is starting to just now adopt a policy of "if it saves one life"?	existing	existing	[0.65632766 0.34367228]

>I thought the original thing was that arguing for systemic racism etc was reaching?  Yeah so one of the things I have realized from this thread (this exchange with you, as well as a few others) is that some people think the things I am describing fall under the definition of systemic racism. If you are going to define systemic racism to include "any problem created by racism", then I do believe systemic racism is a problem. I just find that definition to be so broad and unspecific to the point of being useless.  The funny thing I find is that everyone who is a believer of "systemic racism" as a widespread problem think that their definition is the correct one and in fact the only generally accepted definition. In reality there are multiple widely accepted definitions. I also find that people tend to move the goalposts a lot. I think words matter and I think the rhetoric we use in discussing these problems is one of the many obstacles to actually solving some of them.  >You can't blame racism in the past that causes the problem and admit the problem persists into the present without explaining why the problem persists.  "Admit the problem persist"? I am the one who from the beginning said this was a present day problem. You seem to be under the impression that I am trying to play some sort of "trick".  I think I see an important difference of opinion. You seem to think that if phenomenon A creates problem B, and problem B still exists, that must mean phenomenon A is still happening. To me it is quite obvious that a problem can persist long beyond the phenomenon that created it.  > If it persists into the future then eventually you are invoking A) to explain why the problem hasn't gone away or continues to exist.  Another fundamental difference here. You seem to think that if a cultural problem exists, there must be a problem with the people of that culture. I disagree. I think any race or group of people subjected to those conditions would likely find the same problems emerge within their culture. Proposition A is incorrect. There is nothing inherently wrong with black people that causes this counter culture to persist. If this counter culture emerged in any group of people, it would likely persist beyond the phenomenon that started it without a motivating force to change it.  >If the counter culture is the fault of racism in schools then when did that ever stop? .... Back to original my question in a way. When did it stop. You blame racism faced in schools post-integration for this "counter-culture." When did that stop exactly?  I answered this already and it seems you didn't acknowledge my answer so I will try in different words. Racism has not "stopped" it is just far less prevalent in society. Therefore there is not an exact date I can give you to answer this question. Here is a very oversimplified description of the trajectory. At one point, the vast majority of port-integration schools were very racist. Over time the racism in most schools reduced. The pace of this reduction was different in every school. There is no "exact" date when racism "stopped". Today, black students will not receive racist treatment in most schools. There are some schools where there is some racist treatment. As in the school might have one or two racist teachers or a few racist students so the harm is limited in scope and scale. Then there are some students with high levels of racism. As in many racist faculty members, many racist students, creating an environment hostile to black students. I would place the number of schools in this third category in a small minority. I don't have exact numbers for you but I also dont have any concrete data to suggest that racism in schools today is more widespread than I describe.  I have answered your question. Please help me understand your view by answering some of mine.  1.) Do you believe the counter culture that I describe exists?  2.) If yes, do you believe this counter culture has a real impact on academic outcomes?  3.) If yes to #1, do you believe that this counterculture could persist in any particular group of people across multiple generations beyond the influence that started it?  4.) Do you have specific examples of ways our academic system is shaped that that prevents black people from receiving value from it? Can you give specific examples for what should be done differently?  You seem to be under the impression that my goal here is to blame black people. If you actually read my posts you would see that is clearly not the case. I am blaming racism for creating these problems and I don't make any claim about who is to blame for the problems persisting. I agree that there are things the school system can do to address the problem. If we recognize this counter culture to be a problem, for instance, outreach programs by the school could be one tool to help shift the culture.  >If there is a counter-culture racism created it.  We agree there.	existing	existing	[0.6540915  0.34590852]

The old safe crackers poured nitroglycerin into the crack around the door of the safe(on older models), and then detonated it to blow the door off.   But, you couldn't just go out and get nitro at the hardware store because it was too unstable to store or transport. But, what you could buy at the hardware store was dynamite.   Dynamite was just nitroglycerin stabilized (originally) with things like sawdust or coal dust. If you then boiled the dynamite, the nitroglycerin would float to the top. It was yellow and thickish, and looked like grease in top of a soup pot. The safe crackers would then spoon off the nitro and bottle it, and use it on their next couple of safes.	existing	removed	[0.14590678 0.8540932 ]

Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	removed	existing	[0.6172677 0.3827323]
If they are getting paid in stock they are being tax on the value of those stocks when they receive them but what they are not getting taxed on is the growth of the value in those stocks over time, that is until they sell them, but the tax on the sale of stock is called capital gains and it is distinct from the income tax. The capital gains tax is only levied on the difference between the purchase price of the stock and the selling price, because they already paid tax on the purchase price as a form of income in the beginning on this paragraph.   The reason they can borrow against the value of these stocks is that both they and the bank giving the loan are reasonably sure that the value of the stock will be going up so neither they or the bank thinks the value of the loan will be higher than the asset backing up the loan, much like a mortgage but the risk is a bit higher than a mortgage since stocks are more volatile than real estate. It is much like as if somebody gets paid in houses and then gets mortgages to pay their living expenses, and then gradually sells the houses at a later date when they have increased in value far beyond what they were worth when it was given to them as payment.  The reason they are doing this now is precisely as you said interest rates are historically low, not only because they are rich and so are considered less risky to loan money too, but also because the general interest rate for everyone is low.  How they pay back the loan is either by getting paid in more stock (which they will get income taxed on) and using that stock to borrow more money to pay the interest, or they can sell some of the stock (and pay capital gains tax on the increase in the price) to pay back the loan plus the interest. they can do this because as I said the value of the stock goes up. Thus you can view it as only really needing to pay taxes on the portion of their capital gains which is necessary to pay the interest on the loans they are using to cover their expenses.   This trick can keep going as long as interest rates are low enough that this isn't a big deal. At a 5% interest rate the compound interest only results in a doubling of the loan every 14 years so if the stock doubles within 14 years while paying a 5% interest rate this can be economically. However you also have to account for the capital gains which will reduce the after tax gains, so lets say if the stock doubles and you sell you might only keep 50% of the gain, so instead of needing it to double in 14 years to cover 5% interest you might need it to triple in 14 years (as it is the gain which is taxed, not the full value. A 200% gain is tripling, cutting half the gain leaves you with double), perhaps only Bezos with his amazon stock can do that consistently. At a 2% interest rate a loan doubles in 35 years so even if 50% of the gain is taxed you might only need it to triple it in 35 years which is much more doable.	existing	existing	[0.9342203  0.06577968]

>The media is still falsely placing the current rise in cases at the feet of “uneducated white President Trump supporters"  You're right that we don't have data to support this beyond looking at relative vaccination rates broken down by voting preference.  But that data is rather clear that vaccination rates are lower in areas where Trump won more votes.  My anecdotal experience is one where 100% of the people I know who are anti-vaccination are Trump supporters.  I do know a few people who are simply "hesitant" and they're not necessarily Trump supporters, but they are members of evangelical churches who are feeding them anti-vaccination rhetoric.  I'm not saying there are no anti-vax folks on the left - but there are WAY more on the right...  That being said, I sort of agree with your basic premise (I think) that the messaging and communication has been a mess from the start, and that can be laid at the feet of all politicians, the media, and the CDC/NIH.  I don't think they were prepared to produce content that would speak to the conspiracy-minded or authority-skeptical.  I think they should have funded RCTs into HCQ and Ivermectin - even if not warranted scientifically, but so that it could be used to counter the misinformation being put out by others.	existing	existing	[0.6785614  0.32143858]

>What is it that's "not really"? what argument or statement in my reply are you responding to?   The last sentence. "We gonna have to apply the same logic to Buddhists, to Hindus, to Jainists, to Taoists etc..." I thought it was obvious, because that's the bulk of what I'm replying to.  >Second of all, there is no such thing as some religions are just religions. All religions are just religions.  You very blatantly have read my comment in a line by line way, where you tried to find a way to disagree with each line, instead of taking my whole argument as it was. It's pretty discouraging to write a comment you think is thoughtful, and to have the other person try to dissect it instead of understand it.  I'll make it simple for you.  1)There is a claim: "you can't be racist against Muslims because Islam is not a race".  2) Being 'racialised' is when your differences are treated as innate, important, and as a reason to treat you differently to others. That's just what the word means. We look at people with different skin colours and say that's a 'different race' but we don't do the same with hair colour, even though both have a visual genetic component.  3) People who are 'visibily' Muslim (women who were headgear) are treated in much the same way as a hated racial group. Islam is being 'racialised'.  >Muslims and Jewish are not religions, these are members of religions. Islam and Judaism are religions, and these religions can never turn into races. They have scriptures, rituals, and a set of beliefs. All of which has nothing to do with the definition of a human race.  None of this matters. Not a word of this is relevant.   >What do you mean by "systematic shitty deal"? And do you have any proof to support this claim?  Do you really think that an equitable society is the null hypothesis? Seems like I'm arguing with a useful idiot.

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately.

Body dysphoria. I had to read a whole chapter about body image and plastic surgery in relation to mental illness and overall happiness. Some of these included people who felt like their hand wasn't theirs and it actually brought them peace and happiness to get it amputated.

There's a very good reason that (from the outside looking in) there seems to be a lot of hypocrisy (and there is) in feminism around the subject of women's sexuality and promiscuity. I believe we have the emergence of onlyfans existing in stark contrast to all the efforts to crim the "sexual objectification of women" causing a large number of people to experience cognitive dissonance.      This dichotomy in feminism started around the 90s. The feminist ideologues (like Dworkin, Daly, Atkinson, de Beauvoir, Greer, MacKinnon, Bindel, Jeffreys, etc) had been busy describing "Tha Patriarchy" and all the ways in which women suffered under it, ^(supposedly.)     Pornography became one of the leading topics by the 90s, and this led to the split which could be essentially described as "sex-positive feminism" vs "anti-porn / sex-negative feminism."     The sex-positive side believes that sexual freedom is an essential component of women's freedom. They oppose legal or social efforts to control sexual activities between consenting adults. And that in doing so deliberately fight against the oppressive control of sexuality by, you guessed it, Tha Patriarchy.     The other side believes that female sexual promiscuity is an extension of male privilege, male dominance, and further promotes misogyny, rape, violence against women, so on and so forth, which is also Tha Patriarchy.   **This is actually a great example of showcasing how despite all the different feminist subgroups, the core ideology remains the same.**  Both sex-positive and the sex-negative/anti-porn feminists agree on the core tenets of feminism: that women are oppressed, and men are the ones oppressing them. *They just have different ideas on what the solution is.*	existing	existing	[0.9438246  0.05617538]

It is relevant in a number of ways.        Before answering your question, I am going to throw some statistics at you that will I hope help start making the connection between feminism and Jews.        Jews make up roughly 2% of the population in the US. In the UK, they make up 0.2% of the population, in France its roughly 1%, etc. Despite making up insignificant minorities in all of these countries where feminism was born and constructed then spread around the world, Jews form the majority of the founders, leaders and financiers of feminism.        Most of the founders of the feminist movement are Jewish: Betty Friedan, Robin Morgan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, Simone Veil, Mary Ellman etc. etc. Jews also played an important role in the early women's movement e.g. the Jewish League for Women Suffrage. They played an operative role in injecting in feminism its anti-Christian sentiments as well as many other Jewish ideas and principles.        All of the Marxist theorists who pushed the idea of feminism in the 1800s were Jewish, Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Mosses Hess. The founders of the feminist sexual revolution, that revolution that has spread sexual degeneracy across the globe were Jewish. Wilhelm Reich and Sigmund Freud the godfathers of the feminist sexual revolution were both Jewish.        Most of the most anti-male, radical feminists have been Jewish: Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Gayle Rubin, Elizabeth Gould Davis, Sally Miller Geaarhart etc. etc. etc.        There is clear correlation between Judaism and feminism, but what causes this correlation? Why, of all people, have Jews played a significant role in the formation and rise of the feminist movement?        The answer to this question is very simple.        Judaism is made up of many branches. The largest branches of Judaism are those of atheistic Jews (Jews that do not believe in God, but are born racially Jewish) and Reform Jews (Jews that believe in a liberal approach to interpreting Jewish texts).        Reform Judaism is the largest branch in Judaism followed by Atheistic Judaism. It is heavily influenced by Marxism, communism and feminism. Reform Judaism is essentially feminism in the form of a religious ideology. They believe in and promote the exact same ideas and principles as those of feminists. They believe in and promote the feminist interpretation of patriarchy, they believe in and promote the idea that gender is a social construct, that men have throughout the ages oppressed women, that sexuality is a social construct, that abortion is a right, that there is nothing wrong with sex outside of marriage, that consumption and production of pornography is normal etc. etc. etc. Reform Judaism, the largest branch of Judaism in the world, is feminism and feminism is Reform Judaism.        Judaism by the admission of some of the highest Jewish authorities in the world has played an operative role in the rise and spread of feminism. Take icon of Judaism and Professor of Government Sandy Meisel as an example. In this following citation he notes that Jews have led the feminist movement in America from the 1970s onwards.        ‘From the early 1960s, Jews served as advisers, political operatives congressional staffers, “idea men” and powers behind the throne. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Jews rose to political prominence in the civil rights and anti-Vietnams War movements. From the 1970s on, Jews led or were influential in most, though not all, of the political reform, feminist, consumer rights, gay rights, environmental and other public interest groups and related foundations and think tanks that came to dominate the Democratic Party.' Jews in American Politics, 2001.        I must note here that Judaism is a dogma that is unconventional. I would not even call it a religion, but a racist ideology. Let me elaborate on this. In Judaism, you don't have to believe in Judaism to be considered a Jew. In Judaism, so long as you have a matrilineal Jewish lineage i.e. you are born to a Jewish mother (note that Judaism is extremely matriarchal. It is from Judaism that feminism borrows many of its anti-male theories surrounding sexuality and gender etc), you are considered a Jew. In Judaism, you are considered a Jew so long as you are racially Jewish, even if you reject Judaism. Most Jewish sects also believe that they are a chosen people. All also promote the concept of racial nepotism, a concept that renders them extremely tribalistic i.e. they work together, regardless of their beliefs, to push and promote their own racial interests. Combine their radicalistic views and nepotism with their belief that they are a chosen people and they are rendered a racially supremacist ideology.        I have just touched briefly on this topic here. If anyone has any questions, ask.

It’s his first kid ever & mine as well. He disappeared for 4 months but ended up coming back. He said he wanted to try being a family & giving it another shot which we did. Then out of the blue says nevermind. Then after that he started to go out a lot & go clubbing. He has been the worst throughout the pregnancy. I think it was much easier him being a dead beat. Hes a bum. I’m always helping him with bills. Always helping him when he needs a hand. I’m always the one helping but never him. I’m 40 weeks pregnant & found out he was going out with girls & getting nudes from them while sleeping in my bed every night & me helping him. He never wants to help out when I ask. Never offers to do nice gestures while I’m pregnant. I told him before I don’t want his last name in my kids name & he got upset. Saying he doesn’t think it’s right. But I went through most of my pregnancy alone. Til this day he can’t act right. Also forgot to mention one night he was out clubbing & I spammed his phone telling him I’m going to the emergency room because how much pain I was in. He never came home & continued to party. He never even asked if I was okay. So Is it wrong to not put him on the baby’s last name?  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was the best idea they had at the time. Japan's overall mission was to make themselves self-sufficient. The Japanese home islands were poor in natural resources, so they needed to accumulate territory and the loot therein to make that possible. In the Pacific, that put them at odds with China, European colonial powers,  maybe the Soviet Union, and the United States. Of those, only the United States had the resources to come at Japan and attack because of their geopolitical landscape - they were safe on their own continent (they COULD get interested in Hitler but didn't HAVE to because there was an ocean of separation) and had the industrial capacity to strike if needed and keep the hits coming. The European powers wouldn't risk the bulk of their militaries in a colonial conflict when they had fascism and communism to worry about closer to home. The Soviet Union might have the motivation to fight back but not the logistical capacity - most of its factories were on the other side of the country (de facto the other side of the world) and linked by one rail line to their Pacific territories. China could fight back if attacked but didn't have the strike capacity to launch an attack on their own, and there was a civil war between Communists and Nationalists that would keep their eyes focused inward.  Japan never realistically entertained the notion that they could defeat the United States in a protracted war if it came to it. Their hope was that if they wiped out most of our strike capacity at the beginning of the war, it would end the war before it ever got rolling. They didn't think we had the willpower to rebuild an entire navy from scratch if they sank the bulk of what presently existed, that we didn't have the stamina and motivation to fight our way island-by-island across the entire Pacific Ocean, and that they could catch our carriers at port at Pearl - they were wrong on all counts. If we dropped out of the fight, the rest of the Pacific would have been theirs for the taking. If anyone else came back to take what was theirs, Japan would have a huge chunk of the world to defend and pull resources from to fight back.  Pearl Harbor looks like a bad idea because it was the beginning of a four year war that Japan was destined to lose almost as soon as it started. Risk/reward - the risk was that we'd get pissed and stay pissed long enough to finish the job, but the reward was about a third of the world. Pearl Harbor was intended to be the only major event of a war that started and ended in December 1941, and had it gone according to plan it would have been a brilliant plan.	removed	removed	[0.28650096 0.713499  ]

NTA. Also, don't be embarrassed by that, it seriously happens way more often than you might think.

You’re not wrong. CIA is well beyond our petty political rivalries in their achievements. They only care about the success of the organization, us, not so much. Also our politicians are actual terrorists. They actively vote for budgets and policies that terrorize poor nations, in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Their respective bases are fodder for their agenda, nothing more.   We are all more similar that we are different and that is our strength-if we can settle on who the real adversary is.	existing	existing	[0.79892826 0.20107166]
It's all about bodily autonomy. Babies with penises are their own people who deserve their own agency, therefore only they can decide what happens to their genitals. Foetuses, on the other hand, are essentially parasites, as they feed off the host (pregnant person) to survive. In that situation the decision falls to the pregnant person, as no one can be forced to donate their own body for the benefit of another.

What is wrong with this? FAFO. Use someone’s property as a tool? I’d give you a flat tire and call a tow truck for ya.   Growing up in a rural area, you better know when someone is on your property. Not only is it a liability if someone injures themselves on your property doing dumb shit like riding your trails on a atv/dirt bike, they could be there looking for trouble. I’ve had a crossbow shot at me when I was around 16, trying to tell a man to get off the property, turns out he was a poacher.   I have deep beliefs of if it’s someone I don’t know, on my property, they better have a warrant. If not, gtfo. I have a child now, and that has only amplified my beliefs, as well as paranoia. My dad could hear a pebble get stepped on in a dead sleep and he’d shoot up and grab his rifle and start searching.	existing	removed	[0.48699346 0.5130065 ]

How did you come to that conclusion?  Btw, everybody is misogynistic in one way or another. It's extremely difficult to not be in patriarchal societies.

This question is coming from a place with entirely the wrong assumptions about piracy. A lot of pirates/privateers were British. Our weather is definitely not 85F, wool is the fibre most readily available in a typical British port owing to our sheep farming and mercers, and disrobing is not encouraged in British culture, possibly because hypothermia is a constant threat in our North Atlantic climate. A woollen seacoat would be standard attire in the Royal Navy for centuries for a reason.  And a great many privateers were ex naval men.   Additionally temperatures at sea are typically less than at land- sailors in all history have tended to need warm clothing and wet weather gear because sailing the ocean is frequently chilly and wet.	removed	existing	[0.5655371  0.43446293]

In support of your point, it is important to remember that criticism of the armament of WWII tanks frequently boils down to comparing penetration values to the frontal armor of the heaviest German tanks. Given the proportion of German units who had zero tanks of any kind, and in fact would have been more or less recognizable to their forefathers in 1918, the HE rounds are important. And rather than worrying about Tiger II frontal armor, if a round can punch a Pz IV or Stug III, it can take on the vast majority of armored vehicles that would appear in their sights.	existing	removed	[0.45693573 0.54306424]

Do we not care or is it not worth the effort to stick our heads up and complain about it?  My whole comment is dedicated to "it's a racist slur and it's bad and it sucks that when people try and say it's bad they get shouted down".  But to the point of   > Wouldn’t it be up to white people to decide when racism against them is a problem?   Two questions immediately arise:  * How many white people have to say it's a problem for "white people to decide"?  Like if you had one white guy tell you it's a problem, is it a problem?  It seems like one of those easy handwaves like "If Native Americans have a problem with the team name, change it." but like okay how many have to have a problem?  * What exactly is step 2 for when white people decide it's a problem?  I think it's just one of those structural racist concepts.  You hate black people for being lazy, you hate Indians for being smelly, you hate Asians for being Chinese, you hate Italians for being loud, and you hate whites for being racist.  Nobody's ever going to "stop" and there's really nothing any of us can do about it.  It's too big.	existing	existing	[0.8883831  0.11161693]

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	removed	existing	[0.83785856 0.16214147]

Yes you are right. Two signals almost entirely corrects for it, three signals would correct even better. Check out [this link](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog862/node/1715) for more details.   The reason they don't is that dual signal correction already provides accuracy down to tens of centimeters. Most GPS applications don't require sub-millimeter accuracy.

I actually disagree slightly, and take it a step forward.   You should not be able to use your title as an introduction unless you are an expert in the specific field, many times even related fields are just BS.  For example:   * the average doctor/physician/MD knows very little about nutrition, but they use their MD degree to claim expertise in nutrition. (when usually they are just regurgitating what they read in "The Omnivore's Dilemma" or whatever) * noble prize winners in microeconomy using their noble prize status to comment on macroeconomic trends. These are very different areas, and leads to all those clickbait "NOBLE PRIZE ECONOMIST THINKS THE MARKET WILL CRASH TOMORROW". This is nothing but an "educated opinion"  Additionally, if you are going to use your title, make it very clear if what you are going to comment on is just your opinion as a PhD vs. actual research/knowledge/evidence you posses by being a PhD.  For example:  * "I am a child psychologist and I think the cry it out method is terrible for children". Then you ask oh, have you seen many traumatized children or is there research in outcomes of said children. "Oh no, I just think its terrible to let your child cry".

You should chill. Trans people aren't a threat to you. You're not being held at gunpoint, no one is threatening to force you to transition, you don't have to go to pride parades if you don't want to, you are free to have whatever beliefs you like and shit on people irrationally who have nothing to do with you. All good, don't expect LGBT people to like or tolerate you but by all means continue getting off on obsessing about minorities.  The least you could is treat trans people with the same respect you afford anyone else, hell even the same respect you afford dogs would still be a step up. That's not her name, she does not go by that name. Anyone can change their name, it has nothing to do with biology. She has also expressed that she identifies with womanhood and would like to be referred to with female pronouns. A lot of words to explain a very simple process by which you can show respect for her and her mental health.  No one is saying that chromosomes don't exist. No one is saying we can change all the chromosomes in the body. Kind of the whole point of being trans is having an identity that doesn't match how you were assigned and raised and feeling distress depression and discomfort with your body and how people perceive you. Plenty of other illnesses that have similar problems and you don't have much trouble respecting them. You don't insist on referring to married people by their maiden names just because "biologically your DNA is of the family you were born in so I outright refuse to change how I refer to you because its not scientific" even though that argument holds exactly the same principal to it.  If you won't afford people your basic respect, then your just showing your hand that you have no actual argument scientific or otherwise and are in fact just stubbornly continuing to dismiss people based on something you clearly don't understand. Maybe actually talk to a trans person, read the experiences of trans people, actually listen to them when they talk about how they feel. It really doesn't take much.	removed	removed	[0.2905116 0.7094884]

“Campists” are people who divide the world into imperialist vs anti-imperialist. Their perspective comes from the Cold War when everyone was forced to choose a side. So anything or anyone that’s opposing US Imperialism receives their critical support.  As opposed to, “Third Campists” who supported neither side in the Cold War, are highly critical of all sides & only support workers movements.  So the cons of campism included ending up supporting states like DPRK & China as well as Iran & Russia, etc. These places aren’t the most progressive on a lot of issues. But the pros are they’re the strongest on opposing Western Imperialism.  The cons of “third campism” is that they sometimes side with false flag operations, like color revolutions, then have to retroactively withdraw their support. But the pro is that they support all movements of the oppressed & exploited, even when they happen to happen in “anti-imperialist” countries.  So that’s the great divide on the left. Most organizations are strongly campist or third campist. As opposed to newer people who don’t even understand the debate & tend to just vacillate between the two depending on which way the wind is blowing in that particular moment	existing	removed	[0.3782289 0.6217711]

Yes it would be. Which I think goes to explain why that's the straw man your brain settled on. Because that's not the argument anyone is genuinely making. It's not that they as a race have an inability. It's just that they are specifically targeted by what is allowed to be used to obtain it or not. And how to get there. Keep in mind there's never been a need proven for such voter IDs as are being pushed. But even regardless of that. Anytime someone has suggested one that doesn't have all the design disadvantages of the ones being pushed. (Federal ID for instance) The very same people that often push for voter IDs scream bloody murder against it. Because it's not about the ID or any security they can bring. It's about who they can help exclude.	existing	removed	[0.4832184 0.5167816]

Until the ADD diagnosis, I'd self-medicated with caffeine– I consume prodigious quantities of caffeine to concentrate and sleep. Unfortunately, Adderall made me drowsy and Ritalin made me jittery at unpredictable times, so I returned to large doses of caffeine.Similar to u/Ryan30z, I wasn't diagnosed with ADD until well into adulthood. (My physicians use 'ADD' because I do NOT have the hyperactive component.)Like others, I have a high IQ and am very creative in multiple fields. I began to think of ADD as a creative superpower, which helped me deal with it.Since childhood, I've been plagued with refractory atypical depression. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved either ineffective or outright dangerous.• Effexor® venlafaxine (extreme splitting headaches and weird popping sounds)• Lexapro® escitalopram oxalate (severe suicide ideation)• Remeron® mirtazapine (red splotches over body, MD doubled dose resulting in full-blown gout)There was some thought a reverse-MAOI might work, but none were available in North America.The clinical trial of Emsam (12mg selegiline patch) worked wonders… until the trial ended. Without the medication, depression set in.And so did acting out in my sleep, a type of hypnagogia unrelated to sleepwalking. The muscle inhibition from REM atonia had broken down. I punched, kicked, and leaped in my sleep. I was afraid of hurting my girlfriend, but I actually injured myself my eye striking the corner of a table. I mention this for a reason…My insurance company helped locate a psychiatrist knowledgeable about Emsam and willing to prescribe it. The malaise of depression begin to lift… and the hypnagogia began to fade. Selegiline was treating both… or possibly the depression and hypnagogian were related.Forgive me if I hijacked the thread. I merely hope others may benefit.	removed	removed	[0.3088883 0.6911117]

And yes, I could have worded that a little better. What I meant was “I’ve adopted socialism as the part of the ideology that I proudly support”. Autocorrect keeps removing words from the things I type and if I don’t catch it before I post, it tends to make me sound like a caveman. It’s really annoying and I can’t fix it, and trust me, I’ve tried. Also, I find Nazbols to be a paradox because nationalism directly contradicts communism.

Marcaine is the long lasting anesthetic you are thinking of.  The other alternatives of the anesthetic not working is: A) an active infection. An infection is acidic in nature. Anesthetics are basic in nature. The acid in the infection will neutralize the anesthetic, reducing its effectiveness. (Which is why many dentists will drain an abscess, or give antibiotics to reduce the infection prior to treatment.) B) too much swelling/infection around the area preventing the anesthetic from getting where it needs to be to work.  There is also often pressure associated with root canal treatments as well as micromovements of the ligaments and tendons surrounding the tooth, causing some irritation post-procedure which can cause discomfort and pain afterwards. (Think of soreness after you go to the gym.) This pressure can be quite uncomfortable depending on intensity and the location. If it is on a top tooth, this pressure can be against your sinus cavity as well. Anesthesics will not get rid of any pressure.  In regards to post-treatment discomfort and pain: each person and each tooth reacts differently to root canal treatments. (I know I've had five done.) How active and recent the infection is, how intense the pain is day of procedure and the technique done on the tooth, may dictate the body's reaction to the procedure.  (Some dentists use the two-appointment technique as it was popular as it provided a higher success rate as opposed to the one appointment technique. But with more recent equipment, materials, and more accurate x-rays the two step method is slowly being phased out.)  Root canal treatments are also lengthy, and requires the patient to be open wide for long periods of time, which can create jaw pain post treatment.  And last, but not least: the only good story is a bad one. Nobody wants to hear about how you had the most wonderful root canal and how you fell asleep in the chair. But everybody wants to hear how you writhed and screamed in the chair getting this horrifying procedure that is pulling the nerves out of your tooth.	removed	removed	[0.45592752 0.5440725 ]

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***  I'm asking you please to engage in cultural relativity here. You don't have to like our practices, just temporarily accept them to understand this post.  We are from a culture where its customary that a dowry is paid when a woman is married - this a customary marriage (CM) and what one must do in order to start a life.The CM serves many purposes: it shows you that a man is serious about you: he'll have worked to save and declare his commitment to you and your family; it joins your family to his; its the right way to marry a woman; it honours a womans parents, family and community, and it let's the ancestors know you're leaving the home.The CM is one of the core principles of our society: we're a family oriented people and that's how families are forged.   Now my sister decided to marry a yt man who's not from our culture. He refused to marry her customarily because it was "demeaning", "barbaric" and "backwards".everyone advised her not to marry a man who viewed her that way but she stuck to him and had a European marriage ceremony. Our parents weren't supportive but they did attend the church ceremony.  This is already a *huge* faux pas in our culture. To add insult to injury, her husband is consistently rude and disrespectful to our culture. They live together in our home country.   He comes into my parents home and refers to them by their first names. This is not done with anyone older than you, especially not your in laws. My parents try to look beyond the absence of a customary marriage and treat him like their SiL anyway, but he throws it back in their face each time. The other men who've married into the family have get togethers and days out: he was invited once then never again. I recently had a baby and my parents slaughtered a cow to host a fast, something that wasn't done when my sister had hers. My mums also moved in temporarily to help me as a first time mum while she only daily visited my sister.  She came crying about preferential treatment and everyone's mean to them. I have a new born: I'm tired and I'm not in the mood. I said It's her fault she's treated the way she is. She chose to abandon her culture to appease a man who thinks shes beneath him. She then never taught him the culturally appropriate way to behave or conduct himself and he's consistently disrespectful. He has an energy about him that reminiscent of colonial settlers and, duh, none of us like it. The cow that was slaughtered was one that my husband gave as part of my marriage agreement: her husband never did that so there's no cow to kill. She chose to carve her own path and turn her back on our ways - nobody forced her to stick to our customs, so she can't force us to stickto our end of the deal. She wants to nice parts of our culture without going through the proper channels: she wants to have her cake and eat it. I told her she was in a mess of her own making. She could either rectify it or learn to live with it. Aita?  Tldr: pointed out sister hypocrisy  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don’t think they have quite the cognitive understanding of “ah, this is the child of my child, and thus this is my relationship to them” largely because they probably mostly just focus on, “ah, tiny pack animal, smells like us, is family, must protec”.   It may actually be possible to teach certain breeds of dogs to cognitively understand the generational connections but without human intervention, I doubt it’d happen as there’s a lack of need.

Quick question, just want to tackle one thing you've said. You say, "Israel has completely ignored the two state solution," but you honestly think the Palestinians held up their end? They literally denied a two-state solution ever since 1948 and have made it abundantly clear that Gaza, Judea, and Samaria are not enough for them by perpetuating terrorist attacks. Also, where is the public outcry that it's illegal for Jews to live in Gaza, Judea, or Samaria? There are no laws prohibiting Muslims or any ethnic minority from living in Israel.	removed	removed	[0.41999975 0.5800002 ]

I don’t think it’s biased, I think it’s a misunderstanding of these distinctions. It makes sense biologically.

This is the exact opposite of the truth. I'm always surprised that people can be so poorly educated, yet here we stand.  Here's a good explanation of the basic tenets, origins, and examples of socialism from encyclopedia Britannica: https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism  Hitler's Nazi party, after the Night of The Long Knives (where Rohm and many potential adversaries were murdered) never espoused any sort of ideology or practices that could be remotely described as socialist. I think you'll agree after reading a bit about what socialism is, and perhaps a bit more about Nazi leadership.  Not only was it callous and murderous, but it promoted private business ownership and created massive wealth for many people. So the antithesis of socialism.  Anyway, off to do your homework.

Well, technically, yes.  However, before the "crisis church" of Western "beta" males cosplaying as 'females', and wanting to be acknowledged as the latter, trans of the world never entertained the absurd notion of claiming femalehood.  All they wanted was acceptance and to not be discriminated against.  However, since Western societal collapse became undeniable, and said "crisis churches" started popping up, these fetishists "trans" people have polluted the entire gender genre and turned it into a microcosmic clown show inside today's clown world.	removed	existing	[0.81208175 0.18791829]

"The second case was a 20-day-old baby with complaint of severe bleeding following a ritual circumcision 7 days ago. After resuscitation and bleeding control in the operation room, the patient developed with sudden cardiac arrest and expired. In conclusion, we suggest that the circumcision procedure should be performed at least by a qualified, experienced medical practitioner."     "Parents of a 5-month-old boy took him to the hospital with complaints of purulent discharge around the penis, bleeding, and amputation of the distal part of the penis after ritual circumcision two days ago. A local non-qualified traditional person had used the Mogen clamp technique to circumcise the boy. Before the procedure, no antibiotics were prescribed. It was also done without the use of an anesthetic. The patient’s vital signs were unstable when he arrived (blood pressure: 60/30 mmHg, respiratory rate: 28 respirations per minute, pulse rate: 150 beats per minute). He was very pale and agitated.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...

Robert Bakker (paleontologist) wrote a fiction book called Raptor Red. He made a story about a female raptor and her offspring, and about what a typical life might be like. He brought his knowledge of the animal to explain (or hypothesize) what was going on at any given moment. One of the things he describes is that the raptor mom's sister meets up with her and the little raptors "understand" that this is pack (family) based on scent. Such as; the baby raptor would surmise:"Not mom....but like mom. Safe". So it's not the family as we have classified it but likely based on the familiarity of the smells.	removed	removed	[0.380889   0.61911094]

>The only side driving children to suicide is yours.  If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.   Normalization and encouragement of children questioning their sex will increase suicides.  &#x200B;  >if people spent less time telling them they're attention seeking, pervert, liars they wouldn't have so much self loathing  The self-loathing is primarily from their physical body not matching their desires; no one says anything to them, people are too afraid to be shamed, judged, and fired.   Evidence that it is more than society causing the suicide rates can be seen by comparing transgender suicide rates to Jews in the Holocaust. The Jews had literally the worst societal impact, yet they had lower suicide rates?  >Nobody is forcing pronouns on you. They're...a part of speech? Do you not know what pronouns are?

Does not seems curious to you, the way we use the word shallow to criticize people and their own standards?  How can you measure another person's desires with a standard? Rich people sometimes want simple-minded, mundane people. Humble ones maybe want beauty and riches.  It's like mortals calling the gods of Olympus shallow, just because they're godly.  I always express my own standards and that makes people call me shallow. It's okay, people can't understand why I want the things I want or why I likes the things I want. I always reply something in the lines of:  "What you like is of no interest to me, why should I bother with what you think of my interests? Do you think that calling me shallow puts you in a culturally higher level than me or something? You are spiritually worthless and hollow, and by criticizing my standards you're proving my point. After all, what are you going to do? Pick a partner for me with your superior tastes? pftt."  Or something like that.  It is as simple as that. Either you agree with me or learn to tolerate my opinion. Regardless of what you think, you don't even know which person are you gonna end up with. Having high standards and realistic ones are two different things. It doesn't hurt to dream, but don't mess with them.

I wanna push back on the "variance argument" with a personal anecdote...  (I'll put "subjective preference" like soft/al dente, along with environmental considerations like pressure, salting, under the variance umbrella.  Simply put, cooking spaghetti in your kitchen to your preference will not take the same time as the same spaghetti in my kitchen)  Anyways, annecdote time, showing why the time quote matters...  I mistakenly bought angel hair pasta and because i know the shape matters and angel hair is not my regular shape, I looked at the time quote to get a baseline...  It's like 40% of my regular shape, fettuccine.  Now even with variance (my subjective preference, my salting and pressure) the time difference between angel hair and fett is very significant.  Now y'all might always but the same shape but i switch up a bit, depending.  Penne is not farfalle is not linguine is not angel hair.  But since i don't buy every shape all the time, the "recommended cook time" gets me in the ball park to allow me to "localize" for my kitchen.  OP talks about ravioli and how it's fast.

Considering the range of different manufacturers, different doughs (plain, tricolor, etc) different fillings, yeah, I'd def look for the cook time instead of just winging it.	existing	existing	[0.8782609  0.12173907]

The last few days everything has been wonderful and the food delicious, but last night dinner was served, it was a pasta dish with mushrooms, her dad told me he had removed basically all the mushrooms from my plate as he knew I didn't like them, I tried to eat around what little mushrooms there was and be polite but the taste was there even without mushrooms being strongly present because they'd been cooked together, so after a few bites that turned my stomach I ended up eating mostly just bread trying not to make a big deal out of it worried i'd upset him, later on when I went out to get something at the shops bought myself a sneaky McDonalds.  My friend thinks I have been extremely rude to her dad and that he was upset I didn't fully finish my meal and how wasteful i'd been, I explained the mushroom taste was overwhelming and made me feel ill and that i'd told her I couldn't eat them, she thinks I am exaggerating and that since there were basically no mushrooms physically present it should have been fine, AITA for this?  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I totally get it, 100%.  You're absolutely right.  It feels like you've gone through the looking glass.  The experts all say that no one can predict an abuser's next action as well as his current victim, and they say the most dangerous time in the relationship is when you try to leave ... and then they pathologize your hypervigilance around him during exactly that most dangerous time.   And god forbid you be more accurate than they are while you're still with him ... if you're coping relatively well with the insane demands of living in hell, do you even want to leave?  Are you even battered? Maybe you like this?   I had to take a break from the entire battered women's industrial complex for a few years after leaving my first husband. It's not entirely sure how it feels about battered women, and there was so much internalized misogyny in a lot of the otherwise well-meaning women I encountered.  I felt like I was performing "battered woman" long after I'd moved into the anger and rebuilding phases ... and that performance was a woman who never would have lasted a day in the actual abusive relationship, so I'm not sure where they got the idea that this was how I should be.	existing	existing	[0.8015127  0.19848724]
Real meat is a way older concept than fake meat. The meat industry is way more ingrained than the new "innovative" plant based imitators industry. Meat has good lobbying to protect their interests and pushed alternative competitors to the edges of the market. So why isnt new plant based meat subsidized?

I said "shovel my face with meat" for the comedic effect, I still don't eat a lot of meat (except in comparison to my previous diet). But I'm disillusioned about individual choices. It was far from a new idea when I started, and it's even less ten years later, yet so many people around me have a hard time cooking even a single meal without meat. I'm waiting for some tax raise on meat, or some other governmental measure (hopefully something smarter than just not letting the poor have meat), it's the only way we can achieve anything.  Most people know and agree it's fucked up to eat meat at every meal, but most of the time they just go "But I'm addicted to bacon" like a brain dead idiot, sleep walking into the apocalypse.	existing	existing	[0.9202054  0.07979465]

It’s important to remember that Germany was newly unified (1871) anyway, during which there was a movement to make Austria part of Germany (pan Germanism). So many contemporaries would not have seen it in such stark contrast as Germany / Austria, as it can seem to more modern observers. And, though Austria had a large multi-ethnic contingency, the Austrian Germans would have been viewed, for the most, to be as ‘German’ as Saxons, Bavarians etc, which had all until recently be autonomous states, like Austria was (until 1938).	removed	removed	[0.4904274  0.50957257]

I'm a feminist. Feminism is about equal rights between men and women and it focuses on women because women are 'generally' at a disadvantage to men.

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).

Adding to your point. Our biggest cultural changes as a species seems to always be in the wake of some massive technology boon.  People worked in serfdom until the industrial age and then the beginning of the 40 hour work week was born. As the tech increased more people were added to the job force, after a generation a farm family now works in factories. Another generation and they've unionized and expanded the factory output via manufacturing lines. Another generation and more people are receiving higher education- getting into fields making tech to make our lives easier.  100 year ago you *had* to have someone stay home and work the homestead, while someone brought in the income. The act of making dinner for 2 probably took a few hours alone. Imagine housework without vacuums, washers, dryers, plastics, sprays, swifters.  Even masculinity and feminity aren't the same as they were 100 years ago... hell even 30 years ago.	removed	removed	[0.45080292 0.5491971 ]

Right. Way to deflect.   People involved in Political discussions online are already likely to vote. Encouraging people who you can clearly see are paying attention to politics is either A. Stupid and Pointless or B. Taking a swipe at them for (presumably) not voting dem.   People aren’t dumb. We know what is meant by it.   Unfortunately, just like “vote blue no matter who” it won’t actually convince anyone to vote that wasn’t already inclined to. It just pissed people off and makes them more resentful of the people saying it and the party they represent.   If Dems want people to show up and vote dem, they need to give them a tangible benefit to fight for. Not empty promises. Not “we could do more if you supported us harder” crap that we’ve been hearing for years.   But go ahead and keep doubling down on stupid dem party talking points.

Domestic violence is not a very gendered issue. There may be some gendered nuance to the acts, but not much difference. The genderedness is almost entirely in how it is handled.  I wish we as a society look at gender neutral domestic violence data instead of studies looking for violence against women.  > Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.  Src: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/  Behind a paywall I have archived around, but Harvard research that women are more likely than men in starting or escalating domestic violence and those women are by far the women most likely to be injured in DV. That doesn't say all women injured are perpetrators themselves, but it does indicate the problem goes beyond the feminist/pop culture model of "violence against women".  It includes:  > Almost 25% of the people surveyed — 28% of women and 19% of men — said there was some violence in their relationship. Women admitted perpetrating more violence (25% versus 11%) as well as being victimized more by violence (19% versus 16%) than men did. According to both men and women, 50% of this violence was reciprocal, that is, involved both parties, and in those cases the woman was more likely to have been the first to strike.  Read that one again.  \#BelieveWomen.  Src: https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/In_Brief_Domestic_violence_Not_always_one_sided  or  http://archive.is/7vuUz   This is a long meta study that shows we've known domestic violence isn't gendered for decades. It is good analysis. READ IT.  It summarizes the results of hundreds of studies across decades.  Not ONE study.  LOTS.  https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrpa/1/3/332 or the whole study here http://www.menweb.org/battered/StrausV78.pdf   Popculture article -   https://thedailycounter.com/male-victims-of-domestic-violence-are-they-ignored/  Most domestic violence research today is research of "violence against women" from grants specifically looking for data on violence against women, not gender neutral research.   All that is very much against the feminist narrative that domestic violence is men beating women.   The rates of partner homicides didn't used to be that far apart. Then women got help and resources and the rate they killed their husbands dropped a lot. Men didn't get DV shelters they could use to protect their kids from their abuser without getting kidnapping charges giving the abuser an upper hand in custody, government funded help to allow them to get easy restraining orders, DV intervention public policy and programs that favored them, etc. Therefore the rate that husbands kill their wives hasn't dropped much. Maybe if we want to eliminate the desperate husbands in mutually abusive relationships killing their wives, we should give them better options. That would probably save a lot of women's lives just like doing it for women has saved a lot of mens lives.  "Gender Differences in Patterns and Trends in U.S. Homicide, 1976–2015" by James Alan Fox and Emma E. Fridel. The data comes from FBI statistics ("FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports, SHR").  https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vio.2017.0016?journalCode=vio&  Here's part of the conclusion that the authors came to:  > Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.  Here is a graph of intimate partner homicides by sex over the years from the study. Notice the trend for women as they got help vs men that didn't?  https://m.imgur.com/a/6Hx9dJt  God forbid we help men, even if it would save womens lives. The reason women need these resources and men don't is because more men kill their partners. Non-abusive women need to be taught to fear men. We need more one sided services ... if you are a feminist.  Anti-feminists consider maybe we should help men too.     I also suggest you look into the feminist Duluth Model of Domestic Violence Intervention which results in men being beaten by their wives being arrested more often than the perpetrator when they call the police for help.  Ellen Pence (The creator) herself has written,  > "By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff [...] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with [...] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find."  I suggest you read the Overview section of Erin Pizzey's wikipedia page or one of her books. She was the founder of Refuge.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey  She created the worlds first domestic violence shelters. After opening several for women in the UK, she suggested that men were being abused too (often by women staying in her shelters) and men needed a shelter too. She was then slandered, her kids were threatened, her dog was killed, bricks were thrown through her windows, and she was removed from the DV organization she founded (now known as Refuge which has just recently lost funding for harming male victims for decades). She fled the country for her childrens safety and became an outspoken DV activist and anti-feminist once they moved out on their own.  That's what happens when a DV advocate tries to help men.  In the US, VAWA replaced the gender neutral Family Violence Prevention and Services Act giving extra rights/services to women and taking services/rights away from men and children. The funding and laws became very gendered. Many of the laws in the act were challenged in court and had to be rewritten. The funding is still very gendered 25 years later, so... We have lots of grants to study "violence against women" rather than gender neutral domestic violence, lots of grants to develop separate programs to "teach men not to rape" and "teach women to report rape", lots of perpetrator intervention programs for men but none for women, lots of DV resources for women but almost none for men.	existing	existing	[0.94256425 0.05743571]

So how do you get it spinning? How do you keep it spinning? How do you correct for the energy and motion it imparts on the craft as a whole? How often? Where and how does it attach for maximum efficiency and minimum wear? How do you maintain the mechanical parts involved? Turning it off? Gotta expend the energy to get it up to speed again. How do you enter and exit from the stationary portion of the craft? What happens in case of structural damage or integrity loss? What's the procedure for mechanical failure that stops the section from spinning? How much friction is imparted by the pieces that connect it to the stationary portion of the craft? If there's not a stationary portion how do you keep the craft in orbit?   For someone who supposedly has an easy solution you're not offering any. Burden of proof is on the one who makes the argument. You say it's easy yet give no actual solutions and instead deflect. And then you have the AUDACITY to say the hardest part about making and maintaining a spinning space craft is getting it into space? That's literally JUST one step and by and large the one we have figured out.   So give your designs that I'm sure you developed through your time engineering at NASA and put this all to rest.

What that quote means is the people with the highest probability of surviving the virus are those who have gotten vaccinated and gotten the virus before the vaccine. That’s because they had antibodies and vaccines which helped to fight the virus. Lowest chance of people surviving an infection are people who were both unvaccinated and had not gotten the virus prior to their illness because they didn’t get antibodies.

Yes and I have never felt good about my decision to abandon that person.    Now however I find myself on the other end of that equation. I am holding back my partner and they are unwilling to "abandon" me BUT it isn't helping either of us for them to stay as we are. They are ready to fly and I am not there. I hate feeling like I am holding them back from their life and happiness.    We have an agreement that we wait 7 days before making any big decisions about our life.   If they love you, they want you to be happy even if they aren't part of that equation any more....sometimes we just need a little shove.

none of that is true, its always been about republicans introducing bills that make it harder for minorities to vote. They for some reason always choose ids that less minorities have.

We’re basically in agreement then and I don’t want to argue just to argue. There is always room for improvement in messaging and outreach. It’s also the fault of sensationalist media, which elevates stories of division rather than stories of policy-making.  “Why” are things like they are? It’s too complicated a question. It’s a rightwing subversion of media and institutions, it’s poor educational standards, it’s the fractured digital landscape that’s full of tribalism and misinformation.  All I’m saying is *encouraging people to vote* is the most concrete solution we have. And it has every possibility of working, we just need to overcome the threshold of a rigged system long enough to un-rig it.	existing	existing	[0.88868946 0.11131057]

Thank you for pointing out CIGCIS resource guide! Some of the books on the list are going to be on my ever-growing to-read list :P  Computing as a field, in general, is merely a century old so it makes sense that the history of computing, too, is a relatively new field.   I'm wondering, are you aware whether the history of computing/technology has had many interconnections with the philosophy of technology and/or technocriticism? I've read a little bit on the contemporary debate among computing professionals on the issues of technological instrumentalist and determinism, but surely the level of discussion among computing professionals would be lagging behind those who are philosophers first.	existing	existing	[0.91207695 0.087923  ]

As has been pointed out, "risk" has to be defined in this context. Risk in modern economics is having capital to risk. Even without considering if our hypothetical socialist society is moneyless or not, or of it has labor-vouchers for that matter, capital doesn't exist in socialism since the goal is to get eid of it.  "Risk" makes it sound like someone is not going to eat if you do bad business ... Oh how ideology is contained in language, right in front of us!  So to better refrain your question - will the workers share responsibility for the venture. Well, absolutely - not in an absolutist sense since everyone does different things. If someone specializes in being the treasurer, they have a greater responsibility to manage the "risk" of the budget. But in a general sense, if a business fails they all share the responsibility to manage the bankruptcy in what form it may take on this society. They might need to see that the remaining resources gets distributed to the community.	existing	existing	[0.7735785  0.22642154]

You should be because innocent people are coerced into confessing pretty regularly. If you went through the courts for even minor vandalism or drug possession as a kid or teen you probably signed a plea deal that amounted to greater charges than you what you committed, because even a lawyer is going to tell you that it's better than risking a judge choosing to make an example of you  It's *usually* harmless, kids often get community service and probation and later their record is expunged, but it has also led to children being coerced into believing they saw someone kill someone else, or touch them, or touch someone else, because memories are malleable and you can be talked into believing, or just confessing to, a serious crime because they've painted their "deal" as the only option vs going to trial against 10+ years for something they are already convinced you did, and they'll lie and tell you they can prove it and it's what happened so you think you have no choice. And if you don't have a choice for long enough, even the strongest willed person will believe whatever they have to to make it end.  It's disgusting and should be illegal, because cops are not expected to even get the right person or keep you safe or even alive.

I think in general, the ability for salt (NaCl, ie, sodium chloride) to reduce bitterness of foods, and thus enhance flavor components like sweetness, savory, etc. is why it’s so great -   and I think this is largely attributed to the Sodium ions within the salt, interacting with, or diluting, the more bitter and alkaline compounds within the food. this then reduces that bitter taste and seemingly enhances sweetness, and other flavors.	removed	existing	[0.8341938 0.1658062]

so I started calling tow truck companies explaining my situation about how I'd been hit and run and where at. After about ten or so calls I found a towing company who said they had towed someone from there who'd been in a collision. They happily gave me his address. I showed up to his trailer with his passenger side mirror in hand that I'd found by my truck. When the police got there and questioned him he admitted to hitting me and to being drunk @ the time of the accident. When the police asked him what he was doing he said he was out looking for a prostitute. Real awesome fella! The police also told me a few hours earlier there was nothing they could do and nobody would ever find the guy. Great police work guys! 👏	existing	existing	[0.75852823 0.24147174]
This 100 percent, people are so weird about penis size , if you are a obese, obnoxious, just horrible being of a man and you have a monster schlong that’s not going to make a difference.

 The study contained multiple methodological flaws that call the reliability of its conclusions into question.

I have no clue if that or any of them actually work. But the theory is that by storing the balls in an environment that's the same pressure as the balls are supposed to be at, they either maintain their pressure, or gradually inflate to the correct pressure.  Balls (anything plastic or rubber, really) are only partially air-tight. Small amounts of air can diffuse in or out through their surface, depending on the relative pressure on either side. If the inside is higher-pressure than the outside, then the balls will slowly deflate. If the pressure is higher outside, then the balls will slowly inflate (this is because, unlike balloons, the rigidity of the balls' surface keeps them roughly the same shape).	existing	existing	[0.5578937  0.44210634]

First of all, the OP doesn't give ANY examples of ANY of the claims he is making. So not sure how anyone would be able to argue this and get a delta. The mods should actually remove his post or ask him to specify what he is talking about instead of making vague and general claims like he is doing.  &#x200B;  OP, just remember, you called him right wing but did not provide proof. If you are doing that simply because the MSM is telling you that he is right wing, then you already lose your own argument here.   &#x200B;  I am not a Joe Rogan fan, I just hate MSM and will always go on duckduckgo or bing and do research on the things MSM claims, which quite often reveals that MSM is lying about things they say. You can also google it, but google will always try and link you to the MSM websites, it is often quite difficult to get info that is not from CNN, Fox News, WaPo etc on google.  &#x200B;  As for his podcast, MSM is trying to cancel him because he had actual medical professionals on his show talking about MRNA vaccines etc.. The medical professionals from MSM was also on his show, that medical professional admitted that they lied about Joe Rogan on CNN. Then a day later, he went on CNN and said that he was afraid that Joe would climb over the table and attack him.... That's the type of misinformation they are spreading about Joe. There is a video from CNN where they literally manipulated a video of Joe Rogan to make him appear more green and sick than he actually was.   [https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30](https://youtu.be/-py5344oJrM?t=30)  &#x200B;  Joe has never once claimed his podcast should be used for medical advice, but the media is smearing him for it. He made a video of when he had covid and said that he used Ivermectin, the media LIED and smeared him and said that he used horse medicine, despite Ivermectin being FDA approved for use in humans years ago already. This is called pushing a narrative, which is what MSM does, and they literally lied about ivermectin because they want to push that narrative.   &#x200B;  Now, months later, pharmaceutical companies are saying that in the trials, ivermectin seems to be effective against multiple corona strains, but you don't see the MSM reporting on this because that would go against their narrative.   https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japans-kowa-says-ivermectin-effective-against-omicron-phase-iii-trial-2022-01-31/  Even before this, there was a few studies that showed that ivermectin had decent effectiveness in treating covid symptoms, but the media refused to acknowledge it because that would mean that they would have to admit that they lied.  &#x200B;  Then there is the one where he had Jordan Peterson on. The MSM has always hated JP and if you watch the podcast, and then watch how the MSM reported on it, you will clearly see that the MSM is lying about it. Even if you don't like Joe, you can see that MSM is lying  &#x200B;  Now OP, my question to you is, are you going to actually provide proper reasons for the things you are saying so that people can dispute it, or will you leave your post as vague as possible in an attempt not to provide any deltas?	removed	removed	[0.36292872 0.63707125]

Well obviously the only sources that we have concerning his life are in the Bible, where the books were written a few decades after his death.  In some cases by eyewitnesses, others not by eyewitnesses, but still within living memory of the events.  This doesn’t mean that they are 100% reliable, of course, but as far as historical documentation of a figures life goes, this is fantastic.  For your first part- how did he see himself?  Well, based on what is recorded in the gospels, what his disciples taught after his death, and the fact that he was crucified, he certainly saw himself at the minimum as someone who was sent by God to teach.  If you want to take a more skeptical approach to the part where he claims divinity, you could argue that he merely thought of himself as a prophet, here to reform the way that the Jews thought about the law.    It is worth mentioning that the Talmud, Jewish religious writings that were written much later, may include references to Jesus, but it is not agreed upon that they are references to the Jesus of Christianity.  Some of the references are to a Yeshu of Nazareth who is accused of sorcery, stoned, and then hung on the eve of the Passover, and his 5 disciples are then tried and executed.  Another reference makes mention of a Jesus, son of Pantera, who conducts healings, and there are a few references to Jesus, the Nazarene, who teaches the Torah.    As far as the socialist part, that’s nonsense.  Encouraging charity is pretty standard in most religions, and this was especially true in Judaism.  Additionally, Jesus was living in a time where the wealthy people of his society were increasingly hellenized, and held beliefs contrary to traditional Judaism.  (The Sadducees, according to Josephus in his *Antiquities*, did not believe in any kind of soul or bodily resurrection after death, and were very connected to the Roman power structure, though they and their teachings were very unpopular with the people.)  What modern socialists misunderstand when they claim that Jesus was a socialist for his criticisms of wealth is that 1st Century AD Jews weren’t wealthy through private enterprise, they were wealthy because they were cooperating with a power structure that was pagan and directly counter to Jewish religious belief.  Jesus’ endorsement of poverty, however, has lead to some people theorizing that he may have some connection to the Essene movement.  (Josephus also mentions them, they lived in isolated groups that were essentially communes, holding everything in common, and also practicing absolute celibacy.  They can be seen as an inspiration for the hermetics and monastics that played a role in Christianity.)  Honestly, though, I haven’t seen much evidence for it, and nothing very convincing.  Not saying it’s impossible, just that I don’t see it based on what we have.  Now of course we can’t bring up the historical vs Biblical Jesus of Nazareth debate without addressing the elephant in the room- his miracles and resurrection.  Your take on this is going to be whether or not you’re a Christian- if you aren’t a Christian, you will not believe in the supernatural aspects of the Bible (though I think Muslims will agree to many of his miracles, just not the resurrection), whereas if you are a Christian you will probably believe all those miracles happened.  For what it’s worth, other sources at around this time don’t seem to question the authenticity of his miracles, but this is a time when such things were amazing, but still considered relatively normal occurrences, so take that as you will	removed	existing	[0.84058523 0.15941477]

If they aren't married, then they can choose to just walk away completely with no consequence and your family's secrets. Even secrets as simple as soup recipes should be reserved for actual family.

> Take out is expensive because you are paying for the ingredients AND the cooking.  For starters, takeout isn't expensive, but even if it were, the word you're looking for is "overhead". Commercial kitchen equipment is expensive. Commercial solvents and cleaning products are expensive. Insurance is expensive.  Cooks? Not that expensive.  Go read /r/KitchenConfidential. Food doesn't cost what it costs because Johnny working the line is getting well-paid.  >The person he's trying to under compensate because she is feeling the economic crunch is not his family.  Hey, you're finally using the right word. I only had to teach it to you, what, 4 times?  And just because you, and she, disagree with the value of the compensation in exchange for the work performed doesn't mean she's "under compensated".  >On no planet does she owe him free labor.  Nobody said otherwise.  Nobody said she owed him labor that he'd compensate her for either.  Kinda disappointed that you forgot your new word so quickly.  >To say He is compensating her in food is disingenuous  No, it's an accurate description of the barter arrangement being proposed.  >He is looking for cheap food that costs less than his current take out  And is, almost assuredly, higher quality.  >which means he is looking to get freshly prepared food for less than what he currently pays  Which is irrelevant.  >she will get to keep a same amount of food that he is already expecting to cost less in its entirety (both half portions together) than what you typically order  Yes, and she'll get to eat it without having to buy it, pick it up, or shop for it.  >So she gets, basically, half of much, much less than he currently pays others for the same labor.  Except he's not paying for labor. He's paying for overhead.  Seriously, what the hell do you think takeout cooks make?  There's a reason that a lot of them are immigrants (more than some working under the table), many of whom don't speak a lick of English.  And it's not because the job pays well.  >Essentially, he is asking for a favor that he is making less irksome for her by bringing the ingredients.  And letting her eat half of them for her own meals.  >He is absolutely not offering to fairly compensate her for a service.  Ok, that's how you see the value of the 2 sides of the arrangement.

That's actually not the whole reason. There are a complex web of other reasons for the pay gap, some of them social, some of them personal. For instance, there's a general trend of lower pay following female advancement. When women enter male fields, the average pay lowers. When men enter female fields, the average pay rises. This may be due in part to women working fewer hours than men, but that's probably not the only reason. There was a study which sent out identical resumes with male and female names attached, and found that the male resumes were better received and got higher starting salaries than the female resumes. There's also a raft of studies suggesting that women are viewed as less intelligent and less competent by both men and women. It's simplistic to suggest that the pay gap is entirely a result of women's choices when that's almost certainly not the only factor.	existing	existing	[0.9381841  0.06181588]

Thank you for this detailed answer. I find this question fascinating because it’s in fact true that enormous numbers of Chinese Communists were massacred in extremely horrific fashion during the Shanghai Massacre and during the violence that followed in other parts of the country, But it’s difficult to parse the reality because the most detailed accounts come from pro communist sources like Howard R. Isaacs “The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution”. But while these accounts may be exaggerated it’s clear that the Chinese peasants and labor activists suffered horribly at the hands of the ruling elite.   I agree that Orwell most likely based his comment off of reading Malraux. I really appreciate you drawing a connection between that and the actual event.	removed	removed	[0.33986932 0.6601307 ]

Because you cna believe in ideas like leftism, anti-imperialism, etc for their ideals, or you can do it because you oppose something that leftist are opposed to.  Its basically just fascism. There are people who oppose the West not because they believe it to be anti left, imperialist or neoliberal, but simply because they oppose it. So they attach themselves to leftism like a parasite and start making up conspiracies, lies about their own side and just in general being inconsistent.  They often support capitalist dictatorships like Russia and state capitalist distatorships like China even though neither adheres to leftist and progressives ideals and both are imperialist nations with their own fair share of human rights abuses.  Depending on what part of the world you live in you've either benefitted from or being the victim of one of three major imperialist powers: The USA+EU, Russia or China. None of these three powers support leftism, democracy, freedom, and the only reason to equate these ideals with any of these three is not because people believe in them, but because their entire ideology is defined by its opposition to something else.	removed	removed	[0.31760108 0.68239886]

NTA... your mom has a thing about this (prolly been dreaming about it since you were born...) but referring to your MOH as "random" is beyond the beyond.

Leftism itself needs no insults... lol. It's a self-destructive, pitiful existence. The typical leftist male is a single, white, degenerate gamer.

Early on Hitler made a living through speaker fees and rich friends who “lent” him money.  In 1920, Hitlers left the army and began his rise in leadership in the National Socialist German Workers Party and did not accept a salary. When asked how he made a living, he would get angry. When Hitler was indicted in 1921 by the National Socialist Party, who believed that his leadership of the party was becoming too dictorial, he was asked by the committee court of the party how he made his money. He replied, “If I speak for the National Socialist Party, I take no money for myself. But I also speak for other organizations… and then of course I accept a fee. I also have my midday meals with various party comrades in turn. I am further assisted to a modest extent by a few party comrades”. His own personal lifestyle was also not lavish.  *The Rise And Fall of The Third Reich* states: “His wants were certainly modest. Until 1929 he occupied a two-room flat in a lower-middle-class district in the Theirschstrasse near River Isar. In the winter he wore an old trench coat - it later became familiar with everyone in Germany from numerous photographs. In the summer he often appeared in shorts the *Lederhosen*which most Bavarian donned in seasonable weather.”  After the publication of his book *Mein Kampf*in 1925, its royalties became his chief source of income. His book didn’t make significant sells until 5 years later, in 1929, when his annual sales increased 10 fold from an annual average of 5,000 copies sold to over 50,000. Along with the rapid rise of the Nazi Party, this was also the year an inexpensive copy was released.  *The Rise And Fall Of the Third Reich:* “But they were nothing compared to those received in 1933, the year he became Chancellor. In his first year of office Mein Kampf sold a million copies, and Hitlers income from royalties, which has been increased from 10 to 15 percent after January 1, 1933, was over one million marks (some $300,000), making him the most prosperous author in Germany and for the first time a millionaire. Except for the Bible, no other book sold as well during the Nazi Regime, where few households felt secure without a copy on the table…. By 1950, the year after World War inscentia broke out, six million copies of the Nazi bugle had been sold in Germany.”	removed	removed	[0.28602257 0.71397746]

The Nazis also provide interest free loans, rent supplements, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, old age security. They had programs for alcoholics to get clean, focused on rehabilitations of criminals and provided benefits for ex-cons who completed their sentence, so they could become productive members of society. They funded holidays for all workers. They were implementing a universal healthcare system.  Kind of sad when the fucking Nazis could do that shit 80 years ago.

LOL gurl you really triggered the scrotes with this one: 12 comments and only 2 showing hahahahaha 😂  I agree though - and we get shamed so hard for having standards. Just tonight I was at work; one of my coworkers had just had a baby (roughly a year ago). She asked me about my holidays & I mentioned a movie marathon on the 25th. I'm telling you, for a moment she looked like she was going to cry, and launched into how she hasn't had a moment to herself since her son was born. Just so defeated and sad... and then immediately started asking about my love life, and whether I had "found" someone yet, because I'd "better have kids soon" (with some noticeable resentment in her voice). SIS WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING AT, your life is breaking-mom 😂  It was such a weird interaction, but she was honestly a lot nicer about it than most. Women married to LVM are the worst. They're angry at their scrotes but have to shove it down, so it bubbles to the surface when they see a woman that *didn't* settle.  I love my life.

Sad little man. I guess you should also fuck off, Biden sucker?  So I liked trump ok.Didnt like Biden because even before he was a liar, plagurist and a do nothing.  I liked Obama ok.

This is a MAJOR issue all across the board. Democrats hate localized education and love tools like common core that like to try and ‘dumb down’ higher preforming, usually better funded schools. I went through a regional school district that was, and still is very conservative and while they offered dozens of APs and were regarded for their academics they recognized and embraced the small town, working class area they served and offered several Vo-Tech courses in business administration, building, auto, electrical, food service and childcare. Kids could graduate high school with certifications in these fields and move right onto working in the community.

I'm especially interested in the area of violent crime victims. How do women get off saying that they're scared to walk down the street out of fear of being raped yet men never complain about being scared of being murdered, assaulted or robbed. Men make up the majority of victims of violent crime so shouldn't we be more scared. My theory is that women are conditioned to be scared. They're only scared because it's fuelled by the media with bullshit like 97%. Mass hysteria you could describe it as.

Reply to your dumb ass comment where you told me off myself and got removed:  What have you done? You're spewing hate like a pissed off teenager. Stop and think for a sec, what are you accomplishing? You're only doing your part to give this movement a bad image. This kind of talk pushes people away and makes us look like we don't deserve support, because we're just a woman hating cesspool of bitching and complaining. Look at what people on other subs are saying about this sub. They think we're full of shit only looking for excuses to express our misogyny. If that's what you're doing, do it somewhere else cause you aren't welcome here. People like you do nothing but prove them right, and give the world more reasons to not take us seriously. What kind of fucked up mental gymnastics are you doing?  People like you are what's holding society back from overcoming all these issues. You could be spreading awareness and trying to get people on our side, show people the fucked up issues we're facing, put light on the empathy gap and the horribly skewed statistics that everyone thinks are legit. Spewing hate only gets you more hate. If you wanna keep being a miserable fuck, then you go ahead and do that. Just know that you're a fucking leech and you're just as bad as the most toxic feminists.   What you're doing is actually harmful to everyone and I'm just calling you out on that. I don't think that makes me a "little pacifist bitch" but you're free to have your shitty misguided opinions.   I can only do what I can but I'm sure as shit not gonna hate on the entirety of the opposite gender just because I'm jaded about what the feminists have done to society. You're right that feminism is winning, and that's why we need unity. Hating on women isn't gonna achieve that, it's just gonna make us stagnant at best and move backwards at worst.

Leave him. My ex was like this too. He made me dread birthdays and holidays so much with his appalling treatment of me that one of the biggest motivations to finally cut him off was that I couldn’t bear to spend another holiday feeling miserable and sorry for myself.  He didn’t even get me any present like yours did but still expected seggs. I only asked that he bring me on a proper date where we could dress nicely, but he always insisted that I sneaked to his house for seggs first even on my birthday, and only offered to pay for dinner after when he saw that we ordered something cheap (less than $10). If i had ordered something more expensive he would have conveniently waited another week to offer to pay for it.  The Valentine’s Day he offered me was just as bad… he wanted me to sneak over to his room for seggs again because valentines and very generously offered to cook me instant noodles. His excuse was that restaurants would be fully booked (then pick up the phone and call up to reserve in advance, bastard). This is when I had a perfectly good meal of salmon waiting for me at home—why the fuck would I travel all the way to his place and be a free bangmaid for a pathetic bowl of cold instant noodles?

Why do I care if it makes them happy.. well there ARE reasons why I am totally against this practice, BUT for the sake of discussion, let's say that I don't care and they are free to do whatever they want to make themselves happy.

I bet you are right, and the reason why SOME people have very low Hb1C is because they have high RBC turnover due to a dangerous condition.

I also read that some people have much smaller sized red blood cells than the rest of us, and their readings are unreliable.

You have stumbled upon a very complex and divisive topic in the field right now, and there is not a clear answer. Different researchers will define TADs in different ways, and there is a credible argument that most of what is being looked at is simply a coorelation of expression.  The way we measure TADs is with a technique called [Hi-C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149993/). We had other techniques too look at interactions before, but HiC gave us enough data to actually start looking for trends. Hi-C is just gluing all the DNA together, fragmenting it with enzymes, and then reattaching all the ends of DNA back together again. Then we sequence the library we just made and graph where the two halves are on the chromosome. The vast majority of the reads we get out are just next to each other in a linear sense, but there are some regions that show up ligated together that are far apart, and this has to happen more than you would expect randomly. So you are looking at a somewhat fuzzy probabilistic model of 3D genome architecture.  A lot of what we see are densely packed heterochromatin, or permanently inactive DNA. These show up next to each other, but there isnt really a clear specific distal interaction. Instead it is just all clumped together, so things that are far apart show up, but there is no real specificity to it. This is often things like telomeres, centromeres, and long regions of transposable elements. These evolve very quick (there is no real selective pressure on TEs, and centromere evolution is a it of a mystery), so they will be different between humans and pretty much anything. Do these count as TADs? Some people say no, some people say yes.  There are more well studied interactions like with [CTCF](https://www.nature.com/articles/emm201533#:~:text=CCCTC%2Dbinding%20factor%20(CTCF),communication%20between%20enhancers%20and%20promoters.), which binds to a known sequence in two locations and creates a loop. This has an impact on gene expression and is a pretty specific interaction between just two sets of DNA. Are we limiting TADs to just stuff like this?  [Phase seperation](https://www.nature.com/collections/adgjaibdae/) occurs when you have groups of proteins that end up in the same location and change the physical properties of the nucleus in a very local area. This is more of a clump like with heterochromatin, but a little more specific in the regions of DNA that end up inside of it. Do these count or are they too nonspecific and wishy washy?  We can spot specific interactions of transcription factors interacting with gene promoters. This is sort of a TAD, but it is also something we have known about for ages and is just specific (sometimes transient) protein protein interactions. Do we set some sort of cutoff when we see it enough statistically to call it a TAD? What if the statistics are just reflective of the cell types it is happening in instead of the actual strength of the relationship.  My point is that if you ask two different people you will get two different answers. You actually have to look at the methodology of the original paper, which is difficult if you are outside of the field. Cis-regulatory elements evolve and change faster than protein-coding genes (most of the time), and their physical location relative to a gene can change even faster then that. How this all ties into 3D genome architecture, and the extent to which it has an impact on expression, is still a mystery.	existing	existing	[0.66122764 0.33877233]
Due to a dearth of solid historical sources about India's past, it's hard to definitely say when a particular practice started. A lot of the sources from Ancient India that we have today are related to philosophy and religion rather than historic chronicles. For instance, we don't have an Indian equivalent of the *History of the Peloponnesian Wars.* Also, due to the vast diversity of the country, the caste system was practiced in different ways at different time periods.  First, let me clarify something about the word 'caste'. Caste is an English word, derived from Portuguese 'casta', as a catch-all term for hierarchal structures of the Indian subcontinent. What is called caste is divisible into two terms called वर्ण (varna) and जाति (jati), which are related but distinct. Varna, meaning colour, is the fourfold caste system of Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra that even foreign observers are familiar with. On the other hand, jati, meaning birth, is based on specific occupations, tribes and traditions, and there are thousands of jatis all throughout the subcontinent. A jati surname, still in use in the subcontinent, will let one specifically know the occupation of someone's ancestors. Jatis were generally distributed into varnas, although it wasn't always a clear-cut division. Examples of Jatis include Gamalla (toddy tappers), Mukkuvar (fishermen), Irular (Irula is a tribal division), Ambalavasi (temple workers) and so on.  So, onto the answer.  The caste system was said to have originated during the Vedic era, although the precise reason for the origin was unclear. It is said that  originally there were only 2 'castes', the Arya and Dasa. Aryas were the Vedic tribes, while Dasas were everyone else. The Dasa people were defeated by the Aryas, and were generally in subordinate positions to them, leading to the later meaning of Dasa as 'slave'. Towards the end of the Vedic era, Dasas were recategorized as Shudras, while the categories of Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya emerged based on priestly, mercenary and mercantile work respectively.  Before we leave the Vedic era, we must note that untouchability was not found in the Vedas. While the Purusha Sukta, which gives the story of Brahmins being born from the mouth, Kshatriyas from arms, Vaishya from body and Shudras from feet of Brahma, is present in the Rigveda, it is thought to be a later addition. So while the caste system had germinal beginnings in the Vedic era, untouchability hadn't yet sprung up.  In the Upanishadic era, we have the first inklings of caste elitism. Shudras were now servants bonded to the land, and when an owner sold land, he could sell the Shudras who worked it too. Artisans were also given Shudra status, but they were not considered to have been discriminated, rather they were Shudras by virtue of not fitting into any other category.  By the era of Mahavira and the Buddha, an untouchable caste known as Chandalas and formed. Chandalas were generally those who disposed of corpses, hunted animals and did other undesirable work. However, at large, in principle, any jati could learn and do any other jati's work. The principles of one caste only marrying their own caste, and that each caste had to do their designated profession, was not yet solidified. Yet Buddhists and Mahavira's Jains denounced the caste system strongly. the Buddhist and Jain critique was mainly levelled at the Brahmin claim of them being specially worthy of priestly duties, with the Buddha himself pointing out the hypocrisy of Brahmin thinkers.   Now parallel to this, in Sangam-era Tamil lands, there was definitely at least one untouchable group, who were called Paraiyar (the English word pariah derives from this jati name). The Paraiyar were a community who supported the king by drumming for him at processions, reading out decrees and so on. However, they were associated with black magic, and so segregated from mainstream society. So this is ironic; the jati closest to the king turned out to be discriminated against by the majority of the subects.   At this point I should probably point out one thing. I have been saying that the castes were not solidified, there was no proper untouchability as we know today and so on. But in the Mahabharata and Ramayana there are instances of people being discriminated because of their caste, such as Ekalavya, Karna or Shambuka. And there also existed the Manusmriti, the c. 2nd century BC code of law that is famous for holding extremely brutal punishments against Dalits, along with other such dharmashastras, to the extent of being burnt by the great Dalit reformer Ambedkar. You may ask, how can you say untouchability wasn't strong when such things were being written?     The answer is that these are all Brahminical texts and they represented the ideal worldview of a Brahmin, while not reflecting the ground reality. There are similar biases in Buddhist and Jain texts too, them being written from the lens of an ideal world of those religions.  Classical Indian times (preceding the 11th century) are host to lots of contradictory statements. On one hand, the Chera kings of modern Kerala began to favour Brahmins and stratify their land into castes, which implications of untouchability. On the other hand, some temples in Andhra Pradesh have inscriptions in praise of Shudras, with evidence of Shudra nobility. All in all, we can say that the caste system widely varied from place to place, with it being strongly embedded in some areas and very weak in others.  Following the invasions of the subcontinent by the Muslims, even the Muslims adopted their own form of caste, where Ashraf Muslims, said to be of Arab descent, were superior to the 'darker' Ardhal Muslims. So we can deduce that caste was important enough for the Muslim rulers to integrate it into their culture. The Muslims used the caste system as an easy way to collect revenue, demographically dividing their subjects by caste, However even as late as the times of Akbar in the 16th century, jati was quite fluid, a case being taken of the Jat people of Western India, who had occupations as farmers, soldiers and Zamindars (landlords) in the same land.  On the other hand, in Kerala, South India, the caste system was by that time rigid. The Kerala caste system was unique in that there were only Brahmins (Nambudiris) at the top, with everyone else below them, no Vaishya or Kshatriya varna. Yet the Nair caste were close to the Brahmin Nambudiris and thus were seen as a high caste. As for other religions, generally Muslims were also clubbed with low castes, and the Syrian Christians were clubbed with high castes.   In the Kingdom of Travancore it was said that lower caste Ezhavas were not allowed to walk on roads leading to temples, come into the sight of Nairs or Nambudiris, and that they had no basic rights. Lower caste women were not allowed to cover their chests, and Ezhavas could be killed at even the slightest provocation by a Nair, while their women could be raped in a practice called sambandham.  On the other hand, the Marathas, who were a peasant caste, set up the Maratha Confederacy, which was a powerhouse during the twilight of the Mughals.  Some scholars hold the view that the modern caste system began to coalesce in India after the reign of Aurungzeb, when the Mughal hegemony was broken and local rulers began to try to flex their muscles. So different areas of India began to have more solid caste systems.  Before I write about the British, I will give a brief account of Manipur, which is an interesting case. Manipur is a state in Northeast India, near Myanmar, populated by the Meitei people. They were somewhat isolated from larger Indian civilization due to their location among dense hills and forests. In the early 18th century, the kings of Manipur were converted to Vaishnavism and Brahmins who were mainly from Assam and Bengal came to wield great influence in the kingdom, and the Meitei people quickly came to be divided into fourfold varnas. This is interesting because it is one of the few cases of aggressive Hindu proselytism, and shows the quick setup of the caste system in a land which traditionally had no such ideal.  In the British era, the British treated the existence of castes as a readymade category for the classification of the population. They granted administrative jobs and gave better positions only to Brahmins and higher castes, since they were thought to be 'intellectual', while soldiers were recruited from the so-called 'martial races', who were considered to have an aptitude for war. These British policies, as well as the fact that the British were an occupying force in India, led to more insular castes all over India, and a promotion of discrimination, since the upper castes had social prestige as well as social capital.  So in conclusion, the caste system was, like many other Indian philosophies, something that varied greatly according to time and place. The caste system consolidated at different places at different rates according to unique social contexts.

"I’m confused on why people downplay the issues/systemic problems that have gone on in our country for centuries. People were enslaved and forced to work for free while being stripped of their humanity,families, or any other humanly items/thoughts while being told they shouldn’t be allowed to read, write or enjoy any other freedoms that their oppressors enjoyed. If it’s safe to assume legislation and legal action has generational effects on people then we can easily assume that the 200+ years of legal slavery 100% had major impacts on those people. And it only gets worse. Once slavery ended those people weren’t actually freed or given literally anything to start with. We just swapped slavery with indentured servitude, enslaving these people for life-but legally. And after that? Black codes, Jim Crow laws, segregation etc. It’s crazy to think after 400 years of this group of people experiencing nothing but pain misery and hate from another group that they’d be able to magically “pull Themselves up by the bootstraps”. After centuries of this treatment we finally Found “equality” which isn’t even true equality and now we tell the group of people who have been though all of this to essentially get over it, and move on. This group of people have been destroyed within this country for centuries and all you guys have ever done is either A- be the problem or B-do your best to make it seem as if there is no issue and that these people are dramatic. It’s disgusting. They kneel during a national Athem against a systemic problem they’ve been facing and somehow that’s anti-American but breaking literal laws and going against the ways of the country on Jan 6th is okay? How does any of this make sense. Someone please explain"   Another redditor asked me to post this, he can't post because karma balance or non-flaired.

I fully agree with you. But the medical term “obese” really needs to be changed to only apply to those who are actually obese. Using the same term to apply to both those who are healthily figured and those who are dangerously grotesque causes massive unintended consequences on both ends of the spectrum.     For the fat, they use the 40% statistic as an excuse, because “being obese is totally normal, like 40% of people are so it’s ok for me to be”.     And for the healthily figured it creates a toxic fitness ideal which isn’t actually healthy for everyone. Some people actually need a higher BMI to function at their best.    And there are also academic unintended consequences, such as “Fat Studies”, which is a disgusting grievance studies course which is dedicated to irradiating all forms of fat shaming micro-aggressions in society…	existing	existing	[0.7448283 0.2551717]

I would argue that it was not a socialist state. Just a pure example of how countries will have you believe that "socialism" ruined everything when almost no socialist values were implemented. It works damn well too, hence why so many are opposed to socialist ideals. That being said, any one political ideology is shit on its own, including socialism. I believe the only way for a country to be a good nation is to draw ideas from different political ideologies and implement them together. Way harder said than done, but Germany today is a good example of a country that does it. It can work, and to say "socialism ruined my country" is just wrong. The people trying to keep a stranglehold onto power ruined it, and propaganda helped them lay blame on others.	removed	removed	[0.35534936 0.64465064]

>Hello! I have often heard among cannabis users the mantra that opiates, nicotine, and other drugs are “biologically addictive” while cannabis is “psychologically addictive.” The explanation I have been able to find for this is that many drugs can change the body such that it does harm to itself in the absence of that substance, whereas cannabis addiction (or other addictions like playing video games or gambling). Is there truth in this? If so, what are the physical and psychological mechanisms behind each type?  Cannabis is like other drugs in that it too is biologically addictive. Meaning that when it is not present, it does lead to physiological changes, not just craving/anxiety which many consider as “psychological” addiction. The effects of cannabis are mediated by cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain that underlie craving, anxiety and mood. However, cannabinoid receptors are also expressed throughout the body.	existing	existing	[0.5222824 0.4777176]

I’d say the main concern is the concept of informed consent, the form is secondary. Pretty sure you don’t need a consent form for something like taking a nasal swab or blood sample anyway. The important thing is that people are supposed to understand what’s being done to them and why, including what’s gonna be done to sampled taken from their body. A consent form like you described would do nothing in the spirit of this principle.  But yes, you could draw up a form with an exhaustive list of all the tests you intend to do and have people read and sign it (or more realistically, just explain to them what you’re going to do). However, you still have the (arguably more important) consideration: are these additional tests likely to benefit the person? If not, you shouldn’t even be asking for consent in the first place.	removed	removed	[0.45312774 0.54687226]

Yes.  Recently several times.  I'm sure many times in the medieval period.    Ruler of Dubai's daughter was missing for a few years.  Princess Latifa al Maktoum.  She re-surfaced again last year.   In August, Princess Shamsa (again, Dubai) was kidnapped off the street in Cambridge and taken back to Dubai.    In 1974, there was a kidnapping attempt of Princess Anne in England off the streets in London.    In the 1100s, Eleanor of Aquitaine was a very desirable wife because she was rich and had lots of lands. She was abducted two or three times (depending on how you count them) in attempts to force her into a marriage (so the kidnapper could take control of her lands).  After her first marriage (to the King of France) fell apart, she became very close to her Uncle Raymond (ruler of Antioch), there was talk of "excessive affection," and she consented to his abduction of her but that never happened.  A few weeks after her first marriage was annulled, she was traveling with her entourage.  Two different lords (Theobald (a French count) and Geoffrey Plantagenet (aka Geoffrey of Anjou),  (the brother of Henry II, Duke of Normandy) each tried to separately kidnap and marry her to take her land.  In a defensive move, she sent her messengers to Henry (future king of England), to ask him to marry her.  He did, and they got married about 8 weeks after her first wedding was annulled.  This also prevented anyone else from kidnapping her.  She thus became Queen of England.  I think they were third-cousins.  She was thus both the Queen of France and then later the Queen of England.	removed	existing	[0.63419974 0.36580032]

As I understand it, in the West, since say 1900 people who think they are far smarter than they are able to demonstrate thinks a few things: That government by controlling monetary policy can stave off the worst parts of the economic downturns, and that deflation is the worst thing in the entire world.   When these people got power in Central banks they took their wealth of knowledge to focus on inflation with the belief that by controlling it, letting it exist but at a small level they can stay away from deflation.   These wizards of smart at the Fed managed to create a recession inside of the Depression, and prolong the depression by years.   These same geniuses were happy enough to let inflation run rampant in the late 60s and early 70s instead of using their monetary policy to kill the inflation.

I think this particular workload is very anecdotal and the average workload of a SAHP really depends on the kids and the parents, any types of developmental issues, or special activities the kid has.

With all due respect, I think you are deeply ignorant.  Look at your language: you consider yourself a member of the "fact based community"--i.e., your beliefs are **fact**.  It logically follows that anyone who disagrees with you is, *ipso facto*, "factually" wrong.  You and your tribe have exclusive access to the Truth and that Truth is being threatened by ... shall we call them Blasphemers?  Or is that a little too on the nose?  Accusing your ideological opponents of being children is no idle threat.  Children, after all, do not enjoy access to all the civil rights of adults.  It sounds like you are enthusiastically in favor of stripping your fellow citizens of their essential liberties.  I hope you are simply ignorant of what lies around that bend.

Please, please stop making racism into some distant evil character’s trait. It’s shocking to me that so many americans act clueless of how dad, or “sweet sweet” grandma are racists. And the problem is usually this fictional preconceived idea of what a racist really is.  This kind of stuff does no good for anyone (well except for racist people who get a free pass).   People can be racist and still be human, still have “good” qualities. Also, being old is not an excuse, it’s funny to me how they’re rarely too old to vote, drive, own property, travel, whine. But way too old to grasp basic concepts and let go of stubborn childishness.

You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	removed	existing	[0.5086695  0.49133053]

>you don't seem to realize that your "feudal warlords" argument actually describes current reality rather than some unrealistic utopia. What do you think the various layers of governments are? Are local governments not in effect local warlords?  I'm fully aware of this, that's why I'm an actual anarchist instead of an idiotic ancap, because I realize that an "anarcho-capitalist" society would just be more of the same, except even worse.    >And do they not succeed in this criminal enterprise primarily because a tremendous majority of their citizens have been convinced that it is ethical and legitimate, thus removing their impetus to fight back?  Yes, which is exactly why we need to reach a point where the majority of people realize that private property is unethical and illegitimate.    >If a random person showed up on your doorstep and demanded protection money, how would you respond?  Depends on how much power they have to back it up.    If they work for a local ~~warlord~~ *"business owner"*, who uses their private ownership of the means of production as leverage to buy soldiers and gain power, then I'd probably give in to their demands, since I'm not suicidal.   Maybe, in a best case scenario, I'd try to support a revolution, in that case you can rest assured that the goal of this revolution wouldn't be to just take out this one ~~warlord~~ *"business owner"* and hope that the next one will be more benevolent, but that the goal will be to *actually* abolish the state this time by actually getting rid of private property.    >They would track this would be competitor down with all due haste and throw him in jail.  Yes exactly, no such thing as fair competition or a free market when you have a world where people leverage their wealth and power to control others.    >Conversely, in a truly free market society, these warlords would not be able to exist.  If you remove the market part then I agree.    >Without their perceived legitimacy in the minds of their citizens, nobody would be willing to entertain their protection racket.  I agree, which, again, is exactly why people need to reject the legitimacy of private property and the way it's leveraged to gain power over others through violence.    >In fact, it's all too likely that domestic security companies would exist in greater number even than today(though they actually number more than most people think in our current world). These companies, motivated to provide a quality service voluntarily to their customers, would certainly not permit thugs and criminals to harrass and threaten their clients.  Well yeah of course they wouldn't permit it, they wouldn't want the competition...    How the fuck do you not realize how these companies would themselves be the "thugs" that you're talking about?    >These companies, motivated to provide a quality service voluntarily to their customers, would certainly not permit thugs and criminals to harrass and threaten their clients. Indeed, their clients likely would also not permit it, as ownership of defensive tools(AKA guns) would be common and encouraged.   Ah yes, that's why companies in the US are all so ethical and why they never use the state's power in the form of the police in order to help them get what they want, because of how there are more guns than people in the US! /S  >This world where peace and cooperation reign over coercion and dominance is possible, but only when the inhabitants of a given geographical area have broken free of their indoctrination and come to realize that their current lives are subject to domination by the very criminal enterprise that they've been taught to revere.  If you get rid of private property, and of the "given geographical area" part, then yeah I agree.   This wouldn't really work on a local level, you'd just end up being conquered by the more organized forces of a neighboring region that hasn't abolished its state.    It would have to happen on a huge international scale, borders would need to be abolished.   It's fine if not the entire world participates, so long as it's a big enough portion of the world, with enough of a sense of solidarity to come to each other's aid when needed, to make the militaries of remaining states afraid to attack.	existing	existing	[0.8209539  0.17904612]

A CD-ROM writer takes a blank CD-ROM and literally burns pits into the a reflective foil membrane. The disc can only be written once because once you burn something it's very hard to unburn it.  If the CD is single-sided that membrane is just the silvery stuff on which the label is printed. So if you want to destroy a CD more effectively you scratch the label side not the clear plastic side.  Since there is no way to unburn that membrane once it's been burned it's been burnt.   Now the encoding was designed so that you could make an extendable CD-ROM image and apply that to the disk. And then later apply a Delta, a set of changes, basically adding or replacing existing files.  Basically the medium records a serial data stream. Like you could actually send the bit pattern across an old cereal line if you wanted to. That's why they were so easy to copy. You could just read the stream off one and burn those same markings into another .  Now the rewritable media had a reflective plastic that could be melted instead of a simple foil membrane. So you could heat the plastic and change where the pits were, filling in old ones and adding new ones.  And before that there was basically a magnetic disk that could be heated with the laser. You could only change the magnetic recordings when the individual track had been heated. So these were basically removable hard drive media, just not as big as the hard drives of the day .  Going the other way DVDs just used higher precision lasers so that they could fit more into the same size disk. But it was still burning pits or melting plastic depending on whether or not it was read only or rewritable.  And blu-rays are basically the same deal as CD-ROMs and DVDs, except they use a higher energy blue laser so that they can make smaller marks closer together.	existing	existing	[0.7927044  0.20729563]

I’m long gone from school. I don’t think school is much to learn as much as it is to expose students to new ideas. Much of the learning I had while in school and in college came from myself.   I agree that young kids don’t have the diligence or responsibility to know when they need to focus on the professor. But once you reach a certain age you are well capable to know the importance of studying and paying attention when needed.   “School is drag and that’s just how it is” of course not.

Im not sure what you're trying to convey with this comment, tbh. Goldman wrote this in response to Trotsky's ["Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm)  > Wasn’t she writing from Russia?  Pretty sure she was in Spain when she wrote "Trotsky protests too much." She went there in 1936 to help the CNT-FAI and returned to Canada in '39.  > Wasn’t Berkman just broken after he tried to shoot Frick?  He was sent to prison for over a decade which certainly did a number on him.  > Was any of this relevant to anything when both of them died two years later?  No, but it was relevant to what Trotsky put forward. Also Berkman died two years before Goldman wrote this.	existing	removed	[0.13759744 0.86240256]

Cats are responsible for many bird species being endangered.   Cats can bite and scratch people all they like, but a dog barks too much or nips once, and they’re liable to be taken away and maybe killed.   I don’t have to pick up dog shit off my property because cats have more rights over the land than most humans.   90% of cat owners don’t know where their cat is most of the time, because a cat isn’t a pet that takes responsibility.

In college I did a presentation and another time an essay on gun violence and I encountered the study by the NRA and MANY critiquing it. The NRA claims that guns are used all the time in self-defense. Other studies point out that the NRA data is literally self-reported. And upon further investigation found that most cases of "self-defense" were actually illegal and unjustified acts of aggression involving a firearm.   It's just wild to me that 1) the NRA sgudy is so blatantly and obviously flawed and 2) people somehow still believe it. Like it's almost comically bad.	existing	existing	[0.92724156 0.07275837]

Everyone makes their own choices, but there is nothing wrong in the appeal to moral authority here. If the argument that makeup is harmful to society and to women, is believed to be true enough to be convincing, then there is nothing wrong with saying "Well, I'm going to opt out, and I'm going to tell everyone I know that I'm opting out for these reasons". And if you are at least able to take these arguments seriously, and you cannot convincingly argue against it, then you have to make a decision.   It's like climate change. We all know that we're contributing to climate change. And yeah, it's so big that it's bigger than any of us. But also, all of our individual choices add up. And so we have to make our individual choices about the things we do. There are practical limits to this.  If you are really a feminist, then you have to make the decision about the commitments you're going to make. And one of those commitments has to be to realise that if you and everyone you know is in what seems to be a miserable relationship with the cosmetics industry (and it seems that there are at least a few women), then the only way to change it is to make it clear that you refuse to have any business with that and try and make it ok for everyone else around you to do the same. If enough people just make the moral decision and take some leadership, that can be enough to make the change.   A few years after the recession, a lot of people were skint, and my dad would talk to the parents at the schoolyard and some always used to talk about how they were going on expensive holidays abroad, and do this expensive thing, and etc. and how great that would be. But this time actually people were kind of skint, and they were still being like that. It was a pride thing. My dad openly told people that we were kind of broke this year, and that we were going to be camping in a field, this time, because that's what we had money for. And after that summer, a few of those people quietly admitted to him that they didn't wind up going on holiday after all. It's actually quite simple. Normalise the behaviour you want to see, and often you can make it happen. The issue is that doing that takes serious effort.	existing	existing	[0.91266006 0.08733997]

This is my view on ugliness. You may think you are ugly. And maybe by some standards you are ugly. But to some people, the ones that see you and actually know you for who you really are, they don’t see ugliness, they see smiles, and quirks, and the good in you, they see when you get excited about something, they see when you are passionate about your hobbies, when your favorite song comes up, when it’s time to watch your favorite shows and movies. They don’t get fixated on your skin color or your “flaws” they see the best in you and vice verse. You need to change your mentality about how you see things. If some handsome guy loves you for who you really are, let them love you. That just goes to show what an amazing human being you must be.  Lift up your chin and focus on other issues instead of looks.  Life is short. Enjoy and make the best of it.	existing	existing	[0.82021636 0.17978358]
One of my most interesting possessions is a letter sent from my grandad to my grandmother in the 50s. My grandad was doing his National Service with the RAF, and was stationed at Christmas Island to support the atomic bomb tests there (his job was, amongst other things, scrubbing the radioactive dust from the bombers once they returned.  Anyway, the letter describes the test he witnessed. It describes how they were positioned on the opposite side of the island to where the bomb was being detonated, sat on the beach facing out to sea (again, facing in the opposite direction to the blast), and they were instructed to close their eyes and cover their eyes with their hands. The letter describes how even through closed eyelids, he could see the silhouette of the bones in his hands.  So yeah, nuclear bombs are pretty bright.	removed	removed	[0.30382484 0.6961751 ]

The Imams’ attitude was covered in Halil Inalcik’s book The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age.  The background was that the Ottoman state never had a tradition that the eldest son was by default the only legally valid successor.  Instead the idea was that the most powerful son would take over. This led to civil was with massive death.   The Imams were needed to legitimize the execution of Sultans’ siblings. They were were brought onboard because in Islamic law there is a principle that an evil can be made permissible to avoid a greater evil.  In this case, if the murder of the sultan’s siblings would prevent civil wars where thousands or tens of thousands of citizens would die, then the murders were the lesser of the evil and would be allowed.  The Imams thus backed this succession practice as an exceptional circumstance.	existing	existing	[0.513378   0.48662195]

It's funny i saw this video the other day, "when a simp meets an incel":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhx32xBmzRc  In it they portray the "incel" as a supposedly conservative neckbeard who hates woman.  In the comments you will hear people pointing out how the "incel" seems too confident and charismatic for an incel.  Another will reply how the incel's arrogance is just right for someone who hates women.  Another will point out how the incel should be worshipping women instead of looking down on them. (simping?)   No one seems to agree what this legendary "incel" looks like.	existing	removed	[0.42364633 0.57635367]

Also, a vaccine is considered a contract, and there are many countries with laws against “backing people into corners” to force them to sign a contract. Also, it’s his body his choice. There is also no duty of care the dad has to anyone else when deciding to get the vaccine.

Like what, specifically?  >So, now I’ve adopted socialism as the ideology that I will proudly support.  >I’m aware that socialism is the transition to communism, and that’s why I’ve adopted it. It leads to the ideology that I truly believe in.  Ideology doesn't lead to ideology. Communism is an ideology, socialism is how to get there, the result of the ideology. Socialism is the process of achieving communism. Liberals and reactionaries have used the word "socialism" as a scare word and apply it to anything politically inconvenient to them. It isn't a belief, it isn't an ideology, it isn't a goal.  >I’ve also adopted a bit of doomer thought as well.  I've noticed.

Yes dear yes. Accidental, unintentional physical contact with a woman's skin, let alone breasts or hips is generally interpreted as sexual harassment (in my country the federal penal code has a special section for it titled "Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty") or possibly assault, but viciously hitting a Man in his genital area is seen as hilarious for some demented reason.   Men in general and Male Artists in the media and entertainment industry need to stop simping or tolerating it and stand up to this absurdity.

That’s like saying we should teach kids to not give a fuck about race and be “color blind.” You can’t just ignore something that’s such a big part of society today. Eventually we’ll probably get to the point that so many people have made up so many genders that only they and nobody else have that gender won’t matter and everybody will just be themselves. The labels will keep getting smaller and smaller and more specific and eventually it’ll all just break down. But until then, encouraging everyone to just be themselves and find ways to explain exactly who they are is the best way to go.   I *wish* my school taught about gender like that and encouraged everyone to really think. It’s not hurting anyone; most people will come back with a deeper understanding of their gender, even if, as it probably will be for most people, they’re cis. I imagine that even just having that peace of mind and understanding of why you’re cis (and more generally why you are who you are) would be beneficial. And for people who aren’t? It’ll save them so much pain of having to be alone thinking about their gender, worrying about people being transphobic because they don’t understand at all, and generally feeling lost trying to question it and figure out what gender even really *is* to them. More people being themselves will mean even more people will be comfortable being themselves. And that’s what will lead to the endgame in the first paragraph, the breaking down of gender completely.	existing	removed	[0.33797744 0.66202253]

So... "I don't like that subreddit" CMVs don't tend to be fruitful discussions. The stakes are basically zero, so there's nothing to discuss. You don't have to like it. There's no negative consequences for not liking it. And typically the best course of action when you don't like something where the stakes are zero is to just stop engaging with it.   Instead of doing that you've tried to export the arguement you want to have with the people you don't like in that sub to this sub. Which also tends to not make for a great discussion. If you want to argue with the jerks you find at AITA than argue with *them*. I understand the instinct to bring the discussion here as people tend to be a lot more reasonable in CMV and trying to discuss thing rationally in AITA is diffucult because the folks there are often pretty unreasonable. To me, the behavoir of folks in AITA makes them not *only* not worth engaging with, it makes them not worth talking about.	existing	existing	[0.7579541  0.24204585]

Interesting. When I first took my ssri, I actually felt a direct change in my mood about 5 minutes after taking it.   For me, this drug has been life changing in the worst way, it actually made me much more depressed. I’m unsure if you’re aware of pssd, but I got that months after quitting ssris and I’m still dealing with it today. So for me personally, this drug is certainly the most depressing thing that happened to my life.  I agree they might work for some, but my question is “at what cost?” Really wish my doctor told me that by taking this drug I was running a chance at losing my sexuality forever. (I’m only 23, btw) Treating depression at the cost of sexual function (especially without warning) isn’t a fair trade-off in my eyes.	removed	existing	[0.6367345 0.3632655]

Gentle YTA like everyone is saying. Not only are you an adult, but you also have to remember that there is a privacy issue now that you are over 18. Some doctors will not allow your mom to do these things for you for you anymore unless there is proxy paperwork that you have diminished capacity.   As someone who has struggled with mental health and now works in the mental health field, may I suggest asking your mom to help you make an initial call to a therapist who also does some version of “life couching” or social work? It isn’t always covered by insurance, but they can help you get to a place where you can become a better advocate for yourself and deal with why and help you overcome it!	existing	existing	[0.9282514  0.07174855]
YTA. Your daughter, whom you can easily support, is living at a friend's house, sleeping on their couch because you want to teach her a lesson, and you can't see how screwed up that is? The friend's parents do. They know it so well, they are protecting your daughter because you won't. If you wanted her to succeed in college, you would have allowed her to stay rent free in your home for the year she wanted to use to save up some money, and you would have provided guidance on how to save and budget. Instead you have left a teenager in a very vulnerable situation. You need to sit down with your boys and explain that loving families support each other no matter what and that, for the time being, they will once again need to share a room. Either that or buy another bed for your room to share with your daughter.	existing	existing	[0.9308405  0.06915946]

Admitting defeat or bad choices and wrongdoings is a fantastic ability for someone to have.

He said it was one of scariest things he had done because he felt that tactic relied in large part on hope and he was not 100% in charge of the situation.

Thank you for a non emotional answer. I'm going to stop arguing soon on this post seeing as there's so many emotional assholes. Seriously, it reminds me of all the radical feminists that shut you down if your opinion is not the same. Even if you state facts. I post my opinion and/or facts which is not meant to harm or insult anyone and all I get is "shut the fuck up" "circumcision fetishist" instead of engaging into an actual debate.  And I want to say now once and for all I have no idea who this guy is, I am not pro circumcision nor anti circumcision. I couldn't care less. But I will stand by my arguments:  Circumcision has health benefits and is often needed for medical reasons. Circumcision is not the same as mutilation. ( OP has also made a comparison to the Holocaust in another post which is insane ) Circumcision on a newborn WITHOUT medical reasons is debatable, and I'm not gonna argue about it.	existing	existing	[0.9007549  0.09924509]

How do you know that they haven’t told him that it’s unacceptable? You know absolutely nothing of what is going on in that house.

You’ve made it clear on this thread that you’re never able to be seen outside or inside your home naked or in any other similar situation.

the argument from the left is that those resources should have 'no owner', or collectively owned and democratically controlled by everyone that works it or depends on it. so *in theory* it wouldnt 'cost' anything in such a proposed system, besides the actual quantity of resource being moved from the earth, because no money is exchanged for it.   the argument from the right is that the resource should stay privately owned and controlled by the owner. its cost, in monetary terms, to the rest of society is determined by market forces. in this case, which is our current system, youre right. living does cost money to buy resources.	existing	removed	[0.48528054 0.5147195 ]

Am I correct in summarising your point as follows?  Our society is centred around identity, and a group of people found the current vocabulary lacking with regards to their identity, so they invented pronouns that do reflect their identity. However, they are pushing for society in general to adopt these terms, and that's not a good thing, because we shouldn't be focusing on gender as a part of identity, rather, we should abolish this identity-centredness altogether, and let everyone be unique.  I have two more questions then:  1. Isn't it normal that they would push for society in general to adopt these new terms? What's the point of adapting language, if not to effect societal change?  1. If you're against identity-centredness with regards to gender, why focus on new pronouns, and not on abolishing the existing genders? If inventing new pronouns only makes things worse, then, surely, having no pronouns at all is the ideal state?	existing	existing	[0.9296077  0.07039229]

Warry is no more than a brief introduction; there isn't much space to go into depth on any of the controversies. As such, it's a fairly bland consensus piece (nice pictures though). It is, therefore, just as dated, though without quite as much of an axe to grind about the traditional view being unquestionably correct. It would be better to go for a more recent general work like *The Ancient World at War* (ed. Philip de Souza) or *The Oxford Handbook to Warfare in the Classical World* (ed. Campbell & Tritle).

I can only think of one instance of violence and I don’t think it’s that bad considering it was accidental, but as you said it is essential to the story’s progression.  It’s been a while since I read the book but I doubt the “drugs” were that much more than smoking a pipe or something.  And if Tom’s racism is “off putting,” good. It’s there for a reason. He’s a jerk, that’s literally the way the book was written. We’re supposed to feel sympathetic to Gatsby and dislike Tom. Having a racist character does not make a book racist.	existing	existing	[0.55199146 0.44800848]

This harms my heart to no end! I genuinely wish I could go to my mom in my lower moments. I have tried, but I rarely even get a response from her at all. So I’ve stopped trying. Maybe our relationship is just that broken, I really dont know. I absolutely agree with you, in all the ways to screw up as a parent, “too much love” is absolutely the best way. Now I’m wondering if this is the reason I tend to “best friend” style parent my own daughter. My past, peer/friend that was able to have her mother as a friend, still goes to her for help when she needs, and I’m actually jealous of that. That is so important to me, for my own daughter, I never want her to think that she cannot come to me for help, or even just to vent at least. I got extremely lucky in that I was able to have an adult in my life at that time, that I could trust and call my friend. This woman was a godsend in a way. She was mentally not healthy, and had MANY of her own issues, but even as a kid I was able to see through that. The love and acceptance from a mother type figure at least, as a preteen, was what I truly needed. The girls I grew up with, in rehabs, hospitals, and juvenile halls, were all so much better off than I was, when their parent was a friend for them, even if they were a crappy and enabling friend. This trend even continued into my first career when I hoped to become successful in helping other young women with similar issues to mine. It genuinely hurts to this day, to not have that type of relationship with my own mother, although I really do recognize the efforts that she made, and also consider the relationship she had with her parents as well. Our relationship now isn’t bad by any means, but was always best when she did treat me as a friend and even as an equal (our kids are still humans/people). I just never want someone to be down on themselves for being a loving parent and trying their best, when being as loving as possible is often the best thing to do. Your daughter is so lucky to have you! ❤️❤️❤️	existing	existing	[0.9099323  0.09006767]

Are you slow? The left threatened article 25 on Trump most his term. Just google Trump 25th amendment. You'll find thousands of post. He had no choice but take it. Biden CANT take it because he will fail... That's the difference. Realize the media is protecting Biden, just as they attacked Trump, and you may wake up to the enormous lie of the uniparty.	removed	removed	[0.15223552 0.84776443]

She's also an actor and a provocateur. She is genuinely not smart, but also says dumb shit on purpose because it riles people, and a lot of her batshit opinions are fed to her as talking points. People get so mad at her but really it's better just to ignore and forget. The low-life goon district of NYC that elected her got exactly what they wanted, as did the DNC.   The only reason she was anointed into power is because the DNC really needs an "ethnic" and "attractive" girl boss power woman, and the last one (Huma Abedin) went down with the Hillary/Weiner Titanic.   This woman is a dumb narcissist but don't believe that anything she does is not a part of the plan.	removed	removed	[0.16952819 0.8304718 ]
