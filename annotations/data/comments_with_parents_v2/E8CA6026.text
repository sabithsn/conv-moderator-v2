Good for you, Stephen. I'm a broke medical student, and even when I start residency next year, I won't be financially capable to buy a Tesla, and it's already a huge financial strain to fill up my freaking Hyundai Elantra; I don't even drive a gas guzzler, and filling up still sucks.  I'm so glad that $4 or $5 or even $15 per gallon doesn't affect you in your ivory tower. I'm really happy for you. No really. Good for you. You're not an out-of-touch, limousine socialist fuck face at all.

Boo hoo Iâ€™m gonna be a poor doctor someday said no one ever. Suck it up pussy
