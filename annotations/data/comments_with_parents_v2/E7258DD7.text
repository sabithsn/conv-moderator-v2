My bad, im one of the “uneducated” who put all bronze/brown toned middle eastern types as arab because im not aware of the distinction between the darker skinned jews like aramaics, and actual arabs.   And his ascended form would just be a more glorified version of hisself. Jesus was NOT white. He would have been brown skinned even if a lighter tone

Well certainly he wasn't white, I don't think any modern-day serious Christian thinks he was white
