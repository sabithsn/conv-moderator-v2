I think
I 'd rather pay more at the pump than
having Trump back in office .
That 's my nightmare scenario .
As an independent voter , GOP is n't my escape from harsh economy at home ,
it means in the long run we 'd be looking at even worse problems than gas prices .
We are clearly seeing the aftermath of citizens United powered corporate America 's greed .
Your as dumb as a rock .
