So this sub addresses the #1 biggest conspiracy, people lost jobs, people have been injured, an experimental medical treatment was literally just recently mandated almost everywhere; people had to move from "bleeding heart compassionate" so-called "liberal" cities to escape tyranny, to escape their kids being suffocated in masks all day, and you think addressing all that is a big joke to you? Your scoffing attitude says a lot about you. Maybe you're one of those "compassionates" who would give a damn one way or the other so long as your own life is not interrupted, but guess what, it would have come for you eventually once all the "undesirables" were killed off because that's how tyranny works. Tyranny is not a joke and websites and this sub is not a joke for addressing it. The OP is spot on.

This reads like an unvaxxed rape fantasy
