Bro, obviously not cuz that's MOCKING Indian people. It would be this person's scenario if you gained an INTEREST in the Indian culture, wanted to learn the language and wanted to wear the clothing because you thought it looked nice, then yes people would accept it. Since what wouldn't be MOCKING.

How do you know I’m mocking them…Are you pushing your preconceived notions onto me and judging me when maybe I just enjoy it?
