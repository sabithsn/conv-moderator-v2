> I argued
that it is n't a tip
if it is mandatory ,
it is a service charge .
Why did you have to argue ?
Did they explicitly ask you for extra money as tip
when you tried to pay ?
Do they do that ?
A lot of high end places started doing this .
Partly
because certain [ removed ] do n't tip
and partly because why the fuck not ?
