Yeah conservatism is a vial cancer
and will naturally lead to politicians like this every time .
I truly believe
if democracy is gon na survive long term
it will be
because systems are reformed
to effectively limit the ability of conservatism
to get a foothold in politics .
CUCKOLD CARLSON is becoming a real problem
