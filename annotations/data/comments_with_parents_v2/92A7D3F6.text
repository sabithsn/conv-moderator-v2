Generally, taking a killer at their word is not considered legal proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that a murder was justified.   Imagine if they go unpunished. Then anyone who wanted to kill someone, for whatever reason, could involk the "he was a child molester" defense. You're right that most teens aren't brutal murderers. But brutal murderers will most definitely use this defense is they think it might work.  How could anyone be trusted after that?
