Aww that 's sad .
My friend 's mom just died of covid
after having a compromised immune system from a year 's worth of chemo .
This makes the 3rd person
I 've known
that died from covid .
But sorry to hear your friend lost his job
because he 's afraid to get a shot .
Such a tragedy .
/s But for real , anti-vaxxers do n't deserve sympathy .
Fuck your friend .
No one gives a fuck about you ,
or your friends dead mother either lmao .
Such a tragedy .
Anyyywayyys .
