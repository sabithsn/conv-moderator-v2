The fact that someone tracked every little utterance and scoured it for inaccuracies, not even just intended lies, of Trump for 4 years, obsessively noting over 30,000 incorrect statements and can't be bothered to check the largest of Bidens claims is the exact issue here. Thanks for pointing it out. Biden is at a greater pace, ya'll just don't care to listen.

Trump will always be the biggest liar. Huge! Perhaps the biggest of all time. Big, beautiful lies.
