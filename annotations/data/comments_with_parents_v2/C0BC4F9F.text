I've had one community that banned the R-word, which is a discord server  had many discussions with the main mod about it as well, where I told them "retarded" doesn't hold the same value in my language at all and that many other words are considered vile like "cancer", which you REALLY shouldn't say where I come from.  they said: "It's an english speaking community so you should be aware of these linguistic differences". I asked him: "Why ban the word at all?". they said: "I work with mentally disabled people and thus its very offensive". I then said: "To only you then? You are aware that this discord has people from all over the world? Either you also ban the word cancer and hold polls about what other people find offensive as well, or you should unban the word", the latter having my preference ofcourse.     That was my final warning and clearly I didn't understand the issue at all. I'm just sick and tired of language policing. I can't even call myself retarded without being warned that I might offend SOMEONE ELSE. Fuck man.

That mod sounds like a total fagguette.
