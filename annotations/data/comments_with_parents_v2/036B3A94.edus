> At the time of his death , Quintanilla had an arrest warrant out for continuous sexual abuse of a different child and assault family violence ,
police said .
The kids definitely killed him ,
but I ca n't say
he did n't deserve punishment .
Death ?
Probably not ,
but family can be tougher than the rest of society .
People
that sexually assault children should get the rope .
There is no coming back from that .
