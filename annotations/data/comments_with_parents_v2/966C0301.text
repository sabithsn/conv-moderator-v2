>  it was taken from them through fraudulent land sales and colonists simply going "this is ours now, actually" until they'd had enough and fought back. Of course, by the time they did, smallpox had killed most of them.   most natives made no claim to the land, they were largely nomadic. while it may be true for that nipmunic nation (i do not know specifically), it is generally untrue for most tribes. smallpox killed most of them before the fraudulent sales, not after. it is also worth noting that the nipmunic tribe was certainly also guilty of killing other people who had possession of the land before them and so on going back at least 3 thousand years and likely for as long as 10 thousand years. most tribes had no problem with killing for territory nor did europeans, africans, asians, australians nor territorial animals.  so long as you weren't the one that did it and the one it was done to has long since died, you have no reason to feel responsible.

Fuck you, frankly.
