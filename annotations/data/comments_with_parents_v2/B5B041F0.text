Greene actually voted YEA while Gosar didn't vote.  8 Republicans didn't vote.  1 Democrat didn't vote (Pocan).  I'm curious why he didn't vote since he's an openly gay representative that got into politics due his personal experience with gay bashing.  EDIT:  He was probably not present for a legitimate reason and it doesn't appear that the bill had any chance of failing anyway.

Because he probably isnt gay and just used it to get some noobs to vote for him.
