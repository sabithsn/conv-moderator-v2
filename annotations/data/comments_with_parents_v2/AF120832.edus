The life of an abuser is n't worth a life ,
is worthless for anyone but themselves .
They have no rights ,
they lost them
when they decided to take away those of their victims .
Nazis were killed ,
not forgiven
How can you decide rather or not ?
People are terrible and terrible ,
but being a abuser does not automatically mean they are worth nothing .
