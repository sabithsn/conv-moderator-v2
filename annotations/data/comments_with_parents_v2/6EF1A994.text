There were riots all summer and the left never made a peep. I am not a Republican. Nor am I a traitor as I have actually served my country instead of just being a keyboard warrior.

Youâ€™re a fucking moron.  Did those riots attempt to overthrow the government because those rioters lost an election?  Shut the fuck up traitor.
