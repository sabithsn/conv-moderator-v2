I don't care what anyone says, Pence is right on this. Even if the election results were sketchy, which they were, they just couldn't find enough evidence to prove that the election was rigged on a massive scale. Not to mention that I genuinely felt horrible for Mike with the guy having to deal with Trump demanding Pence go out of his way to overreach his duties as vice president despite knowing that he had no powers to overturn the election, while having a twitter mob calling for him to be fucking lynched. I'm not saying Mike wanted Trump to lose, otherwise he wouldn't even be Trump's running mate again, Mike did the job that Trump chose him for and that meant doing something that Trump didn't like. Even as a guy who was proud and still proud to have voted for Trump in 2020, I feel that the way Trump treated Pence was the start to me just being done with the guy.

The election was stolen on a massive scale and it was a clear cover up! He let the American people down
