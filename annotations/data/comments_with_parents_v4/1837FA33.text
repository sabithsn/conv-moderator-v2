I can ’ t get an EV , there ’ s literally no infrastructure for it in my town . I can count on one hand the number of charging sites in the city I work in . Gas going up only hurts me . The alternatives are presently unaffordable . Don ’ t know where you live but there are plenty of high paying jobs if you ’ re not a lazy liberal bitch
