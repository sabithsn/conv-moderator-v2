It works if you hit it with enough force . I 've never completed a project using only bronze because it just is n't efficient enough these days , but hundreds of masons with a lifetime to complete the project certainly could . So using that logic a wooden chisel could cut sandstone ? You just need to have enough strike force ? ? You sound dumb as fuck haha
