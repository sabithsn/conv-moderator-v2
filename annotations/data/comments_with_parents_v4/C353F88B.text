This is a really good point . I told my husband when we were dating that I ’ d slept with 3 men , I honestly can ’ t remember the true number but it ’ s a lot more . Ultimately it ’ s none of his business and I don ’ t know the number anyway , it ’ s not something I felt the need to keep a count on ! The fact that you felt this was worth sharing as if it 's somehow morally sound to be dishonest with your partner is baffling .
