Sponges ( porifora ) are considered animals , and have no nervous system and no neurons , but do have cells that are [ similar in function to neurons ] ( https : //www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03015-2 ) . Cnidarians ( Jellies ) have nerves , but no nervous system or brain , more of a nerve network . [ Placazoa ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placozoa ) are animals that have no tissues or organs , and no nerves . The trichoplax is one example of a Placazoa , and there are two others . It 's an oddity . The most recent classification puts placazoa as a cousin of sponges and jellies . A sponge is more closely related to us than the trichoplax . So basically , sponges and Placazoa . Edit : I realize I did n't answer your question . The nervous system , by definition , is comprised of nerves , which are comprised of neurons . So , there are no animals with a nervous system comprised of anything other than nerves . Sponges rely on cells that can do some chemical signaling that secrete chemicals , called secretory neuroid cells , but they lack anything like a synapse . There are other types of chemical signals that could serve similar functions . One could think of a mycelial network as a giant complex chemical signaling system between interconnected mushrooms like a nerve network . But then it 's hard to draw the line , as almost anything could be considered a chemical signals system . When your body secretes insulin and it 's carried in the blood and then attaches to a receptor , we would n't call that a nervous system . But have you ever stapled a pussy ?
