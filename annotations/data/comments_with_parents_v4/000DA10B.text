For the last time , we do not care if they are ethnically sinti , roma or local driving people . We just do n't like a way of living that promotes archaic womens rights , isolationism and a social hierarchy that 's build upon clans . pls do n't ban this , I 'm just trying to explain it to uninvolved people . Why do we even need to justify our hate towards gypsies ? That 's pretty cringe and implying other cultures do n't hate anyone 's culture .
