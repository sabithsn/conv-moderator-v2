I 've experienced basically the exact same things with cod/league/wow/magic guys ! Edit : Also have had the derisive `` You only play * Animal Crossing * anyway '' kind of comments . Which , A . Not true , and B . Even if it was true , who cares ? There 's nothing wrong with Animal Crossing ! Agh . Same with playing The Sims . Annoys the hell out of me . It 's a game like any other .
