>“interesting”(toxic, yes I’ve had girls tell me they’d rather date someone toxic and that I’m too nice)  Am I glad I took acting classes in college. I portray a toxic attitude towards any woman who's attracted to me. If I see them become more enamored with me after that, I tell them, "the fact you still like me despite my toxic attitude tells me all I need to know about you." Then I ghost them without any shred of remorse.

Yeah girls these days are fucked up
