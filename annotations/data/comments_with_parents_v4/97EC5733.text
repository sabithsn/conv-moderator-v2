And when the ‘ western ’ world = Democrats spreading their corruption and mass migration across the globe , you still feel that way ? Russia at least protects and supports its culture . Clearly Putin has many faults but at least he has kept his country becoming like London or Paris , or even the suicidal culture of the nordic countries . The West has done a fantastic job for them3rd world but not so much at all for its own people . Fuck Russia . We should have nuked them yesterday already .
