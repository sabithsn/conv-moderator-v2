> If you really think cutting off friends is easy to do for a 17 year old then you live on mars . Anyone who thinks it 's hard was a spineless pussy in highschool . Sometimes I think y'all on this sub took HS wayyyy too seriously in general . If you thought it was hard to push back on your friends who were assholes in highschool , maybe do some introspection and realize that you were probably an asshole lol . It 's really not hard to have a spine and tell people to shut the fuck up . Mosy children are spineless pussys , largely . That 's not their fault , they 're still at that stage in development .
