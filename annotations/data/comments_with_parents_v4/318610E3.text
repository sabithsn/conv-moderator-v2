I never said porn does n't have it 's issues and I 'm not quite sure what you 're expecting sending me a 30 year old video . There 's more recent accounts detailing how bad porn can get if you 'd like to update your sources . It 's disgusting but the further porn producers are kept in the shadows the worse it will be . I 've seen other comments from you criticizing brazzers and pornhub but as pornhub 's recent cleanup has shown that they have some accountability . Verifying your porn producers is a fantastic way to empower them and also adds accountability . Though I will miss some copyrighted content that was removed , particularly the french erotic movies . I like a storyline to my porn . I do hope you realize that porn is very unlikely to cease to exist . No matter how much you shame people for liking it . By adding accountability into the equation , we will be able to minimize the risk of abusive , traumatic , and behavior happening . I am not against sex , or porn , or eroticism . I am against the violent , abusive , exploitative , humiliating mainstream hardcore porn .
