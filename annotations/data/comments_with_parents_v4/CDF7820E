I actually disgree with some of this. Men can not do things as good as women can and women can not do things that men do as well.  A woman will probably be a lot better at teaching, nursing, or care giving jobs do to their higher emotional pattern of behavior. Men have a more rational analytical wired mind. So they can work in high intensity situationsnand environments while having a clear calm mind.  Can men be teachers and women be engineers or soldiers, of course, but typically that is not what naturally the two genders go for. And I find that relieving that men and women can really on each other to make our society function as one.   I think men are amazing simply because they can do a lot I can't do. That doesn't make me inferior in value just different in capability or purposeâ˜º
