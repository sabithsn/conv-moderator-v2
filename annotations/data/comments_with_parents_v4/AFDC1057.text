> Keeping track of allergies/sugar/salt intake make it easier to market to individual kids later… That is what you said . You should read what you said . The companies are not responsible for the food for the district . The head of Food Service is . He makes the menus . Then it is up to each individual school to give the kids what they can eat depending on each file when the child gives in their pin code . That info is not given to companies being that its against the law to do so . I don ’ t argue with stupidity . Good day .
