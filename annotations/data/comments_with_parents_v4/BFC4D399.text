Not a tattoo artist , but once in jail I held 12 D batteries in a rolledup newspaper to power a homemade tattoo machine while a friend tried tattooing the word KING on his dick . He made the first stroke on the K and decided its hurt too much and that it would make a nice a cross instead . Lmao Dick King is not the best sounding title , unless you 're Jenna Jameson or something I guess .
