I'm a mechanic... so when I need to fix something, I don't just turn one bolt and call it done. I keep going till what I'm working on is fixed. If that takes an hour, a day, or a week... it doesn't matter, I keep going till it's done. This problem is no different.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for getting rid of them. They are parasites.
