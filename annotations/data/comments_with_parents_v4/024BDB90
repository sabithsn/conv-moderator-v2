I like to remind folks that I marched with BLM every chance I got, and was rewarded for it. My friends, family, and bosses are proud and we made some actual progress.   But if they marched with the insurrectionists on Jan 6, they probably lost their job and are wanted by the FBI.

I hit a proudboy with a bike chain on burnside Ave during the Portland debacle. I'm doing my part. Fuck all fascists.
