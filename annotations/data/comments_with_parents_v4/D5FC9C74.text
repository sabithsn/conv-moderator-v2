Oh wow his Orthodox Christian mother had a Jewish sounding last name , so Jewish . From what we know of Putin 's family they were from Tver Oblast , which means they were not Jewish since at least 1791 , since the Tver was not in the Pale of Settlement , so Jews were not allowed to live there . If having a Jewish ancestor from before 1791 makes you Jewish then literally everyone in Europe east of the Elbe River is Jewish . Yep , hence why anyone who acts in mischievous ways is a Jew .
