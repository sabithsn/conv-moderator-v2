That’s a completely dif conversation- yeah I don’t know why law enforcement was asked to stand down in those situations - and I wouldn’t shed a tear over any violent rioter who was killed - hands down - but this isn’t a “what about this convo”   This is purely a “that woman was not ‘murdered’ “ conversation.

Was she armed? Maybe if she was black there would be another “unarmed black man shot by police” and the narrative would be totally different.
