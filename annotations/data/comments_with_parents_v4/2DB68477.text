> already have at least 6 times and the fact that nobody bothers to ever read it is just annoying . I 'm not sure why you 're expecting people to read all your comments but ok ðŸ˜… I 'll go search > if I was op I would sit them down and have a long talk about it ... I 'd explain how sorry I am for how things worked out and how that was n't my intention and that I would be doing everything in my power to help her avoid the mountain of debt that resulted from it . I 'd explain that I would start saving now to hopefully contribute the full 40k ( or as much of it as I can manage ) by the time she graduates ( and would start incurring interest ) to help her avoid the extra cost of that debt . Found it . It says in the post he tried to talk to her but she refuses . > I 've co-signed these loans for her because I feel terrible about it . I 've tried talking to her about it and how I wish it had n't gone this way but she 's completely iced all of us out . There have been no further comments from OP so I 'm not sure where you got the idea that he does n't plan to help her pay . He 's co signed the loan , is extremely remorseful , and is funding her years in college so she does n't have to worry about getting a job . That seems like a parent that really cares . cosigning the loans is not committing to help clear the debt unless she defaults and trashes her credit first ... that 's gross .
