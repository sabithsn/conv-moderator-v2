You guys are delusional in regard to the actions taken against Trump during his adminstration , and how they are viewed the half of the US electorate that voted for him . You see them as just and normal . The other half of the nation sees them as severe adminstrative obstruction and democratic injustice perpetuated by an antidemocratic deep State that does n't require simple complaints about votes . They had your back through much more sophisticated means . Including collusion with Russian intelligence . Think of how the Obama voting population would feel about it , if they had done that to him . That 's how Trump voters feel . George Bush was never their president . How do we know ? Anyone from Bush 's circle that can , has crossed the isle and are now some of the most vicious anti-Trump voter commentators . Your fake trauma over the single day of the Capitol riot does n't compare to those four years , and that 's before we get to the full election year of terrorist riots that your party incited . No comparison . Not even in the same Universe . I had audible bombs going off in my neighborhood , which killed multiple people . And from which there is a direct line drawn to the MSM and Left Wing politician incitement for those riots . In an election year in which their candidate was installed . That 's election terrorism . Cry to me about the Capitol riot that you were n't at some more , which is being over-prosecuted compared to that year . Cry to me about who said what some more . Lecture me about democracy denial . You lack a concept about political reality in this nation . You literally just wrote multiple paragraphs crying . The hypocrisy is hilarious . Tell me more !
