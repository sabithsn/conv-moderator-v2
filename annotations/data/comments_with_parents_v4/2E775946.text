If cotton swabs are really bad to put into your ears then why make them the exact size to fit your ear canal ? Why not make them slightly bigger so you can still clean around the ear but not go inside ? I think this is the stupidest question I â€™ ve seen all week on reddit . Sorry man , you really did it to yourself this time .
