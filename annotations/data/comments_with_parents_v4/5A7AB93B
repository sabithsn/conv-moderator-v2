The Nazis were socialist racists who couldn't see who they were.  That's exactly the democrat party. They're so sure of their evil dream that they'll destroy everything and never see they were wrong.  Keep your powder dry.

If you head over to r/politics they'll tell you the Republicans are the fascist.  They're crazy.
