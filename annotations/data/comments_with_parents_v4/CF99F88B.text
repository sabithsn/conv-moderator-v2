Unfortunately , if you live in America , you don ’ t have universal healthcare , so it is significantly harder to get medication and therapy , especially for mental health . I ’ m currently in cognitive behavioral therapy for my OCD . Insurance doesn ’ t cover it , so it ’ s 300 bucks a session , which I ’ m very lucky to be able to afford . Read my earlier response on 3rd world countries , this whole point makes you an idiot . These problems only exist when there is prosperity and social safety nets
