You think Trump is better than Biden. That's all I really need to know about how "educated" you are. And you pay $100k in taxes a year? So you're a rich moron. I don't watch CNN and Biden has his faults, but to say he's the worst president ever after the train wreck of the Trump administration and the fucking COUP that he attempted to thwart the will of the people... well, that's why I say you're braindead.

Lol never said that. But clearly you showed who you are. Your obsessed with hating Trump so much you sold out your country.  Congrats.
