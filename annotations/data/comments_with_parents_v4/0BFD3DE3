The left tends to think their opponents have bad ideas, and so they spend endless hours trying to convince them.  Christian Dominionists think their enemies have bad souls and are agents of Satan. Even if those enemies appear reasonable and kind, they know it's all part of a demonic ruse. You just can't reason with that.

Not the left, moderates.  The left knows that there's only one way to deal with fascists.
