I mean ya , I 'd rather not be inconvenienced . I 'd imagine you would n't like to be either . Regardless , an inconvenience for someone can be a serious issue for others . I 'll give my own personal example with masks . Generally in life , I 've struggled with some social situations . I 'm just bad at reading people and can have trouble interpreting things . Between masks and Zoom instead of in person , the issue has gotten a whole lot worse making those issues I had a lot worse . Generally my social life degraded over the past two years and masks make getting it back on track a lot harder . And of course my glasses are constantly foggy . While they may be a simple inconvenience for some , I find them to be a serious issue . Edit : Why the downvotes ? I think I contributed to the discussion and do n't know what I did wrong ? The downvotes are because disagreeing with the official “ approved thoughts ” makes you a nazi .
