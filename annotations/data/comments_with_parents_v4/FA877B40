Yall are fucking insane. OP did not do this. OP didn't steal money from her. Even if they did murder the aunt, the situation cannot be "fixed".  You're right, it doesn't matter who's the AH. But what do you want OP to do? Conjure $40k? Un-death the aunt? Or do you want them to do everything in their power to support the daughter? Oh wait, that's what they *are* doing  They offered their home, co-signed loans.. They included in their post all the ways they're working to help the daughter deal with the fact that she won't be getting the same gift as siblings.  OP is doing everything a parent should/can, and if the daughter hates them for "taking the money away from her", it's because she doesn't understand that they had nothing to do with it.

nobody is saying they stole it... that's gonna be a texas sized woosh from me dawg.
