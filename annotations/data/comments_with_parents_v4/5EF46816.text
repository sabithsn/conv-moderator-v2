No , you do n't . Science , specifically , scientific ideas and theories , changes with added information . You do n't understand science or the scientific method . Science learning new things is why we do n't use asbestos as fake snow , when at one point it was considered harmless . Science is why we do n't think illnesses are curses , when at one point they were considered as such . You 're just an idiot . Also , you do n't know what a cold is . It 's a series of symptoms , not an actual disease , since those symptoms can be caused by hundreds of viruses , mostly rhinoviruses . Science says 99 % survival rate . What 's your covid vax rate ? Far less . dumbass
