Sounds like you did n't do it hard enough . Are you confident/socially savvy ? Fit ? Well off ? The more you progress towards any one of those goals , in my direct experience , the better your situation will be Im a fairly well rounded person . My biggest problem is that I live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere . Not many options around here .
