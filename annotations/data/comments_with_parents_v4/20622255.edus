Here 's an interesting one
I learned.lately ...... You know
when your bladder is full
and you desperately need to wee ?
Well , turns out your bladder can not feel `` full ''
it can only feel `` heavy '' .
So astronaut s in space HAVE to go per every couple of hours ... 'cos
without gravity ... they simply do not know
if they need to or not ! ! !
Wait ...
if that 's true then how do people in Australia know
when they need to pee ?
