Linking being gay to pedophilia is a pretty big stretch and poor logic . If that was the case , there would never be adult men who abuse little girls . The evidence does n't support your view . For the record - gay adults are attracted to other gay adults . Pedos are attracted to children regardless of their sexual orientation . There is a very high percentage of grooming , child molestation , and gay people who were molested as a child in the LGBT community
