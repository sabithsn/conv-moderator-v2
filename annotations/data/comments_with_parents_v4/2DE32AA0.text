If I had my pick of the lot at the moment Is would be Rand Paul , but I think the most likely to be successful candidate for the Republicans is De Santis , depending on how his wife â€™ s cancer treatment goes . If the Democrats win in 2024 the Pax Americana global order is gone . Hopefully his wife dies as payment for all the lives he 's taken by being a piece of subhuman trash .
