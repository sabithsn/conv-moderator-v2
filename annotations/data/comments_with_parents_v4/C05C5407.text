Oh I agree - how this has been handled compared to the Chaz in Seattle is just beyond me . That being said - it ’ s sad and unfortunate- but the officer was not in the wrong for shooting her . How many times is the cop supposed to go “ please angry mob , please stop forcing your way past this barricade towards the elected officials I am guarding ” before he has to make sure his life and the subjects he is protecting are protecting ? At the end of the day if she hadn ’ t been there criminally trespassing trying to force her way into that section of the building she wouldn ’ t have gotten domed CHAZ was handled exactly as they planned . The Left mob gets away with murder .
