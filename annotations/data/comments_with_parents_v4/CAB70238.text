> waxing on about how long you liked her or to what extent wo n't help your friendship . T How is it waxing it on if I 've never once told her the way that I felt about her ? As it currently stands , she has no way of knowing how I felt about her , other than the fact that I probably liked her if I asked her out . This does n't even come close to describing the truth of the way I felt . > Telling someone , after they turn you down , that you 've never felt what you feel about them about anyone else , is creepy . How is it not creepier to hide the truth from her and not tell her about the way that I used to feel about her , even though she may not be comfortable staying friends with someone who used to feel this way about her ? > If you are a true friend , you wo n't do that to her . If I am a true friend , do I not owe her the truth ? If the truth is too uncomfortable for her to bear and stay friends , then we were never really friends in the first place . Her friendship would have been based in an imaginary idea of me . You are a creep
