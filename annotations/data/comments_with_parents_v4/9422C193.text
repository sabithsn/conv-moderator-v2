I love seeing all of the leftists at work complain all day long whenever the topic of Elon Musk comes up . The hilarious thing is that I know EXACTLY why they do it . If they did n't know about his disdain for some of the leftist views , they 'd all think he 's great because he has driven this planet towards EVs and automation SO much farther and faster than we would have gone without him . But they hate him ONLY because he is all about freedom . He 's gon na automate all those truckers jobs away , but apparently y'all will eat up a 3 word tweet and think hell yeah he 's our guy
