You mean that joke from way back in the early 2000 's ?
Hardly the same as 50+ scientists being together
to vote for renaming a species
to avoid insulting a group of people
that literally never complained .
Also don ’ t forget
how mad y ’ all get about history
being taught
because it hurts your little feelings
