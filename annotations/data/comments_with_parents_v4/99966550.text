I wish mine was just a sticker . My dealer 's logo is a metal thingy soldered on there . Absolutely can not be removed with any ease . I wish I could since they failed to disclose needed repairs , and showed me a fake carfax report , among other law violations , and I would never ever recommend them to anyone . Were it not for that I would n't mind it being there . Maybe you were just too stupid to do it ?
