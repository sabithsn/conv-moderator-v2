ESH  Those people are pretty passive aggressive and sound very annoying and bigoted but you don't sound too great either, OP. You didn't have to engage with them. You could have walked away  Also you get extra asshole points for the "I'm not racist comment" you could have made your point without pulling the "I'm not racist" card  Not saying that you are but why would you mention it?

Because I’m saying that she’s racist. I’m contrasting me vs her.
