While I admit dude shouldn ’ t have died that day and what Chauvin did was excessive as all hell , dude was also the furthest thing from a saint . Opposite of it really . I ’ m sick of these idiots who ’ ve convinced themselves to think otherwise . If what Chavin did was excessive , I want to see you do better against a 6 ' 7 drugged out criminal .
