This ... I do n't mask , I stayed home for almost 4months during the initial lockdown , I homeschooled a friggin KINDERGARTNER with no warning , for nearly a full year , ANNNND we 've both been sick and recovered from this thing , we have antibodies .... I did my part when no one knew what was going on , and now it 's clear that this is all nonsense ... So , YES , to those still living in constant fear - stay home . Order your groceries ( like I did ) . If you take it that seriously , then , take it THAT seriously , and stay away from the rest of us if we 're such a threat . I 've had a few incidents in groceries now with fervent maskers shaming me or wagging a finger in my face , and my patience is negligent at this point .... next time , I'ma just gently blow a kiss straight at their face . < 3 It â€™ s you that is negligent , not your patience ( whatever the fuck that means lol )
