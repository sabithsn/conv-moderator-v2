Thank you for proving my point so well . It 's nice to have an adversary validate a statement . YOU just proved my point : `` They believe that the state should decide what education children should be given , and the moral code that children should live by . '' I didn â€™ t say the state should decide either . I only stated parents were too stupid to decide by themselves because they are .
