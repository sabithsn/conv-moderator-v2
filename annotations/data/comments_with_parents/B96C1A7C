Eh aside from your ridiculous comparison to FGM, I actually kinda like that I was “mutilated” which kind of undermines the premise of “mutilated”  I still have tons of sensation, arguably too much at times, I feel like it looks better than it would if the foreskin was there, and I never have ever had to deal with smegma or a bad smelling wiener (based on person judgment and experience with others)   But I completely see how the notion of any cosmetic surgery after birth is frowned upon. And see how it causes complications in a lot of men, making the procedure even more frowned upon (in today’s sensationalized culture turning around the tradition)   But yah, I wouldn’t compare it to anything more “painful” than cutting the umbilical cord (could be misinformed here), especially considering we forget everything at that age (or i did) and I DEFINITELY wouldn’t compare it to the female genital mutilation occurring in “third world” countries to the practiced tradition of circumcision within first world hospitals, performed by educated doctors, in completely sanitary conditions, within completely elective surgeries….  The fact that you made such a comparison…is kinda fucked up OP u/ifIWGreenIWDie

the fuck.... you are on drugs
