Because it was popular and a lot of people my age at the time were using it to talk to each other and I had super strict parents and not many friends so I found ‘ friendships ’ on that app . I didn ’ t know it was purely for sexual encounters at all . Just saw it as a texting app . It sounds pretty clearly sexual in nature when you 're sexting and sending nudes even for a 12 year old , I just dont get it .
