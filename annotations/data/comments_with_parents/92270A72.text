You must have read the wrong studies then or at least cherry picked because that ’ s not true at all . https : //amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/589237/ here ’ s an article . Even women who ’ s husbands do not work still do less childcare and house work than their working female partners . No sane woman is going to consider putting on makeup as a for of house labor ? Shopping for the home I can see but I need to see these studies that you are talking about because every woman I ’ ve met would not consider that household labor haha Gim me a real study , the atlantic is shit .
