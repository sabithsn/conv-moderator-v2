I 'm just tired of them
pushing the gay agenda in every direction .
How some states reveal
they wo n't disclose the child 's sex orientation to parents .
Or teaching kindergarted-third grade about sex .
I 'm okay with sex education , but to kindergarten ,
that 's too young it 's okay
if it 's to thirteen year old No one is teaching Sex Ed to kindergarten children .
That 's a made-up story .
