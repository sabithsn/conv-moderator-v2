Good for you , Stephen . I 'm a broke medical student , and even when I start residency next year , I wo n't be financially capable to buy a Tesla , and it 's already a huge financial strain to fill up my freaking Hyundai Elantra ; I do n't even drive a gas guzzler , and filling up still sucks . I 'm so glad that $ 4 or $ 5 or even $ 15 per gallon does n't affect you in your ivory tower . I 'm really happy for you . No really . Good for you . You 're not an out-of-touch , limousine socialist fuck face at all . Boo hoo I â€™ m gon na be a poor doctor someday said no one ever . Suck it up pussy
