Well as a Muslim and former Christian . What people would classify as `` aliens '' could be the angels There 's a YouTube islam video that says ufo could very well be angelic in their nature Also to mention also jinns which could also be called as spirits but there are many different types Perhaps all the legends and mythcial creatures could very well be the jinns but its just me trying to connect the dots for understanding But aliens are real but as a Muslim they are not really aliens since God tells us what they are and we know from the Islamic understanding God actually created jinns first before mankind and of course He created the angels before that The evil jinns are what you pretty much know as Demons A demon is a jinn but a jinn is not always a demon if that makes sense . We know why Muslims are not evil , .... However Jesus is going to come back it 's going to be riotous ... We love you our friends
