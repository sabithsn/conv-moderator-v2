...Did you really just call the people rounding up Jews "Holocaust survivors"? I don't use Twitter, I have no idea who Rosanne Barre is, and I really don't care- the facts are the facts. And the fact is that you are one of the most insane people I have ever had to speak with; Holocaust deniers have more intellectual honesty than you do at this point.

He never round up jews, and never said he did. How dishonest do you have to be?
