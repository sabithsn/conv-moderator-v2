Well you don’t understand the pro-freedom position here.    First baseline: A person has autonomy over their physical body.    Second baseline: What is entitled to rights isn’t “a life,” whatever that means, but the *person.*  The *person* doesn’t arise until the biological matter of a fetus becomes organized in such a way that a consciousness develops capable of feeling harm.  We’re not sure when exactly that happens, and it probably varies person-to-person.  We know it *isn’t* there at conception, and for a while after; we know it *is* there at birth, and a while before.  You try to pick a cutoff that’s safely in the “isn’t there” range.  Edit: personally, I think this is the key difference in philosophy: whether you believe that the thing deserving of consideration is the “life,” and that this comes in the form of an everlasting soul with some sort of transcendental character that outlasts the physical body.  Then it’s not the timing of biology that matters, but when the “soul” comes and attaches to the vessel.  Conception is a natural point to see this as occurring.

Are you saying it is ok to kill any life as long as it’s your right?
