OK.  Assuming you are correct.  Why not target   1. the whole continent of Africa:  1.216 billion people 2. the country of India:  1.38 billion people 3. the country of China: 1.402 billion people  That's a total of almost 4 billion people, which is more than half of the world's population of 7.9 billion.  Why the West?  What am I missing here?

What you're missing is a brain.
