This bill does not use the word gay . It simply states that , in Florida public schools , children from preschool through 3rd grade will not be taught about sex by the schools . At such a young age , children can not properly comprehend anything sexual . Of course , the left wants unfettered ac ess to children at this young age , so they can try to mold their attitudes around homosexuality and transgenderism . A person who wants to teach children about sex probably wants to * * * * them , too .
