Yeah , well I did n't like my dad 's rules about going to bed , but when you live somewhere rent free , you follow the rules . Nevermind the fact that they are n't even that strict of rules . Do n't drink and smoke in the hot tub , which logically makes sense because the wrong move could drop the vodka on the hot tub and the ashes from the weed could fall in the water leaving a big mess to clean up . Also there 's the soon to be added no skinny dipping , because if a neighbor sees you there might be a fine depending on where you are . That 's literally only two rules , one of which does n't even exist yet . If you have one rule to follow , follow it , because the rules could be much stricter than do n't mix these 3 things . You 're as mad as a cut snake !
