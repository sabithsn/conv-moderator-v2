If someone wants to be referred to by they/theirs/themselves , that 's far more palatable than having people demand I refer to them by female cat pronouns ( true story , nobody had a fucking clue what those are and she screamed and stormed out of the meeting ) . neopronouns aren â€™ t gender neutral you fuckin buffoon
