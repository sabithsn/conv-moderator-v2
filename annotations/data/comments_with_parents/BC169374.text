Oh lordie I ’ m right there with you . Can ’ t stand super hero movies . And I ’ ve seen them all because my kids love them . Honestly I sit in the theatre and listen to a podcast With the exception of deadpool . That actually made me laugh . The movie makes me think they just saw the cover and was like `` what 's this anime shit '' and did n't watch it lol ,
