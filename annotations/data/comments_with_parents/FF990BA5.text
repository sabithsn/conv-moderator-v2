It 's one of the things that blows my mind about modern politics . It used to be we all knew politicians lied and on tv they would obfuscate and avoid questions or lie by omission . These days they just straight up make shit up and people believe it . I 'm trying to think of a single point Biden made during his speech that approached even the neighborhood of reality . Unlike our last president , right guys ? /s
