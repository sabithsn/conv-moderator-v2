Sure . So long as every member of the coalition agrees with every other member 's shibboleths and absolutely nobody has a concrete goal in mind . Forming a coalition to appoint a subcommittee to politely debate the merits of advancing the awareness of cats with gingivitis and every lefty jumps on board .
