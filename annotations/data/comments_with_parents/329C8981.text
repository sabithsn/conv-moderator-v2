Of course there might be a small downtown area in many US cities that is compact and walkable , however zoom out and look in the surrounding areas where the vast majority of people actually live . https : //i.imgur.com/lSVE1v1.jpg This is a typical street in the city I live now . It stretches on like this for miles , people live in these buildings . On the ground floor there are shops , bars , supermarkets , gyms , schools etc so everything you need is walking distance or a short trip by public transport . I step out my door and the nearest big supermarket and tram stop are less than 2 minutes away by foot . https : //i.imgur.com/aOUVilj.jpg Gringos in denial . Our gov can â€™ t even be bothered to spend a dime on infrastructure . Wake up and cope with our shitty cities .
