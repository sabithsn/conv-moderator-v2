Oh you ’ re definitely right , it ’ s all a game to them . Democrats will bitch and moan about the filibuster , then will use it in the same week . It ’ s all about consolidating and holding power . My belief is that Republicans are finally starting to fight back dirty which Democrats have been doing for decades . Republicans just haven ’ t devolved to calling every political opponent a racist/bigoted/sexist/islamophobic/white supremacist/Neo nazi yet . Republicans have been playing dirty just as long . You ever looks at some districts in conservative areas ? The gerrymandering is super blatant .
