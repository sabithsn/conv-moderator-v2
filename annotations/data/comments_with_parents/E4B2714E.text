YTA . I have gone out dancing with guy friends before , and I would would be so confused if any of them thought something as casual as that was a date . It â€™ s not a date unless the word date is in the conversation . She drank three drinks , which at least for me , is enough to get drunk off . So as far as I see , you left a drunk girl alone at the club without a single text to tell her to get her own ride home just because you projected your own romantic feelings on the outing . Im just glad she made it home safe in the end . Boo hoo for the slutty ho .
