Same guys crying at the pump ( and sticking the stupid “ I did that ” stickers on the pumps ) are daily driving giant diesel trucks that they ’ ve never hauled or towed with while rolling coal in the face of every Japanese sedan , electric/hybrid vehicle , and every group of cyclists . Fuck those guys . Are you mentally handicapped by any chance ?
