Ok , so when police carry patrol rifles ( AR15 ) , it ’ s to kill as many people as possible . My rifles suck at their job because they ’ ve killed nobody . I want a refund ! No , all guns are used most often to punch holes in paper , and then second most often as a passive deterrent whose mere presence can prevent violence ( like a bank security guard ’ s gun in its holster ) . Actually killing people is somewhere way down the list . Don ’ t imbue guns with some magically mojo that means they must kill in human hands . That ’ s silly.and just because you name something doesn ’ t mean you get to use that definition as an assumption in your argument . 😂 . Self defense weapons are for SELF DEFENSE ! Look at how gross and dishonest this turd is . Randomly moves the goalposts and starts arguing .
