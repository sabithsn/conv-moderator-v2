Agreed. I just don’t understand why people are still dying on the hill that he was killing people indiscriminately when he clearly wasn’t. Just like how the shooting of Ashlie Babbitt was justified to protect members of congress. It’s fine to debate things like whether or not he should have been there, but people are bending over backwards and ignoring facts just to confirm their biases.

Because white people saying “I got scared “is used as justification to murder people constantly
