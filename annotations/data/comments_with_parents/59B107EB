> Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root. When he returned he shut it down immediately. He hadn't taken any of the steps.  Wasnt it also drug related? Like there was a fungus?

Kinda like how the problem underneath all this is the drastically low testosterone levels of western men right now?
