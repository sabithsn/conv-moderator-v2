Have you asked him why he uses the bathroom with shower/tub instead of the other one ? Perhaps he has a good reason to do so . I understand your annoyance but why do you have to shower in the morning every day ? I kinda think ESH because you could solve the problem easily , you just dont ' want to . He could also be nicer , but he ( apparently ) does n't want to . Both of you are acting out of convenience for yourselves . Just to take a shit and sometimes shave/fix hair etc . which could easily be done in the other bathroom .
