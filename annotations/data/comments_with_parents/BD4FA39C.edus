Man OK with 50/50 relationship as long as it 's to his advantage .
But as soon
as it barely compensates the woman ,
it 's transactional and gross .
Notice , they 're `` spiritually '' married 🙄 Being turned off by your `` wife '' responsibly planning out the financial logistics of pregnancy , birth ,
and child rearing is some next level clown shit
