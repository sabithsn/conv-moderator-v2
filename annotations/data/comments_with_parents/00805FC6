Watching without understanding a word isn't really useful. This article is unbiased, objective, well argumented. Parroting anti-russian propaganda under a bipartisan, unbiased article is just asinine, and shows 1- unwillingness to listen 2- parrotism 3- that you didn't come here to expand your understanding on the matter, but rather to crusade. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this isn't how discussion and argumenting works.

Ok. So because I disagree, I'm parroting propaganda?  You absolute load of cobalt. Get wrecked.
