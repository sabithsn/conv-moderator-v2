So a person with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is a man ? XY chromosomes , but has a vagina , a uterus , grows breasts during puberty , and when fully grown can not be distinguished from an XX female without a genetics test ; they think they are a woman , they look like a woman , talk like a woman , have the genitals of a woman ... you would call them a man ? Lol , shut up . We 're not talking about them .
