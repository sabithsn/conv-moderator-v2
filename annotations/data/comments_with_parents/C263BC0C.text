Or maybe you created a strawman , then rolled your eyes at your own argument . If you do n't know what you are talking about , at least stay silent so we can all assume you do . Inflation + drop of production in 2020-2021 , + increased demand after COVID + Biden EO 's and EPA So Biden had a choice . He could have : 1 . Did nothing . 2 . Made it easier for oil/gas companies . 3 . Made it harder for oil/gas companies . He chose option 3 because he does n't give a shit about US workers trying to get by as long as he can shift production overseas so the US can look cool with less pollution numbers , which he really ca n't , since overseas production is * also still recovering from the pandemic . * Amusingly the GOP gives less than a fuck about US Workers too unless it suits their current agenda or it â€™ s close to elections .
