NTA . You did a good thing trying to help that woman . Maybe tho just be straight and ask “ are you ok ? Would you like me to walk you to your car ? ” Maybe she didn ’ t come with you cuz she may have worried about your intentions . But at least you stuck around . Your friends are a bunch of cowards . The guy was a little aggressive but wasn ’ t violent . The fact they see a woman possibly in trouble and they decide to fucking run away like a bunch of chickens makes me want to say things that are not appropriate about them . Good for you for having the backbone to stick around to make sure the young woman was ok. Tell me , what do you think op would have done if the guy had gotten violent and put a nude through one of his friends necks ?
