If I had a box of 100 % red m & ms for 10,000 years
and I started slowly removing red m & ms
while putting cups of all the other colors of m & ms every year
where the trend was
that there would eventually be almost no red m & ms left are the red m & ms
being replaced in that box ?
Or is that a wild conspiracy theory and the red m & ms just need to learn to be multicultural ?
You idiots .
