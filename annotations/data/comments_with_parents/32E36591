GOP:  government of putin. Edit: I never said she wasn’t a democrat but after doing research something doesn’t smell right with her. She is now out of office and seemingly uninterested in politics. I believe she was a Russian plant but time will tell because I’m sure there will be many more investigations.   In addition: people who get on here and call others names because they disagree with them seem to know absolutely nothing about politics.

Shes a democrat dumbass
