If it did n't happen why wo n't she go on record denying the multiple statements from Trump 's administration officials that state she did ? Do n't worry you 're little heart , when the republicans sweep the House and Senate this November , they 'll have the opportunity to ask in front of Congress firsthand . Do you have any actual source or are you just peddling bullshit ? Bless your heart .
