The world is better with looters in it than killers (and people who simp for killers). People who fantasize about "preventing property crime" as a legal cover for killing are psychopaths. Murderers just waiting for an opportunity to get away with it.

I don't know, I think someone who defended themselves is better than a serial child molester and a domestic abuser, but that's just me.
