I know every has low expectations of senate republicans , but I 'll believe the nominee gets more than 51 votes when I see it . The one thing the GOP agrees on is judges , and they 're pissed off over what happened with Gorsuch , Kavanaugh , and ACB . I think the left us equally pissed that they stole gorsuch 's seat and rammed through another a week before the election
