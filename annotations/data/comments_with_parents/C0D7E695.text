Ok , but this logic is silly . If the ELI5 was `` how did Andrew Jackson peacefully remove the native Americans '' , the correct answer would be `` he did n't , he used force . '' You do n't think it would be at all disingenuous to force people to parrot Jackson 's reasoning rather than acknowledge that there was no good justification or peaceful removal . The real answer is that they do n't . You 're literally forcefully skewing the discussion in favor of pro military talking points . Bingo , I think the mod has a thing for making sure vets suffer
