YTA . Your callousness about her possibly jeopardizing her whole program is inconceivable . You admit she called all her contacts , and only asked you because she was desperate . You could â€™ ve had one of your friends come over and help you babysit if you were concerned . She was willing to do anything possible to have this work out and yet you would not . I might feel differently if it was an infant , but a three-year-old can articulate what they want and need to some extent . You think this prick has friends ?
