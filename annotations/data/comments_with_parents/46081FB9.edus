NTA Just because you are roommates doesn ’ t
mean you are required to watch her child .
She should have had backups or even paid a daycare to watch the child
if it was that important .
She didn ’ t think
things through and you have the full right
to refuse her Your view is valid king
I too would have felt uncomfortable with the responsibility of a roommates child OP is not a “ king ”
and you are both narcissistic assholes .
