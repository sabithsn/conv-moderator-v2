It's absolutely terrible and a crime against humanity. It also is an interesting barometer of trust, fear and uncomfortability. If you trust the government and big pharma, you got it quickly. If you don't, you got it once the social and financial pressure was unbearable. If you didn't by now, you're a rare breed of folks who have incredible mental fortitude and trust in themselves (and God)  I was prepared to have exactly that happen. Not taking the vaccine unless they physically force me to. I've been in really uncomfortable situations financially and otherwise -- and because Ive always managed to land on my feet, I was sure that if I got fired or worse I'd be ok.  At the same time there are certain responsibilities that I dont have -- and people who don't depend on me or my income to survive so I can see how difficult that decision was for many people.  For me though -- I was prepared to die rather than get the vaccine.

Wrong.  We all need to be ready to kill.
