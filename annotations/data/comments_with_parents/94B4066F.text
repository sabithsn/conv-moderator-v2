Aaand right on cue , and just what we had mentioned prior , we have another delusional Leftist projection on display yet again . Only the 700th example just today . You all are so predictable that it 's boring . The fact is you know nothing about me or what I believe in . Painting with such a broad brush is such a bad look that no neutral observer is ever going to side with you . What am I wrong then , coward ?
