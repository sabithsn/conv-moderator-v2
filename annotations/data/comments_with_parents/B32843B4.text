It 's been almost 9 years since Edward Snowden leaked documents detailing the breadth and depth of NSA 's domestic surveillance capabilities . A few specific programs were curtailed or modified , which up until that point you were called a conspiracy theorist for suggesting existed or even could exist . The truth is , the PATRIOT Act merely codified into law * some * of what was actually being done . The bulk of what surveillance state critics oppose is not in any statutes , but classified and in black projects , with civilian oversight from the maybe the President and * maybe * the Gang of Eight . If I understand the motivation behind OP 's view , it 's that we should change our government such that the intelligence agencies and their private sector partners do not wield such enormous , unchecked power through a government which is meant to be democratic and constrained by the Constitution . OP appears to think repealing PATRIOT/USA FREEDOM would solve the problem . You point out that these laws are n't really on the books , and I tend to agree . My point is that the intelligence `` community '' is abusing their power whether it 's legal or not . You ask which particular programs , but we do n't even know what programs exist , although I think it 's safe to assume they are at least as invasive and dangerous as they were when we last got a peek in 2013 . Why do you think they 're abusing their power ? If anything , the IC acts with kid gloves on .
