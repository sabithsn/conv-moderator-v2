Exactly, and last I checked [William Tecumseh Sherman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman) (a Union General) was a Republican and he single handedly crushed the confederate infrastructure in his [march to the Sea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea)

Your really not doing Republicans any favor by associating Sherman with them. What's next, John Brown?
