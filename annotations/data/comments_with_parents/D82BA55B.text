I avoid arguing with him . It gives him the idea that we are equal . We are not . I mostly feel bad for him . Yes he gets on my last nerve . Yes he makes me wan na scream . But I know it must be hard for him . Not having friends , not wanting to compromise the slightest in order to get friends . He either cries when I get onto him or times me out completely . There 's no win . I 've tried the calm talk , the polite requests , the stern voice , the strict rules , you name it . I was actually thinking military school but he 's so sensitive . Do you hear yourself ? ? You hate your child . Of course they behave like this . This is so sad .
