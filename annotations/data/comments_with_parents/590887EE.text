Any social animal will have a greater sense of kinship than solitary ones . Canine packs ' internal hierarchies are predicated upon kin relationship with the eldest breeding female being the head of the pack . Mothers and fathers who play an active role in rearing young will definitely have a sense of `` these are my babies '' and young reared together will have a sense of `` these are my brothers and sisters '' . That sense of kinship becomes more nebulous as generations widen . Normally , as pups grow up , they move on and start their own families . In households where a litter is kept together , this sense of kinship will probably continue beyond its natural longevity . But when a grown pup has pups of its own , the grandparent might delight in the novelty of being around puppies again , they probably do not have the same strong sense of kinship with the young . Keep in mind , it 's hard to say what is `` natural '' with domestic canines since by domesticating them and rearing them in an artificial environment , dogs are kind of reinventing their nature from scratch all the time . For all we know , there might be a grandmother dog who knows for a fact that a puppy is her grandpuppy based on her personal experience and ability to connect the dots . Do dogs even understand that puppies come from sexual intercourse ?
