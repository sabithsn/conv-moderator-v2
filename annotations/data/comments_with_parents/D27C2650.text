Yep . Like Ron White use to say : you ca n't fix stupid . The sad part is the working class moderate democrats will feel the pinch just as much as everybody else . It 's them that might get red pilled during this fiasco of the potato administration . That 's the only positive in this mess . You can absolutely fix stupid , but sadly the cure is considered inappropriate for modern society .
