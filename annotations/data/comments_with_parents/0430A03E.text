> I just never gave them a reason to escalate . Why should we have to live in such fear of these cops ? They do n't protect and serve anyone but themselves . They are far too quick to escalate over anything , and it 's so wrong that it 's never their fault . Fuck the police . I actually know several police officers , they have placed themselves in danger to protect people multiple times . So go Fuck yourself .
