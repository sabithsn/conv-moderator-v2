Did they not ? I think beliefs are different than labels . The Democrats and Republicans of today are very different of the ones just 20 years ago , imagine 70 or even 100 . This is just petty and dumb . Democrats are still committing genocide and eugenics on the black population . No I think nothing has changed actually .
