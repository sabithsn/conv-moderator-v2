Dear god , I will * * never be able to unread this * * . > Thousands of men , women , children and infants interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection , often without anesthesia and usually ending with the death of the victim . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In a video interview , former Unit member Okawa Fukumatsu admitted to having vivisected a pregnant woman . [ 27 ] Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases . Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners , removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body > Prisoners had limbs amputated in order to study blood loss . Those limbs that were removed were sometimes re-attached to the opposite sides of the body . Some prisoners had their stomachs surgically removed and the esophagus reattached to the intestines . Parts of organs , such as the brain , lungs , and liver , were removed from some prisoners . [ 26 ] Imperial Japanese Army surgeon Ken Yuasa suggests that the practice of vivisection on human subjects was widespread even outside Unit 731 , [ 29 ] estimating that at least 1,000 Japanese personnel were involved in the practice in mainland China . [ 30 ] > Human targets were used to test grenades positioned at various distances and in various positions . Flamethrowers were tested on people . [ 43 ] Victims were also tied to stakes and used as targets to test pathogen-releasing bombs , chemical weapons , shrapnel bombs with varying amounts of fragments , and explosive bombs as well as bayonets and knives . > In other tests , subjects were deprived of food and water to determine the length of time until death ; placed into low-pressure chambers until their eyes popped from the sockets ; experimented upon to determine the relationship between temperature , burns , and human survival ; pumped full of horse blood ; hung upside down until death ; crushed with heavy objects ; electrocuted ; dehydrated with hot fans ; [ 46 ] placed into centrifuges and spun until death ; injected with animal blood ; exposed to lethal doses of x-rays ; subjected to various chemical weapons inside gas chambers ; injected with sea water ; and burned or buried alive . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] In addition to chemical agents , the properties of many different toxins were also investigated by the Unit . Holy shit ! How is it the Nazi death camps got so much coverage while THIS is pretty much never discussed in the West ?
