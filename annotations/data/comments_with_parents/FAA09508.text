I go out of my way to try and not buy anything Chinese made , but even a lot of American made stuff has components manufactured in China . I ’ ll pay more to get quality American stuff . It ’ s work though and I know lots of people who can ’ t be bothered . Anyone addict to Amazon ’ s convenience isn ’ t concerned about Chinese crap as long as it ’ s same day delivery . So maybe shame those fucks who ca n't be bothered and stand up for your principles ?
