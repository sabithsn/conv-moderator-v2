The only women I hear standing with men's basic rights are wanting to go back to traditionalism which includes a very exploitive marriage contract.  Any woman that truly supports men's basic rights would not be trying to also exploited us and I can tell you from at least my experience is that 99.9% of women do not care enough to consider the issues that matter to men's humanity.... sorry for the big red pill.  Just dig a little deeper and ask questions it's not like they hide this stuff they are truly narcissistic

Any man who supports women’s rights is equally delusional. Trash don’t deserve rights.
