National Socialism isn ’ t the same as socialism . It was as an appropriation of the appeal of socialism but through a fascist nationalist party . Also keep in mind how monikers of political parties do not correspond with their actual values . Otherwise Republicans would call themselves Neo-Fascist Party . I don ’ t think you know what fascist means .
