YTA , you missed your daughter 's birthday ? For anything other than a genuine crisis ? You said Ryan was a mess , that 's not the same as ' I have to miss your birthday because my friend is suicidal in an immediate and obvious way ' . Even then , sheesh . Your kid will very likely remember and be hurt . What would Ryan say if he knew you 'd dumped your baby girl on her birthday to fish ? You need to bend over backwards to make it up to your daughter . Read between the fucking lines . Also , if he outright said “ suicidal ” his post would be immediately removed .
