So you are salty at the tax loopholes (created by poorly written government tax legislature) and your solution is…checks notes…more (likely poorly written and full of loopholes) government tax legislature.   If there is no incentive for people to become wealthy from the results of their hard work, ingenuity, perseverance, or just plain luck, then why would they do it? This wealth, by the way, lifts up all around them with jobs, new products, and yes, even a larger tax base.

No, it is to FIX a problem... for being patriots you all hate this country.
