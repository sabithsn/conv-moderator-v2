Greene actually voted YEA while Gosar did n't vote . 8 Republicans did n't vote . 1 Democrat did n't vote ( Pocan ) . I 'm curious why he did n't vote since he 's an openly gay representative that got into politics due his personal experience with gay bashing . EDIT : He was probably not present for a legitimate reason and it does n't appear that the bill had any chance of failing anyway . Because he probably isnt gay and just used it to get some noobs to vote for him .
