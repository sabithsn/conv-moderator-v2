And who ridicules men when they get assaulted? Who tells them that they should have liked it? Who tells them to man up? Other men. I'd rather be a woman because at least we have a sense of community, when I feel down I talk to OTHER women, men don't do that because of this weird patriarchal system they've built. If you wanna talk stats, the reason suicide is so high is because men SUCCEED more due to owning firearms because manly men own firearms. Women actually ATTEMPT at a higher rate. Sexism against men can't exist without sexism against women. Don't complain about a society you built.

? Women bully and judge other women all the time,
