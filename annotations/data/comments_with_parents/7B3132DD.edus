Ok ,
so if I describe my coffee as `` black , ''
it 's perfectly acceptable for me to call it `` n-word ''
when describing the colour ?
The point is that the n word , a racial slur , is offensive regardless of the context .
White , black , and cracker are all words
that are used
to describe other things .
No ,
because black coffee is a description ...
so you 're saying
`` you filthy black bastard '' should n't be racist ?
Piss off troll .
