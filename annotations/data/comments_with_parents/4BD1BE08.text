You own a convenience store . Someone comes inside and does ... whatever . You want them out . You call the police to get them out . Police show up and to avoid the `` just following orders '' they just politely hold this persons hand and pinky promise that they 'll stay on the outside of your store . Like wtf would you expect or want them to do ? First of all , if I owned a convenience store and someone would n't leave when I asked , I 'd fuck them up . Problem solved .
