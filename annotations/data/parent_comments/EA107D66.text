Because most people use the mouse the right hand and therefore the left hand is fairly conveniently on ASDF (for most typists) with W being an easy reach (X is harder to reach). This is convenient for games where mouse controls actions and WASD controls movements (for most people). This started in (probably) the early 90s as the mouse became more popular. Prior to that, it was arrow keys for the right hand.
