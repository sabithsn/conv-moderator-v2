You see there is a difference. You just saw yourself that being Gay and living a gay live is totally fine in Ukraine.  But demanding special parent rights, some sort of marriage (trying to apporpate marriage) and trying to bring lbtq shit int othe school to teach little children is completly different.  Americans have to understand that over 95% of the people in this world find it totally weird, yes you can do it in private but don't bother the rest of the people. Americans can't seem to understand that other natiosn have different philosohpies and cultures. Which is strange for a place that was once knows for tolerance.  I also don't go to india or japan and espect them to find my german livestyle totally fine. I can't even do many things I am used to in germany in america as it would be agaisnt the law xDDD so do I not have as many rights in America than I would in germany?? On the other sides some stuff is illegal in germany that is fine in the US that's jsut how cultures work.  If you only support countries with the same culture and believes congrats, you are a racist.
