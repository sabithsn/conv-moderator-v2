My response to this is “ I ’ m not here
to make friends .
I ’ ll be professional with everyone .
I ’ ll be polite with most .
I ’ ll even be cordial with some .
If we become friends through shared interests and experiences ,
so be it .
But that isn ’ t why I ’ m here ,
so that isn ’ t going to be something
for which I actively seek . ”
