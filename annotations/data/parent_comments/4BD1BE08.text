You own a convenience store. Someone comes inside and does... whatever. You want them out. You call the police to get them out. Police show up and to avoid the "just following orders" they just politely hold this persons hand and pinky promise that they'll stay on the outside of your store. Like wtf would you expect or want them to do?
