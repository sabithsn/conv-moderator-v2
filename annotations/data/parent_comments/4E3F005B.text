You don't get to tell me, or any victim, how we get to feel about what happened to us.  Have you been gang raped?  Let me know how "dramatized" it is after you've been violated so fucking disgustingly.   Those men didn't take care of me.  They didn't go to war for me.  I take care of myself.  And just FYI, women have served in the military for decades- including combat.  You wanna tell those female Army rangers that their job is to "have babies"?  Good luck with that one.  Studies show 90 percent of women do not regret their abortions afterwards.  It doesn't "haunt them".  Please leave your medieval attitude about gender roles behind and join us in the year 2022.  Women are allowed to opt out of motherhood, have careers, and not be forced to mangle their bodies and risk their lives for a pregnancy they never wanted.
