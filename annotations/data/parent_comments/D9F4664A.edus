I really love this post
because the more this happens the more men will be fearful of watching porn .
There was a time
where women had a higher standard about how men interacted with women and graphic imagery .
The more this happens and the more men hear about it ,
the more likely the next generation of men will see watching porn as a problem in a relationship .
