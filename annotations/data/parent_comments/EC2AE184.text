I'm incredulous that a white person living in 2022 in today's society is unaware of the n-word or the ramifications of saying it.  > Your assumption is laziness. You're drawing on what you perceive everyone should act like according to your own lazy conclusion. Again, that's not everyone else's problem. That's yours. And you, yourself, will be judged accordingly.  uh huh, so it's lazy when I judge intent but it's not lazy when you do it  got it  you just want to support people saying racial slurs, I get it.  lol this dude deleted his account
