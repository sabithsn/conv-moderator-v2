This is a stupid post. Yes, it's unpopular, usually I'd upvote it, but it's too ignorant so I won't.  These women have obviously moved on and want a better life for themselves. They've probably been sacked from jobs or have limited job opportunities in the first place, because of their videos on the internet. They want to move on from that phase of their life.   "Actions have consequences." Do me a favor and Google some of these pornstars, not to see their porn content, but to read about their upbringing, their childhood and what brought them to the porn industry in the first place. You'd find that the majority didn't enthusiastically jump to the opportunity because it was there childhood dream. There's usually a lot of coercion involved, some of them were homeless on the streets and when this opportunity was presented to them, they thought they had no other choice. There are usually drugs involved, and a lot of them were raped and forced to perform sexual actions they weren't comfortable with,  even though this wasn't initially agreed upon. If they refused, they were told they wouldnt get paid and thrown out the door.   The fact that you think women benefit from this is extremely tone deaf and misogynistic. Please try harder (if you're even trying at all) to be a better person.
