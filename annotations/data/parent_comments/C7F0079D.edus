I don ’ t judge them for being picky alone ,
but pickyness is a VERY strong sign of immaturity and a sheltered/spoiled personality .
You aren ’ t
born with and stuck with the tastes and dislikes you have ;
you develop them
and can change them .
Case in point :
I intentionally taught myself to like sardines
because they ’ re healthy , cheap , and convenient .
