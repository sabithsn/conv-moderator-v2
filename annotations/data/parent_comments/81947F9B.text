This shit has made me despise so many people. I live in ottawa and my roommate has been posting stories about the “terrorists” and all the other names your average re university girl would say multiple times a day. This girls brain is straight rot from this shit. You’d think we live right next to the honking right? No. We literally can’t even hear it. Still downtown, I saw them coming in on the highway and it was based as fuck.
