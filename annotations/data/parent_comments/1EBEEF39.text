Also the left, and really everyone should. Because the whole point of DuckDuckGo was that it was googling without the bullshit, the tracking, and the manipulation. Their whole deal was not doing shit like this.  I mean sure, fine, point out that Russians are spreading misinformation, fucking even do so all over your webpage. Give big fat warning signs if you feel inclined. Fuck it, add a redirect message saying "YOU'RE ENTERING A RUSSIAN STATE OUTLET" or whatever, But downranking search results is exactly what DuckDuckGo was supposed to not do.
