Mmhmm and how often do you envision that happens ?
And
when it 's a whole team of medical professionals ,
it 's hardly just the kid and/or their parent making rash decisions ,
now is it ?
And Abbott is n't just targeting ultra-rare cases of 17yos not being made
to wait until their 18th birthday
when a whole group of various types of doctors thinks
there 's a damn good reason ,
now is he ?
Ignorance is the hallmark of this bill
and people like you .
