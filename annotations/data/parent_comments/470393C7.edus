I think
both of them are more or less politically inconsequential .
Donald Trump did n't do anything as president in a legislative capacity
that will endure ,
and Biden is shaping up to be more or less the same .
( Though I would say
that there 's a notable difference in that Trump did n't even TRY to do anything in a legislative capacity ) .
