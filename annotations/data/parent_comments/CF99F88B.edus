Unfortunately ,
if you live in America ,
you don ’ t have universal healthcare ,
so it is significantly harder to get medication and therapy , especially for mental health .
I ’ m currently in cognitive behavioral therapy for my OCD .
Insurance doesn ’ t cover it ,
so it ’ s 300 bucks a session ,
which I ’ m very lucky
to be able to afford .
