Please watch the whole interview. It’s crystal clear he is not praising Putin. I’m no trump fan at all but he did not side with or praise Putin. He’s admitted that Putin’s moves are crafty and calculated. Putin is evil not stupid. That’s all trump said. Do you think Putin is stupid? I don’t think it’s wise to underestimate an opponent
