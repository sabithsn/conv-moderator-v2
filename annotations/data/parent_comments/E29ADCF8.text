Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose, get over it. He stated he couldn’t breath before the shoulder blade kneeling (widely accepted pinning move around the world).  What’s his face in Kenosha was warned multiple multiple times to surrender then proceeded to grab a deadly weapon.  Officers only respond with lethal force if they are met with it 99.99% of the time.  I’m pro law and order. Every single time a protestor was injured was because they were breaking the law. As is currently stated “fuck around and find out”. If you obey the law and listen to what a cop tells you to do you will never be shot. There is also going to be a fringe case that this doesn’t happen, the very few and far between don’t justify massive riots resulting in devastation to the locals of the affected areas.
