Yep, you're damn right.  My grandfather, a Navy Vet who served his country for ***five decades***, spent his final hours dying of Covid, alone in a hospital.  And no one was allowed to be there with him at the end.  Fuck Trump and everyone who enabled his bullshit.  Don't ***ever*** forget what these traitors did.
