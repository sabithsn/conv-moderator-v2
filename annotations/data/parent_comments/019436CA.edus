Not Romanians , but Roma .
They 're basically a culture of wandering nomads
that go from country to country setting up shop .
Their culture as a whole kinda goes against most countries they go to ,
so they get a lot of hate .
I lived in Hungary for a while
and while I only believe in the individual ,
I met a lot of individually shitty gypsies
