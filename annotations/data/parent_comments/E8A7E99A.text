2 things when dealing with the age of consent concerning libertarians.  1.) Libertarians are against a GOVERNMENT enforced age of consent, NOT the concept of an age of consent.   Libertarians do not believe that the department of government should be able to arbitrarily pull a number out of the sky and put people in jail over it (which is basically the argument FOR the Romeo and Juilet laws that protect, for example, a 17 yr old male, that was dating and having intercourse with a 17 yr old female and because he turned 18 and continues to date the 17 yr old, he's now committing statutory rape).  The Department of government in Michigan says 16 is the legal age of consent. If a 16 year  old and 18 year have sex, it's legal. However, in New Jersey the legal consent age is 17. Which means if the same 2 people in Michigan go to NJ and have sex, the 18 yr has committed statutory rape AND can be changed for sex trafficking of a minor (from Michigan to NJ).  This is proposterous.   This is what MY Libertarians have a problem with.  2.) Many many moons ago, before we had the data we have today of the extremely long list of adverse side effects people face when they're sexualized as a child, the leaders of the Libertarian movement said, "if the child consents."  Libertarianism is about NOT harming peaceful people.   The data we have today, that proves the sexualization of children leads to mental illnesses, emotional disturbance, addiction, prostitution, lack of empathy and sympathy, suicide, etc., no Libertarian could promote such a thing, because it would be antithetical to the philosophy.
