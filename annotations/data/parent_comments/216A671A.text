People just want warm happy feelings of security. Its a "lie to me" thing.  They don't want the truth just a reason to "feel safe".  The masks the vax were all ploys to make sheep "feel safe".  Its like a gate around a sheep herd. It wont keep wolves out, but if you tell the sheep the fence is for their safety, they will happily oblige to the gate. All the while its just a trap set for them. The wolves can still get in.
