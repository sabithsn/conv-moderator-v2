[Here is a list of ongoing armed conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts). Of the major ones, I count 1 conflict in a Buddhist country, 2 conflicts between Islamic countries, and 2 conflict between Christian countries. 3 non-Islamic conflicts > 2 Islamic conflicts.  Of the ones with between 1000-9999 deaths, I count 8 in predominantly Christian countries, and 8 in predominantly Islamic countries, and 2 in countries that are both Christian and Islamic. Basically an even split.  Does that help?
