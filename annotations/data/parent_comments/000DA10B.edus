For the last time , we do not care
if they are ethnically sinti , roma or local driving people .
We just do n't like a way
of living
that promotes archaic womens rights , isolationism and a social hierarchy
that 's build upon clans .
pls do n't ban this ,
I 'm just trying to explain it to uninvolved people .
