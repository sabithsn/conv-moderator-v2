Yea , because Dems were n't doing this all along .
< rolls eyes > Oh right they WERE doing it all along
but the media just downplayed it
when DEMS did it
and reported it every time the DEMS complained about the GOP .
If the DEMS want to call it a problem ,
they should simply lead by example
and stop doing it .
