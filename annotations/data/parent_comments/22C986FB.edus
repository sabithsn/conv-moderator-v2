> Why do n't lions kill other lions all the time
if
they DONT have the same morality
that humans have ?
Lions do kill each other all the time .
As soon as a new male takes over a pride of lions
he will murder the cubs of the previous male .
I love how u/nhlms81 called you out for answering a question with a question ,
and then you just do it again .
