OP didn ’ t barge in .
If you read the post ,
the kid was unconsolable with just the gf ,
so OP came to pick him up .
Also in the post , OP says
she asked the gf
if she bought the cookies - gf
admitted no ,
meaning most likely they were OP ’ s ex ’ s cookies , aka the father .
Edit :
Love all the downvotes ,
but legit none of y ’ all read the post
and you ’ re salty .
