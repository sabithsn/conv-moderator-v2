He's made a career out of being a piece of shit. Even if he gets run out of Congress (as he should), there's no shortage of do-nothing opportunities as a talking head on right-wing propaganda outlets that are hungry for yet another literal, straight-up Nazi to spew fascist bullshit.   This shithead literally bombed out of a hyper-"Christian" diploma-mill of a "university" after ONE SEMESTER, during which the staff and RAs were told to warn female students to never allow themselves to be alone with Cawthorn because he would very likely rape them.  And that's BEFORE he got elected and promptly tried to betray his oath of office and overthrow the Constitution.This is the cream of the crop that the GOP can muster. They're a party of, by, and for assholes.
