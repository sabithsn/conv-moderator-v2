Those studies seem to count things like playing doctor
and `` I 'll show
you mine
if you show me yours ''
which is pretty innocent and not really sexual .
Contrast this with the Kinsey report ,
which specifically defines it as physical contact
and being brought to orgasm .
You can see how these are very different topics .
