No, you don't.   Science, specifically, scientific ideas and theories, changes with added information.  You don't understand science or the scientific method.  Science learning new things is why we don't use asbestos as fake snow, when at one point it was considered harmless.  Science is why we don't think illnesses are curses, when at one point they were considered as such.  You're just an idiot.  Also, you don't know what a cold is.  It's a series of symptoms, not an actual disease, since those symptoms can be caused by hundreds of viruses, mostly rhinoviruses.
