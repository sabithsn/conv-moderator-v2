They completely fell for it all ,
beginning with the `` Russian collusion '' , then another thing , and another thing ,
and then they actually believed
the MSM was telling them the truth .
So at this point they 're so embarrassed for buying into all of it ,
it 's just easier for them to keep going with the propaganda ,
because
if JUST one thing
they were lied to about actually materializes then they can say
`` I told you so ,
I was right '' .
