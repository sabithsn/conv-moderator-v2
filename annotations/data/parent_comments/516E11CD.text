I fail to think of any credible daily situations where your two examples occur.  In fact the only times you would not have absolute rights over your body is in extreme medical situations where you are in danger and unable to make a rational choice or if you are a woman wanting an abortion.  Does that happen so often to you that you require to vent about it?
