Or maybe you created a strawman, then rolled your eyes at your own argument.  If you don't know what you are talking about, at least stay silent so we can all assume you do.  Inflation + drop of production in 2020-2021, + increased demand after COVID + Biden EO's and EPA  So Biden had a choice.  He could have:  1. Did nothing. 2. Made it easier for oil/gas companies. 3. Made it harder for oil/gas companies.  He chose option 3 because he doesn't give a shit about US workers trying to get by as long as he can shift production overseas so the US can look cool with less pollution numbers, which he really can't, since overseas production is *also still recovering from the pandemic.*
