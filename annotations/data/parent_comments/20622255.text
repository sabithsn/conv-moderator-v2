Here's an interesting one I learned.lately...... You know when your bladder is full and you desperately need to wee ? Well, turns out your bladder cannot feel " full" it can only feel "heavy". So astronaut s in space HAVE to go per every couple of hours...'cos without gravity...they simply do not know if they need to or not !!!
