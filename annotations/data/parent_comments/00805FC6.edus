Watching
without understanding a word
is n't really useful .
This article is unbiased , objective , well argumented .
Parroting anti-russian propaganda under a bipartisan , unbiased article is just asinine ,
and shows 1- unwillingness to listen 2- parrotism 3-
that you did n't come here
to expand your understanding on the matter , but rather to crusade .
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news ,
but this is n't how discussion and argumenting works .
