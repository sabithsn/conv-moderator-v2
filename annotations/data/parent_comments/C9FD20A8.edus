I know ,
this is exasperating .
How can it be Biden 's fault .
He communicated to the world what Putin was planning to do ,
and what the rest of the world would do
if he did those things .
( This was his off ramp ) .
He did those things and now we should feel bad
that he does n't have a way
to walk it back ?
BTW , he does have a way out ...
he could get his troops out of Ukraine .
This article carries Putin 's water .
