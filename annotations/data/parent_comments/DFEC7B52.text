If I posted this headline without the link I’d be called a conspiracy theorist:  “The US federal government will no longer require hospitals to report the number of people who die from COVID-19 every day, according to new guidelines from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  On January 6, the HHS published updated guidelines on which information hospitals provide to the agency. The guidelines note the “retirement of fields which are no longer required to be reported,” among which is “Previous day’s COVID-19 deaths.”  The guidelines note, “This field has been made inactive for the federal data collection. Hospitals no longer need to report these data elements to the federal government.” This change goes into effect February 2.”  Does this have anything to do with the Uk updating their deaths ‘by Covid’ down 7-9x and the huge investigation going on in the UK by CID and international criminal investigations?  Are we headed for a similar ‘update’ of the pumped official numbers in the US as well?  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/01/19/high-covid-death-rates-include-people-did-not-die-virus-admits/  https://youtu.be/9UHvwWWcjYw
