It's something definitely important to think about when you think about Trump's foreign policy:   Donald J Trump is the first president in 50 years not to get America involved in a new war.  For whatever reasons you may or may not agree with, that is a fact etched permanently in history.  Donald J Trump spent his entire administration not starting new wars.  Between Feb 2 and Feb 24, Biden moved 10,000 troops into Ukrainian territory, and both sides of the conflict, both Ukraine and Russia said that he was escalating the situation unnecessarily.   We had 4 years of no new wars.  Now we have American troops in a warzone.  These are not opinions.  This is not speculation.  I understand that there's a large section of America, millions of people, who genuinely think he's some kind of fascist antichrist who was biding his time to turn America into some Russian puppet state, but that never happened.  Donald J Trump never started a new war.  Biden did.
