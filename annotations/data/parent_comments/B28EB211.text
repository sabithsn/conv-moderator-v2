Yup, that's why I walk out and go to a a different store that respects their customers or order online. They don't deserve my business if they act that way.  Keep in mind this only happens like 5% of the time most stores employees will just walk up say hi ask if I need help and then let me do my thing. Only about 5% of the time they start pushing me to buy stuff I'm not looking for or open a credit card with them.
