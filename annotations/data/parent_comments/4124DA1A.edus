You know , even as much as i dislike Furries ...
they are n't inherently sexual .
Just like OP you have no idea
what the fuck you 're talking about ,
but at least he is willing to read comments .
I was going to ask
if you even read my reply actually ,
but clearly you did n't , or lack the brain capacity
for it ... i literally addressed Pride in my comment .
