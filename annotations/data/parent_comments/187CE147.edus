Not sure where `` millions '' comes from .
In America , certainly some businesses suffered from the lockdowns ,
though * many * made up the difference
( and then some )
via PPP money .
Same for people
who lost their jobs ,
due to lockdowns .
Other than that , I do n't think
any lives were ruined from wearing a mask .
Many lives were * saved * from ruin , via the vaccine .
