This is not a question of religion but of so many other things.   I live in a muslim country and i have only been met with respect, protection and kindness from other men (i am a woman). In the workplace i am listened to and respected just like my male coworkers. In the streets i am respected and/or saluted with kindness from muslim men. In no moment did i feel harassed in this country. But when I lived in Northern Europe and South America? Harassed all the time and victim of sexism every day.   Islam. Is. Not. The. Problem.   The problem is many things, such as: war trauma through generations that result in extremism and collective vindictiveness.  It’s lack of education, lack of support, extremely hard life and finding some sort of comfort in groups of extremists who convince you that women are supposed to be your sex slaves.  It’s untreated mental illness and PTSD disguised as “holy war in Allahs name”.   Fugitives come with all sorts of baggage and they need help and treatment and proper individual evaluation. It’s dangerous not to help them when they show up at your doorstep!
