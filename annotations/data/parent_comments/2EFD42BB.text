NTA. He’s pushing boundaries. Run far far away.  Edit: and if your parents see that as mature I mean okay I guess? I don’t understand “old school” or traditional people HOWEVER they should respect that it made you uncomfortable and understand that it was something you set as a line or boundary and he crossed it. He waited until he felt safe and in the clear to do something you specifically said you did not want to happen.  Edit 2: maybe I should rephrase, I understand the old school/traditional views but I don’t agree with them in most cases. Still NTA.
