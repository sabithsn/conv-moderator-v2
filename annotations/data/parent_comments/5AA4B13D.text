Influenza is endemic in the human population and - like coronaviruses - has a reservoir in non-human hosts. At the molecular level, the reason for the antigenic drift into other species is the homology in the receptors that the viral class utilizes to gain cellular entry. For influenza the HA surface receptors on the viral particles latch onto the α2,6- or α2,3-linked sialic acid groups on glycosylated surface proteins (proteins with sugar groups terminating in sialic acid abundant on cell surfaces in most mammals). For coronaviruses, the hosts ACE2 receptor that is quite ubiquitous in mammals and found on the surface of nearly every tissue type is the entry point for infection via binding of the coronavirus spike protein to host ACE2. Thus, like influenza, coronaviruses experience antigenic drift as well in other hosts. When you have a zoonotic jump to another species the host-adaptation period for the viral clade can almost “begin again”. So after some time “x”, the viral clade deviates in the new host species. Then after some time “y”, a mutation occurs in a novel clade in a distal species that permits transmission between the original host species. Much like H5N1 (influenza), influenza does this every decade or so on average. The original host species often does not recognizing the new clade when it jumps back, so like a clown jumping out in front of your car, the immune system being the car, pumps the breaks and has to fire up the “oh shit a new pathogen” pathway vs “I’ve seen this before run the clown over”.   Evolution requires time and chance, a high error in replication ‘speeds’ this process up. Influenza and coronaviruses have RNA genomes, which does accelerate the chance of an error occurring relative to DNA viruses.
