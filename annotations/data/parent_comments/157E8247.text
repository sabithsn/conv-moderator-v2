Linking being gay to pedophilia is a pretty big stretch and poor logic.  If that was the case, there would never be adult men who abuse little girls.  The evidence doesn't support your view.  For the record - gay adults are attracted to other gay adults.  Pedos are attracted to children regardless of their sexual orientation.
