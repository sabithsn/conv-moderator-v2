If you're a politician who has been pro mask mandate, then you fu**ing better be wearing a mask when you go out, I don't care what state you happen to be in at the time. If you're not, people at large should be able to forcefully put one on your face.  We the People are beyond sick and tired of the whole, "for thee but not for me," bullshit, and I'm really wondering how much longer we're going to take it.
