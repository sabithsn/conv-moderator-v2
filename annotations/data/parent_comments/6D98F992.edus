My bad .
I guess
I could have given some context .
Okay so you remember
how he was impeached the first time
for trying to blackmail Zelensky in pursuit of his own goals ?
That was the “ quid pro quo ”
that everybody was so upset about at the time .
It left Ukraine vulnerable
when they were asking for help trying to avoid this war and there ’ s a good reason
why it ’ s illegal .
