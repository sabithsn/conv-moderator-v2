agree, it's kinda funny to see how quickly ppl are quick to accuse others of being racist and what they choose to speak up on. I feel like with this OP it's mainly just ignorance, but a lot of ppl who agree and feel it was important to call out the black girl for being "racist" probably wouldn't hold that same energy if it were a group of white ppl discussing poc.
