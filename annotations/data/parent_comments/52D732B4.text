If you took the loan out you are responsible for paying it back. This is whatâ€™s called being an adult. I just made my last payment last summer (original balance $60k)  It took me 15 years of hard work but I got it paid off all on my own. If you sign up for the loan you are responsible for paying it back. This is the honest way.
