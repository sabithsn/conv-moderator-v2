I've been listening to metal since the 70's mate. Up until the Internet came along, the metal community was defined by your mates, people at gigs, Kerrang, Metal Hammer, independent record shops and tape trading. If it was loud, with distorted guitars, heavy bass and drumming, it was in. You didn't have to like every single band but disputing their existence as a metal band was just silly.    When the community moved online people started getting uppity about what constituted metal. It's gotta do *this* or *that* or the other otherwise its not 'real' metal.  None of that shit matters. I personally like Wikipedia's definition of metal: "Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes." If a band's output regularly meets that definition, they're metal to me.  This includes everything from Black Sabbath to Babymetal to Lorna Shore to Slipknot to Slayer to Rammstein to BoltThrower to to Zeal & Ardor. You don't have to like these bands (I don't like Babymetal at all) but that doesn't mean they're not a metal band, it just means they're a metal band you don't personally enjoy.  The gatekeepers and elitists of metal are not the metal community. They don't set the rules. They're just a bunch of small 'c' conservatives who lack the capacity to appreciate nuance and growth. Fuck 'em.
