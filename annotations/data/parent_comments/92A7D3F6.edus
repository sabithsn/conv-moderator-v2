Generally ,
taking a killer at their word
is not considered legal proof beyond a shadow of a doubt
that a murder was justified .
Imagine if they go unpunished .
Then anyone
who wanted to kill someone ,
for whatever reason ,
could involk the `` he was a child molester '' defense .
You 're right
that most teens are n't brutal murderers .
But brutal murderers will most definitely use this defense is
they think
it might work .
How could anyone be trusted after that ?
