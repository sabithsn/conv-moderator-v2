>So you started a discussion with no intention of changing your view. Since this is by definition a space for thoughts and feelings and not actions. Rad.  No I didn't, I actually have changed aspects of my view. I did say it was a strongly held view.   >Okay, my benefit is being white in a world designed for white people. How do I personally give this up?  Give money or things you have to POC. Give whatever you're typing on to a POC. If you believe you have these things as a result of the oppression of POC.   >If my benefit is the area I grew up in was a nicer area than my black mates because it was a white area with way better economic prospects and opportunities, how do I give up my easier childhood?  Obviously you can't give up all benefits nor did I ever say you could. But you can at least give up some of them.   >Your level of empathy doesn't define everyone else's  Don't speak about things you don't know. I have nothing more to say on this point. There's no need to make this personal.   >And your definitions of what is and isn't or should and shouldn't be, are your own  I'm not going by my own definitions, I'm going by society' s definitions. Find me a definition of guilt that does not include feeling responsible, like you could have done something different.   >Stop projecting your personal feelings as objective fact.  Aren't you doing the exact same thing?
