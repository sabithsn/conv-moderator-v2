A crime is not a crime. That's like saying 9/11 was just the loss of 3000 people... something like 8,000 people die in the US every day, right?  Hate crimes involve added symbolism that inspires movements, for example. Elevating the crime of lynching to something considered a 'hate crime' underscores it's elevated seriousness and also moves to better protect minority groups who are more likely to be targeted by random crimes.   Voting no to that is up there with shouting "ALL LIVES MATTER" at someone complaining about racism. It is a dismissive shrug that would only be valid if all people were exposed to similar risk.
