I am sure .
If they were caught ,
they were all returned
unless it was an illegal alien
who was a criminal or had a warrant .
Those were taken into custody and prosecuted .
FYI :
They were all seeking `` asylum '' as that 's the one word
that the Mx Cartels and coyotes told them to say to Border Patrol .
