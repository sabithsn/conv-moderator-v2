When you have only two options, you end up being between a rock and a hard place when you have to make a voting decision. I definitely don't agree with a lot of the social agenda from the democratic side, but fuck all with Trump and the unstable and unpredictable moves he makes and the things he says. He turned a lot of the country against itself, and a lot of the world against us. No way in hell was he getting my vote.
