Ok ,
so if I describe my coffee as `` black , ''
it 's perfectly acceptable for me to call it `` n-word ''
when describing the colour ?
The point is that the n word , a racial slur , is offensive regardless of the context .
White , black , and cracker are all words
that are used
to describe other things .
