When the left won the culture war of the 90s I thought it would bring forth utopia. It didn’t. It made everything much worse and these days I find myself longing for the discipline and structure that religion used to bring me. It took me so long to realize that “tolerance doesn’t equal celebration”. It’s simply tolerance.
