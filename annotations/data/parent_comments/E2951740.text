Yikes on bikes bro. That's like saying gay is sus, or people who are into bdsm are sus. There's nothing inherently wrong with polyamory as long as it's done between consenting adults. It gets "sus" when shitty people use it as an excuse to be shitty, and those shitty people have a million titles to choose from to try and avoid being called out. Ex: "I didn't do anything wrong, I have ADHD/I'm gay/I'm Irish/I'm ...." Etc, etc, etc. poly is just a convenient excuse for terrible people who want to cheat, or have control over their partner. There's tons of actual poly people who enter into relationships with their cards on the table and it's fine. Don't paint them all with such a wide brush.
