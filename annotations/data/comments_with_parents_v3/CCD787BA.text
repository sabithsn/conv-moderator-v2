Not only are there articles, but there's videos as well. - Also Portland Oregon and many other places had federal and/or state buildings burn while Antifa terrorized the nation the last two to three years. - the legacy media called Antifa a myth.   There's a pretty funny video of a guy showing pallets of bricks that were dropped off in the middle of the night, during the Floyd incident. - What's funny is there was no construction around the area. And the guys says, something like, I ain't falling for this sh!t. - someone planted the bricks there

It's somewhat fun and very easy to watch you idiots froth at the mouth when confronted with reality.
