Uhhhhhhhh no, no sugar and cocaine do NOT have the same mechanism of action. Thats the most ignorant comment Iâ€™ve seen on this site and thats hard to do.  There are three principle neurotransmitters of concern when cocaine is involved. Cocaine binds and blocks and the reuptake transporter of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. This effectively increases the half life of these three neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, and increasted half life means increased receptor binding on the post synaptic neuron receptors. This leads to increased heart rate (NorE), talkativeness (NorE), hyperattentiveness (NorE again), and content + euphoria (serotonin and dopamine).  Glucose is merely broken down for cellular energy into pyruvate before this is sent to the mitochondria for the TCA Cycle and Oxidative Phosphorylation.   They are in no way the same. Idiotic comment.

The need to feel superior to others is by far the ugliest human trait. You are very very ugly. Eat dicks sizzle tits.
