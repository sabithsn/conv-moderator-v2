I know, this is exasperating.  How can it be Biden's fault.  He communicated to the world what Putin was planning to do, and what the rest of the world would do if he did those things.  (This was his off ramp).  He did those things and now we should feel bad that he doesn't have a way to walk it back?  BTW, he does have a way out...he could get his troops out of Ukraine.  This article carries Putin's water.

Thereâ€™s been a stupid amount of Putin sympathizing lately. Not sure how much of that has been authentic and how much have been not accounts.
