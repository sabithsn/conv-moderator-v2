Heh .
The older I get ,
the less often people react to my last name ,
because fewer people remember the Reagan administration now
( you would have to be around 50 or older now ,
to recall it in detail ) .
I was born
before Ronald Reagan went into politics ,
and my parents were n't even really aware of his second wife 's first name ,
so it was an accidental naming coincidence .
The distinction in spelling is important to me .
: - )
that Nancy Reagan sucked .
You get to be the good Nancy R .
