There’s a lot of misconception here. First of all, gametes are how we typify species. Not how we sex individual members of a species — otherwise, obviously, infertile individuals would have no sex we could assign. Individuals are sexed via physiology.   Second, the rest of your confusion seems to be conflating gender and gender identity.   Gender is a social construct built atop sex much the way race is a social construct built atop population genetics. My parents were mixed but I appear white. Other people would typically identify me as white racially.    *Gender identity* is how a person self identifies. I don’t identify myself as white. But that doesn’t change the list of characteristics society looks for to identify race. But that list doesn’t change my self identity either. The two are separate.
