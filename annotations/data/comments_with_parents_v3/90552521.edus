You are the only person here
who is attempting to define themselves .
We are merely defining a a guide for some people in their lives .
If you are not manly ,
it makes you nothing less or more ,
simply not that thing as defined .
There are other things to be ,
but those I can not define ,
as I am not those things
and do not know deeply of them .
striving to be something defined by a set of standards < striving
to reach only the standards your ego desires
