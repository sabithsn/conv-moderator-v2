You know, even as much as i dislike Furries... they aren't inherently sexual. Just like OP you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, but at least he is willing to read comments. I was going to ask if you even read my reply actually, but clearly you didn't, or lack the brain capacity for it... i literally addressed Pride in my comment.

Uh huh.  Yiff in hell.
