What a toxic response. I hate pandering as much as the next guy, but this is insulting. “You aren’t qualified, and even if you were, it doesn’t matter because you’re a black woman.” I don’t use the terms lightly, but how is that not extremely racist/sexist?

It is extremely racist and sexist.  This place is a shit hole full of racist and sexist pigs, so it's applauded.
