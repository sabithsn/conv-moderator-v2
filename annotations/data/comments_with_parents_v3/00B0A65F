The most scientific way to categorize someone by sex is to look at their gametes, whether they produce sperm or eggs.   It just so happens that the overlap between that and chromosomes/genitals is *extremely* close, so those tend to be just as good of definitions in practice. But no, if someone loses their penis it doesn't mean they're no longer "male."  Intersex is a *tiny* portion of the population. It often gets cited that "2% of the pop is intetsex" but that's just not true. The only way you get to that number is an incredibly broad definition, like a female with a higher-than-normal testosterone level. I can find the real numbers if you'd like, but its actually something like 0.025%. And of those, most have characteristics heavily sided to one sex or the other. A true hermaphrodite is extremely rare.  Nevertheless, you don't make up a system of rules based on the exceptions. Do intersex people exist? Yes. Does that mean we should treat sex as a spectrum? No.

Tell me your a bigot that thinks their a biologist while obviously not being a biologist lol ðŸ˜‚
