Depends on your definition of bum .
I think of a bum as someone
who is lazy ,
so they steal from what other people produce .
That would make Bill Gates , Warren Buffet , Elon Musk , and Jeff Bezos bums .
Marx was a writer .
I don â€™ t see
how people like bill gates and warren buffet and Elon musk could be bums
unless you consider employers to steal from employees
