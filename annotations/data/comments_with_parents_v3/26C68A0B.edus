Another low effort post about strangers eating habits ,
and its just the second I 've seen today how original .
Honestly this post is everywhere .
> Lik , at what age will you learn that ,
if you want a long and healthy life ,
it is n't optional ?
People know , they just do n't care .
Cigarettes and alcohol are hardly known for being good for you .
Lmao triggered , eat your greens fat person .
