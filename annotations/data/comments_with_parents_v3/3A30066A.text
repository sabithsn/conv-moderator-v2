Yeah, murder. You know, that thing that violates the first of our three basic rights (life, liberty, property)? The function of government is to safeguard those rights. We are not talking about the government banning light bulbs or unlicenced commerce. That's big government. We are talking about the government doing the job it's supposed to do by ending an egregious violation of human rights.

There's really no need to type this out. It's self-evident. You're dealing with a moron; don't bother.
