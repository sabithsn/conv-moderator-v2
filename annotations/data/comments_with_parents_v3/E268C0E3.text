That's dumb. Pedophile has become a light word nowadays thrown everywhere like the word "fascist" and it is starting to lose meaning  Pedophilia is a serious mental illness, its a paraphilia that should be *diagnosed*. and no "occasional" fantasies and reading lolicon are not always enough to become a pedophile. A paraphilia (of any kind) is such only if it obstructs the normal way of life of somebody.  i agree that it's *an expression of a pedophilic fantasy* but that's different. So unless you have a qualification or you are referring to an actual pedo don't go throwing that word around.

Holy shit, youre disgusting.  I dont take the word pedophilia lightly, but a grown man/womann jerking of to loli shit is disgusting and deserves a beating
