Ok, so when police carry patrol rifles (AR15), itâ€™s to kill as many people as possible. My rifles suck at their job because theyâ€™ve killed nobody. I want a refund! No, all guns are used most often to punch holes in paper, and then second most often as a passive deterrent whose mere presence can prevent violence (like a bank security guardâ€™s gun in its holster). Actually killing people is somewhere way down the list. Donâ€™t imbue guns with some magically mojo that means they must kill in human hands. Thatâ€™s silly.and just because you name something doesnâ€™t mean you get to use that definition as an assumption in your argument. ðŸ˜‚. Self defense weapons are for SELF DEFENSE!

Look at how gross and dishonest this turd is. Randomly moves the goalposts and starts arguing.
