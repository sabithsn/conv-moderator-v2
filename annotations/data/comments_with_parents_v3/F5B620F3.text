YTA  you and your partner agreed on a no-kids relationship. suddenly you decide to adopt 2 kids and tell him to accept it or leave.  of course, i understand your situation. but you should've definitely talked with your partner about it before making any decisions. i'm not an expert on this topic, but surely there must've been compromises available, like letting them visit you on the weekends or something, while being in foster care.  if that is absolutely unnegotiable for you, and you 100% want to be their foster parent, then to your partner YTA. i don't mean this in a terrible way, again, i understand your situation, but that doesn't change that you have probably ruined your relationship, and your partner has every right to not want to hear from you again.  sorry if pronouns are wrong but you didn't give any, or you're NB, but well this is not the point of the post.

This is a crap take. Here, have a downvote.
