You Americans don't understand that theft is no argument that warrants unloading a magazine into someone. Also getting punched won't warrant for that too. Self-defense is meeting danger with equal force. Everything else is the job of a competent police. Which you don't have.... Well better start shooting again then

I hope you get mugged and robbed repeatedly until you figure it out lol
