You're literally blaming the victim of bullying for being bullied here. Like I want you to realize this. You're making light of the emotional damage that bullying can cause and excusing everything that the daughter did.   You're the daughter, aren't you.

no I'm not blaming the victim of anything and its asinine you would even suggest it. it's misdirection and deflection.
