That's a red herring. There is not a single right that men have that women don't also enjoy. Feminism has a long history of pushing for rights that benefit women at the expense of men.  Feminists invented the [Duluth model](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/rout02/rebuttals_to_claims_made_about_the_duluth_model/) which is based on feminist patriarchy theory and [suppressed the evidence on gender symmetry in domestic violence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2790940) as well as [female on male rape](https://recalculatingthegenderwar.tumblr.com/post/119784319421/influential-rape-researcher-mary-koss-claims-male) (see [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/qlrday/comment/hj7nuoe) for actual numbers), and [other stuff](https://np.reddit.com/user/lightning_palm/comments/qm5zq2/toxic_effects_of_feminism_on_our_culture).  You think this misandric, lying, female supremacist movement is going to increase human rights for men and women?

Feminism is a hate group and a terrorist group. They should all be exterminated.
