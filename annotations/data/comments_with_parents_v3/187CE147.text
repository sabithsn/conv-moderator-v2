Not sure where "millions" comes from.   In America, certainly some businesses suffered from the lockdowns, though *many* made up the difference (and then some) via PPP money.  Same for people who lost their jobs, due to lockdowns.   Other than that, I don't think any lives were ruined from wearing a mask.   Many lives were *saved* from ruin, via the vaccine.

Sheep goooo bah bah bah. Pathetic...
