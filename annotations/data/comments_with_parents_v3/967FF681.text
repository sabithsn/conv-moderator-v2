Economically? No, both parties and most people on both sides are very capitalist. Socially? Yes, cultural marxism is getting more and more prevalent in the West including the US. That's a  form of communism when it comes to what we should be able say, what groups we should "lift", excuse and glorify at the expense of others and what conduct (degenerate or not) we should accept.

Cultural Marxism isn't a thing you weird fuck.
