I wonder how many people
who oppose the lessons
because they 're too sexually explicit
have actually checked them to see if
they 're too sexually explicit .
I 'm guessing most have n't checked ,
why do that when fox news already said
they were ?
Also , if someone could explain to me how two moms or two dads is more sexually explicit than a mom and a dad ,
that would be great .
They 're legit teaching kids about drag queens in class .
Your excuse making is pathetic .
