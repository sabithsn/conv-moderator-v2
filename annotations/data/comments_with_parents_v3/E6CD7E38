Growing up I had high school friends that turned out EXACTLY like this guy   One of them - let’s call him BJ - got his GF pregnant back in 2002 and worked at half price books for about 20 years   Nothing wrong with that but he’s predictably a massive leftist that believes the “man” is holding him down along with republicans and that the wealth isn’t being shared   No accountability for his life choices  And no awareness at the horrible fate that occurs anytime people like him get their wish (communist societies are not pleasant ones. The elites will always rule)

wrong pronouns,  bigot!  jk jk
