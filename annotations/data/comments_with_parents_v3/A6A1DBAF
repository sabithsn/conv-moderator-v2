He sounds JUST like my ex husband and let me tell you, you do NOT want 20 years of walking on eggshells because he's mean, jealous, spiteful, and cruel.  Go now. Find someone that makes you feel at ease 100%. I wish I would've left so long ago. When I finally did divorce him, he was insane and evil. Do not settle for someone like that. If he's cruel or judgmental to other people, I promise, he will eventually be that way towards you.

He had a big cock at least
