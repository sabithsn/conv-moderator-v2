You seem to have missed the part where I got my information from real doctors. Are you calling them liars now? Comorbidity has nothing to do with it. Got in a car accident and suffered fatal head trauma? Covid death. The numbers are flat out wrong.

No, we're just calling you a delusional liar.  There's nothing left to add because that's all there is to it.
