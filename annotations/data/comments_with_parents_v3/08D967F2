The issue with the first part is what happens if a child has two gay parents. Its not likely that kids are being taught about sex at this age anyway, but now it's a situation where you have to avoid a conversation like this.   Agreed re: the second part.  This ain't the role of the government. It's a creepy intervention. Seriously have way bigger problems to deal with.

Avoiding utterly fringe cases that apply to a tiny minority of the population to prevent lefties from grooming kids seems like a great trade-off.
