For the last time, we do not care if they are ethnically sinti, roma or local driving people. We just don't like a way of living that promotes archaic womens rights, isolationism and a social hierarchy that's build upon clans. pls don't ban this, I'm just trying to explain it to uninvolved people.

Why do we even need to justify our hate towards gypsies? That's pretty cringe and implying other cultures don't hate anyone's culture.
