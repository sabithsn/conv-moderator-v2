Those studies seem to count things like playing doctor and "I'll show you mine if you show me yours" which is pretty innocent and not really sexual. Contrast this with the Kinsey report, which specifically defines it as physical contact and being brought to orgasm.  You can see how these are very different topics.

Showing your genitals to others isnt sexual?  Sure it is. Since they are children practically everything they do is innocent.
