I think the strangest thing racists do is equate culture and genetics. Like, they'll say black people are stupid because some of their cultures are relatively primitive. But then again, plenty of black people historically have managed to learn science and go on to contribute to science as well. So it can't be a genetics thing, otherwise those people wouldn't exist.  So what really accounts for the cultural differences then, at least technology-wise? I am assuming economic factors play into this heavily.  EDIT: Apparently the idea that black people aren't inherently stupid is a controversial one on PCM, ey?

“They’ll say black people are stupid because their culture is primitive” yeah that’s sort of the whole reason… they are.
