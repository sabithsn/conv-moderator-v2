Decry means to publically denounce. Trump was banned for fomenting violence, not decrying it. Get your reality straight. Calls to violence are _not protected speech_.  Secondly though; Trump himself and most republicans LOVE Putin and everything he's doing right now. Why would they want a ban?

So youâ€™re like, an idiot. ðŸ™„
