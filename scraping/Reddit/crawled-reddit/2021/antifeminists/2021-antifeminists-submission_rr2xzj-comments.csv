hqeu6fo,t3_rr2xzj,Don't support feminism anywhere. Whatever good they might do is outweighed by the evil they do..,t3_rr2xzj
hqe6v7s,t3_rr2xzj,"Of course, because is women, the taliscum only shoots in the air for warning, if it was men, there would be detentions, murders, mutilations and tortures.",t3_rr2xzj
hqf0urt,t3_rr2xzj,They are not feminists and they do not protest for women's rights. They are women fighting for basic human rights.,t3_rr2xzj
hqes43i,t3_rr2xzj,You guys know a lot about people thinking they're oppressed victims don't you ðŸ¤”,t3_rr2xzj
hqe6rtt,t1_hqe4zm0,Afghanistan is not in the middle east,t3_rr2xzj
hqf124z,t1_hqevrw6,"I don't, either. But I can still appreciate people who fight for their rights.",t3_rr2xzj
hqfpauz,t1_hqf0urt,Isn't that the basis of feminism? The fight for equal rights? Less than a hundred years ago women weren't even allowed to open a bank account by themselves.,t3_rr2xzj
hqf0ydn,t1_hqes43i,What exactly would you like to know?,t3_rr2xzj
hqesesz,t1_hqes43i,I am oppressed as someone called me ugly once so I know what it is like to be oppressed,t3_rr2xzj
hqevdtu,t1_hqe6rtt,"They destroy infrastructure of nations and place puppets, I think their caring is only a pretence.

The same assholes that are leading and raping the USA are the ones they trust about foreign lands they care not a jot about. If they lie at home, they are for sure going to lie about abroad. They lack sound thinking.

hqf84x2,t1_hqe6rtt,Well west Asia then,t3_rr2xzj
hqfkk3q,t1_hqe6rtt,"I had to verify but you are right, Afghanistan is not part of the middle east, I always thought it was.",t3_rr2xzj
hqfvhyv,t1_hqfpauz,"No, it is not. Unfortunately. You seem to simply parrot the feminist propaganda.",t3_rr2xzj
hqfzi3y,t1_hqfvhyv,I think you're confused. Originally feminism was about getting women on equal footing with men in a society where women were not allowed to vote or work. This was started by the Suffragette's.,t3_rr2xzj
