Name a jewish who is against immigration or for non jewish immigration in Israel?   > Why would we assimilate or not look inwards? How on earth would that help us survive?  Yeah and this is the mentally of nearly all jews. All about dwelling apart from your host societies. European ethnic groups do assimilate.    Inventing transgender studies, communism, Freudianism, affirmative action, usury, the stock market, wars for Israel etc has not brought benefit to heritage Americans, locking out white gentiles from elite institutions like IVY league schools (7/8 presidents are Jewish and non jewish whites are very underrepresented relative to their grades) , most cabinet positions, hollywood and media and dominating high finance to push your own ethnocentric agendas.

11uyvg	**Damn fucking right.**  I love your comment, because it’s so true.  That’s all racism is; Seeing patterns. Sure, there absolutely are people out there who literally just hate people for how they look no matter what, but ”racism” being bad is just something horrible groups of people came up with so they could keep being horrible while shaming anyone who pointed it out.  Black being more violent and savage than other races? RACIST, aka truth.  Asians being generally smarter and more hardworking than other races? RACIST, aka truth...  If ”certain groups” wanted to stop being ”opressed”, then all they’d have to do is prove the stereotype wrong... That’s the problem though, since they cannot do that...	1640929512.0	hqne0ka	t3_rs80zl	t1_hqls2mv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rs80zl/hating_the_gangs_of_an_ethnicity_and_hating_the/hqne0ka/
hykv2tak	Degenerate antiwhite propaganda. Jews are almost half of the billionaires. Are almost 40% of top military brass despite being 1% of the military. Are about 30% of the population at every ivy. Own almost every media company. Own most of the banks. Are massively disproportionately represented among ceos and other management.. Jewish lobbyist groups like the adl, aipac, and splc attack whites advocating their own interests but support Israeli interests and are able to exercise massive authority on social media networks, while also not having to register as foreign organizations.  You're explicitly allowed to be antiwhite on most social media networks, yet antisemitism is punished harshly and rapidly. To argue that the jews are not the most privileged group in the country ignores logic and reason.	1640930013.0	hqnevks	t3_rsir9x	t1_hqnb05z	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rsir9x/yeah_this_is_an_old_tweet_okay/hqnevks/

Your people were behind the 9/11 attacks and countless other attacks on the west like the USS Liberty and the lavon affair. Justice would be a nuclear holocaust for your people.

auu6a6hd	Listen to me brothers I speak the truth that you must hear. The Asian races will conquer the earth unless the west adopts an education and Savage culture. We cannot compete with China with an ethnicity divided bullshit culture, one who worships whores and black men rapping about selling crack.   This culture has turned degenerate and when your mother's, fathers, wives, brothers and sisters are slaughtered and conquered you will deserve every tear that falls out of your pathetic eye. China will conquer the world when they pump out millions of engineers, scientists, and political and cultural geniuses. You believe you're safe, that war is impossible, and when your feeble pathetic lies fail you, you will hope and pray that stronger men and big government will save you, they won't. Your culture is dying and your politics has become who can worship non western culture the best. When we fall I will laugh at your suffering, because the men who warned you will have prepared decades ago.	1641021411.0	hqs71l8	t3_rtb2vz	t3_rtb2vz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rtb2vz/netflix_and_twitter_be_like/hqs71l8/

The White House occupant is issuing illegal edicts and attempting to overthrow the Supreme Court when his illegal commands are struck down, as well as discussing overthrowing Congress to "pass" legislation without the necessary votes.

We as women value power so much because our kids's safety depends on the guy being able to protect us from other men.  That's why white men are the most sought after on ever dating app after Lasquisha/Reiko/Nikitita/Cloud Soul trashed them on twitter. They hate that men of a different race than them have the power but they'te still gonna fuck them and have their babies. It's kinda  tragic for our pride as women, tbh.  POC women want white sperm and will be mad all day long about the fact that the white man probably humiliated their race wherever they come from at the same time.

The hard truth is, no race id eternal. When you fall so back behing your kids are systematically retarded compared to kids of other races, your race is fucking dumb an least likely to survive. "Cucked" means weak, nothing else, and I see races for what they are, strong or weak.  Life's goal is survival of the most genes possible. If your race is weak, you'll end up crying for welfare, not educating your own kids because you're too stupid yourself, basing all your history on the white man and not what you could have done in 250 years in the most powerful country on earth. The black man could lead globally, today in the USA. They could have a thriving community of relatively rich black people helping some african countries developp very well. But the black man is too fucking dumb and short-sighted compared to any race.	1642909772.0	htu3c5v	t3_sacomf	t1_httyoue	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sacomf/its_ok_to_hate_whites_except_for_me/htu3c5v/

c1w5u4g	It's not Americans. It's a cabal of Jews and white liberals who literally live to shit up and destroy all whites created because it makes them feel tolerant and happy. Tolkien said evil cannot create, and can only mock and corrupt, and what's going on in Hollywood is solid proof that his statement's absolutely true. That's why all of their creativity revolves around remakes and adaptations of other people's works that they take a flaming shit all over. And don't ask black people to be creators of this kind of stuff. Every day they prove their mental inferiority by leaning more and more on whites to include them in the things they lack the thinking capacity to create for themselves.	1643035893.0	hu0vu2g	t3_sbkqkb	t1_hu0mlvq	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbkqkb/have_a_feeling_the_jannies_might_not_like_this/hu0vu2g/

o97pnjf	I'm not "anti-Jewish" at all and wish the whole thing would just go the way of sectarian Christian conflict and turn into a joke.  However it's rather difficult to ignore that virtually all of the vanguard political/legal figures behind European mass immigration and ethnic replacement seem to be radical leftists of Jewish extraction. There is no way Europe would be en route to extinction had they not been present & so relentless.  It's disproportionate but not to the same extreme degree when you look at the US adoption of permanent mass immigration in the 60s/70s and the political collapses of South Africa/Rhodesia (as well as the subsequent violent scapegoating of rural Boer farmers).  It will always be an interesting and tragic topic because leftist Jewish culture seems to view all gentiles are interchangeable. A British soldier who died liberating prisoners from the Germans in WW2 seems to be viewed as interchangeable with his German adversary and equally guilty of their crimes because they are all Caucasian gentiles. Gentiles appear to be oblivious of this race-wide vendetta and take the blows without response.  I specific "leftist" Jewish culture because obviously there's political dissent within Judaism and lots of pro-Israel people, traditional religious Jews, etc end up siding with European nationalists when things get desperate enough.  I think a great tragedy needs to occur before Jewish culture generally resets and stops seeing other Caucasian groups as potential "Nazis"; and the Islamification of Europe may lead to that wakeup call/tragedy.	1643050971.0	hu1zecr	t3_sbsbg7	t1_hu1u7b3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbsbg7/germans_are_sadly_going_back_to_their_roots_of/hu1zecr/

itarz2h2	Fun fact about hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B). As a result of hydrogen cyanide poisoning the human body turns bright cherry pink. You see, hydrogen cyanide works by preventing cells from absorbing oxygen. This means that the blood contains tons of oxygenated blood that can't be used, and as a result the cells start to die. Now this oxygenated blood is bright red, which means that bright cherry pink skin is an indicator of cyanide (or carbon monoxide) poisoning. Note that the cyanide does not need to be absorbed by the skin for this redness to occur, inhaling hydrogen cyanide will have the same effect.  https://www.chemm.nlm.nih.gov/cyanide_prehospital_mmg.htm Clinical Signs and Symptoms  Skin - A cherry red skin color may be present as the result of increased venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation  https://www.emedicinehealth.com/cyanide_poisoning/article_em.htm  The skin may be unusually pink or cherry-red, breathing may be fast, and heartbeat may be slow or fast.  Now, isn't it chilling to read all the eye witness reports and documents describing the bright cherry pink bodies from the gassings in the holocaust? Piles upon piles of bright red bodies, looking like boiled lobsters. One surely could never forget a truly terrible sight like that. The witness reports from the sonderkommando, the shock of seeing their comrades almost unrecognizable, the bright red of their skin seared into their retinas forever.  No? Never heard of it before? That's because it has never been mentioned. No witness reports exist describing THE indicator of hydrogen cyanide poisoning. None of the thousands of witness reports. None in the Nuremberg trial documents. Nowhere is what should by all reason be a prominent part of the holocaust mythos ever even mentioned	1643052988.0	hu24qt8	t3_sbs9fi	t3_sbs9fi	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbs9fi/turn_the_volume_on/hu24qt8/

99w7b	The most racist guy I know online messaged me in 2020 really sad when that news broke out of the scandal where that guy was bouncing a boy of a different race on his knee. I think he was a teacher or something and got fired for it. My friend was so distraught because he sees this is the path we are going down where any interaction between the races could be construed as evil. I know the word racism has been so bent it doesn't mean much to me anymore, but I really do think most "racists" these days are just people who are willing to accept our differences, good or bad, and look past them.
