h2s0u583	You've been brainwashed by the same institution that invented the term psyops in the first place. Your "people that think like you" is telling. You have been manipulated by a fascism ruse named "othering." You have bought into the idea that critical thought and skepticism should be banned world wide, that only a select few have the right to ask questions, and you call me anti-science? You have it backwards.      I won't be staying home, I'll be living my life while there's still some left of it. We can all die at a moment's notice, no matter how "safe" we pretend to be, or how much of our lives we hand to war criminals, and it didn't stop with Bush, the drones still fly today.	1640873256.0	hqjpd07	t3_rr8p9n	t1_hqjjcin	/r/AskReddit/comments/rr8p9n/what_do_you_think_is_your_biggest_lesson_learned/hqjpd07/

I don‚Äôt know the process so that‚Äôs probably a drastic oversimplification.	1640907485.0	hqm2s7t	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqklrxx	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqm2s7t/
4q0arfgk	This is true, but many trans women are shorter than many cis women. If height is the real issue, then why are we talking about gender at all? Not to mention that hormone levels in trans women are tightly controlled, which is not the case for cis women. This means that many cis athletes actually have *higher* testosterone levels than their trans counterparts. As it stands, the current regulations are working, and rather than seeing trans women dominate (as some would have you believe), we actually see trans women winning less often than their cis counterparts, even when adjusted for population size.  In the end, this is an issue that has been basically solved already, and is mostly just being used as a culture war issue to win seats for politicians.  One more side note: "a transgender" is not really the preferred wording. It comes across a little dehumanizing, like saying "a black" to refer to a black person. Transgender is an adjective, so it doesn't really work as a noun like that. I am not "a transgender", I am a transgender woman (or a trans woman, or even just a woman).	1640908522.0	hqm5b21	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqm42tw	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqm5b21/

7go21	Well, I would certainly agree with you that the real problem is ***NOT*** trans women (or trans *people* for that matter). Side note: that's a great point for me to emphasize in future discussions, so thank you for that!   But rather, I think the root problem‚Äîin this discussion anyways‚Äîis, "laws that erode the category of 'female'". In my view that's the problem that needs to be solved.  And I think it will never get solved if liberal / progressive-minded groups continue their approach of censoring, bullying, and / or threatening anyone who disagrees with them. We as a society need to be able to communicate openly with one another and try to resolve our differences. There is no "us" or "them", except in our minds. We're all human, and we're all in this together. Every single person is right about some things, and wrong about other things. And we can help each other, to fill in the gaps where we fall short, and to help everyone be a better version of themselves!   /soapbox üòÖ	1640937393.0	hqnq0l8	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqnne06	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqnq0l8/

jqwi6ff	What I've been reading/hearing about recently is that the whole "conversation therapy" name is really abused here. Of course it sounds horrible because we associate it with therapy that tried to force gay people into not being gay etc. But apparently the issue here is that this ban extends to the idea that a therapist would question or simply not automatically accept or agree with a kid who claims they're trans. So for example if a little girl comes out as trans after 4 other girlfriends in school did the same (apparently this is a thing) and her reasoning is that she has "masculine" interests or some nonsense, a therapist can't talk to her through that and about that, ask questions, etc before assigning her to hormone blockers or treatments, let alone reach the conclusion that the issue is something else and work with her on it. Therapists are apparently supposed to non questioningly validate the opinion of their patient	1640938139.0	hqnr0pb	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqm2s7t	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqnr0pb/

5b8ytx7b	Im very left wing, but i think some of the pronoun stuff is a bit ridiculous. Fair enough calling someone whos transgendered by their preferred gender pronouns, but it doesnt need to be such a prominent subject that you have to ask everyone their pronouns when you first meet them, or that its on every form you have to fill in, and if you arent transgender, and even if youre gender neutral, you should understand that when other people have to refer to you when talking to others, they are just going to use whatever seems obvious. The amount of over labelling is just stupid. Pronouns are just words that have no power over you other than what you give to them	1640967387.0	hqp1net	t3_rs6sap	t3_rs6sap	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqp1net/

1bj7qixs	The point is that gender and sex meaning different things is not an objective fact. It is a definition created by a small group of sexologists that has gained *some* support and common use, but I would be willing to bet that the majority of English speakers (going beyond the Reddit/Twitter bubble) think of gender and sex as being the same thing. So linguistically, your definition certainly can count as an alternative definition, but the word has certainly not undergone a full shift in definition.  And there was no "discovery" that gender and sex are different things. A few sexologists just up and decided that from now on gender meant gender identity, and sex meant biological sex. And that's the thing, we already had a perfectly good term: gender identity. Why do we need to change the meaning of the word gender?	1640968569.0	hqp4hzr	t3_rs6sap	t1_hqo82ip	/r/AskReddit/comments/rs6sap/left_wing_people_of_reddit_what_is_your_most/hqp4hzr/

iu59ikol	Hahaha funny i got jokes too tell me what you think   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Jennifer, a 19 year old  college student  walks home by herself from a sorority party in the City. She takes a shortcut through a dark alley as she's cold and wearing just a short skirt and low cut shirt exposing her supple breasts. It's a foggy night making it hard to see the street to turn on. She passes a homeless man passed out with a bottle of malt liquor next to him. The smell of piss as shitty blue  jeans fills the air. Then she notices  a group of  Black men in the distance walking her way. She stops and her  heart rate increases as a sense of terror comes over her. She fears the worst‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Covid. And not the Alpha variant but the Delta which is much more contagious. She remembers reading a report earlier that day that the Blacks have vaccine hesitancy and chances are they most likely haven't had the jab.   As they get closer she notices they‚Äôre all wearing masks... She's  immediately relieved and thinks to herself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
