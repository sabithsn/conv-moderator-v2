fwuzo17g	I think NAH.  You definitely did the right thing. Becoming homeless just so one day your sister can have a house is not practical.  However I kind of get how your sister feels?

i1x1g3rk	YTA. It would be different if your two daughters were younger but they’re more than capable of acting independently. They should be allowed to meet your new baby before 2 weeks & also see you before then. I feel you’re treating them like they’re extended family. At the end of the day, it is your choice who sees your new child but I think as your child’s siblings they should be one of the first people to meet them.	1640879384.0	hqk2zyp	t3_rs4pj4	t3_rs4pj4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs4pj4/aita_for_not_wanting_my_kids_to_visit_their_new/hqk2zyp/

3lg5glt5	First of all I am glad that in all this mess the dads are competent at least. That is awsome and well done to both your dad and Bob for doing exactly what needs to bee done.  OP you are a child, a grown child, but you mom's kid, not your mom's servant or live in nanny. Your younger siblings should have never been your responsibility and it was extremely kind if you to devote so much time in raising them. But no OP, your mom should either have a nanny or at least pay you to professionally watch them. That's time taken out of your day, studies and productive time you could spend creatively and with friends as teens should do.  Not to mention how your mom puts her boyfriend over her own child, takes away her personal space and allows said boyfriend to massively overstep here. You've been civil and way more mature than your grown ass adult mother! You did the right thing and removed yourself from an unpleasant situation.   She decided to procreate about 10+ years since she had you and she should have been mothering her own kids instead of passing that role to her teenage daughter who should be out having fun with her friends being a "stupid" teenager with nit a care in the world. You should be allowed to do mistakes at this age, explore the world, sneak a ship of beer and find that to be the coolest thing you can do, being "sooo baaaaad". But actually just being young, and allowed to be a child and live without major responsibilities for as long as you can. I'm 27, turning 28 and I can't believe how fast 10 years past me by. Feels like yesterday I was being so baaaaad telling my mom I'll just go downtown and actually going to hang out with boys in the next town over, feeling that's so cool and edgy or whatever teens call it in 2021.

3nrugfxd	Congratulations on getting rid of that whole person.  NTA, diets are problematic at the best of times and a night off every now and then is fine, you should be enjoying what you eat whether it is ‘healthy’ food or not.  Also, you don’t need another person to police what you put in your mouth, you are quite capable of doing that for yourself.  Alan seems to have mistaken boyfriend for prison guard, how dare he interfere with your food like that, and make humiliating comments in front of other people, not only is that incredibly rude it is also disrespectful and dismissive of you and your bodily autonomy.  He also doesn’t get to then expect you to pay for the food he stole from you, or the food he ordered to replace it.  At $10.00 that’s the cheapest couples etiquette lesson he’ll ever get, always supposing he actually learns from it.  By the way that doesn’t make you a gold digger, it makes him a jerk, although I suspect he was that long before the dinner.  P.s.  There is nothing wrong with being ‘on the heavier side’, if you are comfortable in your skin and healthy then it’s up to you whether or not you diet or splurge a little.	1641120885.0	hqx7v0f	t3_ru41xo	t3_ru41xo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ru41xo/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_food_when_my_boyfriend/hqx7v0f/

ijsdn	NTA.   He knows exactly what he did. Not only is your "boyfriend" if we can call him that, a pig...he is a jerk.   He obviously did it to get a rise out of you which not only proves that is an immature idiot but a petulant child as well.   That being said, the way you explain his little outburst seems so natural and instinctual of him that I totally believe you that he'd eat the same way at home.  Honestly why are you even with him? With how petty you make him seem I can't imagine he'd be any different or any sort of good guy material.  I'd imagine you'd be cleaning up after him a lot as well considering the slop he might leave behind after he eats. Not assuming anything but just making an educated guess.   I thought it was bad enough that my Dad could go to an Olive's Garden Italian Restaurant and ask the waiter for Mexican Horchata when prompted for a drink but your guy takes it to a whole new level. If I were you it'd take a serious look at my relationship and wonder if you're this guy's gf or his mother.	1641121948.0	hqx953h	t3_rtrs8u	t3_rtrs8u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rtrs8u/aita_for_insisting_my_boyfriend_eat_respectfully/hqx953h/

cfhsvnj5	Yes.  And every piece of evidence regarding omicron has shown that it is milder.  Less able to survive in the lungs, and that previous infection or vaccination increases the likelihood that it will be very mild.    Also, this is what viruses do.  They mutate.  They usually also mutate to be more contagious, and less severe.  As it is in the best interests of a virus to have a walking talking host, spreading a mild version, than an incapacitated host, spreading it to no one.    Despite what media scaremongering will have us believe, this mutation is a good thing.  Naturally acquired antibodies are as good (sometimes better) than vaccination acquired immunity (though vaccination is of course essential for those immunocompromised or those who feel it would benefit them).  But demonising people who are choosing to wait for other options (such as novavax for one example)  or claiming that this mutation is the worst thing ever, is just not accurate.	1641149264.0	hqys6vw	t3_ruf2ji	t1_hqyrdzb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ruf2ji/aita_for_stopping_my_gf_during_new_years/hqys6vw/

The Monday appointment takes priority over the health and safety of a 5 year old - so it’s not “time off”. It’s something fixed and important enough for her to continue regardless of childcare. It’s important enough that her parents are helping her to do whatever activity it is and hide it from the husband. It’s important enough that OPs dad thinks it warrants OP skipping school to mind the kid.  Is she getting therapy? Medical treatment? Taking a class? Working part-time?

Instead of reprimanding the children for doing something that would be considered wrong no matter what the situation, her main concern is keeping that vital cashflow intact.

4ezii2dn	I think this will be an unpopular opinion, but NAH. I completely see where you are coming from. It seems like you are concerned for your friend's safety. I know a pastor who is in the military and he said that he had a marine in his office who had just gotten back from beating a man to death with his gun. But he was in the fetal position crying because his wife was leaving him. It's serious. And when coupled with ptsd, he could be a danger to himself or others. Your daughter is too young to understand that though, so obviously she is upset. But you can't wait when it comes to mental health. One day your daughter will be old enough to understand that part of it. But I don't think you were wrong. This could have made him stop going to therapy, you kept him from doing that.	1642542834.0	ht8gbjw	t3_s78hap	t3_s78hap	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s78hap/aita_for_missing_my_daughters_birthday_to_go_ice/ht8gbjw/

an8k1	> tell me how that isn’t cheating again?  Are you dense?  There is emotional cheating and physical cheating.  When using the term "Cheating" it is typically addressing physical cheating.  OP state that he "kept things professional" which can be reasonably interpreted as not having any sort of physical contact inappropriate for colleagues.      >you seem to be projecting your insecurities onto me.       You mean my supposed insecurities where I've been in various committed relationships for 2+ decades and only been cheated on a couple of times (both of which I acknowledged that my partner might cheat early on and accepted it as a risk)?  Yeah, there are none of those.       You are the one getting all bent out of shape because you have purposefully mischaracterized what OP said.

5eut43ja	Their punishment was no graduation party. The lack of a check is due to the person planning on gifting it fucking dying. The daughter is still going to college which is more than a lot of people get and stepdaughter is going to end up in the exact situation because the parents are doing what they can and the lack of that previous money is not due to the parents lack of care its due to the person who actually gave it again, dying.

Also I find it weird someone with 20 years L&D experience has never heard of a post-partum doula or appropriate support in these situations. I told my husband and I's L&D coach who was a doula for 20 years about how I didn't want anyone around after the baby came solely because I don'y want my mom around and the first thing she said was that it was GOOD of us to establish that boundary and then she gave us the info for a few different post partum doula's *if* we need help. We interviewed three and picked one and they all said pretty well the same thing on the topic and any one of them would/will be 1 million times more helpful than my mom.	1642702095.0	hthl4va	t3_s804e5	t1_htgcl99	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s804e5/aita_for_throwing_a_tantrum_while_pregnant/hthl4va/

It’s a topic just like anything else, of which has to be learned.  It’s not easy when your parents learned that their son turned out gay, which would be the case of you are dating a FTM trans, then had a baby with someone who says they are now a man. Their whole world was turned upside down with no positives to reinforce that everything will be fine. It’s your job as the one off to make them understand that, not for the 99% to just get what less then 1% of the people understand.	1642705125.0	hthth38	t3_s86f9i	t1_hthndbz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s86f9i/aita_for_telling_my_sister_the_real_reason_why_my/hthth38/

She wasn’t even supposed to be down there, our parents told her not to go swimming without them and wouldn’t let her jump from the bridge.

But it was not appropriate for the wife to ambush him with pictures so the kid could go talk about it in class with people who it’s none of their business what their family life is like. And “it’s not the kid’s grudge” is BS the “grandmother” cut her out as much as she cut out the parents. She doesn’t even want to meet her because of how much her hatred for the mother has blinded her. She is PRETENDING HER SON IS DEAD! Do you not comprehend how  fucked up that is? What comes of telling the kid, “your grandma hates us but you’re free to make up your own mind?” The kid tries to reach out to the psycho and gets herself hurt? The grandma decides she wants a relationship ship with her but it the girl’s parents? THAT’S gonna go real well 🙄 life isn’t always fair.

Also, anything that involves your kid getting up in front of a group of people that aren’t your family or close friends is public. Every kid in that room and the teacher don’t have the right to know about the family. It’s none of their business. The school knows who the girl’s parents are and that’s all they need to know.

ilpozuic	There were days at a time when neither of them spoke to me, for one.  Not a good morning, good night, how was school, are you okay, nothing.  When my mom was away at some treatment facility with my sister, she would only call my dad to update him and never ask to speak to me.  My dad would just come home, maybe order a pizza if I was lucky, and then go to bed.  There was a significant period of time right after she was hurt where the only actual meal I got during the day was school lunch because they were just eating fast food on the go and forgot I needed to eat, too.  I went more than a month without eating at home during my depressive episode and they didn’t notice until my teacher asked if I might be anorexic, but they didn’t do anything except tell me that I had to at least finish off a glass of milk and a hot pocket every evening.  They would made sure that my sister had birthday parties and gifts, but the first year I brought up that they missed my birthday, my mom said “It’s your birthday? Oh, I forgot.” and that was it.  Never got so much as an acknowledgement or a card or a cupcake with a birthday candle on it any year after that.  I got a really bad case of the flu one time and they sent me to my grandparents because I might get them or my sister sick and it would have been dangerous for my sister.  Two weeks later, my grandma had to call them to see if they wanted their kid back because they had never even called to check on me or talk to me once in two weeks.  They would habitually forget to pick me up at school and the bus for that school system didn’t run to my house at the time, so it’s a fabulous feeling to be the very last kid sitting there in the cold with the PE teacher like “I guess they forgot again” for the umpteenth time.  Literally my dad didn’t notice that I had moved out until a week after I left.  They dropped the ball on pretty much everything and anything I asked for was treated as a nuisance (hitting puberty and needing menstrual products and things was a goddamn nightmare, I still have anxiety about it).  My grandparents took over as much as they could after I broke down crying in their driveway because I had to go home and let me start spending every weekend with them, which might have saved my life.  I wasn’t exactly suicidal, but I definitely was having feelings of not wanting to be alive anymore.  According to my mom, though, at least I wasn’t paralyzed, so I had nothing to complain about.	1642718408.0	htiqfme	t3_s8oem6	t1_htilhk1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8oem6/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_put_all_their/htiqfme/
iuafmdkt	She flat out admits she kept encouraging him to drink because she didn't believe he was gay based off his looks and mannerisms alone. And believe it or not, hubs can get pretty wasted to the point he doesn't remember a thing the next day but can still keep it up awhile, even at his age. He rejected her in the past, she admits it. He doesn't remember much, she admits to encouraging the drinking and not drinking as much because she wanted one last chance with him. That is one of the first things I've heard out of the woman's mouth that pretty much lined up to the 'T' with what he told me about him having a kid. He also owns up to the fact he shouldn't have been drinking so much knowing how she was about him and it is a lesson he has given his kids in earnest, both ways.	1642718505.0	htiqm4p	t3_s8p2vb	t1_htin12k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8p2vb/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_his_mother_isnt/htiqm4p/
g63fi	> I have it. I know it full well how it works, so I don’t need anyone to explain adhd to me.  Great! So you understand it's a spectrum disorder then and someone might not be able to do the same things as you.   >I also know what it is to have peers who also have adhd and use it as an excuse. When I was in school I had a classmate who used it as an excuse for anything, from low grades to being a bully to people. You have no idea how it indirectly made people have a different opinion of me and treat me worse as a result. It wasn’t my own adhd that made my teenage life shit but someone else who blamed their shitty behaviour on adhd. Which is why enabling and encouraging such a behaviour like op does is vile.  Maybe don't project your past onto others.

9psbe	What?   Firstly, your armchair definition of when an erection is possible is uninformed, maybe YOU can't but your dick isn't everyone else's dick.    Secondly, coercion is part of most rapes and drinking can make one more susceptible to coercion.   Thirdly, while we don't know who he's attracted to, the fact that he's in a a long term relationship with another man maybe he's just not into women at all, you don't fucking know.    Fourthly, people struggling with their sexual orientation can feel pressured to "perform" heterosexuality and this is easily exacerbated by drink and coercion.   Fifthly, it's common for rape victims to blame themselves for being victimized, maybe his "drinking" comment is how he is trying to reconcile on the type of man he was "supposed" to be and what happened to him.     As a man who has been raped by a woman you can just fuck right off with your toxic bullshit.	1642718654.0	htiqxcw	t3_s8p2vb	t1_htin12k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8p2vb/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_his_mother_isnt/htiqxcw/

Her husbands close friend clearly wishes he had married her instead and had kids with her. Little comments like “Imagine if we’d gotten together” “our kids would be so blonde” “My mum keeps saying we should have gotten married”  She says them in a jokey way, but it’s WAY out of line.  You KNOW if someone is clearly interested in your partner. The micro gestures, the touching, the fawning over him are not okay, and she clearly wants to be as (or more) important in his life as you are and sorry but she’s in the friend zone, you’re his WIFE.   Perhaps snapping at her wasn’t the best idea, as you can expect her to play the victim HARD for a while, but I don’t blame you.

If the partner who made the furniture is open to criticism and wants to improve their skills, they may be more likely to listen and make changes.

And let's be real, there are plenty of people trying their very best to invent a fictional reality where white people are somehow the victim and not the aggressor. While it is a discriminatory comment, there's also plenty of circumstances it could truthfully apply in. So while I don't support it, I'm also not gonna make a priority of fighting it.    3. There's historically, and *currently*, still such a vast disparity of racism and power against POC.

I have never dealt with or witnessed racism from white people, toward me or others. However, I’ve seen plenty of very blatant racism the other way around. Toward me, my family, white people as a whole, and just non-black people in general. Not to say white people can never be racist, but in the current climate, most white people would never risk offending anyone, and a lot of racism from black people is pretty blatant. I’ve seen it up close, many times other than this incident.  Also, you are free to call yourself disadvantaged, but I am a POC, and I am not. The POC people who I’m friends with would not want you to force that label on them either.  But sure, white people are somehow at fault for a group of black people saying they can’t stand other races and hate having to live with them or confront their existence. They have made it clear they can’t stand non-black or multiracial racial people. So they are racist, very racist.	1642763380.0	htl2azt	t3_s97fgx	t1_htl1lkm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s97fgx/aita_for_saying_im_not_racist/htl2azt/

Discrimination that continues to this day, impacting every part of your life.   You can tell the difference between a 6 year war Vs the very foundation of a country right? And if Germany was out here acting like they did nothing wrong and refused to apologise for their actions, you'd be a bit little pissed. Kinda like how Japan behaves, but South Korea, Indonesia and China are totes over the actions of Imperial Japan right?	1642766757.0	htl74we	t3_s8z4o3	t1_htl6dvy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8z4o3/aita_for_not_giving_my_poor_trans_friend_my/htl74we/
