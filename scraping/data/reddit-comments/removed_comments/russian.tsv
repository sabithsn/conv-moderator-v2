4q8osbhe	First of all russian is banned in Ukraine, but in east part many people still speak it and the same thing is about Odessa. You can't be served if you speak russian, but you can practice it with people on the street.	1642036100.0	hsfd1u3	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsfd1u3/

4ra1e0ku	You illiterate dalbayob, if you look at my other post, I addressed this. In Kiev, STREET SIGNS ARE IN UKRAINIAN, BUT EVERYONE SPEAKS RUSSIAN AS THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE. As long as OP keeps this in mind, he will have no problems!!!  You have never been to Ukraine, I’ve spent a lot of time there. “The conversation is over.”	1642045401.0	hsfxz28	t3_s2m7ri	t1_hsfxmj2	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsfxz28/

ipotvyxr	Dear people who live in Russia. I have a request. I am trying to buy a pesticide from a Russian shop: Lumiposa, but I they only sell within the Russian territory.  So my question is, I need a Russian address. Who’s address can I use to send the Lumiposa too? Of course the next step is that you send the Lumiposa to me by post. Of course payment in advance. It’s about 2 liters. And only one time!	1642513681.0	ht6bvhj	t3_s0iuf5	t3_s0iuf5	/r/russian/comments/s0iuf5/2022_new_year_handwriting_contest_results/ht6bvhj/
