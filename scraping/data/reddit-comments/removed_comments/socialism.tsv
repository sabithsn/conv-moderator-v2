3p62i1	It was probably on top because so, so many men died in the war. A whole lot of women died too, but women in frontlines was mostly in Battle of Stalingrad.     That resulted in Soviet Union having no other options anyway. I mean, we can imagine a thought experiment where the wars never happened - perhaps the graphs would look similar. But this is precisely what it would have looked like as it did happen, and it's likely it's a huge factor at play here.	1642713491.0	htiexqv	t3_s8s37u	t3_s8s37u	/r/socialism/comments/s8s37u/wonder_why_eastern_europe_was_on_top/htiexqv/

bxap9g57	First of all, China is not a "leading country," though it has came a long way since 1978, when 90%+ lived in absolute poverty. Though the living standards in China is far higher than countries with similar GDP per capita (Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, etc), it is still a developing country by many metrics.  Second of all, there is no magic light switch for Socialism. You can't just turn it on and say well, all foreign investment goes out the window, the State nationalizes all the foreign factories and whatnot (might be useless without the technicians who knows how to use them) no more diplomacy with capitalist countries, all private business shuts down immediately and is confiscated by the state, all home owners now live in a state owned property, etc.   The real world is complicated and messy, anyone who even ask such a question I would assume is someone who never worked a day of his life before.   I'm sure everyone has their "perfect vision" of what Socialism "ought" to look like, or how a perfect novel ought be, or how a perfect software ought to be. When you try building that utopian vision of yours, you realized, the world is really complicated, and you run into all sorts of contradictions.  It is like those who criticize China and Vietnam as not really socialist because they don't have universal healthcare and everyone living in pent houses in Shanghai 10 seconds after the revolution (like how many doctors that is trained in modern medicines are there in 1949 China??).  A revolution is not an event, it is a process, a struggle between the old world (China being dirt poor and dominated by foreign interests), and a socialist China (everyone lives moderately well, the contradictions of capitalism handled by the State dictatorship over the means of production, without looting from the Global South through imperialism).  If you are a Western (armchair) "socialist" who is more concerned about how China is not socialist, and you have far better policy suggestions for them on what the State should do, even better than the people who actually lives in China and understands the material contradictions of China far better than you do, then I'd suggest you get rid of your colonial mindset. Your criticisms will have 0 effect in China since the people who actually live there won't listen to you.   If you are so smart at knowing what socialism is, then build socialism in the West. Show the Chinese why they are wrong.	1642784900.0	htmcpy8	t3_s8r6ex	t3_s8r6ex	/r/socialism/comments/s8r6ex/why_hasnt_china_abandoned_there_mix_economy_yet/htmcpy8/
g22lrree	You don't.  The concept of arming the public is a flawed one and the second amendment of the US constitution should be read how it really is: to arm well-regulated militias, which is the only context in which your right as a person to be armed is valid.  If that isn't the case, then why have that opening statement about well-regulated militias?  It's like saying you have the right to expose your breast in public in a general sense when the real law states "Given the purpose of breastfeeding a young child, the right to bare a breast in public should not be infringed."  And if people want to continue to misread it, then the second amendment should be amended or repealed by another amendment.  Guns are too dangerous and people are too unhinged and unpredictable to allow general arming of the public.  I realize that there's some sort of "socialist ideal" that imagines a glorious armed public to ensure government cooperation, but let's face it -- against any government, you're going to fail because they can afford more and better arms than you.  It's a trick by governments to enable even more class warfare and social unrest so they can gain even more control over us.  Maybe at one point in our history when governments were not so well-organized and militant as they are now were weapons a tool for change but now?  Now they only serve to divide us, harm us, and allow governmental oppression.  Throw your weapons in the fire and win hearts and minds with the most powerful weapons of all: your words.  Someone with a gun isn't going to change the world, because a government with guns just waiting for retaliation is going to keep that society down.	1642786290.0	htmgii0	t3_s9c35u	t1_htm4gw1	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htmgii0/

2krb31d2	Note: I am not a Ukrainian, but I was born in the USSR and my grandmother as well as her family come from Crimea. They lost everything during the October Revolution and many members of my family were murdered by the Bolsheviks. They considered themselves Russian yet they liked the Ukrainian culture and language more. I used to see myself as a Russian because that is the culture and language I grew up with, yet I am so utterly disgusted by what Russia is doing that I do not consider myself Russian anymore. Fortunately, I do not live there anymore either.   Now about the Ukrainians and Russians:  The relations between Russia and Ukraine have never been good. In short, Russia stole Ukrainian history and has been mocking the Ukrainians as some kind of simple-minded "brotherly nation" for several centuries in a row. The reality is that Ukraine is pretty much the birthplace of Kievan Rus as Kyiv was its capital.   Over time, Kievan Rus collapsed and was divided between different entities whereas some parts, mainly Novgorod and Muscovy, managed to survive on their own despite paying a large tribute to the Mongols. After the Mongols were beaten back several centuries later, Muscovy conquered the Novgorod Republic and then kept adding more territories transforming itself into Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire. The Russians began to view themselves as the "Great Russians" while Ukrainians were referred to as "Little Russians". The modern explanation is that this simply refers to the difference in size and population, yet I doubt you want to be referred to as "little + your people's name" by another nation. Because of the imperial past, many Russians are still very chauvinistic which you can easily understand if you speak the language.   In the Russian Empire the use of Ukrainian was forbidden. In the USSR it was discouraged and active Russification of Ukrainians (as well as all peoples of the USSR) took place. The Ukrainians were never truly fond of the Russians during the Soviet times but the gradual Russification and replacement of the ethnic groups by the Russians did make it seem that the relations were good.   After the collapse of the USSR, all the former Soviet republics had this brief moment of euphoria when they thought they would start living better because life in the USSR was absolute shit. People were extremely poor, yet the Soviet elite lived far better. In reality, the October Revolution changed nothing: they just replaced the Tsar with the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and the nobility with various top decision-making members of the Communist Party.   People were fed up, but nobody really knew how to transform their economy to become more productive and competitive in the global market. Remember, we did not participate in the global economy for decades and prior to that the Russian Empire was a backward agrarian state run by monarchs with absolute power. Just like most other post-Soviet republics, Ukraine was suffering from endemic corruption, poverty, inefficiency in virtually every sector of the economy, but this made it easier for the ultra rich business people and corrupt officials to maintain control and enrich themselves even more. Since all of them were still economically tied to Moscow due to the way the Soviet economy was built, they kept doing what Moscow told them to do.   In the early 2000s people got fed up with this situation and they demanded changes. This is why the Orange Revolution happened. The same things happened in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and to a lesser extent in Armenia. The Russians, however, felt betrayed, and who is easier to blame than the US and EU? Yes, the US was involved because it was the only unchallenged superpower left - can you imagine it ever staying away from such an  opportunity? But it played a rather minor role of advising and trying to limit the chaos, it did not start the revolution. The people themselves were fed up with the old ways of living.   Unfortunately, there is no quick and painless way to transform your poor country into a developed one when it had been an integral part of an autocratic regime for centuries. So they failed and this led to Maidan in 2014 with all the mess that we see today. Russia is paranoid about losing control over its former republics because Putin fears the same events happening in Russia itself. NATO, US, EU - these are all boogeymen created by the paranoid minds of the Soviets and kept alive by Putin and his team of kleptocrats.   The events in Kazakhstan are just the continuation of the story. People want changes while Russia and its puppet governments in the former Soviet republics want to maintain a firm grip and continue stealing. The West and especially the US have actually been very disengaged from the whole process. Maybe it is for the best but right now Ukraine does need help as they do not want to be with Russia and there is no chance they will forget what the Russians did there.	1642794686.0	htn3cjj	t3_s9hcwj	t3_s9hcwj	/r/socialism/comments/s9hcwj/opinions_on_ukraine_and_russia_conflict/htn3cjj/

30qo4h8a	That's really the easiest-to-answer question you could have asked. Depending on what exact conceptualization of socialism you adopt:  (1) Social Democracy -- Tax the rich.  (2) Democratic Socialism -- Tax the rich, tax the co-ops, surplus from state owned enterprises.  (3) Marxist-Leninists -- Tax the rich (if, for whatever reason, they're allowed to continue existing), tax the co-ops (insofar as privately-run institutions are allowed to exist), surplus from state-run industry/enterprises.  (4) Anarcho-Communism -- Money is an outdated concept, we already have the industrial capacity for communism to exist.  ***The question you should be asking yourself, is "how does Jeffery Bezos pay for 30 second rocket-rides to space?"***	1642909675.0	htu33hn	t3_sa5z39	t1_httl3o6	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/htu33hn/

en6umk6k	Yikes. Nobody likes spending their hard earned money on taxes. Tax money doesn't go nearly as far either. Too much beaurocracy and too many unions involved in public sector.  The best socialism is no socialism. But that doesn't mean we should have no socialism. Some things are better served by the government. Most things are not.	1642922620.0	hturpub	t3_sa5z39	t1_httr3kj	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/hturpub/
