You'll keep tap-dancing around the core issue and deflect any blame or criticism from any single woman or group of women because...survey says...women can't be wrong ever!  People like you should work for or with charities or non-profits and have to humble yourself and serve others so you not only see the world from a different perspective, you might \*gasp\* work alongside horrible, evil men and understand we're punished and made to face the consequences of our choices \*all the goddamn time.\*  And on the subject of choices:  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that American men are forced to sign up for Selective Service even though the draft hasn't happened in decades.  Women?  Get off scot free.  To say nothing of the advantages women get in terms of alimony, child support, sometimes free housing when they're pregnant, getting men arrested in domestic abuse cases even when the woman is the perp, and in a situation I was involved with, filing false police reports and nearly getting an ex boyfriend shot because a borderline personality suffering lunatic couldn't handle anyone else having differentiating opinions from her own, and so she'd get the police involved to handle arguments she started and nearly got her first boyfriend shot because she claimed he was going to hurt her and her kids.  At the time she did that, btw, he was helping out his comatose mother.  Clearly a threat.  And about choices?  The way the world is now men have absolutely no reproductive rights.  The only protection we have now is self-protective isolation or a vasectomy, which can be irreversible.  Your gender is so ridiculously privileged and chock-full of choices.  Want better men?  Be better women.  And that starts with being better to people.	1642948059.0	htvs1mp	t3_sar60q	t1_htvq41l	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/htvs1mp/

I’m going to be completely constructive here.
