bruze3bk	You would have my sympathy if you did not feel the need to inject race into your story. I have been treated like shit at doctors offices and hospitals as well and I am not a female and I am not black, so have other members of my family. It is awful what happened to your love ones, no doubt.  Sounds like the medical staff you dealt with had no bed side manner.  As far as the fireman goes, they deal with all kinds of shit everyday, accidents, fires, drug overdoses, strokes, heart attacks, exc.  No first responder is going to come on the scene and just take your word for it.  They have training that teaches them how to access a patient and decide what the best course of action is.  Be it  a SOC-M in the military, a fireman, a paramedic or whatever, they have a processes.    Most medical professionals in my area (MD's, specialists, Nurse Practitioners, exc.) are POC. Most medical professionals look at things logically and analytically, not through the lens of race, politics, or gender.    Stop looking at everything through the lens of race.	1642781058.0	htm2cu5	t3_s97a33	t3_s97a33	/r/offmychest/comments/s97a33/angry_and_tired_of_how_the_healthcare_system/htm2cu5/

cxvrt4s0	I feel like there’s always been a division in America though, it’s just that the masks and vaccine have become concrete manifestations of the underlying issue.  It’s like the killing of George Floyd. Did that kickstart racism in America? Oh no, it’s been here, but that was the final straw after years and years of deep seated discrimination.  The reality is that Americans have always had hostility towards views contrary to their own. It’s just that Covid and the mask debate have made the disparity between conformism and anti conformism much more salient.  But the reality is that dissonance in America between political parties has been percolating for years, but the pandemic has become a new platform on which people vocalize their opinions.   The masks and vaccines aren’t the real problem, the need to assert one’s views is.	1642784264.0	htmazn9	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htmazn9/

I literally sat in an ER waiting room for 15 hours with my elderly cancer patient grandfather who has CHF and was having trouble breathing because they triage a lung cancer patient who can't breathe as lower than other ailments.

4xr3g	I love this reply, and let's talk about it. Cults are a well-studied phenomenon that not very many people truly take the time to research and understand. Now I know, I know, you’re an educated, intelligent intellectual and know you would never wind up in a cult.  But name another group of humans who are as depressed, hopeless, lost, mentally ill, angry, upset, lonely, and desperate for a reason to live.  That’s right. It’s largely young adults: the generations whose lives were kicked off by 9/11, a financial crisis that never really ended, who grew up watching technology take over, went to school with the constant thought that one of our classmates might shoot us today, got lost in the abyss of capitalism working terrible jobs for a paycheck that won’t even cover a quarter of an apartment’s rent, are trying to start our lives in the middle of a pandemic, watched the American government system fail time after time after time, watched the justice system fail and fail and fail and fail -  Should I go on?	1642792420.0	htmx355	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htmw13e	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htmx355/

14vn14zv	Lol don't be too hard. Been on both sides of this fence.  Sometimes anxiety can work with you because it can make you appear humble, genuine,  and wholesome.  When I interview someone and they are nervous. I find it flattering, because I tell myself. If they didn't want really want the job or care about the work - then guess what. They wouldn't be nervous.  I won't hire people who aren't some level of nervous during an interview.  Anxiety won't be a deciding factor on you getting a job or not unless it's a public speaking job or something.	1642796168.0	htn7eho	t3_s9j53w	t3_s9j53w	/r/offmychest/comments/s9j53w/i_just_had_the_worst_job_interview_of_my_life/htn7eho/

e16ol3mc	No, he didn't leave his partner hanging. He made a choice about what to do with his body because that's his choice, and the choice cost him his job. Even suggesting he let someone down for making a personal healthcare decision about his own body is insane.   Oh, I'm vaccinated -- so is my entire family -- and we all got COVID-19. The vaccines are junk. Nobody got vaccinated to lessen the symptoms if we got COVID-19. We got the vaccine to stop the spread. Lies. Bullshit.  I'm a former pro-vaxxer, triple vaxxed indeed, and still got sick as shit, as did my entire family. The vaccines are garbage.	1642807425.0	hto20lw	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnfgtz	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/hto20lw/

91w4yqc9	I mean. I look at it like this. The Government hasn’t been the most trustworthy sources of information. Now before people get their pitch forks out, I am vaccinated with the booster. But besides the whole Qanon aspect, there are many legitimate reasons to not trust government.  Example: The Tuskegee Syphillus experiment which was conducted on an entire population of my fellow African Americans. Which if I remember was government sanctioned. So for a variety of people I can see their reluctance to trust something like that. That being said to each their own. No one is going to do something that they don’t want to do, especially when it involves sticking something into their own body.  It’s kinda shit your dad got fired wish their could have been a compromise. But public safety is public safety.

tc7qt	To be honest, using job to force people to get vaccinated is unjust.   I still think that no matter how good / how bad is the vaccine, the government should not use job security to force people to make a medical decision.  I thinkthe real concern should be that we agree to let government force people to inject things into their own body. It doesn't matter what it is. Even it is truly a vaccine, no conspiracy, I still think it is a problem.   I am not saying your father make a good decision. No matter how unjust this shit is, we probably need to consider our family first. But I am pissed that we even need to make this decision.	1642810961.0	htoau2a	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htoau2a/

Looks like you follow an ideology similar to « incels ». Which is an ideology, not a real tool to understand what the world is and how to live and attain happiness. A woman hurt me a lot recently too but I don’t feel the need to lie to myself and put this on the back of all women. You are just trying to hide your weaknesses revealed by a crush/gf/so who hurt your soul and is trying desperately to revenge on every girl. Hope that my comment helped you a little.

8e2ewhr9	Firstly as a man i am a bit offended that you are dragging all men over a cliff and usually i prefer to not drag gender into things but as an example i have been told multiple times by woman that bald men are ugly. I am a bald man. Do i think all women should do better and not comment on my appearance? No i dont. I think they are assholes who should learn to not be assholes.  At the same time i understand your frustrations. My advice is to ignore them, realise that they are a small loud minority but it seems like a lot because you are so aware of them. I was very insecure about my baldness and every comment made me feel like the world agreed with the statement that bald men are ugly. Usually the people we hear are the loud and opinionated people who really should just shut up so we could have a better world.   It sucks that you have had to go through this and im sorry i cant be of more help and that my comment probably isnt conveying what im trying to say. I dont know if this comes off as trying to invalidate you but at least it's not what im trying to do.	1642851870.0	htqe76y	t3_s9xuta	t3_s9xuta	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xuta/im_a_former_hot_girl_who_gained_weight_due_to_a/htqe76y/

if4myzsh	Thanks for your concern.   I’m a little involved with the deaf community, I’m definitely going to try more. My family and friends know I have a hard time but I don’t like to make a big deal out of my hearing.   My local cinema doesn’t have any captions unfortunately.    I lip read but we still have masks where I live. My friends all hang out in big groups so it’s hard.  I’m sorry for your kid, losing hearing is really hard.	1642866279.0	htr59wf	t3_s9yze8	t1_htqyplg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9yze8/ive_accepted_that_i_probably_will_never_fit_into/htr59wf/
8df8xk0d	Pretty sure that a lot of the young fellas that don’t have kids, don’t have kids because they are already careful about who they’re willing to share the responsibility of having a child with.	1642866593.0	htr612a	t3_s9wbyk	t3_s9wbyk	/r/offmychest/comments/s9wbyk/all_the_young_fellas_with_no_kids_be_careful_who/htr612a/
iwoj7001	I understand your concern. Idk how to help you to feel better but if your country allows you to go out and dine-in, make the best of your day. Enjoy your own company. Sometimes we don't need friends to make us happy but ourselves. Trust me, I've been there. It's gon be hard at first but as time goes by you might love your own company. Or my friends have planned a birthday party for my friends by using Zoom. We ordered a cake, distributed the slices between the friend group and  that night celebrated tgt online.	1642867189.0	htr7g9a	t3_sa4x3v	t3_sa4x3v	/r/offmychest/comments/sa4x3v/im_turning_20_in_half_an_hour_and_none_of_my/htr7g9a/
