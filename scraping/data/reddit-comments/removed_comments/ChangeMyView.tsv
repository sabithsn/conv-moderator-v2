7v7ddhqd	And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred. I disagree with that definition but was willing to go along with it if you were willing to contend with the implications of that definition. You clearly aren’t willing to do that because you realize it would make you look fucking stupid.

Your point would be valid if this werent withing the larger context of the conversationsation being specifically about the jan 6th riot.

Literaply every respnse youve made has failed to take that into consideration.  Meanwhile you accuse me of putting words in someones mouth while you are at the same time taking words out.  Additionally, if you think my asking if you can follow a conversation is rude, the same can be said for asking if i am even making a point.  Hypocrite.  Im done with you, you clearly have the reading comprehension and debate skills of a grade schooler.	1640877124.0	hqjxodr	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqjq6d2	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqjxodr/

hv562	I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.     I hope I am making sense.	1640892930.0	hql287x	t3_rs56oc	t3_rs56oc	/r/changemyview/comments/rs56oc/cmv_peoples_view_on_cultural_appropriation_show/hql287x/

9n97g	A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's. But if you think anyone outside a few fringe people support rioting, you're lying and just engaging in lazy Whataboutism. This is Democratic mayor of Atlanta [Keisha Lance Bottoms telling rioters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7z6m2os2g) to be ashamed, stop, "go home."   Throughout last year, it is incredibly easy to find local Democratic officials condemning rioting while supporting peaceful protest. If that distinction doesn't mean anything to you, then I don't know what to say.  And even further: Jan 6th wasn't a spontaneous riot. It didn't start that day. The seeds were planted Nov 8th, when Trump refused to concede the election. When he [called secretaries of state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXYTS20dlIU) and tried to find more votes for himself. When he [lost every court case even under judges he himself appointed](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/12/a-stunning-passage-from-the-latest-court-rejection-of-team-trump/), and still refused to concede.  This is about the rule of law, yes. It's also about our ability to function as a self-governing people. America doesn't need you to "work up sympathy" for whatever democratic congresspeople you hate. America needs you to defend democracy and denounce a coup attempt.	1640905483.0	hqlxxa7	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hql6463	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqlxxa7/

8yepygba	What a load of propaganda.   ‘Israel is the only democracy…. Bla bla bla….’  Total garbage. Not very democratic when the entire population living under israeli control from birth until death have zero ability to control the israeli government.   As for Arab/ israelis (Palestinian/ israelis) - there are over three dozen laws that provide special rights for jews, the vast majority of poor areas are the non jewish areas due Tony equal funding and jew on Palestinian crime is almost never properly investigated or prosecuted.   ‘80% of israel is jewish’ ….. that would be be due to the ethnic cleansing of non jewish Palestinians from their land in 1948 and the refusal to let them return.   The 1967 borders are not honoring by israel and STILL give israel almost all of the best agricultural land and waterfront. Plus logistically it makes the remaining Palestinian land very piecemeal.   Palestinians have never had a say in the division of their own land.   ‘Jews escaping bla bla bla……’ this is complete whataboutism and distraction designed to perpetuate the ‘jews as victims’ justification.   Palestinians had nothing to do with anything that happened in Europe and welcomed many of the fleeing jews as refugees.   As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.  The Geneva convention very clearly dictates  that refugees should be allowed to return to their homes and that the forced transfer of a civilian population and settlement onto occupied land is illegal.    Sorry you chose to ignore the manner in which israel gained and maintains its land and jewish majority, while ignoring the occupation, but that doesn’t make these issues go away.   Your reply is pure parroting of israeli talking points I and everyone who has attempted to discuss this issue has heard ad nauseam.	1640911832.0	hqmd8g8	t3_rrsn5i	t1_hqm4gpp	/r/changemyview/comments/rrsn5i/cmv_israels_government_should_be_held_accountable/hqmd8g8/

3sby9vzu	I feel like a lot of people that don’t support legalization on here haven’t seen the science behind on how cannabis can help people and how little risk there is to legalizing it. I’ve seen comments range from people get addicted to it to DUI’s increasing. WAKE UP! People get addicted to alcohol and withdrawal symptoms are much worse than it is for weed (yes I’m not denying there aren’t withdrawal symptoms of weed, I’ve been through it before but I was able to live my life normally still without hospitalization). I work in a hospital and we have people come in everyday for alcohol withdrawal/intoxication, but never once for someone being to high off of weed. I’m not saying people can’t get addicted, but people can get addicted to anything, so I don’t know why that’s even an argument to not legalize it.   With the DUI’s increasing, this also shouldn’t be an argument to not legalize it. People die from getting killed by drunk drivers all of the time, thousands every year and yet it’s still legalized and there are people that aren’t using it responsibly. Guess what? The drunk driver that just killed someone? Manslaughter charge and 7 years in prison, the person with some pot? 10+ years in prison, for hurting no one but themselves.   Sorry but some of these arguments I’m reading on here to not legalize it just feel like these people are pulling at anything they can get a hold of in order to have an excuse to not legalize it. It’s literally been ingrained in us as Americans that weed is a terrible drug but in reality the government only made it illegal to go after black people and the leftist hippies. Weed needs to be legalized all round, people with non-violent weed charges need to be pardoned AND the state and federal government would make a lot of money off of it if legalized.	1640929405.0	hqndtsa	t3_rs5g3c	t3_rs5g3c	/r/changemyview/comments/rs5g3c/cmv_weed_is_not_nearly_dangerous_enough_to_be/hqndtsa/

40yonpjh	Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.

To do that he sold off a massive amount of Tesla shares and then must pay taxes from that sale.   In 2018 he paid 455 million in taxes on 1.52 billion.   Sorry but your view is wrong, uninformed and ignorant.   This then is not a change my view through argument you need to change your view simply because you're wrong.	1641033358.0	hqsl67i	t3_rtgbcj	t3_rtgbcj	/r/changemyview/comments/rtgbcj/cmv_elon_musk_is_not_a_hero/hqsl67i/

z3w2q	HERO?!?  WAYYY Closer to conman than hero..  1) Hyperloop will NOT and CANNOT exist until new materials are created and more efficient ways to generate vaccums exist, this entire concept is bullshit.  2) Fully Automated cars.. Consider The Las Vegas loop ONLY has tesla cars on it, it is 100% controlled environment, traffic wise, and they STILL do not trust the AI enough to allow it full control in that tunnel.  3) The Solarcity scam.. Shoulda been jail time for this one  4) People traveling on earth by rocket ship... GTFO, you have to be a moron to believe this one  5) He didn't found tesla, he paid for the right to say he founded tesla  6) He got fired from leading paypal, only got the huge payout when someone else took over and turned it around  7) Flying Tesla cars?  Electric Diesel Semis that are cheaper than Rail?  Tesla Automated Taxis that can earn people 30k a year?  8) StarLink?  A system that needs 10k sattelites that have to be replaced every 5 years?  9) Even SpaceX, was built on the idea of being able to launch a rocket, recover it and launch it again in 24 hours, the fastest turn around so far that I can find is 27 days.  The reason his taxes are so high this year is because he is dumping stock like a mad man while his company is so grossly overvalued.  So what if he pays 10 billion in taxes, if he sold 50 billion in stock, thats literal chump change.	1641035546.0	hqsnkrq	t3_rtgbcj	t3_rtgbcj	/r/changemyview/comments/rtgbcj/cmv_elon_musk_is_not_a_hero/hqsnkrq/

dfe8k008	No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”. They wish they could be on Twitter and have a army of loyal supporters backing up every word they say no matter how childish and immature. Bernie sanders told him to pay his taxes and how his enormous wealth could help the world in real ways if distributed and his response was “you’re old and should die” and his stans acted like that was a sick burn. So when he talks about wanting to colonize Mars or whatever nonsense he says next, no one actually thinks he’s going to do it , they just like to pretend he will cause it fulfills the fantasy they want for themselves of “richest man in the world who uses his resources to do sci-fi shit and is loved by everyone”	1641040754.0	hqstk17	t3_rtgbcj	t3_rtgbcj	/r/changemyview/comments/rtgbcj/cmv_elon_musk_is_not_a_hero/hqstk17/

"to see who rules over you- simply find who you are not allowed to criticize"  -voltaire  I find it interesting how quickly those with even a little bit of power rush in to desperately silence any talk of how the roles are being reversed.  liberals openly denigrate white people in private and in public but bringing it up gets u silenced.

21e2hoaw	I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	1641146376.0	hqyk8oo	t3_ru9qs8	t3_ru9qs8	/r/changemyview/comments/ru9qs8/cmv_most_new_genders_and_gender_labels_are_not/hqyk8oo/

sq12l	The only statement you said that I would disagree with us that the term Cracker is a lot less offensuve than other terms. Personally, I find it horribly offensive. From my understanding of the terms origin, it is the person who cracks the whip on slaves. Owning slaves, oppressing people, exploiting people, and owning people is so against my moral compass.   Slavery was such and awful thing and weaved into the fabric of the US - from the cotton plantations to the North that bought the cotton for the textile mills. And to this day, we all partake in the exploitation of people by buying cheap fast fashion and cheap electronics.   It would be like calling someone a murderer who actively tries not to murder people in a sea of murderers.	1641149998.0	hqyu7bc	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqyu7bc/

g754f	I think that the people who are offended by the use of the word cracker are frail. But the word cracker is self-evidently a racial slur. And if a service is banning people for the use of racial slurs, then a person should be banned for using the word cracker.   I see no ideological framework where the use of the word cracker is acceptable whereas the use of other racial slurs are not.	1641152132.0	hqz01j3	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqz01j3/

g2dfg4d5	> So you think ignoring race entirely, pretending different racial groups don't even exist, is going to result in more effective policy and implementation than tailoring policies to the needs of specific communities and groups of people?  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. Specific communities is a geographic thing not a race thing and race isn't a group, black people are not a group. A group of people is like a church gathering or the students in a college class. This whole conflating race with groups is toxic and frankly racist.   >Good thing I didn't say that then.  You literally said it's not as effective but I'll chalk it up to poor word choice.   >I'm certainly not opposed to trying to help correct economic inequality, I just don't think that is mutually exclusive from addressing disproportionate inequality by race, and I don't think it's as effective.  You realize by bringing up racial inequality you are hindering attempts to address racial inequality right?  >And are you actually interested in learning more about the concept of systemic racism? Because I can provide you with some stuff to read so you can learn about disparities by race and why it's not as simple as mere economic or geographic disadvantage. Then you can determine for yourself if you think they "forgot a few variables".  I've probably read what you're going to link me already, it's always total bullshit with ice cream causes murders level of correlation data used to justify it's horrific proposals.   >When did I shut down solutions? When did I ever say we shouldn't try to help?  Every time you bring up race when people are talking about economic solutions so probably a hell of a lot.   > And ostensibly colorblind policy has been tried before.   And worked great.   >It disproportionately tends to benefit particular racial groups, usually white people in the US. An example of this would be farm subsidies or federally backed housing loans, which are not explicitly racially discriminatory as written, but in implementation are frequently unequally given out by race.  So you're against any policy that might benefit white people more even if it's race neutral... fuck you're racist.	1641152475.0	hqz0z3c	t3_ruby2u	t1_hqyz29g	/r/changemyview/comments/ruby2u/cmv_if_we_wanna_solve_racism_we_should_be_colour/hqz0z3c/

1mntp	>The oldest attested -phobia compound of these kinds in any language is hydrophobia, attested in the Latin works of [Celsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulus_Cornelius_Celsus). It referred to the rabies symptom where rabid people/animals become dehydrated, but unwilling or unable to drink liquids.   That sounds like exactly what I said. The medical use is the original. Last time I checked, rabies is a medical condition.    >We're talking etymology, where there's no such thing as original meaning. We can trace terms back to the boundary of written language, beyond which linguists develop hypothetical proto-languages as models of the sort of next stage back that might have existed but was never written. That gives us the oldest knowable meaning of the term, at least. Here, it's the Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to run".  Nice straw man. It's crazy the lengths you will go to to avoid admitting the definition of a word that can be found to be some variation of "irrational fear", in any dictionary. I bet you can't find a reference that doesn't use the word "fear" or some synonym to define it. Go ahead, I'll wait.  Proto Indo European? I want to see your sources on that claim. What is the derived root?   Because I think you just made that up.   [A quick Google tells us](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/%E1%B8%B1ers-) that the PIE root for "run" is "ḱers-" while the [root of "phobia" is from the Greek word "phóbos"](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=-phobia), meaning “fear”.	1641165118.0	hqzy0bk	t3_rtj1jh	t1_hqz6vjz	/r/changemyview/comments/rtj1jh/cmv_trans_men_and_cis_women_should_be_just_women/hqzy0bk/

g1orgqa8	Sadly Hate Speech against men is normalized in USA 2022, as Hate Speech against Minorities was in 1922.  Common phrases like "men are trash" and "kill all men" indicate that many people view men as morally inferior people.  Discrimination against men is also accepted in Modern Western Society.  I have read very many stories of male victims of Domestic Violence being arrested rather then helped.

ifay1wyl	Afaik the "blackpill" started out as an incel thing before the meaning got generalized to mean any kind of nihilism.  Short guys have really limited dating options. [Here's](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) a page (with a link to the original study) that shows 90% of women would reject a 5'4" guy for his height. [This study]((https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill#A_man.27s_height_determines_his_dating_pool._Over_94.25_of_women_reject_men_for_being_.22too_short.22) found that only 4% of women would accept a relationship where the woman is taller as opposed to 23% of men.  That said, I totally agree with you that there's a stupid trend of normal-looking, average-height people adopting an "incel" identity just to belong somewhere. Those people should just get off the internet for a while, but it doesn't mean that the blackpill is wrong.	1642535296.0	ht7vqep	t3_s6m0bo	t1_ht7i03z	/r/changemyview/comments/s6m0bo/cmv_the_black_pill_is_an_overly_cynical_view_of/ht7vqep/

inxw8btp	I didn’t mean art per say, but arts degrees (could be bachelor of dance, or bachelor of music, or gender studies). Undoubtedly some of these are needed but when you look at the demand for jobs in these areas and contrast it to degrees, many people taking these degrees never get a graduate job and are usually rich young girls studying something they find interesting or someone with a clearly unrealistic view of their skills/talents and/or the job market.  Our taxes should NOT be used to support these people so if we do cancel student debts it should have some sort of criteria that includes familial asset checks, degree type etc.   But people signed up for uni knowing the debt etc and I don’t think they should be bailed out as people going to uni are already privileged ON AVERAGE. Would prefer taxes support the working class in unskilled jobs or trades	1642547589.0	ht8slam	t3_s5qv7t	t1_ht03nil	/r/changemyview/comments/s5qv7t/cmv_the_us_government_should_not_cancel_student/ht8slam/

44rnejg6	Thank you for taking the time and effort to explain in great detail why his position falls apart.  Like you, I do know the answer to who holds the record you mention and where her performance falls in the range of cis women performances, the record for the next older age bracket is faster than hers and was set by a cis woman. Like you, I'm not exactly worried about trans women dominating sports. I'm worried about all the voices like the individual you were replying to causing trans women to be subjected to hyper scrutiny in an attempt to tear down our validity.	1642551569.0	ht925ld	t3_s6tbo3	t1_ht8y98k	/r/changemyview/comments/s6tbo3/cmv_transgender_women_shouldnt_be_allowed_to/ht925ld/

hqoxcdkx	No,no no you see this conversation is more complicated than you think it is.  In order to establish your argument that it’s not fair due to “biological differences” we’d have to first open the can of worms: the gender related studies in colleges past few decades. The thin line between gender and sex has been clever broadened by ideologues that teach kids in such institutions. Now whenever someone talks about the diff bw men and women biologically and how it translates to gender in some capacity, the argument is made that gender & sex are completely different and one is biological and the other is a social construct. In reality biological sex forms the base for many aspects of gender such as gender ratio in jobs based on life choices in Scandinavia.	1642566056.0	ht9ymba	t3_s6tbo3	t3_s6tbo3	/r/changemyview/comments/s6tbo3/cmv_transgender_women_shouldnt_be_allowed_to/ht9ymba/

5p2ewidb	>Yes, race is socially constructed and shouldn't determine the value of someone in society, but it is still real, and it is still an type of appeal made by politicians. Language is the backdoor to discrimination, and it is still wide open. These bloc of white nationalists refusing to look at their biases are still making race an issue, it isn't the left trying to implement affirmative action. Colorblindness isn't a reality we can realize yet. If we just said, "Okay, everyone was right. This arbitrary and dumb value system that we've embedded into our systems of law used to exploit everyone was a mistake, call it null and void." that wouldn't eliminate racism, and it hasn't. The appeal to white nationalism would still be there.  So you think that discriminating against white people will somehow discourage white nationalism vs encouraging and validating their claims of oppression? Oppressing white people on the basis of their race is exactly how you GET white nationalists not how you get rid of them. You cannot legislate away racism. You can only let it slowly die off via integration like MLK said. You can't force people to think the way you want them to. You have to convince them via facts and logic. The "rise in racism" is a political construct designed to lock in the black vote. There is vastly less racism in the US now vs the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. It's literally decreased to the point that those using it to gain political power are losing their grip, which is why it's popping back up now. Racial discrimination is real and also being exploited for political and financial gain.   >Also, the law means stuff, but again, its based on precedent. In this case racist precedent. Corporations literally got rights before black people. That's where we've come from. Systemic racism doesn't just end because some politician used appeasement.  Yes. Making a constitutional amendment banning discrimination based on race and sex does end systematic racism. Individuals having racial biases can and do exist but making it illegal to make laws that discriminate did end systematic racism. Now a system showing racial bias can exist but that is a separate concept even if that concept is called systematic racism. The CRT use of systematic racism simply reflects that there is a correlation of race and outcome. The reasons for this are not part of the CRT evaluation bc CRT assumes it's bc of racism and not factors such as individual choice. Point is it is illegal for any system to discriminate racially so the system is actively against racism. Society also completely demonizes anyone who judges people based on race so society itself is actively against racism. What system with any power is actively FOR racism as in encouraging people to discriminate based on race? Literally the only systems pushing for racism is the democrats, the CRT praxis supporters, and the neo Nazis/white supremacists.   >The system is like a vehicle. Ask yourself who's driving it. Historically its the white male elite.  So all white males are intrinsically racist and think exactly alike? Or do you mean that minorities are so different to white males that they cannot compete in the same meritocracy? Either way that's a really racist statement.   >And it is still based on merit, although I don't think we are living in this ideal meritocracy you think we do, it's just merit that would've been passed up on because they have a black name.  You literally are more likely to get into college, get promoted, or get hired with a black name. Being white is literally detrimental to your career in today's society. A white person would need to score 150 points higher on the SATs than a non Asian minority and Asians would need to score 200+ higher. This discrimination you state just doesn't exist in reality, it's a false narrative based on outcomes not on actions.   >Affirmative action notwithstanding because I agree with that policy and see the merit in it.  Sure but it's still racist policy regardless if you see the merit in it.   >From the right it happens that its a kind of fearmongering to white nationalists that's been going on a while.  I wasn't aware the 1300 white nationalists in the states (the prison gangs can't vote) was such a big lobby. As far as fearnongering goes, when policy literally discriminates against white people is it fear mongering or just calling out unconstitutional racial discrimination?  >Charles Darwin was no genius, neither was Einstein. They were specialized in their field and at the right place at the right time. Their work benefited greatly from names you've never heard of.   They literally had 150+ IQs. To claim they weren't genius level intellects is complete idiocy. That's literally the dumbest statement I've ever heard. Everyone's work benefitted from other people and that in no way invalidates genius. I'm really struggling to justify even responding to someone idiotic enough to think this bc it shows your complete ignorance to not only basic complexity but also the complete lack of understanding the difference in ability. Oh yea anyone could come up with relativity or evolution it's no big deal. E=mc2 is a simple equation if you don't understand the gravity of what it actually means. Pun intended.   >The only problem with that sentiment is that we've built our systems in a way that makes each person a cost to their environment. It doesn't have to be that way.  You have established you know nothing about systems so your opinion is useless.   >Also, right libertarianism is just the hunger games, and the IO games we have today.  The hunger games had an authoritarian government that killed dissenters so no that's facism or authoritarian left bc they redistributed wealth...mainly to capital city bc that's what the authoritarian redistribution system traditionally does.   >And without physical violence or professional gatekeeping at play, people would be invested in maintaining that central structure because it's based on finding and distributing knowledge everyone can use to make their lives better, rather than an imaginary fear of the other that demands you give up your rights for your own good.  Dumbest statement ever. I'm a libertarian. I'm for individual rights even if they counteract the will of the majority. So your whole system required that humankind be reasonable, rational, selfless, and put the benefit of others over themselves to work? That's your system? That's retarded. That has never worked and will never work bc that is not humanity. What kind of privileged upbringing did you have to think that is in any way not complete idiocy? Your whole system requires perfect people or else it fails so it will fail and then the people will authorize force to save it from failure which is exactly what happens in every attempt at socialism. You can't redesign humanity, you have to redesign a system to work with the reality of humanity aka humans are greedy so base a system on that aka capitalism.    I'd love to continue this but you want to preach not have your mind changed. That's fine but the more I hear the more idiotic and clueless you sound. Half the stuff you say is in direct opposition to the other half. It's completely obvious you have zero real world experience and read a few socialist books and think you understand the world and all it's problems when literally you just succumbed to propaganda. I hate resorting to name calling but the level of both ignorance, hubris, and confirmation bias in your rational is mind blowing. I like libertarianism but I am aware of it's flaws. I am not ignorant enough to think it is perfect, I simply think that the cost benefit analysis for it is better than other systems. You, on the other hand, think your system is flawless even though your system requires human perfection to be realized. I can only hope that you can scrape together enough sanity to understand the gravity of that analysis. Quite frankly you are also a racist and an advocate of systematic racism but in complete denial of that fact. Sorry but not sorry.	1642562983.0	ht9s6j9	t3_s0sd37	t1_ht9hxpv	/r/changemyview/comments/s0sd37/cmv_its_long_past_time_to_stop_contributing_to/ht9s6j9/

e1wrt	So you had a car, which many people don’t have. Thanks for agreeing with my point.  It also sounds like you didn’t have kids, since forcing children to live in a car and relying on the slim chance that you get a job that deals with food and lets you have that food in advance of getting paid so you can put food in your children’s mouths is not a realistic path to take. It also sounds like you didn’t have any elderly relatives who relied on you for their wellbeing, who you’d have to abandon if you just took off.  I’m not asking you to feel bad for me.

I'll answer your silly question with another silly question:   Why don't lions kill other lions all the time if they DONT have the same morality that humans have?     Why don't dogs? Why don't parrots?     Is it because they fear an eternal punishment in Hell? Is it because they were bestowed with gift of morality?  No no, that's silly.

5uen2ihn	I agree with you completely, but as a white guy when I get asked about race on an application that spends more time talking about efforts at diversity than the job requirements… it’s clear I’m not the type of applicant they’re looking for.  Honestly though this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. As much as I find racial discrimination abhorrent, filling out racial quotas to prove you’re not discriminating it’s just another form of discrimination. Honestly quotas like this don’t do anything for minorities or majorities, at best they serve a purpose in the short term but in the long run continue to harm race relations and diminish opportunities.  The sooner we start focusing on giving everybody an equal opportunity in life instead of measuring equality by outcomes, the better.	1642604211.0	htbodyl	t3_s7rqxm	t3_s7rqxm	/r/changemyview/comments/s7rqxm/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_to_ask_job_school/htbodyl/

i2dnwiin	> I am merely attempting to challenge those who say It is bad having x illness, if I had a neutral title, what would be the point of the discussion? I had to take a stance, and rather, I had to be on the opposite extreme of the other if you will.   Seems like text book reactionary thinking and argumentation. "I disagree with people who believe 'X', but instead simply pointing out that 'X' is a flawed framing of the issue I am arguing for the extreme opposite of 'X' which is still a completely flawed way of thinking.   The way you've phrased this reply also indicates to me that you don't earnestly believe that depression is the worst illness out there. That's a rule violation in this sub. It's also kind of rude as it wastes other peoples time. If you already fully understand that sensible, reasonable, and more accurate views exist and you already fully understand why they are more sensible, reasonable, and more accurate than what is there to actually discuss?   At best this could be seen as a "trojan horse" argument where you are pretending to argue in favor of one view (that you don't actually believe) but your actual goal is to argue *against* it's opposite. If you want to argue *against* people saying "There are worse illness out there, be grateful", than you need to argue *against* that and not argue in favor of an equally stupid but opposing view.   >Obviously I wont go around threads saying that to people which some people do.

The definition of words doesn’t change because of who’s in power. That’s some “alternate facts” bullshit.   Racism is something in your heart. It’s something you believe. Prejudice just refers to any kind of vague preconceived notion about an out group. Racism refers to a preconceived notion specifically about people based on their race.   OPPRESSION is power + prejudice. Racism just means you believe people are inferior based on race.   And don’t gaslight us, I remember reading this definition for racism in like 2014. Not the 60s.	1642608037.0	htbxx2p	t3_s7swio	t1_htbwlzu	/r/changemyview/comments/s7swio/cmv_if_there_is_no_such_thing_as_reverse_racism/htbxx2p/
8mxqt4id	To all the people talking about different definitions pf racism, stop talking shit.   Racism is prejudice based on race, it doesn't even have to be bad (asians are better at maths is a racist positive view)  Systemic racism is a system exercising racism, that is acting based on those prejudgments. Again this both includes positives (like the discrimination in some US universities,  positive actien i think it was called) or negative (nazi germany obvious example).  Racism (genera) includes systemic racism.  To say that hayred against white people is not racism because it's not (systemic) racism is like saying IRA wasn't terrorism because it wasn't (islamic) terrorism.

d6qz3i4o	I agree with you correctly pointing out that merely casting an Asian American actor would still be erasing the Japanese culture that the anime was based on   But I’d go further and say that anime’s art style in portraying people is so western that casting a white person might even be the RIGHT choice  Like, I know this is a thing that anime fans fight about and i have no real experience with that community or anime, but it seems pretty obvious to me that all of those characters look like white people. They’re blonde and brown and red haired, they’ve got big eyes and pale skin…at bare minimum they’re drawn in a way that would not make one assume they’re Japanese if they were looking at it completely unfamiliar with the source material. They’re based on Disney styles if I remember correctly. And you can look at older Japanese drawings and clearly tell they look Japanese, from the medieval era to the imperial era. Only in this new style do the characters look “western”.   I don’t really know what’s up with that. But cmon, you can’t blame westerners for projecting themselves onto those characters when they look like that. Japanese people probably do the same thing.

8ws9injb	You make the assumption that the government will be the most efficient with the money taxed from the rich.  You should understand that economics is all about trade offs and opportunity costs.  So put your Marxist BS aside for now, and just recognize the simple binary question presented by the taxation. Given the choice to have the billionaire decide where to invest his money vs a government bureaucrat, who will make the wiser decision?  And you might say, "Well hang on, if the government spends the money, then naturally the government cares about poor people, so at least that way the money gets spend on inner city schools or something. The billionaire might just spend it on a new car."  Ok, but a car factory could provide a job to an inner city youth after he graduates. The money HAS to spent somewhere eventually, money doesn't just disappear. The money either gets spent here or there, but at least with the car the person who actually consumes the good or service is receptive to the price signals. If Ferrari makes a shitty product, Bezos may spent it on something else. But with government command economy products there's little incentive to provide quality.  Here's the kicker:  It's entirely possible that the poor would be best served by the money staying in the free market. Poor people shop. They buy cars, they buy groceries, they have material needs and they need education as well, and tying up resources... That is to say, to REDIRECT resources away from the most talented most competent players in the economy to ding dong government toadies who have no idea on how to effectively run a school is just FORCING people to buy a product from people that don't want to sell it.  Because the government crowds out the private sector, and the incentive to invest and optimize.  So you're absolutely WRONG that innovation will not suffer from a result of tax increase.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to fork over his money to somebody that's less intelligent, less talented, and who hasn't demonstrated his high level of acuity and doesn't have his reputation of established competency.  I want him to keep every dollar he earns so he can turn around and invest it either directly as a profit seeking enterprise by like, getting asteroid mining off the ground, or indirectly as a citizen voting with his dollar who actually provides value to civilization and who doesn't.  I don't want Jeff Bezos to keep his money just because he's rich and he's earned it. I want him to keep his money because I know that he's smartest guy among us and the ONLY way to solve poverty is to create more material wealth.  That's what poor people are asking for. So let the rich people (ie the competent people) figure out a way to deliver it.	1642723696.0	htj32kc	t3_s8lfzu	t3_s8lfzu	/r/changemyview/comments/s8lfzu/cmv_wealth_gain_should_have_diminishing_returns/htj32kc/

wssbc	>Here you demonstrate a very common problem most normal people shows. I'm statistician by trade, i work with law enforcement to produce criminal statistics, and i give talks to people and sometimes questions with similar narratives surface.   Wow. Can your employers get their money back? Either you didn't read or didn't comprehend. No surprise you work with law enforcement, considering 40% are domestic abusers and you need to justify that somehow. Must take some mental gymnastics.  What I actually wrote, in no way relates to what you responded with. To restate it we are not talking about correlative evidence, we are talking about direct testimony from criminals who specifically and in no uncertain terms state that they were emboldened by violent porn. So are we pretending that is irrelevant? It's almost universal in relation to sexually motivated murders.  >This anolagy is stupid. I'm sorry. But i'm ready to bet my left nut, that there is much more people who ate burgers and mass shoot people, then people who played games and ends up mass shooting. And you know the funniest part of this? Absolutely irrelevant. Because look to the next point.  And yet again, something went right over your head. I agree. That is the point. Eating hamburgers is our 'playing violent games.' You expect to see a TON of overlap between people who play violent games and mass shooters based on the sheer volume of people who play violent video games. In that case, and the case of hamburgers, there is huge correlation, but we don't see it as a warning flag because a larger majority of people who eat hamburgers don't become mass shooters than people who view violent porn don't assault people. When you have a rare attribute like 'watches violent or child porn' which applies to comparatively very few people and see that it applies to the vast majority of people who commit sex crimes, then the overlap is much more statistically relevant. The point is that percentage of people who have eaten a hamburger or played violent games and went on to commit a mass shooting is far, far smaller than people who like violent porn and go on to commit sexually motivated crimes. There's no real arguing that point. It may not be causal, but it is a huge red flag and a danger.  >Thanks for putting words into my mouth. I haven't said anything like this.  Actually yes, that's exactly what you're saying. "Someone is attracted to children and views simulated child porn, but that doesn't mean they're more likely to harm children than someone who doesn't." You can deny it, but that is the EXACT argument you are making.  >"Was the crime been commited because of said activity? Or was this person got attracted to this activity because he was predisposed to it?"  I actually never implied it was causative, but instead that it was extremely harmful for people predisposed to that kind of violence, who are coincidentally, the only sort of people who enjoy viewing that material. Far more harmful, I think is the community surrounding it who encourage people with mental illness to embrace that illness. It's not unlike Pro-Ana, Incels or other communities of the sort.  >And i'm ready to bet if tommorow a someone says to you, yeah i'm reading Comic Lo to satisfy my craving, but i never going to touch real kids.

I found out early in 2020 and cut off contact with him, told him to seek help and reported him to his college faculty as he was seeking a degree in education... where he would be around children. It is not my job to fix him. That is not what I do for a living, but it is the job of society to let people know things like that are not normal and that people need to seek help for them. I, in fact, also told him specifically that if down the road he manages to get some help and come around that the door was open.	1642752382.0	htko8tt	t3_s7r2vr	t1_hthne5o	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htko8tt/

f6um3har	Anecdote time!  I worked at Fuddruckers for like 6 or 7 years. For those of you who don't know, this is a burger joint just above a typical fast food restaurant, but not even as "fancy" as an outback steakhouse. It's like a lower mid range burger chain, but the food was actually good for what it was.   Anyways.   Because this place had a small arcade, claw games, and was a common location for parties, this made parents believe that they could just let their little bundle of shit run around like they own the place. Kids literally screaming at the top of their lungs while running between guests and tables not even associated with the kids. Can't tell you how many times I dome checked kids while bussing tables. They ran in my direction while not paying attention, and I stood my ground. Nothing could be done about it, oh well. I'd ask these little shit constantly to stop running around, but I'm not their fucking parent and I didn't get paid enough to care beyond that.  I understand VERY WELL that parents need a break, but not at the expense of random people I don't know.	1642784016.0	htmabd5	t3_s9dnu3	t3_s9dnu3	/r/changemyview/comments/s9dnu3/cmv_your_kids_annoy_everyone_at_the_restaurant/htmabd5/

7qe6iuic	I have maxed DL, and to reveal my bias here I was an Olympic style lifter all through HS. I found that sensation of your body tearing apart at the when doing most any max, but nothing quite compared to the bottom of a clean during a tournament winning C&J.  For HS Football, the coaches loved the traditional power lifting lifts (BS, Bench, DL) and they always seemed static, slow twitch and boring to me.  With the olympic style coach, we would do straight leg DLs, or Romanian DLs, where the idea was to actually improve your overall lifting ability by adding flexibility to the strength.  I do see what you’re saying overall though, but maybe this was a poor choice of CMV for me because my view is mostly unchanged.  Yes, I get that a heavy DL is a pure expression of the ability to move the most possible weight, how ever short the eventual distance.  But that still just seems boring overall to me.

3i7xyy5a	This is exhausting! You are asking a first year college philosophy question. And it's an ancient apologetics arguement. By (supposedly) clever wordplay, setting up  logically opposite parameters, you attempt to make your strawman God-concept impossible.  It's the equivilent of asking if God can make a rock so heavy that He can't lift it.   The scenario is so sophmoric and naive, it's the type of a question that needs more than an answer. Please come back after you pass your third year philosophy classes.	1642872494.0	htrkscq	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrkscq/
pon3b	I would actually like to add that even the free will argument is invalid. Suppose humans do have "free will" and that's why god doesn't intervene to stop things like genocide. First of all, that's still a shitty argument. Why not just program humans to not want to commit genocide? But more importantly, God clearly has no problem taking away free will from humans, or, creating ones that don't have any.   Think about people with mental illnesses, people who have brain injury, psychopaths etc. They all lack free will. Many of them were born that way or have had things happen to them that were completely out of their control. So God has no problem taking away free will from people when it's a tragic incident happening to them, but, when he would actually need to intervene with something like genocide or rape or murder, his followers conveniently claim that he can't, because then he would be removing free will.   Fact is, there is no way to apply the word "good" to God, because our definition of good doesn't include viruses, diseases, cancer and natural disasters.   The only thing a religious person can say is that we will find out when we die, which again, how convenient and also, how pathetic. Imagine believing your entire life that suffering is okay on earth because once you die you'll find out why it happened.	1642873062.0	htrm9eg	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrm9eg/

4ax34vrc	To further support your view, an "all loving" God would love pedophiles and murderers. I cannot support a God who loves that. I cannot agree with the existence of a God allowed to be that way.  An "all powerful" God would have the power to keep people from unnecessary suffering, and yet millions of children still die per year needlessly, and Earth itself is on a massive decline that God isn't helping with in any way. Thus another reason of a God I could never support, and I God I have no will to believe would ever be acceptable to exist.	1642875841.0	htrtetx	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrtetx/

We've seen the US's original government being scrapped in favor of the current one because it's failure to raise unified forces and others protections offered by tax revenue of the government. The US got libertarianism instead until the 1920s, which is a life version of Anarcho capitalism which failed because even the lite version, libertarianism, is unsustainable due to the fact that people are selfish. However, radical idealists will suspend belief and willfully overlook the fallacies to claim that anything short of mixture of ideas is truly workable.	1642954023.0	htw5ssn	t3_salk6y	t3_salk6y	/r/changemyview/comments/salk6y/cmv_anarchocapitalism_is_a_fundamentally/htw5ssn/

Completely changing the topic to something that has nothing to do with what a woman is.

No principles, no definition s, no truth, just a pathetic way of looking at the world. Your starting to wake up.

10prgq	> It's *your* side that doesn't give any sort of clear answer, no characteristics for what makes someone a "man" or a "woman."  Yea, that's the fucking point you idiot.  Society has strictly dictated for millenia that men act this way and do this and women act that way and do that. When since time began we've all just been people doing our own damn shit and all your idiotic comments about the biological argument are 1. Cringe. 2. Irrelevant to a conversation about gender. And 3. Largely wrong lmao. You fail to recognize the middle ground that exists between male and female sex because you can **only** imagine a binary of male and female.  There aren't clear characteristics for what makes a man or a woman, that's the entirety of the point. When you have single moms who are the metaphoric father with a firm hand and you have stay at home dads who take care of the kids all day, your gender norms are fucked to death and left bleeding in a ditch but you idiots **SCREAM** about how this doesn't make sense! There are men! And women! And if you're trans you're really just a man who's confused! Showing how horribly and willfully blind you are to the calm reality of people living their lives without being bound to the strict ideals of male and female concepts which itself is fluid and cultural. Women went from flower-print stay at home moms to Rosie the riveter during the war because the public perception **needed** to change for the good of the country. So women wouldn't be shamed for working and because there was a shortage of labor.  No one can give a definition of what it means to be a man or a woman because that's an individualistic thing. I can say what being a man is to me but another man would disagree, claiming it's the polar opposite concepts that make him a man, and those reasons are just as valid.  The host, and argumentative individuals like yourself, are trying to box us into a strict definition so they can argue those definitions from a logical/scientific place, they don't actually have any interest in what these people think a woman is, they just want them to define it so they can argue against them with the full spectrum of hypocrisy and contradiction. "Oh? A woman is delicate? Well 'x' was a woman who stood up for her values and took charge, I'd say that was womanly of her, and not delicate, don't you think!?" For infinity.  But no natural woman or man, etc. Can say what makes one that thing. This has been debated by those within the rigid gender form for millenia as well. Hemingway and Wilde contributed on opposing ends of what makes a man, delicacy or vigor, etc. No one can say, so it's a stupid fucking question to try to pin on them and then say "haha, you can't even define what makes you that in a fashion everyone agrees with which NO ONE has been able to do! Time to invalidate your sense of identity!"  Every single argument with trans people and trans identity is just a rehash of the arguer not recognizing their identity and trying to find logical/mathematic/scientific basis for doing so that they can then hold up and say "see? I wasn't really a bigot, it's just science." And to eeeeeveryone who is with the shit you literally just sound like old school doctors who "proved race is genetic and that there is a hierarchy of species based on these clearly identifiable traits, see you have big lips so you must be inferior." "See, you can't define a woman so you must be a man."  "See you don't have x so you aren't equal to others" is the fundamental ideological basis. You're equivalent to racists in this regard.  Get, the fuck, over it.  There isn't a logical or mathematic or scientific or whatever basis for gender because it is a mental construct created by those within the culture. Recognizing the same genders as indigenous tribes have is a pretty low fucking bar and none of you elitist academic types can bend your bricked out brains around that one and it would (really) be so goddamn funny (genuinely) if it wasn't so horrifically exhausting and depressing to be invalidated for who you are, every single day, because idiots like you can't just let shit be that you don't understand. And you set standards which we have no interest or benefit in following then condemn us for not following them.

If you believe gender dysphoric people have higher rates of suicide then you should agree increasing the number of people with gender dysphoria increases suicides.   Normalization and encouragement of children questioning their sex will increase suicides.  &#x200B;  >if people spent less time telling them they're attention seeking, pervert, liars they wouldn't have so much self loathing  The self-loathing is primarily from their physical body not matching their desires; no one says anything to them, people are too afraid to be shamed, judged, and fired.

dosijqw	Vaccinated people can still contract and spread covid. There will be a ton of uninformed people in these comments arguing that if you get vaccinated, there’s less of a chance of that. They’re wrong. There are no covid studies that have a legitimate control group, so the results say what they want them to say, “get vaccinated so we can make more money”. The numbers of covid hospitalizations are wildly misrepresented because of the financial benefit hospitals have by coding someone as a covid pt, rather than some dude that was seen in the ER for a broken arm that happened to test positive for covid. Covid deaths are also being misrepresented for the same reason… pt brought in by EMS with a gunshot wound to the head? Covid positive? Yep, you guessed it, covid death. The reality is that covid is not the same virus that it was 2 years ago. The current variant is closer to a regular cold than it was when it was shutting down people’s lung function.  The pandemic is over. It’s the politicians and media that want to keep it going for personal gain.	1643039658.0	hu1524z	t3_sboy1e	t3_sboy1e	/r/changemyview/comments/sboy1e/cmv_i_do_not_intend_to_get_the_vaccine/hu1524z/

kmy0n	In my 30s, unvaccinated. I just recovered a few days ago after roughly 3 days of actually feeling sick.   I don't intend to vaccinate, and I'm open to having my mind changed, but I see the same talking points over and over, and I still don't see the value. I suppose I'm stuck in my way of thinking that we're all personally responsible for our own health, and that it's not my responsibility to vaccinate because of your grandma. (Ironically, my 80+ y/o, emphysema-diagnosed grandma just recovered from covid)  The talking point I see the most is that it's selfish to not vaccinate because it puts others at risk, but I have an issue with that... I see no reason to believe that I'm less likely to transmit the virus if I'm vaccinated. Based on my current understanding, it spreads by airborne germs and masking/washing my hands frequently is doing *significantly* more to reduce transmission than a vaccine would accomplish. Not to mention, having recovered, I now have antibodies to eradicate any exposure I have in the future.	1643040517.0	hu17a08	t3_sboy1e	t3_sboy1e	/r/changemyview/comments/sboy1e/cmv_i_do_not_intend_to_get_the_vaccine/hu17a08/

6km2a	> Mass shootings are the real statistical unicorns.  This is just whataboutism being used as a red herring. Nobody is talking about mass shootings here. Mass shootings have nothing to do with this discussion. Literally nothing.  >You have a much higher chance of using a firearm in self defense. And while there are no definitive numbers the CDC lists between 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.  So let's be real on a few things here. First of all 2.5 million is bonkers-insane-nuts completely unsupported by facts. There are stats put out by individual cities, and from those stats, we know that the real number can't be anywhere close to that high.  But, as a fun fact, the reason why the CDC doesn't have more accurate numbers, is because it's legally forbidden from sponsoring that sort of research, As our Republican institutions and entities that receive public funding. The NRA lobbied hard for a law making it illegal for us to find out how often self-defense happens relative to other gun actions..  I think that speaks pretty clearly to what the numbers would show if we could actually do that research.  Second of all, 60,000 per year is nothing. That's 1 in 6,667.  Considering that there are 48 lotteries in this country each doing multiple drawings daily, that's roughly how many people win the lottery per year.  If that happens to you, yes, you are a statistical unicorn. That's not misleading; that's fact.   But let's not stop there, because in fact, even that number is wildly inflated by law enforcement statistics being mixed in.  Yes, one in 6,667 of us may engage in acts of self-defense, but most of the people included in that stat are not people in their own house. They are people whose jobs put them in conflict with people, like law enforcement.  That's a totally different scenario.  But don't take my word for it, do this simple search for yourself: Go to news.google.com, pick a large city with over a million people in it, and just search and that city specifically over the last year, for stories about home invasions and self-defense  How many did you find? 10? 20? That's my point exactly. That sort of scenario is super rare. It happens, but it's not going to happen to you. You aren't that lucky/unlucky.    > Its perfectly fine to be anti-gun, its not okay to mislead.  The only one of us attempting to mislead, is you, with the red herring at the start..   > That's your opinion, not one supported by facts or figures.  It can be both. You know the famous Seattle study showed that there were roughly seven suicide attempts and four accidental shootings for every self-defense shooting in Seattle In 1998.  The conclusion from that is pretty clear, that you are a bigger risk to yourself from your own gun, then people who would do harm to you are at risk from it.  That's just facts.	1643050559.0	hu1yaka	t3_sbs3k7	t1_hu1st2h	/r/changemyview/comments/sbs3k7/cmv_smart_guns_are_a_good_idea_in_theory_but/hu1yaka/

The problem is that you **don't** actually think that Mohamed, or anyone else should be "pulled down". You are pretending to argue for that in order to argue against the idea of "pulling down" altogether.  I'm not sure you really want to invoke the notion of "being a realist" here?

ipf00fhk	First, you're a bigot. Sorry to be the one to tell you.  Second, biological women (hi) can't tell you what it means to be a woman because there are over 3 billion women in the world and every single one has a unique experience.   You might think being a woman means having breasts but not all women do, some have to have them removed because of cancer. Does not having breasts make someone not a woman?  Does being a mother make you a woman?  I never had kids, nor did many female friends or family members.  Does wearing make up make you a woman, because ew. I hate that stuff.  A woman is not a set of chromosomes, a woman is not a societal construct or obligation. A woman is a person, a human being with her own identity and life experiences and sometimes a woman starts out life as a biological male.  Humans have both estrogen and testosterone, both a mother and a father contribute to a person's genetic makeup. Why is it so difficult to realize that some people may fall futher on one side of the gender spectrum than they physically appear?  Not to mention in free countries we have this thing called body autonomy. A person is allowed to have control over their own body, it's the ultimate freedom.	1643053325.0	hu25mg6	t3_sb1i9b	t3_sb1i9b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu25mg6/

g1uzm60m	No, normal people understand perfectly what OP is referring to. For the whole year of 2020 there were thousands of people repeating "vote blue no matter who" like a mantra. This mentality is pretty common and most normal humans are well aware of it.  Only a pedant who just wants to argue for the sake of arguing will pretend to not be aware of this just so they can flex their useless debating skills because where else do you expect to show off such a skill? Maybe on a nerdiest nerd competition or something like that.	1643056192.0	hu2d3t1	t3_sbpue2	t1_hu2b8sy	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpue2/cmv_you_are_allowed_to_agree_with_views_from/hu2d3t1/

11n7a8	> No, normal people understand perfectly what OP is referring to.   How so? I thought it was nuanced? What you really mean is that "once you examine the nuance, OP's view is compeltely different than what is stated and makes zero sense."  >For the whole year of 2020 there were thousands of people repeating "vote blue no matter who" like a mantra.  And were they doing that because they only care about party of because the "blue" party is attached to public policy they like or because the "red" party was far inferior to them as leaders and people?  >This mentality is pretty common and most normal humans are well aware of it.  So there is no nuance. These people have no political positions and just vote on party lines because they are party lines? They don't care about healthcare policy, rights, or anything?  All these notions fade away once you have a normal conversation with these people.  >Only a pedant who just wants to argue for the sake of arguing will pretend to not be aware of this just so they can flex their useless debating skills because where else do you expect to show off such a skill?  Who am I showing off to? We're the only ones here. You've already admitted this view doesn't account for nuance.

k84ss	You're clearly not a good Psych grad, because anyone who was would know that DID has nothing to do with transgender people. And if you actually were a psych grad, you'd also know what gender dysphoria is - something completely separate from DID. And you'd know that the validity of gender dysphoria is only disputed by transphobes, but it's a very real condition.   The fact that you even tried to bring in DID shows that you're here in bad faith.	1643059620.0	hu2m6rr	t3_sb1i9b	t1_hu2hms6	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu2m6rr/

3xhaculn	That’s the bandwagoning fallacy - “everyone agrees with me, so I must be right”.    Science isn’t based on majority opinion. Objective facts don’t change simply because the majority of people want it too. Changing the definition of words to fit your argument does not suddenly make you right - otherwise, science is effectively dead.   This is the most unscientific opinion you can have. When you can change facts by changing definitions, facts cease to exist. You’re as bad as a flat earther.    You know, say you were in Nazi Germany in 1939 - when Aryan racial superiority was considered the “scientific consensus” by the majority of people. Would you have joined them, since you think science is decided by whoever’s in power?    After all, it costs nothing to do the Hitler salute and look the other way during the genocides of millions.	1643061483.0	hu2r4q3	t3_sb1i9b	t1_hu2o1g6	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu2r4q3/
p92ca	I said prescription drugs after you edited your comment to narrow down to a specific decade. All of those things have been used to treat hysteria, factually.  You didn't correct a mistake, you literally changed the argument from a factual matter (this is the only treatment) to a subjective one (this is the best treatment).  Feel free to report this comment too because you're too stupid to realize why your argument is bad and too sensitive to accept that you could possibly be wrong.   Six times this has been explained, and you're still arguing something irrelevant to the comment you first replied to.
