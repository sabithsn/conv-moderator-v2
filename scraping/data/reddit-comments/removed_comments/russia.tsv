2rzwuerl	Random side note from a Baltic viewpoint: Sweden is worried about 3 extra amphibious landing ships on the Baltic Sea. They raised the alert level of troops on Gotland, called reservists to service on that island, and [sent]](https://www.dn.se/sverige/militar-utryckningsstyrka-landsatt-pa-gotland/)  additional troops to Gotland by air transport today.  Translating:  > "On Friday, the rapidly deteriorating world situation prompted the Armed Forces to deploy its operational contingency unit on Gotland. Equipment and personnel flew with an American C-17 plane, an international collaboration in which Sweden has a share. The plane took off from the base Papá in Hungary and flew to Kallax in Norrbotten."  Sweden is neutral - has been neutral for many generations. Last participated in a war in 1814. It does not depend on foreign tech, produces its own energy, makes its own planes and boats... it has no reason to bluff for anyone.  I am concerned. If non-aligned governments are making defensive moves that cost significant effort, serious miscalculations might be about to really happen. :(	1642193197.0	hsodgtd	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsodgtd/

They either use the threath as a lever for negotiations or then they are just preparing on full scale war.	1642194972.0	hsoi2sz	t3_s3uhcm	t3_s3uhcm	/r/russia/comments/s3uhcm/us_warns_drumbeats_of_war_are_sounding_as_ukraine/hsoi2sz/

Because when you say supplying what you mean is selling  And let me get this right, if a hobo steals your home, do you keep on paying for water and electricity? I don't see how Crimea is any different, sure the Ukrainians consider it theirs but it's just mental to spend tax money on something that is actually not theirs since 2014   And please...Russia recognises human rights? Isn't that something the Americans say right before they bomb shitholes in the middle east? That they would never, but then videos and leaks come out, ofc russian media is much more censored so you get to hear about these American war crimes but never the Russians ones, after all, why should Russia speak shit about Russia?	1642195053.0	hsoia77	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hsogc8t	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsoia77/

No country needs permission to amass its troops by the border, but given recent history, Russian threatening rhetoric and the drive Russia has shown to de-estabilize by any means necessary the status quo in the western bloc, people are obviously suspicious of what may happen next.  I mean other countries like the US and China do that using similar methods, that's true, but to try and whitewash Russia's aggressive, disruptive foreign policy under the guise of "muh western media brainwashing" is questionable at best.	1642195783.0	hsok6hx	t3_s3b2in	t1_hsoitgn	/r/russia/comments/s3b2in/does_the_russian_media_portray_the_united_states/hsok6hx/

Many of the former Soviet countries are decades away from the governance reforms required for (voluntary) membership.  many russians know how corrupt ukrainian institutions are, they are decades away from the transparent accountabity stsndards of nato membership.

ojfghsq	1. A key difference between US and Russia's governments, despite how corrupt the US might be, is we don't have Presidents in power for however long they wish to be. Putin is coming close to a dictator at this point.  2. The influence of the wealthy over Putin is incredible and the lenghts putin goes to silence his critics is well known. video for proof of what I mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrORwk\_RZLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrORwk_RZLM)    1. How many times do we see in the news some ex russian dying of mysterious circumstances and the chemical found usually being tied to russian spy/government agencies. 3. Russia's government seemingly backs the worlds most corrupt countries whether its North Korea or supporting military take over of African nations like what is currently going on in the country of Mali. Or they send troops over to quell the uprising of citizens and the dismantling of their own corrupt government like we just recently saw with Kazakhstan.

xouob	Ehh.. Your military force are in an country where they don't belong, killing innocent Ukrainian people. For what purpose? What right does a country have to invade a neighboring country? What right does Russia have to interfere with neighboring politics?   The whole purpose behind Nato is to be a collective force against this unpredictable militaristic behavior, from a country within Europe that still hasn't turned into a true democracy, despite all cultural influences through mass media and all the revolts during the former Soviet Union. The  leader still elects himself by changing the law.   We could have thousands of years of peace in Europe. We could buy your Gas, respect your cultures, visit your country, learn from each other, come closer, connect infrastructure, take away the mistrust. But this paranoid military behavior drives us millions of kilometers apart. It even forces us to seek an ally on the other side of the world, who touches some of our cultural values, but is a whole different nation, and sometimes pushes it too far.   There is however 0 intent throughout Europe to attack or invade Russia. Nobody has that need or urge to make your country smaller, to take a square centimeter of your soil. Russia belongs to the Rus, as it has been for hundreds of years.   But breaking these laws, where you steal back lands that previously belonged to you (krimea) (without asking for international permission, how it should go) And now attacking Ukraine, or any possible other country, could ignite World War 3, thousands could die by this stupid bluffing game. In an era where we agreed to never use wars again to solve diplomatic differences. But here we are today, one paranoid country that has trust issues, disrupting an entire continent. Europe cannot let this go, nobody wants war anymore, but there are lines no country should cross for the sake of our own safety. Borders are there to be respected, countries have formed and shouldn't be altered anymore, especially not by external force and demand, this is what we agreed upon after World War 2, *"This no more"*. Apes fight for territory and power, we're hopefully smarter than that.	1642208124.0	hspdlqy	t3_s436k4	t1_hsooawi	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hspdlqy/

gapfvci3	Salad "VINAIGRETTE"   Thoroughly washed potatoes, beets and carrots boil in a saucepan, and then peel. In addition to the mentioned vegetables, you will need:   pickled or pickled cucumbers - 2-3 pieces of medium size;   half a can of canned peas;   150-200 g sauerkraut;   juice of half a lemon;   herbs and spices to taste;   vegetable oil.   The order of preparation:   The cooled vegetables are peeled, cut into cubes, put in a convenient salad bowl.   Sauerkraut get rid of excess liquid, wringing it out with your hands beforehand, add it to other vegetables.   We discard the peas on a sieve, letting the excess liquid drain, pour it into the other ingredients of the vinaigrette.   Now we proceed to the preparation of the dressing, for this we mix lemon juice, spices, herbs, green onion feathers and vegetable oil in a separate bowl.   Fill the vegetables with dressing and mix thoroughly.   Let the salad stand in the refrigerator for about half an hour.	1642223810.0	hsq9yh8	t3_s47lsn	t3_s47lsn	/r/russia/comments/s47lsn/looking_for_recipes/hsq9yh8/

gapfvci3	"I think it also brings me to Putin. ... in our country, we don't have much love for our leaders. My God, how much shit our prime minister gets is just unbelievable. I'm curious why there is a protective culture around him. Is it just because you can't really change anything?"   You see, my friend, some things can only be understood in the context of some distant events. Imagine that some person saved your life when you were in imminent danger of death. Well, let's say you were hanging over the abyss on a bunch of blades of grass, and realized that another minute or two, and you were already flying into the abyss and this is the complete end. And all your emotions about it. And there is no hope, no hope at all. The only reality is death at the bottom. Introduced?   .   That's about the state in which Russia was suspended over the abyss after the collapse of the USSR.  It is necessary to describe what was going on then for a long time and in detail. But how the enemies of Russia triumphed! Here is a quote from Brzezinski: ""The New World Order will be built against Russia, on the ruins of Russia and at the expense of Russia."   That is, he has already buried all of us - it was assumed, apparently, that we would all really die of hunger, and there would be stacks of our corpses and the corpses of our children on the streets of our cities. And I'm not exaggerating, we all felt the approach of something like this.   When I saw a university professor selling some spoons taken out of the house at the market to buy food, and old veterans selling their orders... And terrorist attacks almost every day! And the war in Chechnya, which seemed endless. And the salary that has not been paid for months. And complete hopelessness - where to get food?   And then Putin came to power. The war in Chechnya ended two weeks later with the complete destruction of the bandits. They started paying off their salary debts. There were still terrorist attacks, but less and less, and then they stopped altogether. They started paying off pension debts. In short, we suddenly felt a timid hope that this fall of the country into the abyss would stop.   And then suddenly roads and bridges began to be built, emergency housing in cities was replaced with new comfortable high-rise buildings, whole streets and neighborhoods were built. And then suddenly it turned out that the eternally unprofitable agriculture began to make a profit, and we went from food importer to exporters...   No, you won't understand. Young people here who did not live at that time, they also no longer understand   But those who survived that horror - they will hold on to Putin with their hands, teeth and claws. Because we have always remembered that "the safest place is behind his back."	1642238605.0	hsqvu4z	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsqvu4z/
g80r0	These issues can't be separated from anything else. In my opinion, Russia has huge potential. But it's wasted on confrontation and dumb things. We should be trying to take over the world economically and culturally. But instead of that we're trying to take over Ukraine and letting our corrupt politicians and oligarchs to take over our country. All things protected and built by our great ancestors belongs to oligarchs now. Things like Norilsk Nikel and Magnitogorsk MMK was built by generations of soviet people whose grandchildren live in (or close to) poverty now. Even our "great culture" now belongs to a bunch of wank stains who can gatekeep everything. And the country is moving to be even more closed and more authoritarian. And it will make all that terrible people richer and the population even poorer. Saint-Petersburg will be filled with trash continuously from now on.

Apparently you claim to have been a Finnish citizen, and yet, you don't seem to understand even the basics of a Finnish society. Talking about gods and being fascist, which are something Finns never talk about but know that Russians do.  And it's somewhat silly to say that only Sweden and Russia genuinely like Finland. Where did the "little brother", Estonia go? Or Norway? Or Denmark? Or Iceland? Or Japan? And just that you know, Sweden is often considered to like Finland the least, of Nordic-countries. You should know at least these if you claim to have lived in Finland.  Also, you should tone down the book quotes. It's an another clue that you have no knowledge about Finnish people. Finns don't take those seriously and avoid quoting people -- because quite frankly, it's a bit dumb.  I wonder if an average Russian citizen sees you as a troll as easily or are you targeting the less educated only? Most of your comment history seems to be about propaganda.

In general if American writers need a big bad enemy they choose Russia as the next major super power for two reasons.   1) The cold war so people are already fairly familiar with Russia.   2) It's believable   3) Putin has done lots of shady things on the international stage to keep Russia in the forefront of everyone's minds as potential bad guys.   4) China would be the next obvious Country but they're a huge film market and will block anything that makes China look bad so American film makers don't want to make them the bad guy.	1642603661.0	htbn1va	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbkgp1	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbn1va/

The film maker has to apply, they don't need to refuse support from this office.   They have fake military vehicles they can use and CGI. They don't need real tanks and airplanes. It helps authenticity to have the real deal but the film makers have to pay for the time of the equipment.

4qgbb	> You my friend are an exception, until the last couple of years, I was largely taught the Soviet horde myth by television and school.  I dunno what you're watching because I watch tons of documentaries and WWII movies and didn't really see that as widespread doctrine. What I did see was underequipped (generally not rifle wise as portrayed in Enemy at the gates) Russian forces, especially early in the war, in far superior numbers go against German army's and get beaten back. Not all the time, but some of the time. It's not a secret that Germans at the start of the war had better weapons, training, strategy and more supplies.   So seeing Russian forces lose with much larger numbers on the battlefield field and experiencing much higher casualties is not really a myth. It's also not the whole picture of the whole war either. By the end of the war the Russians were pumping out great tanks in the T-34 and other designs, had better strategies to counter the Germans, and frankly steamrolled them all the way back to Berlin.   But to deny that there were battles, especially early in the war in which the Russians had far more people, and lost to much smaller German forces due to inferior weapons and tactics is just denying history. We only learn from history when we study the good and the bad. Not just that which makes us feel proud of ourselves and our people.	1642606394.0	htbtpzj	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbs0qn	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbtpzj/

eahhpais	I can with an honest heart say I love the russian people, in so far as I've had any experience with them. And I see little use in joining NATO. But as a swedish soldier and teacher, I see no use in lying. I see little use in lies and thinly veiled threats.   Why should we not react when the Russian state makes such provocations? It's not like we are in a position to attack you. So these silly quips about "Estonia and Sweden are hightening the aggression"? Come on! It isn't 1698 or something! And yes, I do understand NATO wants to use us as pawns, I get that. But does that make threats directed at us any better?  And honestly, if it came to blows, to me it matters little to me that you would kill me in the end. No matter what, my native soil is mine. And no amount of death can turn wrong into right.  I don't want to rob Russia of your sovereignty, your rights, or your beauty and life.

i7lavsor	Maybe this is partly true. But satelite pictures do show large russian forces mobilized at the border to Ukraine. It is no wonder that there now are talks between Russia and a lot of other nations to calm down the situation. Its not just all headlines. Yes, western media is biased to put Russia forward as the bad guy. But the same goes for Russian media, just the other way around. No matter how you put it there is no wonder about the situation being very tense right now - perhaps the most tense since the cold war… 150 k russian troops at the border to Ukraine aint a joke. Especially when it involves a lot of tanks. And Ukraine importing equipment from Britain and the US… Sweden mobilizing their troops… Russia sending drones to inspect swedish nuclear factories… the situation is no joke….

dj1wcws2	American here, yes. But its interesting to know that Russians are simultaneously desperate to turn Ukraine in to Russian territory, while decrying how no one would ever want them (literally just means the west to you) to be THEIR asset. And then cites nord stream to say why.   The reason nord stream occured is because Ukraine is between Russia and Europe and can tax the oil being sent through its territory. Obviously and naturally, this pissed Russia off. But then to turn around and claim "SEE! WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM!" While you're actively doing the exact opposite on the ground. Ok, then give back Crimea and never deal with Ukraine again, then? Hell, that'd even get the western sanctions off your back.  Seems like it SHOULD BE a  win win from a russian's perspective.   Furthermore, Russia has a smaller GDP (1.29 trillion, though i think thats up to 1.4 now, $8,735 per capita) than a single US state, Texas (1.7 trillion gdp, $58,000 per capita). With around 5 times as much population (29.3 million vs 144million) . So why is it the case that the same shouldn't ALSO be said of Russia, if it should be said of Ukraine in the first place?   The cold hard truth is, Russia put its self in the position its in. The cold hard truth is russians are a bit wrapped up in a superiority complex. And the cold hard truth is, the world needs the Russian people to stand up to their own government. No ill will friend, just a frustrated plea for sanity from a fellow human on this planet.	1642629703.0	htdkf88	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htca8l0	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htdkf88/

Russia has *already* invaded and taken Ukrainian land despite guaranteeing their sovereignty in exchange for them giving up nukes in the 90s *and having given them that land*.  Russia is a warmongering, imperialist, fascist dictatorship.
