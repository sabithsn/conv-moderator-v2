ja1ys	When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself.

Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.

ocfkrx5	Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	1640883951.0	hqkek1y	t3_rs5386	t3_rs5386	/r/Conservative/comments/rs5386/is_the_covid_vaccine_causing_the_virus_to_mutate/hqkek1y/

4deig	Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	1640884421.0	hqkfsmx	t3_rs2a6g	t1_hqkdmd7	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2a6g/teachers_school_permanently_cancelled_after_wolf/hqkfsmx/

I feel like the only conservative left and the rest of you are posers.  The fact that any of you disagree with me about children being hurt is frankly very concerning.

It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.	1640908800.0	hqm5zfc	t3_rs2z4z	t1_hqka0aa	/r/Conservative/comments/rs2z4z/joe_rogan_forced_to_cancel_vancouver_show_because/hqm5zfc/

41zh15ba	There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	1640915594.0	hqmloyy	t3_rsb7fw	t1_hqmjhlc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqmloyy/

Then you accuse Trump of being responsible for 240,000 deaths and promise to "shutdown the virus"... BOOM, 80m votes.

Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	1640928277.0	hqnbu85	t3_rsb7fw	t1_hqmaz7p	/r/Conservative/comments/rsb7fw/nearly_threequarters_of_republicans_do_not/hqnbu85/

We’ve had 2 school shootings in the history of the UK, 1 back in 1850 where 2 pupils where killed and then the Dunblane massacre in 1996 in which 16 pupils, a teacher and the shooter where killed. That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.   The USA has had 34 school shootings in 2021 alone, the fact that doesn’t prompt any change in your laws shows how little the gun nuts over there actually care about others, even the nations children	1640954564.0	hqoc1da	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqnjdqq	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqoc1da/

3yowjutx	Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.	1640962327.0	hqoq6vm	t3_rsr767	t1_hqongi0	/r/Conservative/comments/rsr767/more_than_200_marines_have_been_discharged_from/hqoq6vm/

jnab5	The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.

I'm glad that the people from Germany and the Netherlands treat each other like good friends and don't hold onto the past.

First work on lowering the amount of school shootings, armed robberies, police brutality, gang violence, gun misshaps (children getting their hands on a gun) by at least taking away guns from people, or by improving living conditions so that people don't feel forced to steal  and getting cops an actual education so they won't act like some damn triggerhappy gunman.	1640968980.0	hqp5itl	t3_rsjztp	t1_hqopt9z	/r/Conservative/comments/rsjztp/cant_take_my_guns/hqp5itl/

So, dash cams would be good, but this seems even less intrusive, since it’s not recording YOU, and less hassle, since it’s built into the car.	1640969031.0	hqp5n7i	t3_rsxf3z	t1_hqp59hh	/r/Conservative/comments/rsxf3z/always_watching_new_car_models_sold_in_the_eu/hqp5n7i/

v4d0r	Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way. But, since it seems like you agree that the vaccine prevents hospitalization and infections, let’s go from there. If the vaccines work, then why would we be having more infections overall? That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	1640969577.0	hqp6ztu	t3_rsx714	t1_hqp67xv	/r/Conservative/comments/rsx714/california_facing_huge_coronavirus_surge_despite/hqp6ztu/

3k7lj	And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	1640975460.0	hqplir0	t3_rswl23	t1_hqp8ldp	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hqplir0/

10l2gu	Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	1640976448.0	hqpnxin	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqpjcly	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqpnxin/

I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that. Just making claims that the south was all Democrats until the 1990s and absolutely nothing to back up that clearly false claim.	1640984773.0	hqq7tei	t3_rsu3yj	t1_hqq6uis	/r/Conservative/comments/rsu3yj/occupy_democrats_tells_republican_congresswoman/hqq7tei/

1ijqxzo1	Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	1640996485.0	hqqxq4v	t3_rsz1on	t3_rsz1on	/r/Conservative/comments/rsz1on/leftist_hypocrisy_never_fails_to_disappoint/hqqxq4v/

97sysua4	Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

Then conveniently despite affidavits by election workers witnessing fraud in every metropolitan city, challenges of the 2020 election where all dismissed by the courts.   It’s funny how Black Lives Matter can encircle the White House, actually charge the capital building and vandalize it, and not one mention of domestic terrorism or insurrection made by this current regime. Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done. She was allowed into the capital building, was unarmed, and was shot by some goon cop all of the sudden the libs are praising after bitching about the cops in every controversial police shooting.	1641016364.0	hqrzp1e	t3_rta54r	t1_hqrjuuv	/r/Conservative/comments/rta54r/documentary_drops_inconvenient_truths_on_the_jan/hqrzp1e/

Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead.

Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	1641025880.0	hqscmti	t3_rt81tm	t1_hqsbtm8	/r/Conservative/comments/rt81tm/abortion_leading_global_cause_of_death_in_2021/hqscmti/

6reyf	*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	1641144332.0	hqyew7b	t3_rubpjb	t1_hqyeac4	/r/Conservative/comments/rubpjb/marjorie_taylor_greenes_personal_twitter_account/hqyew7b/

As a liberal, I fully agree with you that we should make social media a public utility and have a full government take over.	1641148639.0	hqyqfmg	t3_rubpjb	t1_hqy5dgv	/r/Conservative/comments/rubpjb/marjorie_taylor_greenes_personal_twitter_account/hqyqfmg/

2i647xg1	Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket.

It is the right of sovereign countries to determine who enters, and under what circumstances.   But I understand you’re keen to change the subject and talk Covid.	1641177390.0	hr0rybx	t3_runb02	t1_hr0qw6k	/r/Conservative/comments/runb02/liz_cheney_gives_the_game_away_when_she_reveals/hr0rybx/
o3d7y3o	https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-data-vaccinated-people-do-not-carry-covid-19-2021-3?op=1  > During an MSNBC interview with Rachel Maddow on Monday, Walensky said: "Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick, and that it's not just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real-world data."  I’d like to agree with you, but earlier this year there were hundreds of articles touting this information. The narrative changes everyday sadly.	1641177420.0	hr0s10v	t3_rswl23	t1_hqpcdz1	/r/Conservative/comments/rswl23/maybe_most_conspiracies_arent_conspiracies_after/hr0s10v/

Especially because here I’m actually advocating a conservative, risk-averse position... and one I share with ALL of my conservative family members.]	1641208501.0	hr270ou	t3_rug9up	t1_hr0jhf4	/r/Conservative/comments/rug9up/biden_signs_137_million_deal_for_covid_test_strip/hr270ou/

I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.   I can go on but the furthest left wing is anarchism in which there is no authority over you in any way, government, corporation etc.  Where am I rejecting history?	1642531418.0	ht7l8vq	t3_s6ylb4	t1_ht7fqxp	/r/Conservative/comments/s6ylb4/reddit_leftists_go_to_guide/ht7l8vq/

But i have never waited for more then 10 minutes so i never felt the need for that.   If that would be the sole reason in my opinion you could either implement something that water and other things can't be labelled. Or have water be handed out be the polling place itself.

When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.

16j64h	Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.

e8kgkot	>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	1642540155.0	ht88z4n	t3_s6mcgc	t1_ht84p08	/r/Conservative/comments/s6mcgc/i_have_a_dream_that_my_four_little_children_will/ht88z4n/

23lhp1yt	This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	1642540649.0	ht8abw3	t3_s766uk	t1_ht85el6	/r/Conservative/comments/s766uk/who_did_it/ht8abw3/

It is a tolerable compromise to ensure that Americans who are often quite literally on the other side of the planet have a say in their government.

Lol "it's a whole other thing" just admit you have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them. We have one of THE most progressive tax systems in the world which by definition is socialist (taking more from some to provide benefits to all). If you want to talk about implementing a non socialist flat tax system I'm al ears. Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth.

dzsbz	The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable.

I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all.

What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not?

If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers.

96uj9	Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	1642622557.0	htd0v56	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htczgr0	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd0v56/
96uj9	We just don’t see it, or hear it, because we don’t talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say “the leftists” or “the democrats”, not the looters.   Just like democrats say “the republicans that stormed the capitol”. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say “hey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b”. It’s disgusting that we as a people have so little say, or are ignored in what our views our. Currently, we HAVE to match what our leaders say.	1642622935.0	htd1vw8	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htcxips	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd1vw8/

96uj9	Yeah this isn’t even going to go anywhere. You can’t even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don’t agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that’s all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says “go home”, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don’t stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to.

cvsrv	I mean yea, I fully support any gun ownership as long as gun laws are super strict. Preferably some training for anything bigger than some pistols but mainly a register of what guns are where, crackdowns on loophole selling etc. Stricter laws the bigger the gun gets but not things like financial restrictions or time based, it still has to be possible to get guns if you really want something bigger.	1642624819.0	htd6ywn	t3_s7obiw	t1_htd56w2	/r/Conservative/comments/s7obiw/manchin_we_already_have_laws_to_ensure_people/htd6ywn/
96uj9	Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	1642624844.0	htd71ec	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htd52bd	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd71ec/

96uj9	Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I’m general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it’s a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it’s a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it’s a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics?

96uj9	So on that same side, do you think there were no republicans that utilized the rioting and looting for their own benefit? Or exacerbated it?   Again, those people that were at the capitol and looters are not democrats or republicans. They’re anarchists. They’re terrorists. And they’re people that do not know how to handle situations rationally.

96uj9	You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	1642625832.0	htd9qjg	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htd6e4g	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htd9qjg/

96uj9	I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	1642626898.0	htdcnjt	t3_s7rzsf	t1_htd9fav	/r/Conservative/comments/s7rzsf/5_kids_shot_in_chicago_pastor_brooks_asks_where/htdcnjt/

Or we will just see pipes burst and vote counting "stopped" long enough to get the watchers out of the building so new Democrat ballots can be pulled from a sketchy vans at 3am.	1642703919.0	hthq527	t3_s8ikcb	t1_htgnytv	/r/Conservative/comments/s8ikcb/cnns_dana_bash_jarring_to_hear_biden_say_2022/hthq527/

I'm worn out from so many people around me living their life as "do as I say not as I do". So many conservative veterans are out voluntarily ruining their lives for a rich kid who dodged the military but feels like he's a leader. For goodness sake Fox News won a definition case simply by claiming Tucker Carlson never states actual facts and is instead engaging in ' exaggeration ' and non literal commentary.

If they can censor *opinions*, they are no longer acting in the best interests of all people and are instead being weaponized as tools of those in power. That is not okay.  While we're at it, how about that $400 billion in tax payer money that companies received to build the internet as a public utility? What ever happened there?  Privatized gains and socialized losses.

1ebgiraa	Lol, don’t worry, 81 million people didn’t vote for Biden he just got 81 million “votes” from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you’ll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they’ll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don’t see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the “worst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics” even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you’re a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you’re constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	1642743708.0	htkazbt	t3_s92e33	t1_htk5o89	/r/Conservative/comments/s92e33/make_congress_great_again_imagine_a_republican/htkazbt/

fsosoups	It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately. I’m a conservative leaning independent and I think a lot of the Covid stuff is bs, but this was full of bullshit dude. Just telling you that this is like the left saying “all the children are on vents” “ gunshots can’t be treated too many ivermectin ods!!”.	1642776455.0	htlqhto	t3_s8v6pb	t1_htjefpt	/r/Conservative/comments/s8v6pb/scheduled_for_execution_unvaxxed_covid_patient/htlqhto/

80w74qh9	Trump made repeated swipes at DeSantis in his interview with OANN(which is propagandist garbage, but the video interviews are at least useful).   He's basically backtracking and gaslighting people on the subject now.   After his repeated flip-flopping and backpeddling, let's not beat around the bush here,   Trump is a coward and doesn't want to make waves when it's politically inconvenient *for him*, especially since DeSantis has broad support among his base as well as actual conservatives who do not support Trump anymore or never did in the first place.   Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	1642825060.0	htp7xz4	t3_s9e8b5	t1_htogmaj	/r/Conservative/comments/s9e8b5/trump_my_beef_with_desantis_is_totally_fake_news/htp7xz4/

From the article the author pasted in this article: Boosted vs unvaccinated isn’t even close. Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000. That’s somewhere between 3 times and 15 times the risk of death to be unvaccinated.

Ignoring the obvious (rape etc.), it makes absolutely zero sense to compel a woman to carry to term.

hck4f6vo	It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense.

hck4f6vo	Right, so by you’re logic you’re quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can’t support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it’s acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It’s the ‘parents responsibility’ to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they’ll suddenly ‘get it’ and do a good job… but they’re not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	1642865579.0	htr3m6h	t3_s9yyhq	t1_htr1csc	/r/Conservative/comments/s9yyhq/governors_of_fl_and_va_tweets_out_their_support/htr3m6h/

hck4f6vo	So I’m presuming you support policies that help mothers/fathers provide the best possible car for the child once it is born? I presume you’d fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves? Or is it some binary thing of “alive or dead” where quality of that life means fuck all?  If you fully support the above, then we may disagree but I could see your stance. If you’re of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you’re not pro life at all, you’re pro control and don’t care about welfare of the child at all.	1642865811.0	htr460d	t3_s9yyhq	t1_htr3loz	/r/Conservative/comments/s9yyhq/governors_of_fl_and_va_tweets_out_their_support/htr460d/

26i4wezq	Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	1642870627.0	htrfylz	t3_sa5wzj	t3_sa5wzj	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htrfylz/

f9qfu	 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	1642885253.0	htsgwl5	t3_sa5wzj	t1_htrqxn3	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htsgwl5/

73pe89ba	Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	1642887419.0	htsm85y	t3_sa5wzj	t1_hts7yem	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htsm85y/

Followed up with something along the lines of:   "I will not call them by the gender they say they are, but I will respect them as a person and only attack their opinions." - unless there's a genuine reason to attack them as a person (Ex: Demi and Alok)   "I will call them by gender they say they are out of respect, but that doesn't mean I have to believe it."	1642888485.0	htsoutm	t3_saa9vy	t1_htsmms0	/r/Conservative/comments/saa9vy/what_is_a_woman_controversy_after_dr_phil_puts/htsoutm/

Doctors visits with no insurance or bad insurance are very high priced, vitamins, baby supplies etc even on the cheapest most generic you can find adds up to a lot of money. The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child. Pregnancy care is child care and only having a man pay child support after a birth still ends up putting a woman in financial trouble.	1642889243.0	htsqq39	t3_sa5wzj	t1_htrbv77	/r/Conservative/comments/sa5wzj/your_terms_are_acceptable/htsqq39/

8fyn1am	When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	1642921808.0	htuqjn2	t3_saimuf	t1_htupupg	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htuqjn2/

8fyn1am	Is it extremely small compared to the one life?  My math is back of napkin, but there's \~300 million people in the US, so to "balance" the 100% of 1 you only need \~0.0000000003%(1/300,000,000). And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	1642923213.0	htusjqc	t3_saimuf	t1_hturk29	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htusjqc/

8fyn1am	So what...the 5 million who died from COVID aren't significant enough?  Roe happened in 1973. It's been 49 years. That means on average we see 1.29 million deaths per year from abortions.  COVID has been around for 2 years and we've seen 5m deaths.  That's 2.5m per year.  You're going to get the vaccine now, right?	1642926883.0	htuxhqc	t3_saimuf	t1_htuwot2	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htuxhqc/
ibf4x	Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	1642927858.0	htuyr34	t3_saimuf	t1_htusjqc	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htuyr34/

8fyn1am	It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	1642929675.0	htv12ql	t3_saimuf	t1_htuyr34	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htv12ql/

8fyn1am	First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	1642932554.0	htv4q4n	t3_saimuf	t1_htv20f2	/r/Conservative/comments/saimuf/poll_nearly_onethird_of_americans_say_they_have/htv4q4n/

We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.

A lot of the people in anti-work did do trade school.***     Most jobs nowadays requires bachelors, or 5-10 years of experience in a trade to even make some semblance of a living.     \---     I've calculated different jobs for myself, and all of them end up work 40 hours/week 5-6 days a week for the next 40-50 year, then retire on <3,000/month. **If I get a bachelors, or go back to trade school for a better trade, I can do it slightly faster & maybe go on vacation once a year.**     That's not living, that's slavery. Even if we have the best working conditions, it doesn't mean it's a good thing. ***Another's trash is another mans' treasure, but it'll always be trash to someone.***     In this case? It's a trash system to many.	1642954057.0	htw5vso	t3_satdtp	t1_htw0nus	/r/Conservative/comments/satdtp/experts_warn_a_marxist_revolution_is_under_way_in/htw5vso/

Or everyone’s blatant fear of COVID makes them contract it. Iv been around so many COVID positive people, and still haven’t gotten it. I haven’t taken an antibody test yet, but if I have antibodies, I must of been asymptomatic.

c7skv	The problem is, the high skill & high wage jobs are like this.     ***"Specialization in a trade that is in high demand will yield superior wages."***     ***That's the biggest lie you probably tell yourself.*** A masters plumber should make 25-35$+/hour, but they can barely make more than an apprentice at ***<20$. Maybe above 12$/hour if they are lucky.***     A mechanic won't make more than a beginner mechanic unless they can snipe the good paying job from the couple lead mechanic positions in an autobody shop.      Even college kids, and trade skillers who spent 5-10 years training, and learning aren't guaranteed a decent paying job with a decent workplace.     A computer technician, programmer, etc needs a bachelors, and 2-5 years of experience just to get started in the field. **OR** they could go the apprenticeship route, and make less than minimum wage for 2-5 years just to get the experience needed, and even then they aren't guaranteed the job they need to put food on the table for one.     With Inflation, jobs paying <20 for unskilled labor even when said labor can lead to 5day 9hour work weeks where you break your back to just live.     You need a minimum of 20-25$/hour just to live beyond eating well everyday, and paying utilities.     \---     You can't make it well for yourself in todays economy. It's not an Obama, Trump, or Biden thing. It's a 60,70s, and 80s problem that caused this. It is not a republican, or democrat problem. It's an American problem.     ***Minimum Wage needs to be 25-30 dollars just to live, and anything less than 45$/hour you need to work 30-40 hours/week, 60+ years of your life, then you can retire.***     Yes, this is America & you could make something of it. Most of the time? You won't be able to cause you're making 20-25$/hour just to make ends meet by yourself.	1642960768.0	htwn91l	t3_satdtp	t1_htw7lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/satdtp/experts_warn_a_marxist_revolution_is_under_way_in/htwn91l/

Not to mention,   > Domestic violence is more common than any other health problem among women during pregnancy.   https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy  I sincerely hope I don’t get banned for posting this link. I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.	1642981870.0	hty62ig	t3_sb2o9b	t3_sb2o9b	/r/Conservative/comments/sb2o9b/being_prochoice_is_really_just_being_prolife/hty62ig/

57g1vzpi	Yes, why would somebody blame Trump for helping to try to overturn an election when he told people that the election was rigged and falsely claiming that Mike Pence could overturn the election on 1/6 if he just ignored the will of the voters. /s He was literally the one who brought them there by pedaling bullshit. According to testimony he actually intended to go to the capital and didn't because the Secret Service told him they wouldn't be able to protect him. He only managed his "we love you. stand down" bullshit after a great deal of pressuring by others including his daughter and he still wasn't the one to request reinforcements.

57g1vzpi	It took forever to actually get a response for the problem and the President of the United States wasn't ever even who called for reinforcements. Apparently getting him to provide his half-assed message to tell his own followers to leave the capital was its own project that required a great deal of pressure. This shouldn't need to be said, but just because somebody acts like a dictator doesn't mean they're a rolemodel.	1643049620.0	hu1vr1r	t3_sbl7op	t1_hu0wufk	/r/Conservative/comments/sbl7op/trump_if_pelosi_had_not_turned_down_soldiers/hu1vr1r/
a9fcj2	Name another US prez that publicly insisted to his base that an election was “fake” and “rigged”.  That right there to me is a huge red flag. I don’t understand why you don’t see that as particularly heinous. Yeah, that in and of itself is, admittedly, not direct evidence for the claim of insurrection, but it certainly lays the groundwork.   Does the damage that rhetoric caused to the foundation of our democracy not concern you?	1643049672.0	hu1vw7p	t3_sblwzu	t1_hu1um4e	/r/Conservative/comments/sblwzu/after_brutalizing_trump_for_doubting_elections/hu1vw7p/

a9fcj2	The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.'

a9fcj2	Let’s be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what “side” they’re on. So don’t try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I’m not.   But you’re trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn’t be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn’t clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to “protest” a “stolen” election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	1643051440.0	hu20n7j	t3_sblwzu	t1_hu1saek	/r/Conservative/comments/sblwzu/after_brutalizing_trump_for_doubting_elections/hu20n7j/
