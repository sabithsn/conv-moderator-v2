4l0x27dk	it's not an unpaid day off work lol. you don't need a whole day off work to go vote. employers must allow employees to leave to go vote.  and no, $30 is not much money at all. your telling me, that there is an excuse for someone to not have $30 by the age of 18 to go get a standard ID that's required for mostly everything in life, besides voting?

4agkycb3	Lol, last I looked, the post is up by 32, champ. My fellow lefty friends also found it funny, not because it’s trying to make profound and articulate sentiment on a political humor sub, but because it encapsulates a common mis-conception with the bad-luck Brian meme on a political humor sub. But of course you and a couple other mouth breathers with the self awareness of rocks, got triggered like basement Magats. Grow some fucking skin, you peach blossom. Stop with the victim hood. Not everything poking fun at the left has to include a disclaimer showing that the alternative is a complete shit show.	1642712543.0	hticbcx	t3_s8d29l	t1_hthzijc	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8d29l/fool_me_once/hticbcx/

5xhezl84	It does make them untrue; if he has no right to defend others property, he couldn’t have been there to defend property.  If he has no medical aid training or means to administer medical aid, then he couldn’t have been there to administer aid.  You’re right, the law as written means that has no legal bearing.     But, it’s established the rules of engagement going forward.  So when some leftist goes to a Trump rally to “administer aid” and blasts three people, they can simply use the Rittenhouse defense, and it’s all kosher.  Which is fine by me.	1642715976.0	htiluan	t3_s85mjs	t1_htibo6l	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s85mjs/dont_underestimate_the_enemy/htiluan/

6l4z3	Hello! Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately it has been removed because you don't meet our karma threshold.   You are not being removed for political orientation.  If we were, why the fuck would we tell you your comment was being removed instead of just shadow removing it?  We never have, and never will, remove things down politicial or ideological lines. Unless your ideology is nihilism, then fuck you.     Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: "if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.""    If you wish to rectify your low karma issue, go and make things up in /r/AskReddit like everyone else does.    Thanks for understanding! Have a nice day and be well. <3    You can check your karma breakdown on this page:    http://old.reddit.com/user/me/overview    (Keep in mind that sometimes just post karma or comment karma being negative will result in this message)    ~  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was a patriot who wanted America to be better and to dominate the world, BLM despise America and want to destroy it and help America's enemies. He wouldnt support black people like Michael Brown that tried to kill cops who were just doing their job.

8ickh	Dude, even if we humored your transphobic nonsense, the concept of changing your name isn't even necessarily a trans issue.  Cis people change or go by different names all the time.  If you grew up with some girl whose parents named her Bertha and you overheard her later introduce herself as Beth, you wouldn't start "correcting the record" and telling everybody that she lied and her name is actually Bertha, right?  No, at most you would probably say she used to be named Bertha.  Even if the same hypothetical girl changed her name from something common to something you thought was ridiculous (but still feminine/neutral), you wouldnt say that isn't her name.  So then why the hell are you so obsessed with what this person's name is to the point that you not just disagreeing with the choice but outright saying it's not their name?  Don't you think that is at least a little weird?	1642743838.0	htkb7yc	t3_s8w9pr	t1_htk85kv	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8w9pr/do_as_i_say_not_as_i_do/htkb7yc/

Your male genitalia also suffer from your birth defect.

You're not being held at gunpoint, no one is threatening to force you to transition, you don't have to go to pride parades if you don't want to, you are free to have whatever beliefs you like and shit on people irrationally who have nothing to do with you. All good, don't expect LGBT people to like or tolerate you but by all means continue getting off on obsessing about minorities.  The least you could is treat trans people with the same respect you afford anyone else, hell even the same respect you afford dogs would still be a step up. That's not her name, she does not go by that name. Anyone can change their name, it has nothing to do with biology. She has also expressed that she identifies with womanhood and would like to be referred to with female pronouns. A lot of words to explain a very simple process by which you can show respect for her and her mental health.  No one is saying that chromosomes don't exist. No one is saying we can change all the chromosomes in the body. Kind of the whole point of being trans is having an identity that doesn't match how you were assigned and raised and feeling distress depression and discomfort with your body and how people perceive you. Plenty of other illnesses that have similar problems and you don't have much trouble respecting them. You don't insist on referring to married people by their maiden names just because "biologically your DNA is of the family you were born in so I outright refuse to change how I refer to you because its not scientific" even though that argument holds exactly the same principal to it.  If you won't afford people your basic respect, then your just showing your hand that you have no actual argument scientific or otherwise and are in fact just stubbornly continuing to dismiss people based on something you clearly don't understand. Maybe actually talk to a trans person, read the experiences of trans people, actually listen to them when they talk about how they feel. It really doesn't take much.	1642746282.0	htkfeo9	t3_s8w9pr	t1_htkc6fv	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8w9pr/do_as_i_say_not_as_i_do/htkfeo9/

16nr8n	100% you nimrod:  > Finally, more cohesive groups did render poorer quality decisions as group size increased.   https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James-Driskell/publication/239934322_Group_Cohesiveness_and_Quality_of_Decision_Making_An_Integration_of_Tests_of_the_Groupthink_Hypothesis/links/548710910cf268d28f0705f9/Group-Cohesiveness-and-Quality-of-Decision-Making-An-Integration-of-Tests-of-the-Groupthink-Hypothesis.pdf  > These figures give some suggestion of the importance of group size: one of the two cases where groupthink was avoided was the smallest group, and the group responsible for the other case of groupthink avoided (missile crisis) was smaller (13 vs 18) than the similar group responsible for the prototypic groupthink case (Bay of Pigs). Across the seven cases, group size is correlated r(5)=.48 with absence or presence of groupthink. (Group homogeneity, group insulation, and promotional leadership are correlated .55, .55, and .73 with presence of groupthink across the same seven cases (see Table 1 of McCauley, 1989)). There is considerable experimiental evidence that group size affects group product. Perhaps the most studied aspect of group dynamics since the 1950s is the phenomenon of group polarization (Brown, 1989, Chapter 6; see especially ’tHart, 1990, on groupshift in relation to groupthink), and the size of the risky shift was found to increase as group size increased from 3 to 8 (Teger & Pruitt, 1967). In the metaanalysis of groupthink experiments cited above, Mullen et al. (1994) found that the correlation of cohesion and decision quality became more negative with increasing group size. That is, high cohesion conditions were more likely than low cohesion conditions to produce poor decisions when group size was relatively large. This and other research by Mullen (1987, 1991) indicates that group size is “a potent predictor of group phenomena” (Mullen et al., 1994, p. 200).  https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/66344838/obhd.1998.275920210420-10126-1jh5uox-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1642787085&Signature=C4a4fdcF~FWFQSNkJERt0jA-aRyw97LyjKv~o4UI2~px6vev5HcmDbcHWqYmq1g8k5dqpT3yW5yKTmo3F2-6dF3rxIkLypQoPSajDTTRrXkuUeSWDWgd2UKdhKyZo8Pof-I-EphI3DY1ROrkIWgWZJEMi7gv5OgqlrJdDorBzahLoqRyaitnUboElh9LMpuHfbpfIhoVjhBu3uRLpxGSObg8r7IMss0cKjgTJlBYOH-4jeCJ2wIi8CeqG3lR1yBohAU1jr2mwyjljAffn7rerLl-QjLp3oQFWq75NOqajDtT37SrwzkZGIgf~9DwZHY2ZrhjYJbnLhnOiSl3yPIICQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA  Sit the fuck down you ignoramus.	1642783615.0	htm97kx	t3_s9agk7	t1_htm8opw	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htm97kx/

Neither did the Ojibwa, or the Potawatomi or the Iroquois or the Algonquin, or the Cherokee or Navajo, or the Comanche or the Kickapoo....no native population called the continent of North America, America. This is an undisputable fact.  And 25,000 years ago there were literally no human beings living on the continent that Europeans named North America.

This bitch wouldn't know what to do with a platform if he had it. It's easy to criticize anyone in leadership positions, but Theodore Roosevelt said it best...  It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world.	1642833561.0	htpnx51	t3_s9hozr	t1_htntoag	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9hozr/is_this_going_to_be_all_they_got_for_the_next_3/htpnx51/

The reddit downvote system is specifically designed to encourage people to all think the same. It causes people to be influenced by what someone else thought of a comment without even giving it proper judgement. It also discourages people from going against the grain because a majority on this site absolutely care about upvotes. Human nature is that people want external validation, and that's exactly what the up/downvote system does.

Please resubmit your post or comment without the bullying language.   Do not edit it, the bot cant tell if you edited, you will just have to make a new comment replying to the same thing.   Yes, this comment itself does use the word.  Any reasonable person should be able to understand that we are not insulting anyone with this comment. We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.  Notice how none of our automod replies have contractions in them either.   But seriously, calling someone retarded is only socially acceptable because the people affected are less able to understand that they are being insulted, and less likely to be able to respond appropriately.  It is a conversational wimpy little shit move, because everyone who uses it knows that it is offensive, but there will be no repercussions. At least the people throwing around other slurs know that they are going to get fired and get their asses beat when they use those words.   Also, it is not creative. It pretty much outs you as a thirteen year old when you use it. Instead of calling Biden retarded, you should call him a cartoon-ass-lookin trust fund goon who smiles like rich father just gifted him a new Buick in 1956.  Instead of calling Mitch Mcconnel retarded, you should call him a Dilbert-ass goon who has been left in the sun a little too long.   Sorry for the long message spamming comment sections, but this was by far the feature of this sub making people modmail and bitch at us the most, and literally all of the actions we take are to make it so we have to do less work in the future.  We will not reply to modmails about this automod, and ignore the part directly below this saying to modmail us if you have any questions, we cannot turn that off.  This reply is just a collation of the last year of modmail replies to people asking about this.  We are not turning this bot off, no matter how much people ask.  Nobody else has convinced us before, you will not be able to either. ~   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If I get 3+ shots, wear 2+ masks, only pull the masks down to eat or drink and stay 3' away from others, I MAY not get covid. if I do get Covid though, I have a 99% chance of surviving it. And if I do all the above, I may or may not spread Covid. But, if I live in the UK, I don't have to follow all the science. Am I right so far? Tell me, if Fauci (the science) says put your right foot in and shake it all about, shall I do that too? And lastly, the science says this is slowing down. So when all is said and done, and it possibly disappears, and you've followed all the rules and took all the shots, and still got Covid.....what will you think?

41dltdvq	So far he has been. Our allies don't hate us. He isn't empowering tyrants. Biden deserves to be raked over the coals for his handling of his domestic policies, other than getting people vaccinated. He doesn't have brain damage or a personality disorder. He isn't abusing presidential power. He ended the war. Cut childhood poverty, expanded food stamps for the needy. Pretty normally shit for a president all in all but commendable nonetheless. Plus the economy is doing better. Although that's probably more about Covid than Biden. Other than that he's just another useless douche filling the void. But there's a big difference between a useless douche and someone doing active damage to the foundations of American life. Biden sucks pretty hard imo but he isn't a threat to our system of government or our way of life beyond apathy to it's problems. Again, not the same as actively damaging those systems. It seems to me the primary difference is that a very solid majority on the right is so partisan and disconnected from reality that they're incapable of assessing an individual on the merits of their performance or situations on the facts of that situation without having that partisanship taint their conclusions. They hate Biden because he is a Democrat. Not for what he's done. His approval ratings back that up. They've hated him since before he was in office and have never judged his performance on the merits since. I haven't liked Biden since before he was in office but I'm fully willing to commend the good things he's done. Same goes for Trump. I didn't like the guy but he was all bad. He did do a few good things. There were just far more bad. That right wing hate from the get go for Biden has flowed into every opinion they've formed since. You've got people on the right suggesting the public drink piss to cure Covid, thinking JFK is coming to save them, that there's some massive election scam when there's zero evidence for it. From a non policy perspective the right has fostered a culture of anger, intolerance, belligerence, authoritarianism, silence and irrationality. I don't agree with a lot either party does but when you weigh the metrics of each of there's no real comparison here. One is flat out insane and the other is just ineffective and annoying from time to time. I'm not saying there aren't nuts on the left or that they don't cause problems. But they aren't generally institutionalized into the power structures of the country or party. I don't generally need to worry about some BLM rioter seeking office and then being held up as some kind of hero. Being given financial backing from the countries power brokers or a national media spotlight with which to launch their insanity into office from. I don't need to worry about the Democratic party attempting a coup. The left is annoying at times. They sometimes go to far with their Covid bs and woke nonsense but their hearts are in the right place. That's a normal disagreement about policy. There just is no real comparison here. The actions and motivations for them are night and day.	1642892629.0	htsz4cu	t3_sa108o	t1_htryenw	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sa108o/liberals_sharing_unironically_lmao/htsz4cu/

9658r	Yeah, I bet you don't want to get into it because it completely destroys all creditability for anyone stupid enough to still push or pushed it for years.  No, I don't have to.

9658r	> No, it’s because I know you don’t care what my opinion is. It feels like a waste of my time to share it with you.  Yeah because it's been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be a lie and anyone stupid enough to continue to parrot it only shows they have absolutely no idea what is going on. That's why you don't espouse your opinion of it. You know it's dead in the water.  The first sentence said alleged. Means they have no proof. Like Russian collusion, it's bullshit. Anyone could have wrote it. Just like the Russian dossier. The entire pretext to Russian collusion has been 100% confirmed to be fabricated.

But Rodgers released that holier than though statement around “independent thought” and how he’s just a skeptic who wants to learn as much as he can. He made it a point to say he follows both anti-vax scientists ) as well as those who think “vaccines are the greatest thing ever. That’s rich. I find it funny that he had no problem rattling off several names of nutjobs that are anti vax but conveniently didn’t list any of the scientists or the papers he’s read that show csccines are safe and effective.

The odds of that happening are so small as to be impossible. That’s anti-science.

The majority of the left believes elections are legitimate despite the fact that there is literally 0 reason to believe that they are - that’s anti-science.   The Green New Deal has 0 provisions for nuclear energy - that’s anti-science.   Evolution and climate change aren’t the only scientific areas that exists.

Regardless of where you stand, that was a win for conservatives. Funnily enough, Biden is currently building the wall. Our new justices slapped down Biden’s tyrannical vaccine mandates for businesses and federal workers. Big W. Hopefully they get Roe v Wade too. He showed how the media pumped out fake news. News outlets and social media intentionally mislead the public on the Covington kid for example. Bunch of liberals then practically wanted to lynch him. Another recent example is how the media and social media treated Rittenhouse. If you went by them then you’d believe that he mowed down an African American crowd. Thankfully he’s free and those pedos are dead. His policies resulted in the creation of 1.2 million domestic construction and manufacturing jobs. Additionally, his economic strategies $1.5 trillion being repatriated into the US from overseas. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is fucking up our inflation among many other things.  I also find it funny how despite having all this power right now, Dems can’t even pass progressive policies. In fact, progressives are losing ground at the courts. 2022 is looking to be a red tsunami, which will further impede progressives.

And believe me, they have done more research and pull from more sources than you.    I used to think they were off their rocker.  They said they would lock the country down, milk would be dumped, animals euthanized, and frickin toilet paper would be hogged of all things.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  And then it all happened and then some.  They even said which I began to support that they would demand proof of vaccination and that covid would require more than one shot because this wouldn't over until at least the end of 2022.  All the people who argued with me about the likelihood of vaccination have never argued with me again. That last thing about the end of 2022 remains to be seen but we're on track.  They're already talking about preparing for the next variant.  But you will fall in line and think it's best.  I just can't.

b2xjq8w8	Vaccinated & boosted people still get Covid.   You only have a 1-5% chance of being hospitalized form Covid per CDC and less than 2% chance of dying from Covid per CDC.   The odds of getting hospitalized and dying are so small already.   So without the vaccine you have a 95-99% chance of not being hospitalized and a 98.2% chance of not dying per CDC.  If you get vaccinated let say you get like 1% bump in protection against death so now 99% vs 98.2%. We know some vaccinated people have died so it’s not 100%.   Maybe it gives you 2-3% bump against hospitalization.   That’s pretty much it.   Vaccinated and boosted people still spread it. We are the most vaccinated we’ve ever been but cases are the highest.  The people really affected by Covid were the obese (3x more likely to end up in hospital) and the elderly.  Time to move on, we have a lot of shit to do and trying to force people to stay in despair over this is getting in the way of the work we need to do.	1642994303.0	htz0gf7	t3_sb994x	t1_htyul1y	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb994x/_/htz0gf7/

Maybe this guy is the scum of the earth, I’m not American so I don’t know and honesty can’t be bothered to look him up.  I’m just wondering if it’s wrong to use a racial slur,  are you allowed to use racial slur against bad people no matter their race?

55o8zrul	I don't have a messiah. I assume you're referencing Trump somehow ? When people always assume you're pro-Trump, just because you are critical of Biden, you can see they have fallen for the 'them, vs 'us' bullshit the media have sold them - ironically, often whilst criticising people for believing Fox News - and proving Biden has failed on another thing, the "unity" the country needed. Tragic.	1643000021.0	htzcndz	t3_sb7vyz	t1_htzbuqp	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb7vyz/turning_a_tabloid_into_a_news_channel/htzcndz/
3mmq6	> A far simpler explanation is that Bernie ran as an outsider and wasn't even a member of the Democratic party until it was necessary.  We all should recognize the DNC and RNC have a stranglehold over a critical part of our government.  A functional, consensus-based government would not choose the candidates our process chooses.  Can we mutually agree that it's a dysfunctional process that doesn't lead to good governance, good policy or the effective promotion of laws that are adopted by consensus?  > But organizations like the DNC are made up of people and those people will invariably favor the people they know and who have put in the time. First time around that bias was pretty clear, not great, but hardly surprising. Second time around there were a lot more Bernie people in the party putting in the time and the DNC was a lot better.  I think "putting in the time" has a lot implied and not stated and Bernie Sanders has been advocating for working people for many decades.  Can you describe what "putting in the time" actually means to you?  > Didn't change that the bulk of the party and candidates weren't on the left wing of the party. Nothing about any of this is sinister and is pretty obvious if you have spent any time around any organizations decision making, it's politics.  You focus on the fact that Bernie was an outsider.  What quality of insiders among Democrat leadership should be esteemed? What are regular party members holding onto that only leadership can be trusted with?  I don't think an ineffective process that leads to terrible outcomes has to be "sinister" to persist.  At the same time, we as regular, unprivileged primary voters should be able to recognize the efforts to keep this process as dysfunctional and corrupted by campaign financing as possible aren't in the best interests of voters no matter what party or leadership says.  It's just common sense, isn't it?  So instead of recognizing Bernie's outsider status (he had caucused with Democrats practically his entire time in Congress) and how he wasn't a part of the campaign-finance leadership, we could be recognizing that Democrat leadership's cupboard was so bare of established and well-known leaders after the Clintons that this outsider had favored polling status among the general electorate.  The reason he had a shot was because Democrats had maintained a reputation for failure and an inability to hold corrupt executives accountable for at least two decades.	1643000464.0	htzdhan	t3_sb0qgj	t1_htz6md1	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb0qgj/wooderson/htzdhan/

3mmq6	> Okay, I'm done. Fine, Pete and Amy made Bernie lose, and therefore Biden's 51.8% primary victory was unfair, that's fine  As long as you can acknowledge the truth in hindsight, we don't have to bicker about what's happening in real-time during the next primary.  And then perhaps we can select the one which actually delivers consensus instead of the campaign financing which leadership is beholden to.  So long as you continue carrying water for a cadre of failed leaders with a reputation for overlooking corruption and an inability to hold corrupt executives accountable, Democrats are not going to look much better than Republicans.  And that's startlingly pathetic considering how bad Republican leaders actually are.	1643002430.0	htzgzxk	t3_sb0qgj	t1_htz690l	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb0qgj/wooderson/htzgzxk/

But he is not the best candidate.  Never will be.  He caved when it got tough. He's the reason why we have the vaccines in the first place.  He could've continued pushing what he was which was hydroxychloroquine, z-pak, and azithromycin.    He also banned bump stocks of which I was disappointed in but that's not relevant to this discussion.  Some of you say he was ruthless.  I say he wasn't ruthless enough.

You only have a 1-5% chance of being hospitalized per CDC and less than 2% chance of dying from Covid per CDC.    The odds of getting hospitalized and dying are so small already.   So without the vaccine you have a 98.2% chance of living per CDC.  If you get vaccinated let say you get like 1% bump in protection against death so now 99% vs 98.2%. We know Vaccinated people have died so it’s not 100%.   Maybe it gives you 2-3% against hospitalization.   That’s pretty much it.   Vaccinated and boosted people still spread it. We are the most vaccinated we’ve ever been but cases are the highest.  The people really affected by Covid were the obese (3x more likely to end up in hospital) and the elderly.  Time to move on, we have a lot of shit to do and trying to force people to stay in despair over this is getting in the way of the work we need to do.	1643032433.0	hu0oa8f	t3_sb994x	t1_hu032n4	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb994x/_/hu0oa8f/

8c1dykp5	Idk if this is a Dem subreddit or not but I am a leftist, far from the center right where Biden is. Let me give my perspective.   I think Hunter Biden is a criminal too. Why do we let this slide by us: Hunter Biden had no experience whatsoever in Eastern European affairs or in the energy sector, and after VP Biden went to one of the most corrupt countries in the entire world (Ukraine, while claiming to be on an anti-corruption mission) his son ends up with a job in the Ukrainian energy sector, bringing home millions?  Everytime I bring this up to Dems, they brush it off as just a fluke or something (leftists I know think he's a criminal, especially non-Americans). The media went on about Trump who is undoubtedly a criminal, but barely covered the Hunter Biden story, and when they did they called it a conspiracy theory.   Well I wanna know how someone with no experience in Ukraine or energy made hundreds of thousands in a no-show position on an energy company. I wanna know why someone who never painted professionally is able to auction paintings of for thousands.  Do I want Trump and his kids tried for crimes? Absolutely. But I don't want us to pretend it's just Trump. There is some SERIOUS dirty laundry that needs to be aired out on the Democratic side.
