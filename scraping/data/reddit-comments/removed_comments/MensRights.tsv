7au0gnf3	Seriously? Do the moderators even look at the subs when they mindlessly ban people from other subs just for existing on them? It‚Äôs so easy to tell that none of the popular posts (or ones that stay up for longer than a few seconds) aren‚Äôt incel beliefs. It‚Äôs literally just acknowledging that men have problems.

cx05s	I am sorry that is literal the dumbest thing I have ever heard, but that‚Äôs your perspective.  Here is my perspective.  My dad, me, my eldest son and my grandson.  All cut. All no issue.  My second son. Uncut until he needed emergency surgery to free up everything down there.  It‚Äôs a tiny issue.  Ill continue recommending it to any new father, just because of the risk that it poses and the issues i know it has caused.  I am sorry your penis broke or is shorter.  Sue the doctor.  My dick is fine.  And I see no harm or foul in performing hygienic surgery.	1640967982.0	hqp32xg	t3_rrwamo	t1_hqnot3e	/r/MensRights/comments/rrwamo/argument_of_male_circumcision/hqp32xg/

drm9t323	Well you see, women are gonna get a *nasty* surprise when the local men are no longer willing to defend them from disaster and outside forces.

drm9t323	Okay, so heres the thing.  Shopping for clothes isnt real work.   Doing makeup isnt real work.   Spending 2 hours cooking when you can do it in just 1 is an extra hour of work thats not real work.   Spending a billion years picking out *just the right* items for the child/house isnt real work.  Stop acting like womens lives are so unfair when most of it is just women putting it onto themselves. Spending more *time* doing work means very little if someone else can achieve the same results using less. Which is what men generally do. So yeah. If you want an "equal amount" of work done, the solution is really easy. Its called not wasting your own damn time.	1642713090.0	htidu37	t3_s7shyj	t1_hti8rzk	/r/MensRights/comments/s7shyj/why_women_being_more_college_educated_than_men_is/htidu37/

drm9t323	It actually is that simple in this case. This is a zero sum game. You either care about a womans and/or mans right to choose, or a childs right to live. If you choose the first, the child loses its right to live. If you choose the second, the parents lose the right to choose.   By stating your belief that women (but not men) have the right to choose, you are implying that you do not believe in a childs right to live.	1642723640.0	htj2xqx	t3_s804hf	t1_htim9oa	/r/MensRights/comments/s804hf/this_person_doesnt_acknowledge_that_it_could_be/htj2xqx/
