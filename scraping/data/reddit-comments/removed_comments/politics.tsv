i0j4n	>Biden has the 2nd lowest approval rating of any president except Trump.  Except Truman, Nixon, Carter, Obama, GW Bush, Ford.    Nixon had 34.4.  That's certainly lower than 42.    Or are you just parroting disinformation you heard but didn't want to verify yourself?  Where's your data for "Biden has the 2nd lowest approval rating of any president except Trump."?  Is it the CNN article from yesterday, no, that doesn't support your claim.  The Hill?  Still no.  Gallup News?  Still no but close as they only went back to WW2.   NBCNews, no.  You know who does make that claim that you're making?:  A Facebook post.  A Facebook post that was flagged as misinformation.	1642706094.0	hthw2mx	t3_s8n4ot	t1_hthpnjo	/r/politics/comments/s8n4ot/one_year_into_his_presidency_bidens/hthw2mx/

What I don’t understand is how you can ignore the fact that the FBI, one of your supposed most trusted institutions, was clearly caught on camera in-sighting a riot and lying about it to congress.  But sure, focus on the quote “secret meetings”. If you cant understand that politicians all over the world partake in meetings “off the record” there is no hope for you.	1642706286.0	hthwksz	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hthu10i	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/hthwksz/

I know I don't have to list all the underhanded means they go about accomplishing this but to get back to our original point, blaming Nader for his Florida votes plays right into their strategy when it was really Republican corruption and the Democrats resistance to a truly progressive platform. It's not just Manchin and Sinema, they're only the latest excuses.	1642706338.0	hthwpre	t3_s8o7tp	t1_hthv529	/r/politics/comments/s8o7tp/ralph_nader_bidens_first_year_proves_he_is_still/hthwpre/

You can’t “call me out on my bs” when I was asking about an article about a press conference that really happened.

What policies that they've passed aren't in line with neoliberalism?  Rather than attacking the source, attack the argument.  > Also, just because someone "deregulates" one thing, that doesn't make them a champion of deregulation, which is why the entire assertion that they are neoliberals is flat out bogus.  Obama was literally writing opeds for the Wall Street Journal explaining the need for deregulation.  It's hard to champion it more than that without passing executive orders and signing bills from congress in that direction (whcih he also did both of, this op ed is explaining one of his executive orders focused on deregulation).  https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703396604576088272112103698  > I understand what a "New Democrat" is, I didn't put it in "scare quotes", I put it in "quotes" for emphasis. They are not neoliberals, which is something you obviously don't understand.  General political theory thought processes disagree with you.  The New Democrats fall clearly under the banner of post classical liberalism, aligning closer to Ordoliberalism than even Blair's New Labour.  The New Democrat's domination of the party for the past 30 years is literally the reason why we refer to democrats as "liberals", referring to the neoliberal roots.

a6haum2u	I don't know, is that where you're from???  https://www.kenoshanews.com/news/local/wisconsin-high-schoolers-could-take-gun-class-under-gop-bill/article_c0ae33e6-166f-5c46-8657-beff6613c184.html    Try Wisconsin for current states for one.   Michigan and Missouri are a couple of others.  It was quite common back in the day.  MAYBE the kids back then weren't such dumbasses and could be trusted with having the common sense necessary to handle a firearm.  It was quite common to see a pick-up truck (or 10) parked on school grounds with a rifle in clear view in a gun rack in the back window.	1642724654.0	htj5ceu	t3_s8t0vy	t1_htj019c	/r/politics/comments/s8t0vy/wisconsin_republicans_vote_to_lower_age_to_carry/htj5ceu/

n1h9i	I hate this woman. She is an unrepentant piece of dog shit.   Jihadi Squad isn’t a fucking joke. That’s you being racist as fuck.   People are riding you for doing reconnaissance because within a week of you taking people on a guided tour, they broke in and fucked things up.    Seriously, these are not passive faux pas.  Boebert has done enough that she should lose her job. If I did a quarter of what she did, I’d be looking for a new job.   immediately.   Maybe if she actually did her job, she wouldn’t have time to be such a piece of garbage	1642727001.0	htjauak	t3_s8qq0w	t3_s8qq0w	/r/politics/comments/s8qq0w/rep_lauren_boebert_asked_a_group_of_jewish/htjauak/
