The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	1640885038.0	hqkhg5m	t3_rs5nro	t1_hqkdlqj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqkhg5m/

hj6penur	I've been reading it too and it's amazing! Especially that you can find out many celebrities and people in your life who use those laws.   One of my favourite laws is conceal your intentions and I think you can apply it to FDS. It's better to not be open and direct about your FDS ideology and feminist beliefs. Sharing them and showing off how you don't need any men can be dangerous. People don't like being called out on their misogyny and LVM and pickmes will try to show you "your place".	1640890356.0	hqkvipm	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqjkosb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqkvipm/

fmxwzjyb	Wow you definitely did the right thing. Any man who can't understand a lone woman locking their door in this situation isn't living fully in reality. His immediate aggression is an obvious sign he was up to no good. I've been the man in situations like that and my immediate response was to communicate the situation without aggression if it was important enough and to make sure i was being as nonthreatening as possible. Cuz I'm 200+ pounds and bearded i already look crazy üòÜ in any case just to add to the tip about the window. Don't roll it down even a crack. Once closed it creates a sort of seal that strengthens the integrity of the glass.

hys5kov9	I‚Äôm new to Reddit. I was seeking out feminist subreddits and saw FDS being bashed as being extremist, so of course, being curious, I had to see for myself. Far from seeing hate-filled discourse, I was pleasantly surprised to find like-minded women, taking back their power and creating a space for themselves in an oppressive and misogynistic online world.   I‚Äôm not dating, so at first I questioned whether I should even be here but I‚Äôm so encouraged to see women here knowing and respecting their worth, it has ignited a small flame in my heart. In the short time I‚Äôve been participating in this group, I‚Äôve learned concepts and language for things that I haven‚Äôt been able to articulate in my entire 57 years of life.   Someone on here recommended the book ‚ÄúHow He Gets into Her Head‚Äù. I grew up in the context of a family where DV occurred. I questioned why my mother stayed and settled upon lack of financial resources and social supports (it was the 70‚Äôs) as being the reasons. I never really understood what psychological processes might be going on. I‚Äôm 4 chapters into the book and light bulbs have been going off over my head like crazy.   I learned term ‚Äúp0rn sick‚Äù here in FDS. I‚Äôll be forever grateful for learning a term and defining a concept for something I‚Äôve been grappling with ever since I was exposed to p0rn0graphy as a young child when my father‚Äôs Pl@yBoy  magazines were kept in stack in the bathroom. Even as a young child, I felt a sense of shame and devaluation that was something I couldn‚Äôt define in words.   I‚Äôve been learning other concepts here and re-examining my life choices in light of them. Probably not a lot I can change about some circumstances in my life at this point, but I can change my mindset. I can also pass on knowledge to my daughter and my female co-workers.   I‚Äôm grateful for FDS and the work the moderators do to keep this a protected space. üôè	1641158370.0	hqzgxmg	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqzgxmg/

cy48uble	I‚Äôm 23 and I recently dated a 28 year old man and then a 31 year old man for very brief periods of time. I realize that the age gaps are not extremely socially taboo, but it felt quite significant to me at the time and since they were the first ‚Äúolder‚Äù men I explored. Since cutting them off and finding FDS, I‚Äôve decided from now on I‚Äôm not going to date someone more than 3-4 years older than me, at least until I‚Äôm a little older myself. I don‚Äôt know why young women are taught ‚Äúolder automatically = better‚Äù when it comes to men when in reality I think it should be treated at the very least as an automatic drawback, if not a dealbreaker entirely. The types of men who date significantly younger women are not actually more mature, but instead using these kinds of relationships as an excuse to get way with being emotionally immature. It is burdensome and exhausting to be dating someone using you to feel ‚Äúyoung‚Äù, and that feeling is even more exacerbated if the younger woman feels some psychological need to prove that she‚Äôs ‚Äúmature‚Äù. When I dated these guys, I was fresh out fo college and felt like I was constantly struggling to establish myself as an adult in society for the first time, but meanwhile these older men seemed to give themselves permission to be childish just because they had a younger woman by their side. They never gave me any of the so-called mentorship and guidance that society told us that older men can allegedly give you, and honestly speaking were not that much more mature/intelligent/generous compared to the younger men I had dated (in fact, they were probably the dumbest ones). If you want real mentorship, just find older women you admire and seek them out, there is just no real need or automatic benefit to dating men older than you.	1641173765.0	hr0j7zw	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr0j7zw/

5u126usi	I dated this avoidant man on and off for 7 years. He would come back into my life, things would be amazing, then as soon as I started putting in the effort and showing my feelings he would pull away. Never ghost, but would get distant. Would take forever to reply, didn‚Äôt get me direct answers, and wouldn‚Äôt really commit to plans. I‚Äôm not am anxiously attached person, but this gave me soooo much anxiety.   After not seeing this man for 2 years, I run into him again this past summer and I truly thought he had matured. He texted back enthusiastically, initiated conversations, liked my social media posts, and even planned actual dates.   Then there suddenly was a shift, I tried to plan a weekend with him and he cancelled last minute because of work. Then every time after that, whenever I tried to make plans, he was very noncommittal. I asked if he was still interested, he said yes. But I was still so anxious.   Anyways, a few weeks ago, I realized enough is enough. I shouldn‚Äôt feel this confused or anxious about a man. This many negative feelings is not healthy in any relationship. So I point blank told him I noticed his actions weren‚Äôt matching his words, and that I was confused. He was quick to text back. I asked what his intentions were, and made mine clear. That after 7 years, if we‚Äôre going to see each other then we need to actually date and work towards a relationship. He told me he just wants to hang out when it‚Äôs convenient. So in the first time in 7 years, I told him we should stop seeing each other. Every other time, he got avoidant and left, only to come back into my life when he felt like it.   What I learned, is to be really direct and upfront right off the jump. If you clearly state that you are dating for a relationship, and not casual sex, then I‚Äôm sure an avaoidant man will leave then. However, when we don‚Äôt share our expectations it leads to disappointment and painful months of being breadcrumbed and strung along by avoidant men. Plus it just hurts way more in the end.	1641181781.0	hr120bz	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr120bz/

I am A Wife. And, not altogether incidentally, I am a mother.  Not too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife. He is obviously looking for another wife. As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife?  I would like to go back to school so that I can become economically independent, support myself, and, if need be, support those dependent upon me. I want a wife who will work and send me to school. And while I am going to school I want a wife to take care of my children. I want a wife to keep track of the children‚Äôs doctor and dentist appointments. And to keep track of mine, too. I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly and are kept clean. I want a wife who will wash the children‚Äôs clothes and keep them mended. I want a wife who is a good nurturant attendant to my children, who arranges for their schooling, makes sure that they have an adequate social life with their peers, takes them to the park, the zoo, etc. I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife‚Äôs income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that. Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.  I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean. A wife who will pick up after me. I want a wife who will keep my clothes clean, ironed, mended, replaced when need be, and who will see to it that my personal things are kept in their proper place so that I can find what I need the minute I need it. I want a wife who cooks the meals, a wife who is a good cook. I want a wife who will plan the menus, do the necessary grocery shopping, prepare the meals, serve them pleasantly, and then do the cleaning up while I do my studying. I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school. I want a wife to go along when our family takes a vacation so that someone can continue to care for me and my children when I need a rest and change of scene.  I want a wife who will not bother me with rambling complaints about a wife‚Äôs duties. But I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies. And I want a wife who will type my papers for me when I have written them.  I want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life. When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements. When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house clean, will prepare a special meal, serve it to me and my friends, and not interrupt when I talk about things that interest me and my friends. I want a wife who will have arranged that the children are fed and ready for bed before my guests arrive so that the children do not bother us.  And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself.  I want a wife who is sensitive to my sexual needs, a wife who makes love passionately and eagerly when I feel like it, a wife who makes sure that I am satisfied. And, of course, I want a wife who will not demand sexual attention when I am not in the mood for it. I want a wife who assumes the complete responsibility for birth control, because I do not want more children. I want a wife who will remain sexually faithful to me so that I do not have to clutter up my intellectual life with jealousies. And I want a wife who understands that my sexual needs may entail more than strict adherence to monogamy. I must, after all, be able to relate to people as fully as possible.  If, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; my wife will take the children and be solely responsible for them so that I am left free.  When I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife‚Äôs duties.  My God, who wouldn‚Äôt want a wife?	1642532102.0	ht7n3na	t3_s6wu1r	t1_ht7ktn3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6wu1r/we_dont_do_that_no_more/ht7n3na/

ij7utuuw	I agree with you. I‚Äôve read a lot of the literature on abuse, studied psychology and have done a lot of therapy. The choice of hot sauce was motivated by his desire to cause her harm. There is no other explanation. No one deserves to be caused harm deliberately, regardless of the circumstances. I would also argue the hot sauce was chosen to humiliate her, or ‚Äúteach her a lesson.‚Äù Baby trapping is horrible, but even if she had succeeded, Drake wouldn‚Äôt have suffered physically for it. That‚Äôs a big difference. Also, condoms aren‚Äôt even 100% effective. So idk where Drake gets off on being Mr. Responsible. He obviously hates the women he has sex with, and overestimates his grandeur, importance and value as an individual human being.	1642540142.0	ht88xsf	t3_s6j7kx	t1_ht5oiqm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6j7kx/can_we_talk_about_drakes_hot_sauce_condom_incident/ht88xsf/

dfpjkuub	I was looking forward to subscribing soon, because I want to partecipate safely outside of Reddit, but this might change my mind. I don't want to interact with hateful scrotes even if it's to piss them off. It feels unsafe to have scrotes partecipating even if they pay, I'm sure many of them are rich enough to join and be threatening psychos. I just want a fucking female space with no men in it, especially hateful men. Disappointing development.

ipjpoetx	I think the idea (though not explicitly stated by the OP) is that liberal feminism often attempts to rebrand patriarchy/what men want from women as somehow empowering to women. Or just the idea that if an individual woman decides to do something, then that choice is automatically empowering because it‚Äôs her choice. Obviously sending your nudes is not empowering when you literally have zero control over what the recipients (men) do with them once they have them.	1642561245.0	ht9oee8	t3_s6ufge	t1_ht9mptb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6ufge/liberal_feminism_at_its_best/ht9oee8/
