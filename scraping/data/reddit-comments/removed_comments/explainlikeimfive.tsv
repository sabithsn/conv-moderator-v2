Though I have read about there being an odd lack of sneezing in performing artists.

isfx2dnk	Dissociation  Schizophrenia  Anxiety *hell*  HPPD  OCD  Paranoia  Brain zaps  Brainfog  Deja vus  Random delusions (yes, 2 months afterwards)  I mean, whatever. I had a full blown The Absolute enlightening experience on potent af *weed*. The emptiness and realization of non self was brutal and I wasn't ready at all. Left me dissociated and brainfogged for 8 years. Then did it again due to very intense love experiences in meditation and wanting an easier way to get into that state. Went full blown paranoia, brainfogged so hard I thought I was having a brain stroke, called an ambulance and left me so fucking hard dissociated afterwards to the point that I said to myself ''if it's going to be like this for the rest of my life, I won't be able to deal with this' '  The second time have me A LOT of compassion for those who suffer serious mental illnesses.  I'm still dissociated and brainfogged and it will never go away but the intensity has gone down at least. I still have moments it's really really fucking strong to the point I can't tell wtf is happening but I learned to shrug it off and just vibe with it.  But trust me, in the end, it was not worth it. I didn't get to experience the oneness and incomprehensible love I experienced in meditation once, instead, I had to go through all stages of grief in the span of 1 hour thinking I had severe brain damage.

97xacnpp	I don't think there are any serious ideas on this, only sound bites and talking points, but when you start to work though what it would look like, it fails, for the reasons you state, as well as others. Additionally, though you say it would be 'one time', once the gov taps a new source of money, it's never one time... BUT, even if it was on time, and you took all of it from the 1%, their complete total net worth, neverminding that it would actually crash markets, what would that value be, and how long would it fund the gov? Look at the total annual US budget, and if you took everything, how many days would that pay for? Not many...

6i3j4isk	LOL. Thanks so much for your concern! I only took out $42k and have been overpaying since my payments started, and also continued paying through the pandemic moratorium when I didn't have to. My loans will be paid off in another 3 years and given that I'm in my 40s, no, I won't die with them unpaid. I am not on IBR (don't need it) but I want the option to have it if something happened with my job, and I also want the security in place of having whatever I have left on the loans discharged if I die, so my assets don't have to go to paying off that debt.

z64m7	Much like Christianity, it depends on what group you are talking about.  The Satanic Temple has 7 fundamental tenets.  1. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason. 2. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions. 3. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone. 4. The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own. 5. Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs. 6. People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused. 7. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.	1642803832.0	htnsm41	t3_s9mko8	t3_s9mko8	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9mko8/eli5_what_are_the_basic_beliefs_of_satanism/htnsm41/

ijuh5u70	Why run BLASTp and not BLAST?  Unrelated proteins have a chance of sharing certain sequences of amino acids. Imagine two enzymes, from a plant and an animal, converting substance A into substance B. The enzymes might be more or less similar but I'm willing to bet that the maximal similarity will be at the catalytic site where the enzyme must hold A in the right position for the reaction to happen.   DNA sequences are better suited to distinguish differences among closely related species or individuals.  I wonder if the researcher ran BLASTp and not BLAST because there's less similarity at DNA level...	1642808673.0	hto564j	t3_s9nzv3	t3_s9nzv3	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9nzv3/eli5_how_did_a_unique_moderna_genomic_sequence/hto564j/

i8lmj	Different chemicals all have a unique shape. In the US, the main chemical in weed that gets you high (delta-9 THC) is illegal. Delta-8 THC has a *slightly* different shape, so it affects your brain very similarly as delta-9 THC. However, because the shape is different, it's not the same, and wasn't made illegal. In fact, there a specific law that explicitly says it *is* federally legal, as long as it comes from hemp.  Since hemp plants make very little of it on their own, people take other similar chemicals and change it into delta-8 THC. Chemistry is usually easiest when your starting chemicals are pure, those are taken out of the plants and purified into an oil. After the chemistry is done, you also get a pure oil. This is what goes into the delta-8 products you see available.*  As far as medicinal properties, to my knowledge they are the same as regular delta-9 THC.  *It's also why you shouldn't ever buy delta-8 flower. It's not real, it's just delta-8 oil sprayed onto it. Just vape it instead.	1642812701.0	htof30j	t3_s9p1pn	t3_s9p1pn	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9p1pn/eli5_please_explain_what_delta_8_canna_honey_is_i/htof30j/

b8xeo	Here's another theory. The $ sign is a pole with a snake on it. Numbers 21. The Israelites were whining because the manna the Lord sent them didn't taste like bread right out of the oven. So the Lord sent poisonous "fiery serpents" to strike them down. Then he sent a cure, by having Moses create a serpent and hang it up on a pole. Many Christians suppose the serpent is a symbol of the devil, but here it's a symbol of Christ on the cross. In Nephi's commentary he explains that the Israelite tribes, or "nations" as he calls them, had only to look at it to be healed. It was the power of God that healed them; looking at the serpent was a filter to weed out people who were stubborn and wouldn't look. Anyway, the American founding fathers made this symbol in the hope that the new American money would heal the economy. It was a good thing. American money has boosted the economy of every nation on earth.	1642823122.0	htp3ozp	t3_s9cdm9	t3_s9cdm9	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9cdm9/eli5_why_is_there_a_cross_sign_in_most_of_the/htp3ozp/

8mv174bl	I think in general, the ability for salt (NaCl, ie, sodium chloride) to reduce bitterness of foods, and thus enhance flavor components like sweetness, savory, etc. is why it’s so great -   and I think this is largely attributed to the Sodium ions within the salt, interacting with, or diluting, the more bitter and alkaline compounds within the food. this then reduces that bitter taste and seemingly enhances sweetness, and other flavors.	1642873187.0	htrml1q	t3_sa7g02	t3_sa7g02	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sa7g02/eli5_why_is_salt_so_important_for_flavor/htrml1q/

And the way you copied and pasted it as if it speaks for itself is kind of douchey.  Go read the actual study and see that lobsters scored the highest rating in the ability to feel pain. Page 42, Table 3, Criterion 4. Very high confidence that Lobsters meet Criterion 4.  Page 49 explains Criterion 4 as "*The animal possesses an endogenous neurotransmitter system that modulates* ***(in a way consistent with the experience of pain,*** *distress or harm) its responses to threatened or actual noxious stimuli;*"  Page 12 describes noxious stimuli as "*extreme heat, extreme acidity or alkalinity,*   *toxins, or breaks to the skin)"*  You got shrekt.

One other anti-anxiety that's not an antidepressant and not a benzodiazepine is buspirone. I don't think it hits like a benzodiazepine but that's probably why it's not so fast to form dependence.	1642902258.0	httm76w	t3_sahkl1	t3_sahkl1	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sahkl1/eli5_why_does_it_feel_off_when_something_thats/httm76w/

8hw4n	No, it is worse. It is purpose-built so it is practically impossible to “comparison shop,” or even find out what providers pay for things. Hospitals purchase their supplies through purchasing associations, who  1. Add another layer of profit on top of already bloated prices  2. Can conceal actual costs as “trade secrets.”  So when the hospital charges you $8 for a single Tylenol, there’s no way to know if the hospital paid  $.01 or $7.99. The lack of transparency prevents the existence of a competitive market and keeps prices high. Keeping in mind, in many situations in health care the consumer does not have the luxury of researching the most cost-effective treatment options, following a car wreck or heart attack.	1642908277.0	httzxiu	t3_saftzs	t1_httnmy2	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/saftzs/eli5_united_states_why_are_drug_retail_prices/httzxiu/

7jrdfj30	Well actually Germans are extremely aware of their own history and have very open education and discourse on it, and having lived there during the Trump years, when a lot of the national political dialogue was about the rising fascist and now Nazi parties in and outside Germany - I would say that is a pretty valuable conversation to be a part of. I also marched in an anti fascist protest in Berlin.  Also I am in the field of education, so I know how they teach their own political history to new generation, which is very openly critical about fascism.	1642909105.0	htu1rmk	t3_sajuw6	t1_htu1cr9	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htu1rmk/

85d20rn5	I don't know the scientifics behind it, but as someone who takes adderall for my adhd I can explain how it helps.  It's not that doesn't make you more hyperactive, it does, but it allows you to focus that hyperproductivity to one task as opposed to multiple.   It's hard to explain but normally I can't sit at my computer and do schoolwork for no more than 5 minutes maybe before I get distracted by something else, sometimes miniscule shit but still a distraction. And when I take the aderall those distractions tend to happen less frequently and I can sit down and focus my energy to one thing for potentially an hour depending on the day.   You still have the energy but the stimulants help you to focus it on one productive avenue as opposed to multiple like my brain normally does.   I.e. I used to have about 100 projects on the go in my garage, I would start building or cleaning something, and then get distracted away from it and it just sits there for months lol. Once I started taking stimulants now I can actually maintain focus on the project and find it easier to come back to it, almost like it's addicting to be doing what I'm doing, which normally wouldn't be the case.	1642909691.0	htu34sm	t3_sak7ci	t3_sak7ci	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sak7ci/eli5_why_are_people_with_adhd_often_prescribed/htu34sm/

Also, i've hear from numerous sources that ever since the Nazi's waged genocide, Germany really does go out of its way to focus a lot of school time to learning about the rise of racism, how it works, how it happened, how to never let it happen again.  It is actually true that the average German is an expert on facism; being from Germany does mean that you know more about facism that the average person and certainly than probably the vast majority of Americans no matter how up to speed they are on Republican/Fox news talking points about how to claim you are not facist.	1642910058.0	htu415q	t3_sajuw6	t1_htu1rmk	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htu415q/

ex4ca	This is the exact opposite of the truth. I'm always surprised that people can be so poorly educated, yet here we stand.  Here's a good explanation of the basic tenets, origins, and examples of socialism from encyclopedia Britannica: https://www.britannica.com/topic/socialism  Hitler's Nazi party, after the Night of The Long Knives (where Rohm and many potential adversaries were murdered) never espoused any sort of ideology or practices that could be remotely described as socialist. I think you'll agree after reading a bit about what socialism is, and perhaps a bit more about Nazi leadership.  Not only was it callous and murderous, but it promoted private business ownership and created massive wealth for many people. So the antithesis of socialism.  Anyway, off to do your homework.

4adwc	Monopolies are illegal since they are bad for humanities.  An exception for a time is made to this since in the form of patents since that can also be bad as the investor can cost recover although market lead should enable this anyway.  So patents run contrary to the idea of capitalist competition and the overarching illegality of monopolies beyond Government based coercive monopolies (eg Utilities where all the population must be supplied even at subsidy and not just the highly profitable niches)  The thing that is often forgotten that operating a business is not a right. It's a boon in exchance for taxes and FULL complicance with the laws of the entity granting the boon. Even the legal personhood of companies is just another boon. A pretence of personhood in order to serve a limited purpose (ownership, able to be sued, etc.)  If not for the corruptness of many people in Government lots of these companies would not only have their artifical monopoly exemption removed but they would be de-registered and loose their artifical deeming of personhood.	1642915929.0	htugnke	t3_saftzs	t1_httvr5d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/saftzs/eli5_united_states_why_are_drug_retail_prices/htugnke/

f8pmm	>Hitler was big government. In modern terms that makes him left wing.    Banning abortion = regulation = big government = left-wing.  Border control = government employees = big government = left-wing.  Banning "critical race theory" = censorship = big government = left-wing.  Regulating gender transition = regulating what you can put in your body = big government = left-wing.  Single-family zoning = regulating what you can build on your own property = big government = left-wing.  I could keep going, but I believe I've made my point, namely that if you honestly believe that *government doing things = left-wing*, then you're to the right of literally every single politician to have ever held office for any reason, other than to destroy the very office they hold (e.g. Scott Pruitt and Betsy DeVos).

exw5d	Fascists changed their ideological labels rapidly early on in order to attract as many people as possible, but in practice they did most of their *successful* recruiting from the right (more specifically, from disaffected conservatives who believed that the mainstream conservatives of their day were too weak and tepid), which is why they ultimately embraced framing themselves as the furthest-right option.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_and_ideology):  > Mussolini took these electoral gains as an indication that his right-wing strategy paid off, and decided that the Fascists would sit on the extreme right side of the amphitheatre where parliament met. He also used his first speech in parliament to take a "reactionary" stance, arguing against collectivization and nationalization, and calling for the post office and the railways to be given to private enterprise.  > Prior to Fascism's accommodation of the political right, Fascism was a small, urban, northern Italian movement that had about a thousand members. After Fascism's accommodation of the political right, the Fascist movement's membership soared to approximately 250,000 by 1921.	1642917468.0	htujfwp	t3_sajuw6	t1_htugyvp	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htujfwp/

12kpyp	The scary thing is I think that a lot of the early Fascists were actually sincere - they did believe what the espoused, and were working for "the people". It's just that they were working for THEIR people (Germans, Italians, what have you), and most of "the people" were more than happy to go along with that because they benefitted, at the expense of "the other people" (Jews, Gypsies and Jehovah's Witnesses to name an alliterative few).  I think modern "Fascism" is more duplicitous, and serves a select few by utilising popularism in the way you outline. Which is also terrifying...

c69b46mb	'The entirety of National socialism was based on Marx' -Hitler.  No, you read a lie that validated your defence of Karl Marx, a man who called people "Jewish N*****" and called for "The emancipation of society from Judaism" via "Despotic inroads" and "the Guillotine".  If you're comfortable defending Marx knowing this, and you're comfortable rationalising that an ideology that calls for the extermination of the Jews is fundamentally different to an ideology of the same name that also calls for the extermination of the Jews, then sleep well at night.  But if you have even a shadow of a doubt that you might be on the side of an evil ideology, then I beg you to research this	1642919723.0	htuncy7	t3_sajuw6	t1_htumr5i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuncy7/

A few regrettable statements doesn't automatically invalidate everything proposed by one of humankind's most influential economists and philosophers. Nothing about Marx's economic theory requires racial bigotry, trying to tie the two together to invalidate the former is textbook ad hominem and wouldn't be allowed in intellectual debate.   Let me put it this way, if you're comfortable defending the US Constitution knowing that most of the people who wrote it owned and sexually exploited slaves, you're rationalizing and condoning a moral worldview that endorses owning people as property based on race and the sexual exploitation and rape of said property.

13ca87	Modern right wing politics involved us in an endless war on terror, spending trillions of dollars. Modern right wing politics attempts to infringe upon a woman's right to get an abortion. Modern right wing politics started the drug war, which is almost certainly by your definition "big government." Modern right wing politics is the reason you can't buy an automatic weapon. Reagan signed that bill. Modern right wing politics tried to stop the legalization of gay marriage, and actively attempts to stop gay people from adopting children. Modern right wing politics is currently attempting to implement barriers to voting, so they can lower voter participation. Modern right wing politics doesn't give a shit about individual liberty, they only care about corporations and whipping their religious fanatical base into a frenzy, usually on the basis of bigotry.  Alright so now onto your points. I said preserving, not conserving. He was ultra nationalist, saying Germany was the greatest country on earth, invested heavily into military spending and militarization, and idolized the past image of the German people. The term "3rd Reich" is based on inhereting the right to rule from the HRE (1st Reich) and The German Empire (2nd Reich.) He absolutely was hell bent on conserving German culture and heritage. That was like his entire schtick. His hatred of the Jews was based on the fact that he believed the Jews were controlling too much of German society when it should be pure blooded Germans who should run society.	1642920697.0	htuovwx	t3_sajuw6	t1_htui6is	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuovwx/

y93q6	Dude has no idea what he's talking about. Russia hasn't been communist in name in decades and even longer in practice. It's a kleptocratic oligarchy where the rich and powerful siphon off billions in public wealth and let the peasants wallow in poverty and decaying infrastructure.   It's the exact situation that on paper Communism seeks to avoid, but Russian society is built on corruption and authoritarian governance and that shit is stronger than philosophical ideals.    But to answer your question, socialism is a vague term used to describe governments with heavy social safety nets, worker protections, and state owned public corporations. To give an example, a socialist economy may have one government controlled oil company, like Venezuela or Norway, whose profits are used to pay for government services instead of a bunch of private for profit oil companies that make a few people very rich. Communism is the extremist far left form of economic organization where private ownership of capital and the means of production are completely banned and the state owns it all. There's no private oil companies, or any companies, allowed. There's no rich people, but there's also no "poor" people. Everyone is allocated the same amount and quality of stuff, and nobody is left wanting for anything, at least on paper.   In practice, the societies that have experienced extreme enough situations to swing that far towards communism have waaaaay too much baggage to actually pull it off and it ends up drowning in corruption and authoritarian government abuse. Not that those are traits/outcomes exclusive to communism, there's plenty of free market capitalist countries that end up with the exact same kind of guy in charge thanks to said societal baggage.	1642921145.0	htupk9s	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuo3l9	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htupk9s/

Of course, in periods when the political state as such is born violently out of civil society, when political liberation is the form in which men strive to achieve their liberation, the state can and must go as far as the abolition of religion, the destruction of religion. But it can do so only in the same way that it proceeds to the abolition of private property, to the maximum, to confiscation, to progressive taxation, just as it goes as far as the abolition of life, the guillotine.	1642921848.0	htuqlrk	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuqjjr	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuqlrk/

xjsd4	Yes. The Russian revolution, the Soviet Union, Stalin, eastern European socialism… all that was a massive propaganda campaign running decades long to smear socialism.  Tbf, there has been propaganda for sure, but it hasn’t been 1 way only. An entire generation of intellectuals in the interwar period as well as right after ww2, were socialists. People like Oppenheimer, for instance. How could they not be? They witnessed the great Depression, and they hoped to build a better world.   It was the reality of socialist life in the Soviet Union, and many years later the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that changed their minds. Socialism became a dirty word.   Sure enough, we are in an era similar to the 1920s, with great income disparity, injustice, upheaval. So it’s not surprising that socialism is fashionable again. “We’ve never tried it,” right?	1642922608.0	hturp7j	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuk601	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/hturp7j/

It works damn well too, hence why so many are opposed to socialist ideals. That being said, any one political ideology is shit on its own, including socialism. I believe the only way for a country to be a good nation is to draw ideas from different political ideologies and implement them together. Way harder said than done, but Germany today is a good example of a country that does it. It can work, and to say "socialism ruined my country" is just wrong.

dcb7w58x	I mean, in pure Marxist-Leninist terms, it absolutely was socialist as the means of production were owned collectively through state. The fact that it turned into what some refer to as “state capitalism” is inevitable when the ideology calls for a massive government that owns everything and expects the government to magically wither away as everyone is a pure soul and wishes nothing but communism and equality for all. People aren’t pure and if you give them power they tend to hold onto it	1642925035.0	htuv0ur	t3_sajuw6	t1_htut9st	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuv0ur/

j02r9	That's a narrow definition of "superior". A system can be better for the people but not be implemented for any number of reasons, including outside interference.  For example, I work IT for small businesses. Some of those businesses use bad practices like using RDP to access their server. A better (read: superior) system would be for them to use a remote viewer, like TeamViewer, but they still use RDP.  It's not that using TeamViewer is the "worse" option, it's that people choose to use the worse option for one reason or another—maybe they don't understand why RDP is bad, or in a few specific cases there's some "friend of a friend" who "totally knows computers" convincing them to continue the bad practice.  The point of this extended analogy being: you're basically asking people why they don't make perfectly correct decisions all the time. I guess the answer is, have you *met* people?	1642925076.0	htuv2s3	t3_sajuw6	t1_htutncl	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuv2s3/

ed2u2	The Nazis also provide interest free loans, rent supplements, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, old age security. They had programs for alcoholics to get clean, focused on rehabilitations of criminals and provided benefits for ex-cons who completed their sentence, so they could become productive members of society. They funded holidays for all workers. They were implementing a universal healthcare system.  Kind of sad when the fucking Nazis could do that shit 80 years ago.

544tkzob	Well I guess I’d say I take issue with the claim that no one is arguing for the US to veer that hard into socialism. Politically speaking yes, I think very few people are advocating any more than a more Nordic model like system. But in terms of political discourse, especially on sites like Reddit, a lot of people absolutely are.  The sub which takes its name from late stage capitalism is openly communist and they regularly joke about slaughtering anyone they consider to be bourgeoise. The antiwork sub hits the front page all of the time and they push people to take actions in real life that could actually cause a lot of problems as some sort of stand against capitalism.  It’s honestly kind of a problem. I’m all for more social programs, but reasoned and nuanced debate on those topics rapidly gets drowned out by tankies looking to farm karma, and I think that does real damage to efforts to actually get some of these social programs enacted.  Go to any politics thread and most of the comments will be about how Biden is actually a Reagan style conservative and Bernie is barely center left, and people should give up on voting for democrats because they just Aw corrupt as republicans. All of those people are openly lobbying against the possibility of improving the USs social infrastructure because it doesn’t fit whatever weird revolutionary fantasy they have in their head.	1642926521.0	htux0j1	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuwci7	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htux0j1/

xqvxu	This is a lot of great information and I appreciate it. I'm trying to find out why the retail prices are listed so high. And widely varying retail listings. And not just why, but why do people quote the retail price when literally no one pays that retail price.  Can Sony just say "PS5 retail is $10k but you can buy it right now for only $700!"
