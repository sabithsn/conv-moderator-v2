cmht5eup	Cyan/Magneta/Yellow is the set of subtractive primary colors (suitable for inks and paints).  Red/Blue/Green is the set of additive primary colors (suitable for lighting or illuminated displays like computer screens).  &#x200B;  Blue/red/yellow is not a set of primary colors. This is used as a simplified version of cyan/magneta/yellow for teaching school children, because it's close enough for school painting class, and it saves having to teach what "cyan" and "magenta" are.	1642706665.0	hthxld0	t3_s8imhu	t1_htge3un	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8imhu/eli5_can_a_pure_blue_be_created_using_cmyk/hthxld0/
cmht5eup	In very basic theory, CMYK should be able to produce a pure blue by mixing cyan and magneta. The basic theory states that there are 3 primary colors of light detected by the eye - red, green and blue. Cyan reflects green and blue. Magenta reflects red and blue. Mixing cyan and magenta should therefore reflect only blue.  The problem is that things in real life are not so simple. For a start, the eye's color sensors (the cones) have overlapping sensitivities, which means that the simple theory of primary colors (red, green and blue additive, or CMY subtractive) together doesn't work as accurately as you might think.   The other issue is generating wavelengths of light that try to activate just one type of the eye's cones. This is reasonably practical with colored LEDs, for example you can get deep blue LEDs which produce a small range of wavelengths in the deep blue region, which has very little effect on the eye's green and red cones, giving a very deep and pure blue sensation.  But while we can do this with LEDs, it is more of a problem with inks. Practical cyan inks, for example, do not generally reflect deep blue (indigo) wavelengths - but mainly reflect the "royal blue", cyan and green wavelengths.   This means that if you actually did the cyan/magneta mix, you would find that because the cyan blocks the deep blue wavelengths, what you get would actually be less saturated and slightly greener than the expected pure blue.	1642707932.0	hti0zxh	t3_s8imhu	t3_s8imhu	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8imhu/eli5_can_a_pure_blue_be_created_using_cmyk/hti0zxh/

gb4h3	They're talking about getting into a 6 point harness. I encourage you to try getting strapped in while wearing a HANS device, helmet, and fireproof gloves. You physically can't see or feel (because of the gloves) what you're doing, so you're probably going to mess up the order of straps on the camlock and lose your submarine strap under the seat if you try. Nor can you get enough leverage to tighten the shoulder straps all the way. Never mind if you're racing an open cockpit and therefore have to have arm restraints. In every level of racing I've done beyond autocross you have a buddy strap you in.

vhxas	Portfolio margin (borrowing against your stocks) is not like a mortgage -- you don't have a schedule or deadline to pay it back. It's more like credit card debt except the interest is way way way lower and the line of credit limit is really high and keeps going up. If you don't pay it off, the interest charge just gets added to what you owe. You don't have to repay it to borrow more. You just keep borrowing more.  You can lever up to 2x in most margin brokerage accounts. So that means you only need $500k in your brokerage margin account to own $1m in stocks. So you can withdraw the other $500k cash. (In practice though you don't want to be at the limit, because then you risk a margin call if the value of your stocks goes down.)  So lets say you have $10million in stocks, need $200k per year for living expenses, assume stock increases in value 10% per year and that the margin interest rate is 2%:  |after x years|portfolio value|total owed| |:-|:-|:-| |1|$11m|$204k| |2|$12.1m|$412k| |3|$13.31m|$624k| |4|$14.64m|$841k| |5|$16.11m|$1.06m| |6|$17.72m|$1.29m| |7|$19.49m|$1.52m| |8|$21.44m|$1.75m|  After 8 years, despite borrowing more and more, your net worth (what you have minus what you owe) has just about doubled. There's no reason to ever pay it back. Your wealth grows faster if you don't.	1642732429.0	htjncfg	t3_s8rnk6	t3_s8rnk6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8rnk6/eli5_how_do_the_rich_borrow_against_their_wealth/htjncfg/

wyemd	Ukraine, Georgia, and several other countries were part of the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia lost about half its GDP as newly independent states broke away. Putin has repeatedly called the collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest catastrophe in history.  Putin is seeking to rebuild the Soviet empire and has stoked nationalism at home by doing so. He's invaded parts of Georgia, Crimea, and put down Chechnya's rebels with violence. Those actions have hurt Russia economically, but to keep his iron grip on power, he needs to keep expanding Russia's borders to suppress discontent at home.  Ukraine is the most developed, most wealthy, and most industrialized of the former Soviet republics. In  2004, a popular uprising against Ukraine's corrupt and Putin-aligned government resulted in democratic elections in which the country aligned itself more with the west, signing free trade agreements with the EU. If Russia invades Ukraine, it gets the economic benefits of the spoils of war -- Ukraine's GDP would be siphoned off to Russia and democratic elections would be a thing of the past.  Because it knows this, Ukraine is rapidly building up its own defenses, so if Russia is to invade, it must do so soon. Time isn't on Russia's side because while Ukraine is relatively weak now, it's only getting stronger. Putin presumably believes the benefits of invading Ukraine are greater than the costs.	1642733412.0	htjpmo3	t3_s8zgyy	t3_s8zgyy	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8zgyy/eli5_why_does_russia_want_to_take_over_ukraine_so/htjpmo3/

ycvtv	We can't say for certain, because Renaissance Technologies keeps all of their methods very, very secret.  But he probably applied what comes down to advanced statistical methods to model the market as a semi-random system. I'll try and ELI5 it for you.  Imagine that you're waiting for an Uber. You ordered it from far away, so it's taking a while to get to you. How fast it's traveling at any point in time is not the same, since differences in traffic levels, traffic lights, speed limits, etc. affect the precise amount it travels every minute. But over 15 minutes, you notice that it moved 3.2 miles in the first 5 minutes, 2.7 miles in the second 5 minutes, and 3.1 miles in the third 5 minutes, so you conclude that it moves about 3 miles every 5 minutes. There's 4.5 miles left to get to you, so you estimate it will take roughly 7.5 minutes to get to you.  The longer you record data, the more accurate your prediction - and most critically, you can put a number on that accuracy. Say that you track that particular Uber over the course of three full days driving in identical conditions (yeah, I know, that doesn't happen, but let's pretend). You notice that the average speed is 3 miles in 5 minutes. 68% of the time, it goes between 2.7 and 3.3 miles, 95% of the time it goes between 2.4 and 3.6, and 99.7 percent of the time it goes between 2.1 and 3.9. So now you can predict how far the Uber will go in an hour, with a full range of possible speeds and likelihoods.  Let's go a little further and say that you're going to make a betting with your friends about the distance the car travels in an hour. You have developed this model, which means you have detailed predictions about the odds of various outcomes. You can now consider all of the bet offers that people give, and only accept the ones that you think you'll win. You won't be right every time, but if you did your work well, you'll be right more often than you'll be wrong, and you'll end up making money. Get a thousand friends in this betting pool, and you can make a lot of money. Get on the open stock market and you can make billions.  The actual models used are almost certainly more complex than average and standard deviation (which is what I described above), but the idea is the same: consider past performance, try to fit a mathematical model to allow you to make predictions, and then make the bets that you think you'll win.	1642746984.0	htkgilb	t3_s93a8f	t3_s93a8f	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s93a8f/eli5_what_mathematics_did_jim_simons_use_to_crack/htkgilb/

du4inlze	There are 20 balls in a basket. We bring 4 more baskets. Now we divide the 20 balls equally to each basket. So if dividing means asking how many balls each basket has, the answer is 4.

Then we ask the same question: how many balls each basket has, and the answer is 20.

3ajn7	If every man woman and child was given $50000 cash you still wouldn't reach the level of nation debt we're at now.   Current student debt is around $2 trillion. That could be paid off with current tax revenue rates in 4 years just by taking a bite out of *deficit* defense spending. The federal government budgets about $300 billion to cover military wages, benefits, housing, veterans affairs, etc AND defense maintenance and expansion, and yet every year the actual spend after adding handouts to giants like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman on extremely overpriced contracts for current and new fluff R&D projects is close to $1 trillion.  With the defense deficit spending money, we could end homelessness, revitalize education, have universal healthcare for all,  free education up through post-secondary, you name it.   But Republicans and Democrats alike in congress who are in it for the greased palms and stock options (i.e. money in politics) will never touch that money not effect real, positive social welfare reform.  So yeah that's why we "can't afford" to cancel student debt, like like we "can't afford" to clothe, feed, and shelter the homeless, and "can't afford" universal heathcare; congress flips back and forth between two parties of politicians who either have a vested interest in not fixing the budget, or are afraid to.	1642778473.0	htlvl03	t3_s9bqg4	t3_s9bqg4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9bqg4/eli5_how_would_we_cancel_student_loan_debt/htlvl03/

7djifol7	When light passes through a hole, the distance from the object being observed, the hole, and the surface that image is reflect upon are very important.  If the hole (aperture), is too big, it will let in too much light, and this reflects on the surface (the back of your eye / retina) as very fuzzy.  If the aperture is too small, it won't let in enough light, and this doesnt reflect enough on the back of your retina to discern any meaningful shape.  There is a range of aperture sizes that is useful to you. Since the distance from your eyes lens to your retina is largely the same, the primary drivers of your aperture size is distance from yourself and the object, and the amount of light available.  Your body provides feedback based on your senses; you consciously know if what you're looking at is sharply focused or fuzzy. You have control over this (try unfocusing your vision on your phone, zoning out, and everything gets blurry).  But your brain has a baseline of, "yeah, this is focused" and tends to apply that to objects you see day to day.	1642782745.0	htm6ubg	t3_s9c2vq	t3_s9c2vq	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9c2vq/eli5_how_come_our_sight_increase_and_decrease/htm6ubg/

gyahvs1j	Provided you set up your credit card to be fully paid off every month you won’t owe any interest on it.  One advantage of credit cards, particularly for online purchases, is that there are a lot more protections for you when you buy stuff - for example in a dispute over whether goods were delivered, or arrived as described and the seller won’t process a return you can request a “Chargeback” that the card issuer should handle provided they don’t think you’re committing fraud. With Debit Cards this option isn’t on the table.  Another is that they help build a credit rating **if used responsibly** that will be useful when buying things like cars or applying for a mortgage.   If you are concerned about spending getting out of hand or starting to clock up a debt that rolls over each month and accrues rather a lot of interest you can get a pre-paid credit card where you put the money on in advance but then it functions like a regular credit card for purposes of consumer protections and credit rating building.	1642786200.0	htmg9nb	t3_s9ftyv	t3_s9ftyv	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9ftyv/eli5_credit_cards_in_general/htmg9nb/

1276s7	ALMOST, and you're along the right path so kudos. Dry drowning occurs due to negative pressure pulmonary edema and irritant pneumonitis.   When that valve (the epiglottis) closes, people still try to take a deep breath in; this results in them pulling a lot of pressure into their chest but, because that valve is closed, no air comes in and the 'negative' pressure reaches levels that can damage tissue. This leads to damage to the small blood vessels in the lung, which leads to leakage of fluid INTO the lung air sacs (the alveoli). This fluid accumulates in the lungs and is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema inhibits oxygen absorption, which can lead to respiratory failure.  The other component to it is that the small amounts of water inhaled into the lungs can cause inflammation and damage to small blood vessels (pneumonitis), which causes leakage of even more fluid into the lungs. This contributes to MORE pulmonary edema.  The combined effects can lead to severe pulmonary edema and, potentially, respiratory distress or failure.  This is why dry drowning can occur hours and hours after people have gotten out of the water and think they're fine. Many may die in their sleep overnight as the fluid accumulates. Thats why you have to be very careful to monitor kids after any near drowning event.    **Also, to answer the main question: when you don't swallow correctly, the muscle contraction of the esophagus (the swallowing tube) is uncoordinated and leads to disorganized, high-pressure contractions called esophageal spasm (which is very painful, similarly to overcontracting one of your skeletal muscles like your biceps). In fact, some people with esophageal spasm are mistaken as having a heart attack and sent for emergency angiography, which may come back totally clean.  You always read about this scenario in med school but I never believed it; however, that exact thing ended up happening to my uncle a few years ago (a very healthy guy with almost no risk factors for heart disease). Angiography was completely normal but his esophagus was as disorganized as an outlet mall on black Friday.

gyahvs1j	It can, provided you get to it before it metastasizes.  What is metastasis you ask?  When a tumor grows it sheds other cancerous cells - these spread through your body, exact mechanism depends on the tumor and location. Once in a while one of these cells will get a foothold somewhere away from the cancer site. It might sit there doing nothing, it might grow slowly, it might grow quickly.  These are called secondary tumors. While small they might be virtually impossible to detect. They’re also the same cancer as the original tumor - eg if a lung cancer secondary starts growing in your liver you have lung cancer in your liver. As I’m sure you’re guessing - this is very bad news for the patient.  If you get to a tumor before it has done this, and it’s not inoperable due to some technical difficulties as it’s wrapped around an artery or something, then removing the tumor has a great prognosis for the patient.  If you get to it afterwards… removal material not be worth it or might not solve the most critical issues, and the recovery from major surgery could shorten their life more than dealing with the tumors via other means.  But why can’t you remove the secondaries?  Well, these often end up everywhere, with multiple tumors, many of which may not be detectable, some of which may not be operable. You could maybe try, but then you’re playing wack-a-mole with each removal presenting a severe recovery that could weaken the patients ability to survive the rest of the tumors, or you know more secondaries are gonna activate soon enough anyway.	1642801591.0	htnmiop	t3_s9lc8i	t3_s9lc8i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9lc8i/eli5_why_cant_cancer_just_be_cut_out/htnmiop/

Kind of like stretching a rubber band, the sides closest and furthest from the moon go out further, which is what we know as a high tide. A high tide can’t just come from nowhere, the high tides pull water from other places, causing the low tides in the middle.  Where phases come in is just in that if the sun and moon are in line (full moon) the sun’s gravitational pull also comes into play, creating the same high and low tides but to a higher degree. The suns gravitational pull is less than half of the moon’s though, so if they aren’t in line the sun’s pull somewhat cancels the moon’s out, creating the same high and low tides, but to a lesser degree.	1642804768.0	htnv3c2	t3_s9mu7i	t3_s9mu7i	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9mu7i/eli5_how_can_the_moon_phases_affect_the_tides/htnv3c2/

gyahvs1j	Why would they?  Cities end up mostly being built where it makes sense to have a city.  You’ll note that in the UAE the cities are mostly on or near the coast, similar to Australia. Saudi is somewhat more varied, but the locations of cities are still very much a product of resources and history.  There is very little reason to build a large city in most of WA, NT or SA - due to limited resources, and even where there is potential for development it’s difficult to attract people to live there due to a fairly limited lifestyle available 1000km from any major population center.  So… not many people want to move there because there’s not much there, and there’s not much reason to put anything there for people to move to.  Its not like the place is cramped with the currently populated areas around the coast either - the most densely populated state, of which most is habitable, has a population density of about 30 per sq.km, on par with Vermont, or slightly more dense than Arizona. The next most densely populated state, again a lot of it is habitable, has fewer than 10/sq.km. In other words -  or only isn’t there much reason for people to move *to* the center, there’s not exactly a drastic shortage of space in the populated areas to push people *from* the existing populated areas.	1642810499.0	hto9oho	t3_s9oq6d	t3_s9oq6d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9oq6d/eli5_why_isnt_australia_able_to_build_anything_on/hto9oho/

The LHC (all particle accelerators actually), look at what happens when we force collisions of microscopic particles.  In both cases, the object of the test is to cause damage: with a dummy, we analyze the results to minimize hypothetical damage to people. Particle accelerators like LHC cause collisions of particles to see what happens, and to try to break particles into their smallest particles and sub-particles that we can observe.	1642823568.0	htp4q0n	t3_s9sqdj	t3_s9sqdj	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9sqdj/eli5_large_hadron_collider/htp4q0n/

But when I was interested in Civil War re-enacting, I found a pair of period-correct frames and had lenses made for them. Those frames were designed to sit much closer to your eyes. The lenses were much thinner, because they didn't have to bend the light as far as my modern glasses do. It took some time for me to get used to glasses where the lenses were so close.	1642824759.0	htp7bdp	t3_s9ngcv	t1_htp2kfz	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9ngcv/eli5_how_come_were_able_to_make_paperthin_contact/htp7bdp/

3jfs15fp	Not a lawyer. But my layman's understanding is:.      In the American system, anything you give to the police can be used against you but not for you.   I believe the legal term for evidence in your favor is"exculpatory" ie it's evidence to prove you were not culpable.    It's kinda messed up, it means if you are indicted then the fact you gave your alibi to the police isn't something the court can consider in your favor. The prosecutor also isn't required to put that in front of the jury. B Don't know if that makes it easier to land more plea bargains.       In the British system, your alibi you give the police must be included in the brief of evidence. This means the police have to prove your alibi false and include that in the evidence as well.   The court can consider anything in the evidence eg an alibi given to police as being in your favor, not just used against you.   This probably works as a counterbalance to the fact plea deals are far less common.	1642831613.0	htpkm36	t3_s9rlsm	t3_s9rlsm	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9rlsm/eli5_the_police_caution_after_being_arrested_in/htpkm36/

bx4g9	Admissions by silence can also happen in America.  "The non-denial of a statement made in the presence of the party charged which tends to establish his liability may amount to an admission of its truth, if, as it appears in this case, the statement was heard and understood by the party and he had knowledge of the facts stated; was not physically disabled from answering; had a motive for denying it and would naturally do so if he does not intend to admit it, and was at liberty to make a reply... \[T\]his silence \[is\] admissible evidence from which an admission of its truth may be inferred, the inference to be drawn being left to the jury."

fkz68	1 wasn't an assault rifle, 2 killed people in self defense. You really should google it as the person you replied to was purposefully vague and used incorrect definitions to paint Rittenhouse in a bad light.   Dude was at a protest providing first aid to all protestors and cleaning graffiti. He has family in town and works there only recently moving about 15-30 minutes from town to a sub rural area just over the state border where Kenosha is the closest metro area to. Later in the night rioters show up and he is asked by the local car dealership to act as armed security there (armed security guards are a thing in all of the u.s. states and common with at most a proof of ability to shoot accurately as requirement to get the job.) His friend gave him an ar15 he bought with Rittenhouse's money. Rittenhouse that night put out a fire being pushed into a gas station by a Mr. Rosenbaum. Mr. Rosenbaum at that time proceeded to threaten to kill anyone in Rittenhouse's group if he found them alone.   Later that night when Rittenhouse was walking between dealership lots offering first aid (after the police blockaded the road that lead to one of the lots) Mr. Rosenbaum spotted Rittenhouse and hid behind a car with an accomplice. When Kyle passed the parked car Mr. Rosenbaum gave chase yelling "fuck you" while his accomplice fired a gun in the air or at Rittenhouse (this has not been determined) Rittenhouse turned around after hearing the shot and saw Rosenbaum lunging for him and Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum 3 times as Rosenbaum grabbed his barrel (this is corroborated by burn marks from the barrel on Rosenbaum's hand).   At this point Rittenhouse saw a mob forming and started running to the police line. As he did Mr. Grosskreutz on Grosskreutz's own livestream asked Rittenhouse what he was doing. Kyle said "going to the police" Which Grosskreutz said he misheard as "I'm with the police" in his testimony. Someone yelled get him.   At this time Mr. Huber can be seen chasing Rittenhouse and a rock can be seen thrown and hitting Rittenhouse causing him to fall. When he falls Huber gets on top of him and hits him with a skateboard to the head. Rittenhouse shoots and kills him, Grosskreutz (then also chasing Rittenhouse) feigns friendliness by putting his hands up and decides to aim at Rittenhouse when Rittenhouse lowers his weapon. Rittenhouse re raises his gun and shoots Grosskreutz's bicep and while Grosskreutz tends to his wound Rittenhouse runs to the police who yell at him to go home and drive off when he tries to turn himself in. He does so and drives 15-30 minutes to his house and then goes to the local police station to turn himself in for questioning. There was a fourth man involved that assaulted Rittenhouse but narrowly avoided being shot and ran off.   I left out the background of everyone involved just as the court did. I only referenced the distance Rittenhouse drove to give proper context to it before someone tries to use it as a demerit when it isn't one like some think. These are all facts from the trial and the reason he was found not guilty which due to the presumption of "Innocent until proven guilty" means his innocence was not stripped from him as he was not found guilty. Transitive property and all that. Everything I stated is straight from the trial with no opinion added just what the witnesses stated and video corroborated. At no point was Kyle found to be the aggressor.   You can judge his decision to be there but if you do you must give the same scrutiny to everyone that decided to be there, You can judge the being armed but must also do the same for everyone else that had a gun there (many gun shots besides Rittenhouse's and Rosenbaum's accomplice's that night.)	1642843342.0	htq2frx	t3_s9rlsm	t1_htpvxfx	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9rlsm/eli5_the_police_caution_after_being_arrested_in/htq2frx/

This is called adverse inference. While you don't have to say anything, if you don't answer a question and then in court you do answer that question and it provides you with a defence, then the court has a right to think "well why wouldn't you just say that when they asked in the first place?" and MAY draw adverse inference, as it suggests that you have changed your story now you've had time to think up an excuse.  - Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

hrmslmk8	But turning around in court and saying it was the passenger is exactly what you're saying to do.  If you raise the defence of duress in court then the police will investigate this defence and find evidence to disprove it so as to eliminate the possibility of there being reasonable doubt in court. So if it's actually the truth then they will not find anything that disproves it and will have to disclose that to the court.  By not mentioning it beforehand you allow the court to draw adverse inference.  If you are genuinely innocent, it is not better whatsoever to not say anything. It's best to speak to a lawyer and do what they tell you to do. Which if you're innocent is usually to give an honest account.	1642848216.0	htq92f6	t3_s9rlsm	t1_htptyd3	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9rlsm/eli5_the_police_caution_after_being_arrested_in/htq92f6/

When I interview an innocent person who has a lawyer in the room and has had legal advice beforehand, they also answer all my questions as they have been advised to by a lawyer.

elf2o4lj	Your question is really about cultural conventions that differ from place to place. It is not possible to answer without a historical and geographical context. You are asking something like: "Why are people in place X busy categorizing people from place Y to be of type Z". The label "asians" refers to people living on an enormous continent, and the group comprise more than half the world population and they look very different. What the label "white" means and the importance attached to it is also cultural and likely to vary from place to place.	1642850283.0	htqbxsu	t3_s9zxs4	t3_s9zxs4	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9zxs4/eli5_why_arent_asians_considered_white_when/htqbxsu/

1udvgyz4	It feels like most of reddit is either adhd or autistic. Why is that? Look at my post history. I stopped reddit 2 years ago sometime and I only logged in because I was bored on holiday.   You're taking a stimulatant medication. It improves focus as prescribed but you also need to rid yourself of unnecessary distractions. The worst distractions are those of instant gratification (social media, memes, pointless arguing online).   The biggest lesson I've learned is to not be cheap with time. I know how much I get distracted so I know this is hard for a lot to hear, and it sounds obvious, but if you know it takes you longer to get a task done then you should give yourself more time.  My point: 1. allow yourself some distractions but stay away from instant gratification. 2. Plan your life to give yourself more time to complete tasks. You're better off just trying 20min a day for something rather than 4 hours in one go.	1642856908.0	htqm18i	t3_s9ze9r	t3_s9ze9r	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s9ze9r/eli5_why_is_it_so_hard_to_study_if_you_have_adhd/htqm18i/

6qr5t	"woman" is a name we gave to a person who embodies the "feminine" and "femininity" is a human idea.   Cold is a relative term. Ice is hot compared to liquid nitrogen, or deep space.  Night is only dark to us because we can't see well  in it. To an animal adapted to hunting at night, or my camera set to long exposure, you can see just fine.  Feminine only makes sense when defined against masculinity.

It was just normal for the streetlight to illuminate the side of the house including my window. Then one night a couple of years back I had an almost completely dark bedroom (unrelated to power outages etc). It was AWESOME. Even better, the streets don't look sickly yellow anymore.

We know roughly how strong this effect is relative to how much mass there is. We know the effect of this is inversely proportional to the distance away from a mass.

du45b	Most people would say the exact opposite, that LED streetlights feel *brighter* than older incandescent technologies, and that’s due to the color spectrum of LEDs overlapping more with human vision. Humans are more sensitive to blue light while sodium lamps tend to put out a very reddish/yellowish light that seems dimmer even if the measured brightness is higher.  To answer your specific question about why they wouldn’t seem as bright I can only assume it’s because your municipality didn’t do the proper research on what kind of LEDs would work best for their needs, or maybe they went with the lowest bidder who couldn’t deliver what they really needed.	1642898507.0	httdif1	t3_sa1jul	t3_sa1jul	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sa1jul/eli5_why_does_led_not_illuminate_areas_well/httdif1/

They don't just lie -- they craft lies and create narratives specifically to mess with a person's head and take away their agency. It's emotional abuse and psychological manipulation.   What you're describing is someone who simply lies and refuses to own up to their lies. That's different.	1642901707.0	httkvqc	t3_sah6xj	t1_htthh1w	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sah6xj/eli5_gaslighting/httkvqc/
134ae4	There is a very important theorem in probability theory called the "central limit theorem". What it says is that if you repeat a random event a large number of times and take the average of the outcomes, the average will always approach a specific distribution-- which we call the "normal distribution".  An example:  The outcome of a fair six-sided die roll is **not** normally distributed. Each outcome is equally likely, which in statistics we call a "uniform distribution".   Suppose you performed an "experiment", where each run of that experiment consists of rolling the die twice and recording the results. After plotting the results from many runs, you would find that some numbers come up a lot more often than others -- for example, rolling a 7 happens about six times as often as rolling a 12. If you increased the size of the experiment, e.g. rolling 10, 100, 1000, etc. times before averaging and recording, the plotted results would gradually approach a bell-shaped curve: the normal distribution.  Amazingly, this actually holds true even for unfair dice. A die could be weighted to land on 5 99% of the time, but if you roll it enough times, the average of the results will still be approximately normal.  On to how this is useful. In statistics, we commonly want to answer questions like "how plausible is it that an observed effect is a fluke" or "how likely is it that the real value of something differs from an estimated value by more than a certain amount". Methods for calculating such things are called "statistical hypothesis tests", and the most powerful such tests all rely on prior knowledge of the distribution of results.  For example, let's say you're testing a new drug to treat the common cold. You sample 1000 people with the cold, give 500 of them the drug and leave the other 500 as a control. At the end of your experiment, you find that members of the group given the drug recovered in 5 days on average, while members of the control group took an average of 8 days. Is this effect real, or the result of random chance?   A naive way to answer this question is to run the experiment again, a lot of times. You go out and sample another group of 1000, and then another, and then another, until you've repeated the whole experiment a million times. You find that the group given the drug recovers faster than the control group 97% of the time, and conclude that the effect is probably not a fluke.  Obviously, repeating an experiment a million times is not feasible in real life. Fortunately, it isn't necessary. The central limit theorem tells us what *would* happen if we ran the experiment  a million times: the means of the two groups would be normally distributed with a certain mean and variance. We can then apply something called a Z-test, which makes use of the mathematical properties of the normal distribution to calculate exactly how likely it is that the observed effects of our single experiment were the result of chance.	1642903536.0	http6l4	t3_sagpfu	t3_sagpfu	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sagpfu/eli5what_does_normal_distribution_mean/http6l4/

gyahvs1j	During their rise to power they engaged heavily with the working class and campaigned on a populist platform - I.e. socialist messaging to appeal to the working classes. This was in addition to other platform positions - white supremacy, anti-semitism, immigrant blaming, Christian-nationalism and law and order.  The Brownshirts were their street force before taking power, and were heavily socialist leaning, and their leadership wanted to continue those policies after the Nazis took power. At this point they’d outlived their usefulness to the rest of the Nazi power structure, so Hitler had the entire leadership rounded up and murdered - several hundred people - over the course of a few days. This ended any remaining “socialist” bent in favor of a turn to full on fascism, with the Blackshirts recruited from more middle-class backgrounds filling the role previously held by the Brownshirts.  /note - this is not meant to imply the brownshirts weren’t raging shitheads either or that the Nazi brand of socialism ever had a Kum-bah-yah-everybody-holding-hands-in-unity vision for the world.	1642910178.0	htu4ayp	t3_sajuw6	t3_sajuw6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htu4ayp/

4adwc	Monopolies are illegal since they are bad for humanities.  An exception for a time is made to this since in the form of patents since that can also be bad as the investor can cost recover although market lead should enable this anyway.  So patents run contrary to the idea of capitalist competition and the overarching illegality of monopolies beyond Government based coercive monopolies (eg Utilities where all the population must be supplied even at subsidy and not just the highly profitable niches)  The thing that is often forgotten that operating a business is not a right. It's a boon in exchance for taxes and FULL complicance with the laws of the entity granting the boon. Even the legal personhood of companies is just another boon. A pretence of personhood in order to serve a limited purpose (ownership, able to be sued, etc.)  If not for the corruptness of many people in Government lots of these companies would not only have their artifical monopoly exemption removed but they would be de-registered and loose their artifical deeming of personhood.	1642915939.0	htugob5	t3_saftzs	t1_httvr5d	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/saftzs/eli5_united_states_why_are_drug_retail_prices/htugob5/

16nebso4	A few years after the second world war, George Orwel--a famous socialist--wrote 1984, about a guy working in the ministery of truth, activiely revising history and manipulating language to keep IngSoc--a socialist party--in power. It is not a story for a five year old, but make sure you read it one day.  History is written by the winners. The nazis lost. Their enemies got to reconsider whether the nazis were socialist after the war. Socialists among the winners didn't want to be in the same group as the losers regardless of how much they belonged together, and so nazis were excluded from socialism from that time on. If the nazis had won, however, then this question would probably have been about communists.	1642926981.0	htuxmbp	t3_sajuw6	t3_sajuw6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuxmbp/
drnctn0w	> **Na**tionalso**zi**alistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP)   Nazi is just an abbreviation of NSDAP, not related to a slang term.	1642927388.0	htuy5e7	t3_sajuw6	t1_htu2kua	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuy5e7/
drnctn0w	But they already had the regular military on their side, as well. Why not use them? And then they had not just 1 but multiple paramilitary units, the SA, SS and then Hitler's own personal agents and intel people.	1642927495.0	htuya8u	t3_sajuw6	t1_htukwtg	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuya8u/
drnctn0w	The conservatives are the ones that actively decided to cede power to the social democrats. Then the social democrats had to take the blame for the Versailles treaty. They then made a deal with the devil (the military) to go against the communists. From there, Hitler rose to power.   So it wasn't the communists, but the social democrats in alliance with the military that allowed his rise.	1642927660.0	htuyhti	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuxda3	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuyhti/

drnctn0w	They were NATIONAL socialists, meaning socialism only for Germans - which in their definition meant Aryan. So they supported wealth redistribution, universal healthcare, etc. but only for and on behalf of the "chosen" race.   So basically economically Left-wing, but socially far-Right.	1642927896.0	htuysw6	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuxn3m	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuysw6/
drnctn0w	I mean, national borders tend to do that, by their very nature. National Socialism is just socialism restricted to the "nation," which they defined as only a certain race. Only the far, far-Left of communists proposed international socialism, like  Trotsky. Stalin, Lenin, etc. just sought a national form, while encouraging other nations to adopt the same policy, but not in conjunction with Russia's.	1642928043.0	htuyzqw	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuuyxi	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuyzqw/
2oqsh0fn	You're getting a lot of complex answers, and a not insignificant amount of propaganda, but the short and sweet answer is that Hitler was smart enough to know that appealing to the working class was only going to help him, so he let the preexisting name, and quasi-left wing rhetoric, of the party stay after he took over even though he personally detested the types of socialism that were popular at the time because they didn't align with his cultural and racial supremacist views.  If you want a more specific, and less eli5, explanation I would suggest reading a book on the history of the nazi party and not listening to the yokels here on reddit who usually have among the worst history takes you can find on the internet.  Or, if you dont want to take that much time, here is Wikipedia:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party#CITEREFOrlow2010	1642928149.0	htuz4pk	t3_sajuw6	t3_sajuw6	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuz4pk/
drnctn0w	Just not the **national** versions of them. That's the point of the adjective, to modify the noun. Nazis wanted socialism, but only for their chosen Aryan race, whereas socialists and communists wanted it for everyone within a given region or, some, like Trotsky, for the whole world.	1642928313.0	htuzcbd	t3_sajuw6	t1_htuitdd	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sajuw6/eli5_why_did_the_nazi_party_use_the_term/htuzcbd/
