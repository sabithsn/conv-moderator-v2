cmd29agj	I'm not gonna yell about it. I thoroughly believe that Britain becomes a republican after queen Elizabeth dies. Elizabeth inherited the throne when Britain still believed in its own power and traditions.    Modernity doesn't depress me, because I see the current age as a liminal and turbulent age, like the [Axial age of 700 BC  to 300BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_Age?wprov=sfla1), where all of the traditions, philosophies and political/economic doctrines of the previous time are abandoned in favor of new ones. This seems to happen to human civilization, whenever a truly massive technological change happens; the agricultural revolution, the bronze age collapse, the Axial age, and now modernity. ***The Axial age and it's changed were caused by the introduction of iron weaponry/tools and that took 600 years; think of all the marvels we've invented in the last 200 years/are currently developing, and imagine the length and enormity of the societal upheaval that is only begging now. This wild ride has only begun, my beloved friends, and you will not live to see it's conclusion***	1640870914.0	hqjkvjn	t3_rs0qgf	t3_rs0qgf	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rs0qgf/make_way_for_the_queens_guard/hqjkvjn/

1ql7ilgc	I’m assuming 14 was the correct answer to my last question.  How is it a libleft idea to want teachers to have better pay and to not have a bias?  Which states pay teachers well enough if you don’t mind me asking?  Yes, economics teachers should teach economics. I know it’s difficult for you to hear the words communism and socialism since yesterday your parents told you they were bad!!  Again, top 15% nationwide and still won’t qualify because I’m exactly 10 points away on the SAT. But you aren’t old enough to take it yet so.  Shouldn’t have to risk my life at all for education.  Again, what makes you think that even though I couldn’t afford college the first time, I can suddenly pay it off with massive interest? Or did that thought not occur to you? Or any thought for that matter.  Theories DO block things yes. Just like how the theory of capitalism being the only system allowed can cause bias and not knowing any other system.  They do NOT require different ethnicities to work. They require that you don’t only hire people because they’re white.   Equity isn’t communism. Classic.  Tolerance IS the maximum required. And even then there’s really no punishment if you’re not tolerant.  Was there a CORRECT answer you were looking for with the original question? Did you just get mad over my flair like a child? Did you want me to support only your ideas since that’s what you got washed into thinking on PCM?	1640881916.0	hqk9a5m	t3_rr5uu5	t1_hqjun3v	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rr5uu5/public_education_lol/hqk9a5m/

qtxaa	The various Ancient Greek polities basically had nothing in common with each other besides the fact that they viewed themselves as being of a common race, and even then they occasionally attempted to excommunicate people they didn't like from being part of the greek race. See: Athens arguing Alexander (III, the famous one) was a barbarian and Alexander (III) showing them his birth certificate where the original Alexander (I) of Macedon participated in the Olympics via a claim to greek heritage through some greek god or whatever. Keep in mind Alexander (III) later argued his direct father was a greek god rather than Philip who was descended from Alexander (I) so Alexander (III) was not even related to the first Alexander (I) by the end of his life anyway.	1640891305.0	hqkxzu1	t3_rs1psj	t1_hqk35hj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rs1psj/ancient_greece_the_moral_epitome/hqkxzu1/

d3ma80j2	Yes. Migrants are actually exceptional citizens. They work harded and are usually smarter than your working class too. Most are skilled and upper class people from decadent countries. And they agree to work jobs that are undercalificated for them, cause even your worst jobs pay better than working degree/profesional jobs in socialist countries.

hyhnkat2	what really fucking annoys me is "believe science". that is literally the opposite of what "science" is based on - doubt, and the dissolution of said doubt through evidence, confirmation of said evidence through peer review.   I'm triple vaxed myself; mostly for uni. I've sought  out the clinical trials and concluded that the vaccine is not harmful.  its not "believe science", its "believe the evidence", "follow the science".  I'm not trying to support the people who think therapeutic oils will heal them from cancer and prevent all disease, i'm saying that "believing science" is a bad idea, especially in fields that suffer heavily from the replication crisis like medical and social sciences. "believe science" seems to apply to these people indiscriminately, which is why we keep seeing shit like "right wing = retar new study (N=3) confirmed!!" hitting the frontpage from r / science and similar subs.  I genuinely believe that if more of the reporting around covid was based on actual data from the many many clinical trials they conducted, more people would be vaxxed. But that would mean doing actual journalism and we all know journos are lovecraftian insect people so false hope there i guess lol.	1640912698.0	hqmf86p	t3_rsflr6	t1_hqm3pop	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rsflr6/despite_being_82_vaccinated_they_have_some_of_the/hqmf86p/

That's what [this CBS article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bushs-final-approval-rating-22-percent/) says. Or are you referring to Biden's approval ratings *at this point* in his presidency relative to other presidents?   If you mean the former, I would not at all be surprised if Biden and Harris got that low by the end of their current term, provided that they keep fucking up as much as they have this year, but I don't think they've gotten that low just yet.	1640913112.0	hqmg634	t3_rsbgax	t3_rsbgax	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rsbgax/ask_them_why_they_think_joe_burden_and_kamalatoe/hqmg634/

1ql7ilgc	Pharmacy assistants aren’t only in the military. Hard to understand when you’re a 14 year old bootlicker who can only understand things their parents repeat.  Business insider. Wow. Fantastic source! Still nearly 20k off of what you said incredibly. Gotta read more than just the final sentence.  Correct, the world isn’t simple. It’s exploitive. That’s why student loans exist. Since you’re not old enough to go to college, and you’d only go max to community since you’re… you, that doesn’t even effect you.  That would be the definition. If you refuse to mention other systems other than literally saying “it’s bad”, it’a indoctrinating. China feels the same way for capitalism (ironically), they’ll tell you the same exact thing you just told me but with the word capitalism in there. What that not be indoctrinating students then?  Yes? That’s literally what I said. You can’t just say you’re facing racism from a coworker without proof. Even if it’s an eye witness thing, it’ll hurt the company to say they let this happen for such a time.  If you weren’t mad you wouldn’t be replying.  Join the military if you think it’s safe then. You’ll probably be paid extra since college for you is out of the question. Are you old enough to sign up? Here’s the US military site that explains how to do it: https://www.usa.gov/join-military . Do us a favor and join it maybe.  Again, no way that discord mod job is paying enough.

1ql7ilgc	If you don’t mind me asking once again, how old are you?   Join the military then if it’s that easy. Please go ahead. “Serve” your country. I actually do qualify for scholarships but I’m going for one that covers a majority of the cost. Not surprised you couldn’t figure that out but then again scholarship isn’t a word you’ll be hearing very often outside of this conversation.   Business insider is literally just a media outlet for entertainment. You might wanna join them after the military since you’re that funny!  Sorry for insulting your dream of community college. Bet that door is also closed off for you. Don’t worry, it’s insanely difficult to get in.  Teaching multiple things is possible. And currently 1.6 billion people are living in just 5 countries that claim to be communist. That’s a massive amount. More than you can count on on both hands if you were wondering.   And if you want to add socialists countries to my last message, that would raise an extra 302 million people. Not including India which surprisingly is considered a socialist state. Did not know that. But if you do add India that would make the total 1.7 billion. If 1.7 billion people live in socialist countries and 1.6 billion live in communist countries, that would mean 3.3 billion people aren’t living in capitalist countries. You’d need to maybe count on your feet to get to that number.  I’m going to assume the racism you’ve “faced” was one time a white girl on Twitter made a joke about white guys and you ran to PCM to circle jerk crying.  You keep saying you’re rolling with laughter but you keep coming back to get mad over my flair lmao. It’s kind of cute that at first you didn’t see the flair so it was “omg teachers shouldn’t have to have 2 jobs!” Then when you saw the flair you went “never mind they get enough because business insider told me so bad flair scary”.   You are that age where you know nothing. That age is again, 14.   Visiting the Bahamas, Mexico and Canada when you were younger with your family isn’t called living in 3 other countries.  This country DOES have problems. Why not try different ideas instead of just crying about it on Reddit and jerking off on PCM? Bet you get scared by Democrats and think they’re left wing lmao.  PCM is probably looking for mods. Think about it, you’re an unemployed 14 year old that MAY join the military one day and won’t be attending college.

82qwco0j	My grandmother was my parent. She babysat me while my mom and dad worked full time, so I spent more waking time with her than I did with them. We used to play hide and seek. Her house was pretty big so there were a ton of places to hide. She also introduced me to vinyl records.  She died suddenly when I was in 4th grade. 59 years old. It was easily the worst day of my life, and I still consider it to be.  I feel your pain. I really do. But it gets easier, I promise.	1640927824.0	hqnb0su	t3_rskhbl	t3_rskhbl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rskhbl/rip_nana_i_need_your_guys_rn/hqnb0su/

im8je	As I grew up in a single mother household, my paternal grandmother did everything she could to help us where my delinquent father wouldn't. Every other week she and my grandfather would bring me and my little brother grocery shopping to get some of the nice stuff we didn't usually get to have.  One of my warmest memories was during a car journey home, when my 12 year-old self was pondering on whether selflessness is really possible, effectively an infant's understanding of the idea that altruim could be technically impossible in humans, and when I shared the idea with her she explained that a mother's and grandmother's love for their offspring and willingness to do anything to keeo them safe is the one sure example of selflessness.  I've been abroad for three years without being able to return for at least another year - it should have only been a couple of years but the financial implications of the pandenic fucked me over. I miss my grandmother, and the rest of my family, dearly. Whoever is taking the time to read this, please visit your loved ones more. I wish I could.	1640931803.0	hqnhv22	t3_rskhbl	t3_rskhbl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rskhbl/rip_nana_i_need_your_guys_rn/hqnhv22/

You won't do a thing to stop people in power with your internet comments.   There are elites of all nationalities playing war games and you want to join in? Have some respect for yourself. Your neighbour could be Christian, Muslim, or Jewish, are you actually going to think more or less of them based on that? If so, you are as pathetic as they come.   People believe different things and  different beliefs, but your world view is so restricted you can't seem to fathom that, you power on being anti-Semetic because you think it's achieving something?	1640932321.0	hqnioi6	t3_rsir9x	t1_hqngi2k	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rsir9x/yeah_this_is_an_old_tweet_okay/hqnioi6/

1ql7ilgc	Your post history is public btw. It’s pretty clear you’re not above the age of 14. Good try tho.  14 year olds can’t enlist. Try when you’re 18 please.  Love seeing right centers 180ing their initial opinions on a question they asked for because of someone’s flair that doesn’t have anything to do with it.  Job recruiting sites like ziprecruiter actually compile job offers to display data. Like the average wages of high school teachers. Surprising, it’s not looking too hot. Guess they don’t need a 2nd job now because… idk somehow had a different opinion from yours and since you’re a child you couldn’t handle it.  Spoiled brat for wanting an unbiased education and for teachers to have a fair pay. Crazy. Someone must’ve got really angry at me to use meaningless insults! I guess I struck a nerve. Poor fella, however shall you recover. Maybe touch grass? I do not apologize for saying you’d never make it past community college. You aren’t the “salt of the earth”, you’re someone who has literally made 900 comments on PCM. You’re a failure. I don’t give a shit about your feelings. Welcome to the internet!   Chinas economic system is actually just capitalism with a different name. Crazy to believe right! They have a similar system to ours but they criticize the name! Wonder if we do the same…  Again, profile is public.   You should maybe consider traveling to maybe get out of your basement for 2 seconds.  Changes have been stagnated for quite some time. And what changes would be allowed in your opinion? Maybe people should vote for a new economic system to be put in place! Or maybe they should make it so employers don’t only hire white people! But then again, white people have had just the most difficult time in the US. I’ve heard one time some girl on Twitter made a joke about them! The horror.  1 person and whomever the fuck is the “squad”. Insane.  I recommend you apply. Finally, you can go from earning 0 dollars at your moderation job at “Furry dating discord 21+” to earning 0 dollars at your moderation job at PCM lmao. Some good career choices you have. Parents just be crying tears of joy.	1640933021.0	hqnjs3n	t3_rr5uu5	t1_hqnfvj0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rr5uu5/public_education_lol/hqnjs3n/

7bbpvkjk	My Gram had a very hard life, and she also had a chemical imbalance that often made her manic and act out in strange ways.  Once when she got arrested, she called our home to ask someone to bail her out of jail, and at twelve years old, I happened to be the one who answered the phone.  We talked for ten minutes, and she told me the whole story of the relatively harmless public mischief she had gotten into.   She described the female officer who had arrested her as being blonde, with long hair, tied in a ponytail behind her lobotomy.   I laughed so hard and so long... couldn't stop.  Could literally hear the smile on my Grams face from jail.  She was messed up, but we still managed to have some laughs, and I never judged her transgressions too harshly after that.  Sorry you lost your Nana tonight.   Hope you have some memories that make you smile too.	1640933313.0	hqnk86o	t3_rskhbl	t3_rskhbl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rskhbl/rip_nana_i_need_your_guys_rn/hqnk86o/

1ql7ilgc	So then how old are you! Let me know please! On one hand, you’re just a stupid 14 year old that made 900 comments on PCM and as a result have probably perm stunted your mental capacity.   Join again then. Why not? Not dangerous. Want the link to the site again so you know how to?  You asked the question about the education. You got an answer but it wasn’t the one you wanted because it supports the indoctrinating that you like. You can’t even agree with anything I’m saying because somehow my flair (which doesn’t have an impact on this at all) has upset you so you decided to shit you pants and whine.  Noooo. You’re telling me the department of education is going to inflate the numbers to make the situation seem better than it really is? Crazy. Wonder why the average salary from those site were all offering 20k less than what you were offering then…  You’re not a fine person because you went to community college. You literally couldn’t get into a better school because thinking isn’t your strong suit.  I’m sorry your reality is calling yourself the salt of the earth. Maybe it’s time for the schizo meds.  China lying? No way. They’ve never done that before. Especially with human lives before.  The one person you mentioned isn’t even a communist. That’s just a word you learned at one point and throw it around like an ape.  I know your mother is proud. She’s proud that you got that mod job for that discord server. Though it’d break her heart to here about the shit you probably say on there.  Changes do take time. And if you refuse to allow your children to even hear of different ideas, changes cannot and will not occur. That’s called something by the way. Can’t quite put my finger on it though.	1640934632.0	hqnm64x	t3_rr5uu5	t1_hqnkuz4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rr5uu5/public_education_lol/hqnm64x/

7o1flr2d	The japanese fat 'tax' doesn't work the way everyone thinks it does. The law really just requires companies to measure the waistlines of employees who are older than 40 and fines the companies if there are enough employees who have large enough waistlines. The individual isn't harmed at all, they are just required to take weight loss classes. If you are unemployed, retired, or under the age of 40 then you can be as fat as you want. If you are over 400lbs then you are probably unemployed to begin with.	1640937953.0	hqnqrnq	t3_rseq8s	t1_hqmgwqp	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rseq8s/based_authleft_japan/hqnqrnq/

w75bd	Bullshit.  Humans experience shame for a reason.  Some things, many things, *should* have shame and stigma attached to them.  The degree to which we as a culture have come to coddle useless people is insane.  No, everyone does not deserve a trophy.  You want a trophy?  Practice more.  Get better.  Win.  Accomplish something. Improve.  Smack your kids occasionally.  Don’t clean up after them, let the world kick their asses sometimes.  They’ll heal.  The total lack of shame approach’s results speak for themselves.  Grown men walking around in front of children wearing ass-less chaps and shrieking tumblerina’s accusing you of being a bigot because you don’t want to learn and use the new pronouns that they have just made up.  No.  It’s time to bring back shame, and mockery, and being able to point to an idiotic idea or value and say: “Dude, that’s fuckin’ stupid.”	1640992761.0	hqqpngn	t3_rswbvh	t1_hqq6hvg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rswbvh/guess_she_cant_have_sex_with_her_husband_then/hqqpngn/

The "religious brainwashing" was absolutely correct and based, and modern day LGBTQ supporters ought not to have any respect for this kind of worldview either.   I would also strongly argue that this worldview is nowhere close to the default way to feel and that the overwhelming majority of humanity has been "homophobic" for the majority of history, and if anything this way of thinking was simply cope from homosexuals who didn't want to admit they were fruits. I honestly have more respect for full blown out-and-proud queers then these sorts of people.	1641036194.0	hqsoasc	t3_rt7syb	t1_hqrer5n	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rt7syb/enough_reddit_for_today/hqsoasc/

exquu45	When I was younger, up until the time I was twenty, I used to be pretty critical of democracy in general. But as I've gotten older and understood more about how actual political dealings work, I've come to appreciate it a hell of a lot more than any other form of government.   The main reasons being that it doesn't allow for any one political group or individual to hold all of the power, that it forces opposing factions to cooperate and compromise if anything is to be done, and that it ensures that the government must focus its agenda on satisfying the voting populace rather than pursuing higher ideals which the vast majority of relatively apolitical citizens couldn't give less of a fuck about in the end.  Democracy does have its flaws, we all know that, but it is truly a better alternative than all the others known to us based upon what we can know from history and the data available to us.	1641129840.0	hqxjocj	t3_ru92iv	t3_ru92iv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ru92iv/based_google/hqxjocj/

c64km	Eh. It's fine to not want to date someone with kids, and it's obviously fine to want to date someone in good shape, but this guy seems like a dick. Imagine being a girl who doesn't have kids, makes decent money, and wants a relationship and a family reading this guy's Tinder.  Literally the *only* thing you'd pick up about him is that he really, really hates a lot of women on Tinder, and that he's moderately financially healthy. All he's conveying is that he's bitter and irritated, and that's before even *speaking* to someone. This is just gross.  Whenever I see people with furious bios like this on dating apps, I usually ignore them. If they're going into any potential conversation looking to say "Why didn't you read my page?" or "People like you are the reason I hate these apps," then they're going to be examining you with a damn microscope rather than talking to you like a person. It's exhausting, he's high maintenance. I'd be annoyed by a girl having the same kind of bio about older or unattractive men, it's gross when he does it too.  The kind of girl he's interested in isn't going to read this bio and say "Thank God that doesn't apply to me, I have a chance!" they're going to think "This guy of average attractiveness making a normal amount of money seems extremely pissed off about everything and extremely entitled to attention from me, I'm going to go find anybody else." And we both know he's going to use the lack of attention he gets as "proof" that all women are trash, pretending that if any girls like the ones he wants existed they'd be leaping to match with him. I just find the entire thing disgusting.	1641144038.0	hqye45f	t3_ru945m	t1_hqxo9wj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ru945m/auth_right_tries_tinder/hqye45f/

eqfw9	the production of goods IS a form of contribution to the society, without affordable goods there is no such thing as a developed world, the whole point of corporate welfare is to keep the cost of goods low and prevent the recession, should US implement some kind of minimum wage to make companies pay their employees better? maybe, but the minimum wage is a crappy solution to low wages though and we should look for other solutions first. should the US cut the sheer amount of corporate welfare it has?

eqfw9	>So when somebody can choose between jobs that don't pay a living wage or wellfare, what should they choose?  stuff like negative income tax might fix the low wage problem, the way i understand it its basically a form of wage subsidization when if your wage is bellow a certain amount you get a subsidy, but abolishing the corporate welfare might utterly destroy the economy and make it so there is nothing for people to buy to begin with. we need to have a proper conversation about the corporate welfare before cutting it out completely	1641151012.0	hqyx097	t3_rua0m9	t1_hqyv210	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rua0m9/if_you_dont_like_it_then_quit/hqyx097/

eqfw9	i think you are underestimating the sheer amount of damage to the economy the abolishment of corporate welfare might cause, when you abolish it the prices of goods will be guaranteed to rise, and doubling the prices of goods might catapult a nation in to a recession. im not saying we should be living with it forever, im just saying that we shouldn't be so shortsighted when it comes to it. also slavery? really? you really shouldn't compare apples to oranges, unless you mean something else by "slavery".	1641154885.0	hqz7mt3	t3_rua0m9	t1_hqyyflc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rua0m9/if_you_dont_like_it_then_quit/hqz7mt3/

bvxfts4s	"Fuck you got mine" is an attitude of a moral coward or a child.  Education, that is worthwhile education and not "queer studies" etc., is something that benefits society as a whole, without that education the society will crumble and placing a price cap on participation rather than a competency one is like shooting yourself in the foot.  Sure make the people taking underwater feminist dance therapy courses pay for every breath they take, but why do you insist doing that for doctors, engineers, teachers, etc. would it not be better to make the only requirement for such important jobs the ability and competency to perform?	1641155135.0	hqz8ba9	t3_rtzib7	t1_hqw8d6w	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rtzib7/virgin_libleft_politician_of_usa_vs_chad/hqz8ba9/

The entities fucking us now are the same ones paying them.   I think, to do this without a pyrrhic revolution, the structure of society itself would have to be edged in our favor. Restricting political office from the corporate teet is paramount, but it starts with closing the wealth gap to strengthen the commoners position.	1641205920.0	hr23plz	t3_rua0m9	t1_hqzlu0q	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rua0m9/if_you_dont_like_it_then_quit/hr23plz/

But I would say semi close to what we have now, with a few notable exceptions.   - Universities would preach theistic morals instead of watermelon propaganda  - harsh fines for married couples who divorce and you can’t legally marry a second time.   - American diversity stays the same but we no longer try to tear each other down, but the black family unit is repaired and schools aren’t as trash. We all appreciate each other’s cultures with out attempting to change them.   - Giant oligopolies and monopolies are broken up  - the next time bankers make shit bets and crash the entire world economy, instead of being bailed out, they get fucking hung.   - Immigrants are unwelcome unless they conform to American ideals and morality   - massive pharmaceutical corporations and dismantled from the bottom up and major players are thrown in prison (or are executed) for all the shit they’ve pulled but mostly for intentionally starting the opioid epidemic.   - 2 term limit for all elected positions   - change the way bills become laws so dishonest politicians can’t Trojan horse random agenda shit into bills.   - Universal healthcare  - Extremely cheap college as long as you study STEM   - undo the sexual revolution  - voting is an earned privilege for paying a certain threshold in taxes, owning more than 5 acres of land, government service, but all citizens can vote at the age of 40 even if you meet none of the other qualifications.   - For profit prisons are done away with, sentencing is massively reduced for minor crimes and is instead replaced with physical punishment like lashings, and focusing on rehabilitation   - Laws are made to give workers more rights  - All media organizations can be fined into oblivion for even a small amount of intention misinformation or toxic fear mongering   - expelling globalists from our nation and instilling strong nationalist values to our children  And a whole bunch of other shit that I can’t think of right now	1641178328.0	hr0u5zl	t3_rudwua	t3_rudwua	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/rudwua/i_wany_to_know_more_about_the_people_here/hr0u5zl/

d0xxltco	> Communism has never failed  First of all we are going to get to communism through dialectical materialism if we don't become extinct first. Second, socialism has been tried as a stepping stone to communism but basically since capitalists enforce property rights, capitalists have more power and influence in a world of scarce resources. There will be a time when property rights become obsolete through dialectical materialism, that's when communism will emerge.   Capitalism is merely a lower form of human civilization, we have not evolved enough yet as a collective species to achieve communism, so for now all we can do is participate in capitalism. Basically what I think is the best way to get out of capitalism is to keep doing science and find out ways to produce more high IQ scientists so that we can learn how to keep improving our society through technologies/engineering and also keep reducing scarcity. Communism can only exist where there is no scarcity and property rights are obsolete.	1642530580.0	ht7iyzz	t3_s6ig55	t3_s6ig55	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6ig55/anon_is_based/ht7iyzz/

7nnh6c7y	Anyone should be able to move to a better country, either for survival or better opportunities/livelihood. Nobody should be restricted from immigrating somewhere else, that's inhumane. What's also inhumane is "exploring" another country with the only intent being strengthening your empire and becoming wealthier. That's greedy and selfish, and not "survival". The two things mentioned above are and are not the same. Europe is not for Europeans, just like Africa wasn't for Africans, the Americas weren't for Natives and same with any other colonized continent. It's true that no piece of land can be anyone's, from race, to nationality, to anything. The difference is what makes a land "someone's", colonization or an attempt to have a better life. North America shouldn't be for the natives, since they also probably used selfish methods to acquire these lands and kill off other civilizations. But honestly what I'm saying is that everything we do should be in favor of everyone or ourselves if we are in danger. What Europeans did was wrong and what immigrants are doing isn't. That's it. It's not about changing the culture or the population demographics, it's about being a bad person. I'm sorry if you didn't understand me, you can ask me to explain.	1642536857.0	ht7zxiq	t3_s6imuq	t1_ht462a2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6imuq/lib_left_only_supports_ethnic_nationalism/ht7zxiq/

sl3ci	> roma   actually gypsi, I'll copy paste my own comment   stop calling them Romani, their are gypsies. Romani is a stolen word.  Romani Means Romans in italian and latin, and probably other languages as well.  It's also been used as a PC term /tool in order to associate gypsies with Romanians (From Romania)  "Newsflash: Romani man steals wallet." TV watcher: Romani, dang must be a thief from Romania!  Great so your PC term for a culture (not a race) has the consequence turning people (more) racist against romanians.  -Signed, a Romanian who had some very bad encounters in London despite it being a bastion of "western culture and tolerance"  Jesus fuck, how many times will I have to explain that Romanians and Romania are unrelated to this shitty made up term, fuck whoever invented it.	1642537176.0	ht80sut	t3_s6yyc5	t1_ht6lgkf	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6yyc5/is_it_just_me_or_is_it_getting_harder_to_defend/ht80sut/

If someone commits any violent crime they shouldn't be deported but tortured (mildly, I don't know of a better word but torture is a pretty rough one) and educated.

10dn9e	I love Latinos and I live in town with a very large Latino population and it's based af. No mask shit. No lib nonsense at all really.   But I am starting to get tired of how insular and one dimensional Latino culture *in America* is. Take food for example. It's *so hard* to get any other kinds of ethnic food. No Japanese restaurants. No levantine food in the stores (spent three hours looking for tahini all over town yesterday before I gave up). No food festivals that don't revolve around Latino (mostly northern Mexican) cuisine.   It's all shitty fried corn puffs, overrated Coca-Cola, tamarind, and dried peppers as far as the eye can see.   I wouldn't trade the based politics to go back to my former home which was cosmopolitan but also a shithole.

iiq6s	I'm expressing my libleft side, so wall of text incoming.  When we talk about gender presentation or rather gender expression we talk about how you present yourself in society. Dressing in feminine clothes, wearing make up, specific haircuts. I think you get it.  Against that stands the term of gender identity. This is how you identify yourself, or in easier term, which gender you feel you belong to. This is something only you experiences. No one else experience how you feel. Whereas gender expression is how you present yourself and how others experience you.  If this does not resonate with you that's okay, since a lot of people have no real difference between their sex, gender identity and expression. Same with me, I don't really know how you "feel" as a man or how you should feel different if you were a woman. But I won't tell anyone that what they feel isn't real.  That said, there are definitely certain limitations that I grand this freedom. Autismgender or helicoptergender certainly falls outside of these limitations.	1642544669.0	ht8l5cn	t3_s7226w	t1_ht7681r	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s7226w/and_then_everyone_clapped/ht8l5cn/

Actively sinking the entire country with each new policy, yet won’t get voted out because the alternatives are also terrible.  -“Conservative” stereotypical old white dude who’s values are so paper thin and hard to pin down that it’s a genuine struggle to figure out what he stands for. I voted for this party just because I like the MP for my area (and out of sheer spite for Castro Jr, plus he seemed the least destructive of the 3)  -Young-ish social democrat guy who is more concerned with making quirky TikToks than creating sensible policy (his supporters insist that he’ll win by a landslide each time and are shocked each time that he doesn’t even come close)  And I don’t even know how to describe the third parties because they are all just incredibly disorganized or nuts.	1642545081.0	ht8m7j1	t3_s720pk	t1_ht7l5wb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s720pk/biden_argues_that_floyds_death_was_more_impactful/ht8m7j1/

8iioesd3	The American government is currently designed to be ineffective in order to limit executive power. Many of the Nordic countries' policies require some degree of solidarity and efficiency within the government, not two parties that are more focused on keeping the other party out of power than enacting their own policies. We've already seen this happen with healthcare bills many times.  Combine that with the US' heterogeneous population that is often in conflict with each other, a large, complicated system of states without any standardized logistics, and an entrenched bloated administration. The Dems have been trying to move healthcare and other social programs closer to the Nordic model for decades. If it isn't working, then there's something wrong with how the government works, right?	1642553366.0	ht96g4o	t3_s79qss	t1_ht95ju5	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s79qss/the_quadrants_react_to_high_support_for_the/ht96g4o/

The "Nordic countries are small and homogeneous so social programs work better there" argument is cliche'd and controversial, but it's one that I believe in. Smaller country means less diseconomies of scale and greater ability to manage things closely, and homogeneous population means greater trust and loyalty in the community and willingness to help each other out.	1642555054.0	ht9a6vs	t3_s79qss	t1_ht98ra0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s79qss/the_quadrants_react_to_high_support_for_the/ht9a6vs/

c1n483bb	Black people in the US are 2.7 times as likely as white people to live in poverty. But commit violent crime at 15 times the rate and homicide specifically at 8 times the rate that white people do. The poorest white people in the US have half the rate of homicide as the richest black people.  Poverty is definitely related to crime, it influences it. But both crime and poverty emerge from other factors. A completely dysfunctional culture generates both crime and poverty. Cultural issues being the cause, and those cultural issues are also influenced by external factors like politics.  The left-wing's courting of the black community in the US and brainwashing to keep them as a reliably poor, bitter, violent subculture in the US is the biggest problem, in my opinion. Every single solution that Democrats in the US present to rescue black people from white racism ends up just hurting the black community more and perpetuating their problems.	1642561568.0	ht9p4r9	t3_s6ytk1	t1_ht86gav	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6ytk1/who_let_authright_on_google/ht9p4r9/

ghor01pg	> Most countries in the west is some form of free market capitalist republic  HAHAHAHAHA, the West is so full of subsidies and tariffs that's a load of shit. My country has had free trade with the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China. We struggle to sell our produce in America because of all your nanny state communist crap so some inefficient farmers who can't handle a free market can sit on their ass.   Ironically we were also offered Nuclear Submarines to clear out a butter debt when the Soviet Union fell but we would've just had to throw out the butter so we forgave that debt. Meanwhile we get blocked by nanny state welfare queens in America.   The West is the nation that let France threaten to hinder our trade in the EEC after we demanded justice because they murdered someone on our sovereign soil. I don't like communists but they have offered free trade far more often than the West and haven't murdered someone on our soil.   The West is not and has never been a free market since the end of the laissez-faire era.

I hate Nazis, I love seeing Nazis get punched. I hate when assholes who are super “patriotic” or nationalist exhibit Nazi ideology because I consider myself an American Patriot and some of these other assholes do as well yet they rock insignia of an enemy we defeated.

1o766bk1	I've been to Cuba and a few other central Am. and Caribbean countries and I have to say, Cuba seems to be doing quite well for being a Caribbean island nation facing down one of the strictest embargos of the modern era.  Anyways, what's the alternative for Cuba? Let the foreign sugar men come back and rule them like slaves? There is a reason they had a revolution in the first place.	1642540318.0	ht89f2y	t3_s6zjnl	t1_ht7l5d3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/ht89f2y/

Well what if Jesus's entire story is just another temptation, but for us. Those who follow him ignore the hard and true OT laws that were written in stone by the Almighty Himself and stopped offering the ritual sacrifices He demanded, and instead accept the easy salvation that promises free forgiveness and asks only for your faith.	1642546187.0	ht8p2ek	t3_s79bsc	t1_ht8jyyw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s79bsc/depictions_of_jesus_on_the_compass/ht8p2ek/

al63o	Yeah, there's a whole branch of linguistics that looks at reconstructing older languages (to the extent that's possible).  It gets super cool in the Indo-European language family, as Persian and German (for example) are actually related to one another.  Before DNA and genetics, human migration was reverse tracked through language. The languages gave evidence of a connection between India and Europe and the Middle East way, way back when. That's where that Aryan thing came from, though it looks like it was actually the opposite: People from modern India migrated and settled Europe, becoming what we know as Europeans today.  Language is a pretty neat subject area. Theoretical linguistics is...interesting, albeit odd. I never gravitated towards the theoretical side of the discipline, though, as I'm convinced it's kind of gone off the rails in the last few iterations of theory, haha.	1642550495.0	ht8zm8z	t3_s63qbq	t1_ht56we2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s63qbq/abe_the_based/ht8zm8z/
1o766bk1	I think you have a serious misunderstanding of communism and are operating under assumptions but I’ll still challenge your ideas.  People work to survive and that work is necessary under any communist or socialist system. Working to secure the safety of your existence does not require you to exploit other workers, that is the main issue.  Communism is not about giving you the bare minimum to survive, it’s about developing a system where we work together to give each person what they want. This is extremely utopian and we can’t really fathom what this would look like hence the necessity of the socialist transition.  You can not take if you do not provide, that would be the same as the exploitation that currently happens under capitalism where the rich owner class does not work but takes much more than they need therefor deriving the worker of most of what they created with their work.  Also, why can’t we create systems were the people are empowered to stop any form of ‘wealth or power gathering’? We can even look to really world examples like the Zapatistas. It’s as if saying that all republics will fail because someone will always become a monarch. If we should not pursue a more equitable life for all because it could possibly be exploited then I have to ask why you think exploitation, corruption, and hoarding are not happening under the current system?  If there is a system in place that may tempt someone to steal from another to gain power over them, it should be remedied. Universal arming of the people would be a good way to handle this.  Capitalism isn’t working for the majority of the world, look outside your comfort bubble and see. I just wish we could engage in discussion on how to actually remedy this without acting like capitalism is somehow the best answer.  I’m sorry but so many people here just espouse their personal feelings about humans as if they are true fact and will determine how people act in any system and that is an extremely challenged point historically and analytically.	1642550777.0	ht90acq	t3_s6zjnl	t1_ht8e06p	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/ht90acq/

1o766bk1	I don't think most people really understand the embargo, please read the below rules for a better picture of what's actually going on.  Boats that dock in Cuba cant dock in the US for half a year.  >The 180-day rule is a statutory restriction prohibiting any vessel that enters a port or place in Cuba to engage in the trade of goods or the purchase or provision of services there from entering any U.S. port for the purpose of loading or unloading freight for 180 days after leaving Cuba  The provision of services mentioned above even includes things like refueling or repairs.  There is another rule that governs ships that stopped in Cuba which plays a big role:  >The goods/passengers-on-board rule – which prohibits any vessel carrying goods or passengers to or from Cuba or carrying goods in which Cuba or a Cuban national has an interest from entering a U.S. port with such goods or passengers on board  This effectively bars Cuba from most worldwide trade and is reflected in their extremely low export/import values given their geographical size and development of industry.  If the US free'd Cuba from the embargo they would undoubtedly blow the rest of the island nations out of the water, which is exactly what the US doesn't want given their economic system.	1642557242.0	ht9f7ag	t3_s6zjnl	t1_ht9cxqu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/ht9f7ag/

And even within each party there was variants more closely resembling others(Strasserism for instance is pretty close to communism) but as time went on they were eliminated.   Funny enough, in the long run the winner was Christian SocDem by process of elimination.	1642607761.0	htbx7sf	t3_s7ntkb	t1_htbqg9v	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s7ntkb/you_know_im_somewhat_of_a_centrist_myself/htbx7sf/

1o766bk1	>You are just way too optimistic. It's not "my limited experience". Our entire history proves this.  The points in human history where we have been most successful have been times of collaboration and cooperation, to think all of human history proves humans are uncooperative greedy people seems to say more about you than it does all of humanity.  >Also you constantly ignore the fact that communism never worked. There is not a single success story of communism applied on large scale. It always gets corrupted and always fails.  Communism has never been achieved, so we can look at socialist countries many of which are market based (something you should like). There are a few socialist countries in the world today that are doing fine, one of them is even a world leader.  The bigger question here to ask yourself is: would the few socialist states that have failed actually worked if it wasnt for economic or actual war being waged against them from the dawn of their existence?  You can't name a socialist country that an imperialist world power didn't try to take down through economic means or all out war, of course this will lead to weird things happening in the government as it is hard to defend against.	1642612048.0	htc8emq	t3_s6zjnl	t1_htbt1ar	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/htc8emq/

1o766bk1	You're arguing against distributism not communism.  Also, many more people have died in capitalist caused disasters than all of socialist history combined and those numbers only continue to grow.  In USSR and China mistakes during industrialization caused mass starvation, and this is bad and why we shouldn't allow totalitarians to take control and make bad decisions.  At the end of the day here are my key reasons why capitalism cant be the final stage of human economics:  * Capitalism relies on ever expanding markets and exponential growth, this is something that can't be continued forever and likely can't be altered while profit is still the main motive. * Capitalism relies on workers generating more value than they are allowed to take home, this is exploitation by someone who does not do the work. * Capitalism gives benefit to the employer who will diminish their employees wages the most through an increased upward flow of profit.	1642612868.0	htcam1z	t3_s6zjnl	t1_htbt7wn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/htcam1z/

1o766bk1	Your view of people is very doom & gloom - you assume people can't really change anything and that all systems will just devolve into the wealth holders securing all of the power and using that in negative ways against those without substantial wealth and that the people are useless in stopping that.  You describe the issues of capitalism but offer no alternative because you feel people are bad and ineffective at providing security for themselves. I don't see your ideology ever getting anything done, we would all still be in slavery somewhere if we thought like that.  &#x200B;  >Look at US and their Big Quit. Suddenly nobody wants to flip burgers for 8$. Some places already pay over 15$.  This is because people had a taste of a life with more freedom from low wage slavery but it is a temporary fluke. Most countries have had to institute minimum wage and other protections because it turns out industries that need to hire lots of people won't compete with each other, they will just all pay the minimum possible, and those are the industries that hire most of the people.  Wages will always be diminished because labor costs are the one thing that you can change when you compete with businesses in the same industry as you.  When people need to work for an employer to survive and are bound by that contract they have little to no negotiating ability which is compounded when industries decide they will all pursue lower labor charges.  &#x200B;  >I'm an engineer. I'm doing way better than in 2020. Why? Because my job have high entry point. So despite the fact that I make more money than 98% of people in my country - we can't find people who do what I do to help. **Not because they don't want to come and work with us. It's because there is nobody there to chose from.**  Do you know see the irony in that final statement and the stance your pushing?  &#x200B;  Lastly, I question your analysis of an automated future. If we automated everything why would we need to tax these industries to support the workers they laid off? We could just give the people the fruits of production and in turn require them to provide enough for the machines to continue operating, there is no need to reward someone simply for 'owning' the machines.  Anyways widespread automation would lay off workers, which destroys the pool of consumers, which decreases revenues, it's a self defeating issue that is another problem within capitalist competition.  Widespread automation would make communism an incredibly easy switch, it would eliminate almost all of the contradictions that communism is meant to solve.  I'd recommend you to really analyze the profit motive and what it actually does for employers and employees and where profit goes and what it does.	1642620939.0	htcwhee	t3_s6zjnl	t1_htckqf4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/htcwhee/

1o766bk1	Read about Chinese famines, there were many devastating famines happening quite frequently.  I don't think you realize just how poor China was and how prone they were to these problems. There is a reason they had a popular socialist revolution and why many Chinese still admire Mao.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_famines\_in\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines_in_China)  You should also read about the famines in India:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\_of\_major\_famines\_in\_India\_during\_British\_rule  Here's an excerpt from a popular book related to this topic:  "It is important to note that despite the gigantic size of excess mortality in the Chinese famine, the extra mortality in India from regular deprivation in normal times vastly overshadows the former. Comparing India’s death rate of 12 per thousand with China’s of 7 per thousand, and applying that difference to the Indian population of 781 million in 1986, we get an estimate of excess normal mortality in India of 3.9 million per year. This implies that every eight years or so more people die in India because of its higher regular death rate than died in China in the gigantic famine of 1958 – 61. India seems to manage to fill its cupboard with more skeletons every eight years than China put there in its years of shame."  To believe that capitalism isn't killing people is probably the greatest misconception that has come out of the entire counting bodies argument.  Capitalism is not working for the majority of people, the largest changes in worldwide poverty have been made in China by the communist party. These are difficult problems that a capitalist has to deal with.	1642622047.0	htczh43	t3_s6zjnl	t1_htctyne	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s6zjnl/actually_sweetie_youre_wrong/htczh43/

aj725	I’ll explain how it works.   There’s technically 3 sexes, male, female, and intersex(aka hermaphrodite). That’s the biological, hard facts thing that pops up on your birth certificate. No one is gonna argue that.  Gender is the social construct side of things. You can make or whatever you want it to be, just dont be shitty about it because it matters to some people.   People conflate gender with sex a lot and vice versa. It’s just that simple.	1642628687.0	htdhnm3	t3_s7qp5s	t1_htc68vc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s7qp5s/choose_your_side/htdhnm3/

cbc2e5at	It’s like others are already saying. Gender DOES exist, but it’s not biological or innate like sex (there’s an exception there with intersex people who have both sex organs but that’s rare).   It exists as a social construct in the sense that being a female is defined by exhibiting femininity, and ideas of what counts as feminine changes depending on culture and social landscape. People who are born with male sex organs but identify with traits and prefer personal expression that is culturally seen as “feminine” (ex in modern US society: wearing dresses, makeup, having long hair) might choose to be trans and use she/her pronouns because they want to be seen by others as feminine, since that’s how they see themselves.  So gender identity has to do with self-expression but just because it’s a social construct doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist (ex: democracy is a social construct, obviously exists though).   But here’s the thing because I don’t think there are “unlimited” genders. There’s no point in identifying as some obscure gender you made up, because nobody is going to get it and it has no social meaning.  All humans expresses themselves in different ways that can fall anywhere along the axis of masculine/feminine and a bunch of other axes.   Identifying simply as “nonbinary” instead of a random other gender acknowledges that you’re just somewhere else outside of female/male. Which is something people can actually understand socially.  So yeah in my experience I would say most other liblefts I’ve spoken to don’t actually believe there’s unlimited genders, just an unlimited amount of ways an individual can express themselves, and therefore an unlimited amount of ways a person can express themselves outside of the gender binary of M/F (not by making up new genders though).	1642633075.0	htdsxbi	t3_s7ubqh	t3_s7ubqh	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s7ubqh/i_would_love_some_libleft_to_explain_this_i_just/htdsxbi/

95cmy	From my experience, people who identify religiously as pagan are atheists who both enjoy pagan aesthetic/culture and don't want to be identified as atheist.   For a lot of religious people (Christians and Islamic people especially), an atheist is scarier than someone who actively worships the devil because at least the "devil worshiper still has faith".

2fbt19c9	I too completely disagree with the taking down of his statue, but don’t act like that’s the reason why they’re trying to do it. Roosevelt was a race realist, a believer in pseudo-scientific racial hierarchy, and eugenics. I agree that this isn’t at all why he’s celebrated, and that these people’s efforts are misguided, but people don’t want his statue down because he was a capitalist or whatever you precisely meant by your comment (at least presumably not the majority). Unless you’ve seen something like this from people on Twitter or something, I believe my argument stands. Regardless I’d like to hear your take.  Edit: [This is the article I got it from,](https://amp.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/03/21/teddy-roosevelt-legacy-100-years), it gets worse as you read.  Edit 2: I believe I may also have misinterpreted this comment. Regardless, MLK had a much more nuanced view of racism which intersected with economics. For example, he was a socialist who believed in giving Black people reparations, something which I assume you’d be opposed to based on your flair (although correct me if I’m wrong). He believed that great wealth redistribution, and posited that special treatment for Black people may be necessary to achieve equality in America.	1642654716.0	htf55y7	t3_s84tzs	t1_htf17ov	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s84tzs/save_teddy/htf55y7/

em7yd74y	I view it as very similar to the condemnation of Israel in the Israel/Palestine problem.  A certain group of people classify any criticism of Israel THE STATE as antisemitic. This is then weaponised to delegitimise any valid criticism of Israel and its actions.  The same can be said here. If you criticise "black people" for their views on "Asian people", certain members of that group will try to delegitimise your criticism as 'racism'.  It's all about taking away the power of critics. I don't care what colour your skin is or where you're from, if you're being an arsehole I should be able to say you're an arsehole without being called a variety of -isms.	1642705434.0	hthubak	t3_s8mhey	t1_hth422c	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8mhey/black_people_cant_be_racist/hthubak/

7d2q844p	how are you failing to understand the idea that the price of the product a business sells and the overall profit it makes are inherently linked  imagine you're a pharma company. if you sell a common, regularly purchased, consistently demanded medication such as insulin for 200 bucks, you can make a nice wad of consistent reliable cheese.  this is good because the whole nature of your business is unstable; oftentimes you'll burn wads on medications that fail fda approval, or create medicines that are viable but lack enough patients to be commercially profitable, or spend years burning cash trying to cure aids... or whatever.  if you are arbitrarily told to sell the insulin for 3 dollars, you have way less money on hand to actually advance medical science and that is a net negative for humanity. since less shit gets solved.  point is, that consistent income source helps smooth out what is at its base a capital intensive and risky business. it enables a focus on less profitable diseases too. so overall i cant say its greed, more just the nature of the business model.	1642720026.0	htiu6hq	t3_s8tolo	t1_htitbwi	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8tolo/you_can_make_your_own_at_home_but_thats_not/htiu6hq/

c5bu71i3	That's exactly it. *We don't care. It doesn't matter to us, at all.* People can go and be whatever they want if they're not hurting anyone else, just don't interfere with me trying to do the same.   I view the constant references to trans-this and lgbt-that in media, social media, and work life as interference when it gets to a certain point. It's a subject that doesn't concern me and about which I am not in any way trying to cause anyone any grief or opposition. I won't be petitioning governments to outlaw it, and won't vote for a candidate who does.   But it doesn't need to be preached about everywhere, all the time. That's *definitely* not how you're going to win over the people that actively hate you (and I'd argue that some of the reasons people use to justify trans-hate are not positions they'll ever be reasoned or persuaded away from. There is such a thing as a lost cause). Worse, it's going to annoy the people who are already not interfering with you, and some of them might end up taking up some of those unreasonable positions I mentioned. Just like people don't like having other people's religions preached at them or forced into the content of nearly every piece of media, no one wants all this LGBT+ stuff permeating everything, either.	1642740306.0	htk4kjy	t3_s91jpy	t1_htk29qp	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s91jpy/one_of_my_favorite_subreddits/htk4kjy/

California has an state income tax from 1% to 12.3%, but the median income is 31,960 in california, which the tax rate is 1, 2 and 4%, and 31,017 in kansas which the tax rate is 3.10%, 5.25 and 5.70%%.  So the median income in California has an effective income tax rate of 2.32%.   The median income in Kansas has an effective income tax rate of 4.23%  So I guess it doesn't matter how public the information is if you can't do simple fucking maths does it.	1642757742.0	htkv8d6	t3_s8mu2l	t1_htiquax	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8mu2l/i_know_california_is_expensive_but_i_am_unable_to/htkv8d6/

Children are actually more at risk of a cytokine storm rather than the viruses symptoms, and the vaccine can also trigger that mechanism so imo kids shouldn’t take it at all.	1642763104.0	htl1y26	t3_s8tmuj	t1_htk2ezl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8tmuj/literally_literally_1984/htl1y26/

s4di83w	The only reason you imagine an individual spending big money to invent someone completely new is because of the patent system.  In a society without patents of course there's nothing stopping someone from copying your creation, but there is nothing stopping you from copying others to make your creation in the first place.  Imagine a world in which memes are copyrightable, then I suggested getting rid of that copyright, people would say "Okay, but what stops someone from reposting my meme after I spend big money to take stock photos, hire actors to do funny faces, and design my own fonts?"  You'd laugh and say "the only reason you need to take your own stock photos to make a meme is because you can't use other peoples memes!"  So rather than a bunch of people spending millions trying to reinvent the wheel, society builds upon itself incrementally.  That's usually what I say to convince normies to get rid of patents, the real reason I'm against them is because they violate property rights.	1642766105.0	htl656j	t3_s8tolo	t1_htl4mg2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8tolo/you_can_make_your_own_at_home_but_thats_not/htl656j/

cg98fx8v	Yes but the thing is, if the state allocates those things it will do it much less efficiently than if the market did. For example the number of empty homes increases when the state enact too much regulation on the housing market, because owners are less inclined to rent if they know they won't be able to evict their renters for example. And if they take control of the market entirely, they will just use the funds to pursue their own interests and control the population with that insanely powerful tool that would give them this control on the housing market, for example by forcing people where to live and forbidding them what they should buy, and generally being much less efficient at building and innovating stuff.  I wish capitalism could provide houses and food for everyone but it doesn't, it's a flawed system which doesn't guarantee a good life to anyone at all. But it's by far the less worse and most efficient system at allocating ressources and the very reason we're able to grow so much food and have so much good sanitary, water and electricity equipped houses in the first place. So if you really care about people having more homes and more food you should support more capitalism as unlike socialism it has proven times and times again it can lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and still does to this day.	1642769997.0	htlcl13	t3_s8sczt	t1_htiizny	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8sczt/reality_is_harsh/htlcl13/

7d2q844p	*laughs in american dollar*  anyway, show up to your local police station and tell them you're having issues with wildlife and trespassers/thieves on your property, and wish to apply for a private firearms license. they'll collect your info and, provided you aren't a radical chechnyan separatist or something, they'll approve it pretty quick. apparently they stopped issuing full-auto licenses in 2015 tho so that's a bummer. still tho poland's about equivalent to canada or a restrictive us state like cali, in terms of ease of access to firearms and what firearms you can get.  it's more of a rural thing i guess, for folks who are more 'on their own' in terms of defense and policing or have constant issues with trespassers.   also i'd argue i'm exploiting absolutely nothing; me coming from abroad and spending my money in poland is nothing but a net benefit to the polish people. i'm literally taking money out of the american/canadian/european economies and transferring it to the polish economy. if i came to set up a business i'd agree, that's exploitative, since i'm using the weight of my dollar-filled penis to crush local polish companies and take money from polish people. but if i'm just coming to *spend* money i don't see that as exploitative at all - would you say dubai is exploited by all the foreigners who come and spend money there?	1642780109.0	htlzv1z	t3_s8wnc0	t1_htlwapn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8wnc0/defend_which_european_country_is_the_best_and_why/htlzv1z/

It's like you're just an inch away from being self aware that your ideology is filled to the brim with dipshit racists and no social media company wants to give a platform to a bunch of racist scum. Maybe stop having such shitty thought leaders? Maybe stop having such aggressively unpopular opinions?  The largest, most watched media company in the US is literally so entrenched in the Republican, right wing party that the previous Republican administration would *phone them in and have them actively participate in the oval office.* When a bunch of redneck trash stormed the capitol, all those media pundits TEXTED the president at the time. They literally were sending "u up?" texts to the president. Every single one of your chucklefuck "the MSM is evil, don't ever participate with them!" thought leaders is a fucking *permanent guest*  like Glen Greenwald on Fox News.

g0t5z	it's not like anyone actually likes the US, or trust in their caring nature and principled foreign politics to make them see reason and do the right thing.      my first real job was in a warehouse during the summer, the guy I worked with hated people, kids, adults, anyone and everyone, when some classmates heard whom I was working with, they told me he used to be a hockey coach, and one of them said "the only time I ever saw him smile, was when a kid broke his arm during a game".   I hated working with him, he'd get angry every time I even remotely did something wrong and yell at me.   and I feared him more than the trashcompactor and the hobo-looking hippie politician who picked through our garbage for feed for his pigs.   then one monday morning I got a call from someone who was pissed off, during the weekend someone at the warehouse had accepted some stuff that was meant for another store, so they were out of stuff.   he yelled at me while I tried explaining that my department wasnt responsible for accepting deliveries during the weekend, and that he had to phone someone else and yell at them to get his stuff to his store were it belonged.   after being yelled at for a few minutes I had a epiphany, I said "hey, I'm just a temp, wait and you can talk to the guy who's responsible for my department.   I went over to my colleague and said "hey, I got someone on the phone who's angry because we accepted a delivery during the weekend that was meant for another store, and he wont listen to me when I tell him we're not responsible, can you explain it to him?"   my colleague ripped the phone from my hands and proceded to yell at the other guy for five minutes straight, I had to leave the room because he was so loud.   afterwards he came out with a smile (first and only time during 3 months) and said that the guy apologised for being rude to me and it wont happen again.         the US is that asshole. the asshole you're friendly and nice towards, just because you fear getting on his bad side.      no one trusts the US, we just fear the shit they'll put us through if we get on their bad side.	1642784743.0	htmcalf	t3_s8ofim	t3_s8ofim	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s8ofim/who_will_ever_want_to_ally_with_the_us_after_this/htmcalf/

When I had covid \`those plague-clothing doctors came over to check up on me (I was on quarantine obviously) and said people below the age of 30 rarely have serious symptoms and barely ever need any treatment at all.  Plus it’s literally common knowledge that the covid vaccine is not a sterilizing vaccine, and therefore it doesn’t stop the virus from being spread. No matter how many vaccine shots someone takes they can still get infected and spread the disease to others, which is what’s currently happening with my vaccinated acquaintances.

From my experience it’s way milder than a cold, and I’ve never heard of anyone getting vaccinated for a mild cold. Of course other people’s experiences can be very different.  But ever since I‘ve learned about Marek’s disease in poultry I think vaccines should be used way more responsibly than they are these days.

aaqpyyp	In high school the kids who rolled around smogging out their car and reeking of weed got pulled over and popped for possession at a stratospherically higher frequency than the kids who found quiet out of the way places and then smoked their joints or ripped a few bowls through their pipes before shoving anything that smelled back into a ziplock container and rolling with the windows down for a few minutes and maybe smoking a cigarette or two to disguise the smell.      To this day I still see morons rolling in some shitbox of a car blasting loud music while weed smoke is pouring out the barely open window. It's almost always the demographic that complains about how they get profiled and stopped by the police too much.

l3vxf	I suppose it depends on the trade/career you are in and everyone's situation is unique so what worked for me may not work for you.. I used my gi bill for my bachelor's and got a job in sales with great commission. I was pretty good at it and made decent money, but secretly hated dealing with clients (I've got a good poker face).   I'm a welder now and make more than what I would've made climbing up the corporate ladder for 15 years. I don't really have to deal with customers either except for presenting the final product. My advice would be go trade early, save that bank, and pay for college with your savings so you can move into a supervisor position down the road.   So for me, pros: am well compensated for my work and have less mental stress. The welding school also was exponentially cheaper than my bachelor's.   Cons: more physical labor and working in extreme weather conditions, sometimes 160ft in the air on a basket lift.	1642795690.0	htn63ss	t3_s9ch2l	t1_htmt2gx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s9ch2l/how_dare_you_not_being_a_racist/htn63ss/

2bo4uoj1	Ngl, every president after Wilson was just trash mostly, and I think I figured out why.  When one has a lot of power, one cannot simply just give it back, right? Wilson's Espionage and Sedition acts gave the Executive Branch way too much power, specifically under the Office of the President. Furthermore, Wilsonian Interventionism would set the precedent for American Foreign Policy for years.  All this puts so much power under the president and since it's enshrined in law, Congress and the Senate won't pass a law limiting that power since they too benefit from it in Party politics.  Basically, we're tempting every president with a very powerful position with no balances and checks that work substantially. The only way to stop this is to repeal the Espionage Act of 1917, Sedition Act of 1917, and the Patriot Act of 2001. The executive branch has too much power, period.	1642817372.0	htoq8yk	t3_s9pruw	t1_htomx18	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s9pruw/ill_gladly_keep_it_in_my_yard/htoq8yk/

You immediately assume the Right Wing deserves to be silenced in it's entirety because we're supposedly all "Nazis" and "Fascists", you do realize that average Conservatives and Libertarians exist and generally don't partake in that stuff correct? Not to mention, what counts as "Slurs" and "Bigotry" these days is a blurry line given all of the new minefields we have to traverse in this Brave and Stunning New World you Leftists have created.  Social Media doesn't just Ban and Silence legitimate bigots they target people who are right of center, and even centrists, to censor and silence opposing points of view.

imm26r1m	Beginning in the 1840s, negative assessments of the "Irish character" became more and more racialized. Irish people were considered brutish and (like blacks) were often compared to simians. The "Celtic physiognomy" was described as being marked by an "upturned nose \[and\] the black tint of the skin."\[86\]: 48         Labor historian Eric Arnesen wrote in 2001 that "the notion that the non-white Irish became white has become axiomatic" among many academics.\[87\] Whiteness scholar David Roediger has argued that during the early period of Irish immigration to the United States "it was by no means clear that the Irish were white" or "that they would be admitted to all the rights of whites and granted all the privileges of citizenship". However, Arnesen suggests that the Irish were in fact granted full rights and privileges upon naturalization and that early Irish immigrants "often blended unproblematically into American society"  &#x200B;  says they were considered 'celtic' not white but they looked just like whites so they blended in and no one noticed	1642832794.0	htpmmgt	t3_s9vjk7	t1_htpm7v6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s9vjk7/mussolini_calling_race_a_social_construct_before/htpmmgt/

cmd29agj	There are certain places whose independence doesn’t make geographical sense.    In my opinion…   Sri Lanka and the Maldives should be Indian.  Canada only exists, because the British were losing their colonial grip on the region, and split Canada into its own thing, just so that they wouldn’t revolt and join America. Greenland isn’t American or Canadian, because the danish think that having a colonial possession in the 21st century is cool, or something. **Both should be American, with Quebec maybe being given some special autonomy deal**	1642864161.0	htr0ed1	t3_sa2j43	t3_sa2j43	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sa2j43/comrade_stalin_or_bhrata_stalin/htr0ed1/

It’s going to happen two ways   1 - USA will become an auth dictatorship next election if trump wins / democracy will be damaged beyond all repair along with the USAs credibility. Checks and balances will be eroded to fit the party   2 - USA will become an auth dictatorship slowly over the next few years...more and more freedoms will be eroded away by the Democratic Party and eventually the USA credibility will be damaged beyond all repair (like above scenario)  Atleast one of these situations will happen imo, I don’t think it can be stopped now / the reality is you will watch it happening and your powerless to do anything about it.	1642868489.0	htralcl	t3_sa4toa	t3_sa4toa	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sa4toa/authleft_strikes_again/htralcl/

English is not my native language (don't live in a english speaking country to be fair)  Dad went to college eventually in his 50s to become a teacher but unsure if that counts since I was in my late teens by then.  Atleast as soon as i got 11-12 i biked or took the bus to school.  My parents were never married and seperated early.  I guess culturally christian but yeah not religious at all.  College was not strange but it was never expected of me.  I would say i'm not a military kid, father was in the military about 10 years before he got me.  Like alot of people i lost family. A somewhat close uncle and a grandfather i never met due to my father cutting contact with him.	1642869221.0	htrceb8	t3_s9msk3	t3_s9msk3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s9msk3/privilege_bingo_is_the_most_orange_libleft_thing/htrceb8/

If there are a bunch of D-voting people fleeing New York for Florida, and your claim is that it's due to housing costs...who do you think ran and continues to run the city, and are they not responsible for the policies that brought about such ridiculous housing costs?   Do you not realize that all these huge national issues the Dems pretend to care about (minorities, housing, free healthcare, gun control) are problems that occur mostly in the cities they run and have run for decades?

Maybe the adoption was more my mom's decision than my dad's, but my sister was friends with a few other adopted kids growing up and I specifically remember some of them claiming that their parents were pretty racist too.

7d2q844p	georgism is retarded  so, let's say tomorrow the government stops all other forms of taxation on all other assets and incomes, and levies all taxation purely upon land value. that tax is going to have to be eyewateringly high to cover all the other prior sources of tax revenue, right?  this causes a serious issue; landowners would simply sell their land for pennies on the dollar to escape the tax burden. equally, land as an asset would become unattractive to buyers, and literally everything else would become more attractive. why buy land taxed at 70% when you can buy stonks tax free? not only would it fuck house prices, it'd likely spark bubbles elsewhere.  the overall value of the land in the country would crater because of this, resulting in waaaaay less tax revenue for the government. 70% of fuck all is still fuck all.  not only this, but you'd have destroyed a significant portion of most people's wealth - their house - which would most likely lead to at the very least political consequences for the party doing it, if not full blown civil unrest.  the issue with georgism is it almost requires that we never did anything else *but* georgism. ltv is fantastically efficient, economically speaking, and doesn't impact the productive economy in the way other taxes do. but there's no way to transition from what we have now to a georgist model without causing wild market distortions.	1642894929.0	htt4o84	t3_saedie	t1_htszrfs	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/saedie/hehe_badly_drawn_colors_go_brrr/htt4o84/

"you need to wear a mask in public at" -inhales full lungful of air- "AAAAAAAAAAAALLLLL" -inhales again- "TIIIIIIIIIIIIIMESSSSSSSS". her own mask at this point was inflating like a fucking balloon under the force of her yelling.   i literally just rolled the window up and turned the music up bc i dont wanna make a whole scene. she stood there for like 5 more minutes, pretended to call bylaw on me with the lockscreen of her phone clearly visible as she put it to here ear, then fucked off in her dodge caravan that had 2 kids waiting in it.  i guess she genuinely didn't see the irony of accusing *me* of risking people, while she's coming up to me, telling me to roll down the window, and screaming at the top of her lungs. shit genuinely had me fucked up.	1642896776.0	htt97u4	t3_saftda	t3_saftda	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/saftda/noone_seems_to_actually_care_anymore/htt97u4/

7d2q844p	the issue there is it'd have to be done globally; the market for natural resources is a global one (land, at least conceptually, being more of a domestic market). any individual country that overtaxed the sale of its' resources would become uncompetitive in the global market. unless the whole rest of the world also taxes steel at 70%, you're just gonna be arbitrarily kneecapping your own industry. an individual country taxing resources will largely just be an economic benefit to other resource producing economies who don't tax as highly.  as i say, the issue with georgism is not one of logical continuity or theoretical plausibility, it's the fact it's near impossible to do in the real world without just fucking yourself over.   maybe at some point in the future when the auths have formed a world government, taxing resources could theoretically work. until then you're just gonna get undercut by *literally anywhere else that has the same resources as you*	1642897305.0	httaies	t3_saedie	t1_htt8fzp	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/saedie/hehe_badly_drawn_colors_go_brrr/httaies/

7d2q844p	ya, someone pointed out to me at the time, the fact she *pretended* to call bylaw rather than actually doing it shows she knows she's in the wrong, and believes a reasonable observer from the bylaw department would *also* know that.  she's just using anything she can as an excuse to vent and express control over something, before she gets back in her car with her kids and drives back to a life she probably hates. she knows it's unreasonable, but her right to vent apparently outweighs my right to smoke a cigarette and bump hardbass in peace	1642898019.0	httcayj	t3_saftda	t1_htt9rgg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/saftda/noone_seems_to_actually_care_anymore/httcayj/

We always wanna either be the rich guys in silk slippers looking down at the barbarians, or the rugged people not spoiled and made weak by lavish luxuries. Long as a group can look down on another for something stupid to lift themselves up they will because it makes small shitty people feel big, most of humanity is small shitty people that don’t do anything worth being proud of so they are proud of their group that they did nothing to be a part of but be born into. At least religious groups uphold beliefs to be a part of their group that looks down on others (except the fakers).	1642898203.0	httcrw7	t3_sa1fsm	t3_sa1fsm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sa1fsm/the_duality_of_libleft/httcrw7/

7d2q844p	i'm in canada, if you slot a dude here theres 100% gonna be an investiation no matter what, even if he had a weapon drawn or whatever.  reason being you have to store weapons here in a locked safe separate from the ammo. in some cases you can display it on a wall with a trigger lock, but keeping a readily accessible firearm on hand is a big no-no. there's also the concept of 'appropriate force', meaning you essentially can't escalate your self-defense beyond the initial threat. so if an unarmed dude breaks in and you stab him, the government will argue your use of force was inappropriate since the intruder didn't have a knife. same with firearms. unless the dude had a gun himself, and you had a real good reason for having a loaded firearm on you at that moment, you'd 100% get convicted of something.  tldr even if you were seconds from being murdered and shot the dude dead, you'd be facing firearms charges here by default.  on a completely unrelated note who's down for a greencard marriage	1642905119.0	httsti8	t3_sahhzf	t1_httqjk5	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sahhzf/another_point_for_possession_of_guns/httsti8/

Your argument has devolved from “Fauci is God-King of us all; he shall bestow upon us what we must think,” to “b-b-but you can’t be the homogay, you’re just a loonie who hates **OUR LORD AND SAVIOR**.”  Imagine devolving to the 1950s and acting like a gay guy has a mental disorder because you disagree with him.

Generally parents who will sell their child to traffickers aren’t going to accept them back very easily…  there is a lot of propaganda around adoption these days that leads many adopted to believe they were torn from their mother's arms, no other way could it be.   That's almost never been the case since the church's grip on society loosened in the 1970s.    Generally if you are adopted; 90% chance your bio parents really didnt want to be parents, or were the abusive/toxic types you wouldn't want to be close with.   That being said: in countries like China, there is a fair chance of stolen from your parents, child trafficking for adoption is a very real thing there.

If it's a government law prohibiting the woman from terminating the pregnancy the government should provide financial aide. Not the guy who's condom could have broke, or who was raped. Also it's implying that being pregnant and having a child incurs extra costs, which the government already agrees with due to child support payments... but what if the father has died, or moves country.

Laying blame on people for acts that happened before they were even alive is some "sins of the father / generational sin" bullshit.

mgsghd	It is a generational divide more than an ethnic divide, imo. I'm white, but I'm a Catholic in Texas who married into a first generation Mexican family so I'm very familiar with the Latin American community. The older ones - especially that immigrated themselves - are very socially conservative and have a ridiculously strong "pull yourself up" work ethic, but it is a mistake to assume that automatically translates to economic conservatism and a willingness to vote Republican. I'm not a guy to shout "racism" all the time, but I've seen them experience it myself on a number of occasions. I don't think you'll be surprised to learn that the people who walk up to them and say things like "stop speaking Spanish, this is America" or "go back to your own country" are generally not bleeding heart liberals. If you think that doesn't affect their view of conservatives in this country - you are wrong.  As far as the younger members of the Latin American community, they've mostly already been absorbed by America's decadent consumer culture and, as such, are quite liberal socially and fiscally. This is moreso the case if they have managed to get through college. They hang onto some of their cultural inheritances, but readily dispose of anything incompatible with typical American leftism, like standard gender roles and overt religiosity.	1642950363.0	htvwzcw	t3_sapq28	t3_sapq28	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sapq28/what_have_i_done/htvwzcw/

Should the woman not want the child, but the man does, he is to assume full responsibility upon birth if the child, and foot all health related bills for the pregnancy.  However, should the woman want the child and the man doesn’t, the man must procure the funds to foot the bill for the abortion, effectively saying “here’s my money for the abortion, I’m done here”. If the woman proceeds with the birth, the father will not be on the birth certificate and will not be liable for any child support since it was the woman’s choice to proceed.	1642959346.0	htwjia6	t3_sapbze	t1_htvg4qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sapbze/lets_do_our_thing/htwjia6/

c5bu71i3	>Landlords, high demand + deliberately low supply of housing/apartments  ...and who is in charge of regulating these things in Dem-controlled cities? Damn, it's like all of the Left "gotcha" moments are just them failing to take their thinking to the logical conclusion and just blaming things on a symptom and not the root cause....  &#x200B;  >Most of the US population lives in metro areas, and Dems are a big tent party. The tent isn't so big outside the city.  And again, it is in these concentrated cesspools of socialism and welfare that crime is rampant, minorities gun each other down, obese fucks stuff their faces with fast-food all day every day, and rent is so high that people are living in closets and/or squalor (or fleeing to better places that aren't run by Democrats). These places are run and controlled by Democrats. It seems that their policies favor overcrowding, poverty, gang violence and all the other negative things that they pretend are issues for the entire country. They posture and virtue signal based on those issues, and then spend decades doing nothing besides making the problems worse.   So, please try again to explain how the problems caused by Democrat policies in places where they've been in charge for decades are not in fact the fault of the Democrats and their supporters and ideology, but can be blamed on politicians from other states and cities who have no power over what happens in those cities, and explain how those cities are still somehow "better" than the places their residents are fleeing to.	1642959561.0	htwk2vp	t3_sa4toa	t1_htvfo3i	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sa4toa/authleft_strikes_again/htwk2vp/

abza7dxs	My head hurts there is no way anyone can really be mad at her for stating an obvious ass point right? That ain’t racism, I’ve seen real racism in my life I’m half white trash half Mexican from a ghetto ass city in middle Georgia, my grandads brother died in prison for murdering a black dude in a bar fight with a logging chain in the 80s because he came into the wrong bar and talked back, that’s real racism. I got to hide the fact I like black girls from my mom or she’ll tell me she “raised me better than that” but she doesn’t even see how it’s racist, that’s racism. Fighting racism isn’t trying to insulate people from objective fact to make them feel better, it’s telling people the truth and raising kids not to think anyone is better than anyone that were all people. Definitely telling all white people they’re evil for how the world was a hundred years ago isn’t doing shit but making more average white people more defensive and pushing them further and further out from moderate positions. I fuck with a everyone until they prove me wrong and give respect to everyone until they do something wrong and in return I’m accepted by 99% of people sure there’s some shitty people out there but why can’t we just accept people are people and gtfo over it. I grew up with a lot of whites who lived in a shitty singlewide trailer with 3 different generations of people and you can’t tell me a middle class black kid from a good home is worse off than 14 year old Johnny T smoking a bowl of meth with his own great grandma and that’s some shit I’ve seen with my own eyes and what’s crazy is it’s mostly upper middle class white “socialists” living on daddy’s credit card who demonize white people more than anyone I don’t get it	1642962673.0	htws8v3	t3_sas96y	t3_sas96y	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sas96y/cant_believe_im_saying_this_but_based_former/htws8v3/

2uywjpui	> NPR has degenerated into an "end justifies the means" racial upheaval/asset redistribution propaganda outlet in recent years.  It is true that you can't speak of white supremacy without being accused of spreading leftist propaganda.   It's interesting how after listening to NPR all these years they've spoken about a multitude of issues from current events, but you depict them based on one of them. I'm guessing you heard a perspective story you didn't like so you've resorted to labeling the whole thing as propaganda.  I would argue further but for you to say that leftist intellectuals get "kicked out" clearly shows that you follow twitter politics more closely than reality. You think a leftist idealogue is going to read the hate they get from SJWs on the internet and just "become" reactionary? You're argument is just your personal bias of what the intellectuals you like are doing.	1642975498.0	htxpecy	t3_s4pocv	t1_htw7v3a	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s4pocv/what_happened_to_ethan/htxpecy/

7d2q844p	i'm of a different opinion  corporations are little more than voluntary agreements between individuals. say i'm making bacon sandwiches alone, and selling them. then you come along and say 'hey, that looks fun, can i help make bacon sandwiches with you for a cut of the take?' and i agree. we just formed a company.   now, say our bacon sandwiches are real fucking good, and we get people saying 'hey can i sell bacon sandwiches in my own town using your brand and ingredients, and pay you a royalty?'. if we agree, our company grows larger.  repeat this 1000 times, we're a large corporation now. everyone in the country is munching our sandwiches, we're making money, all's good.  i don't see conceptually how the government has a right to step in and limit our company's growth and the voluntary interactions of our staff at that stage - or any stage. if someone comes along with better bacon sandwiches that are produced at lower unit cost and vended more efficiently, rational consumers will choose that product instead of ours. if that doesn't happen and we maintain our growth rate, that is the free market telling us our bacon sandwich is better than the other alternatives. we deserve to be rewarded for providing consumers with a decent sandwich, and we deserve to scale the business as far as the market will allow. that is the *definition* of free market. if you're intervening in corporate growth because you personally decided a corporation is 'too big', then that is an expressly anti free-market action. like, how do we even decide what is 'too big'?  now, i agree that corporations shouldn't wield outsize political power relative to their size, but that's more of an issue with the lobbying system than corporations themselves. of course, even without lobbying it is in the interests of a government to protect the corporations that form the backbone of their economy, but i think lobbying is what pushes this past 'government looking after the economic interests of the nation' and into 'blatantly paying for influence' territory. to say corporations should naturally wield no influence is just ignorance, though - no government that intended to remain in power would completely ignore the plight of the companies that form its' economy. without those companies, the country's people would endure suffering through job loss, capital destruction, and so forth. lobbying's a deeply imperfect solution to corporate representation in government, though.  i also agree with the idea of banning anticompetitive practices and market manipulation, since these are anti free-market. i have no particular reason to care about the *size* of a corporation, so long as they earned their size in a fair and free market.	1642979735.0	hty0jeu	t3_sb0pzu	t1_htxph0f	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb0pzu/misconceptions_of_the_political_compass_made_by/hty0jeu/

Can you give me one example of a rich anarchist?  we haven't extensively applied the concept of an anarchist system to the real world; closest example of course being somalia. what's interesting about this one solitary example of modern 'anarchy' is that the economy of somalia grew faster without a government than with one. sure, nobody there is 'rich' by western standards, but they have become rich*er.* which i guess somewhat disproves your whole point that governments are required for wealth to exist.	1642980741.0	hty3a6e	t3_sb68cv	t1_htxx5j0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb68cv/still_new_to_politics_but_i_think_i_understand/hty3a6e/

s4di83w	It says in the article that a girl went to Mexico about bought a 6 month supply for $100, that's $200 per year whereas in the US it would cost her $2,600 for 12 months, and that's $2,600 *through her insurance*, without insurance she might end up paying even higher amounts.  So what's the difference between Mexico and USA? They are both capitalist countries, both have to pay for insulin, I'm pretty sure neither government even subsidizes insulin.  Just go to Mexico, buy the insulin for $100 and send it back and sell it for $110...oh wait! The US government will stop you because it isn't "FDA approved"!  I'm really at a loss for how you cannot see how this is a US government problem.

7d2q844p	i think we're defining anarchy differently, which is causing us to argue at cross-purposes.  if i'm correct, you see anarchy as an internal belief system. like, to your mind an anarchist society is one where each individual makes conscious decisions to actively reject power structures of all kind.  to my mind, however, anarchy is a *system* \- or, more accurately, the absence of an established governmental system. the reason i referenced drug cartels is chiefly because they operate in an environment where the government has little ability to impose its' laws upon the people, making it at least conceptually similar to anarchy in that if you wanna do something, the government can't really stop ya.  anarchy to me is as simple as 'a laissez-faire state with no established government'. that's why i refenced somalia, since it was in that situation for a long time. the *people* in the anarchist state are by definition free to do whatever they want - including organizing themselves.  i guess you would argue a group of bandits with a 'head bandit' and subordinate 'assistant bandits' are not anarchists since they have succumbed to a power structure, whereas i would argue that banditry itself is an anarchist action regardless of the bandits' heirarchy. banditry is at its' base threatening violence against people who don't comply with demands, which is anarchist in the sense that it rejects a governmental monopoly on violence, which is a fundamental feature of most if not all governed systems.  tl;dr we both mean different things when we say 'anarchy'	1642982851.0	hty8giq	t3_sb68cv	t1_hty56ay	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb68cv/still_new_to_politics_but_i_think_i_understand/hty8giq/

7d2q844p	unpopular opinion here: the current situation with the taliban is the closest thing to peace and stable governance the afghans have had for 20 years.  for the first time in 20 years, america isn't all up in afghanistan's shit committing atrocities and blowing stuff up. the taliban rose very quickly and fairly bloodlessly to fill the power vacuum, which is kind of a miracle all things considered. often times countries in such a position will just descend into total fucking chaos as various groups fight for control, nad the bloodshed would be far more intense.  the taliban are in a good position to create prosperity, if that's the direction they choose to go. my personal theory is they're seeking legitimacy to put themselves in a position where they can transition to something akin to saudi arabia's model of governance.   it's facile to imagine the taliban actively desire war and bloodshed. i'm making no statement of sympathy here, but i can't imagine those taliban who've been losing friends, family members and so on for 20 years are keen to continue the bloodshed now they've achieved their goals and taken back what they percieve to be 'their' country.  all logic would indicate now is the time for the taliban to rebuild itself as a modern islamic country with a gulf-state model of governance. it is my sincere hope they go this direction, as opposed to continuing pointless violence.  as for isis, i feel like the taliban are setting themselves up as a kind of 'ally' against isis. the threat of isis once again destabilizing afghanistan may in fact be a bargaining chip the taliban can leverage to gain the aforementioned legitimacy they are seeking.	1642985000.0	htydnr2	t3_sb870i	t3_sb870i	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb870i/and_the_cycle_of_civilians_dying_goes_on/htydnr2/

7d2q844p	i think i worded the quote in point number 2 badly. what i mean by 'protect the corporations that form the economy' is that corporations have no voting representation in government and could easily be fucked over by policy they have no say on, which is a lose-lose for both the corporation itself and the economy of the country. this is why lobbying was created in the first place.   personally i feel like, since corporations have personhood in the legal sense, they should be entitled to the same representation in government. this simultaneously removes the need for lobbying and gives companies a right to defend their interests and protest policy that would negatively impact their ability to do business. it also levels the playing field in the sense that the local convenience store's vote counts the same as amazon's.  acting like corporations aren't fundamentally necessary for countries to function is ignorant. we need jobs and economic activity and growth, and in order to do that efficiently corporations need a mechanism to defend their interests that isn't just pay to win.  i'm not saying the government should bail out shitty companies or engage in preferentialism, i'm just saying there needs to be *consideration* given towards the effect of policy on corporations, since the state of the economy is directly tied to the standard of living of the people.   i also don't really see the point of specific regulations on the environment. if i dump cyanide in the local reservoir, i'd be arrested. similarly if a ceo dumps toxic waste in the water supply, he should also be arrested. i only care about environmental issues so far as they cause direct harm to humans, and at that point we already have laws for that. as for advertising/ safety regulations, i guess i'm a darwinist about shit like that	1642986149.0	htygeu2	t3_sb0pzu	t1_htycx5u	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb0pzu/misconceptions_of_the_political_compass_made_by/htygeu2/

7d2q844p	the issue with indirect harm is it's impossible to really quantify. if i walk by you smoking a cig i've technically caused you some measure of indirect harm through inhalation of smoke particles. when i start my straightpiped car near you, you're inhaling an amount of carbon monoxide from the exhaust. are either of these sufficient direct harm to justify legal action? probably not, they caused you no direct harm - sure, your body had to deal with a foreign particulate, but you suffered no lasting damage.  that's my point. if a company's venting toxic fumes into the atmosphere in such a quantity that people are developing asthma or other respiratory issues as a consequence, that should be treated legally the same as if i released poison gas around people. there's no need to regulate it and specify a ppm where fumes become illegal; that costs tax money for a government bureacracy to manage. better to just expose the company to legal liability for any damage to humans and make them spend the money to figure out the maximum quantity they can vent without getting sued or having their executives arrested.  it's fundamentally not the fumes we care about is it? vent all the fumes you want miles from anyone or anything. it's when those fumes fuck us up.  i guess there's the argument that only doing so much as is necessary to prevent us from getting physically sick will lead to long-term degradation of the environment, and you're probably right. i guess my theory is that eventually, if the long term effects get so bad, they'll start eating into profit margins and become economically viable problems to solve.	1642988919.0	htyn1an	t3_sb0pzu	t1_htykhnr	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb0pzu/misconceptions_of_the_political_compass_made_by/htyn1an/

7d2q844p	or alternatively, humans could just do what they've always done and *adapt to new economic conditions.*  in agricultural economies before the invention of tractors, laborers were paid cheaply to work the fields. a lot of people were employed this way. then tractors come along and all of a sudden less human labour is needed to work a field. those displaced laborers - a significant sum of the population in agricultural economies - did not revolt. *they just learned how to drive, and maintain, the tractors, and charged higher sums for this skilled labour.* some even created ancillary businesses serving these now more highly-paid laborers and their enriched employers.  this is like lesson 1 of how economies grow. low-paid labour is displaced by innovation, producing greater efficiency and more jobs with higher salaries, leading to a healthier middle class and greater economic growth.  the problem is, despite intense market pressure to do so, a significant proportion of the labour market appears unwilling to adapt in this way. mcdonald's fired you from the 15/hr job and replaced you with a robot? literally just cuck them by learning about hydraulics or coding, then charging them 50/hr to maintain that robot. everyone wins.   fundamentally the only way to increase the value of your labour is to invest time into learning a skill that is essential to the economy. also, you can still make 15/hr in construction or whatever if you don't wanna learn to maintain robots and just wanna do manual labour. that is, of course, until construction companies design robots for that too.	1642990455.0	htyqpoj	t3_sb9f0f	t1_htyoc54	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb9f0f/generation_gap/htyqpoj/

7d2q844p	not really.  what we're really saying here is 'unskilled labour is rapidly becoming near-worthless'.  that doesn't mean all those displaced workers just do nothing, though. maybe they become chefs at upscale restaurants - just because we can automate mcdonalds doesn't mean we can automate complex cuisine. equally, perhaps they will learn the skills to maintain and program the robots.   automation is actually a good thing. it effectively drives up the average salary by forcing the labour market to invest time into the acquisition of skills. if you can't make a living flipping burgers, you'll be motivated to learn more advanced culinary techniques, or learn about robots, which in turn gives you the ability to command higher prices for your labour. this is literally how economies grow and mature. over time, the workforce becomes more skilled and recieves a higher average wage as it transitions to a post-industrial economy. sure there's always short-term pain, but long-term automation is a net economic benefit  tldr people will adapt, as they always have.	1642992363.0	htyvfup	t3_sb9f0f	t1_htyscsx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb9f0f/generation_gap/htyvfup/

7d2q844p	this is a dumb argument, you can't automate literally everything.  the thing nobody gets is sure, the trend is the overall number of full-time jobs in post industrial economies is decreasing. and will continue to decrease. that doesn't at all imply less *people* would be employed.  imagine, if you will, an entirely automated world where the only 'jobs' are in industries that require human thought, or provide human interaction as their core selling point. in that world, perhaps you could do this work for 3 months, earning enough in that time to live comfortably for a full year.  this creates a situation where 4 people can live from one 'full time job'.  this is how i see the economy progressing - for some reason we're all psychologically addicted to the idea of 40-hour full-time working patterns but there's no real economic sense behind it - it's a valid metric we can adjust to affect the labour market.	1642993711.0	htyz0ky	t3_sb9f0f	t1_htywcez	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb9f0f/generation_gap/htyz0ky/

tzaizmg	Congratulations on being so absolutely stunning and brave; you've now endured a day in the life of somebody with a mildly conservative opinion in the shit-pits of modern social media.  >You don't seem to understand the concept of "the exception proves the rule"  You keep spouting that line.  It does not mean what you think it means.  > the mods have had to make multiple posts asking the community to stop kneejerkingly-downvoting leftist posts so this place doesn't become as stale and one-note as the default political subs.  Got any sources for those?  Got any actual response to the same facts I pointed out the last time you trotted out the last time you brought up this argument, that the sub's metrics absolutely do not support your viewpoint at all?  >I didn't say anything about every right-winger being a racist strawman, I said that right-wing communities often turn into places that tolerate bigotry.   No.  Left-wing communities can only, and ever, thrive on immense censorship, so the only place people with these views can ever post naturally become right-wing due to their disinclination towards censorship.  >PCM is a perfect example of this, by the ways. The ironic N-word usage, any topic about trans people or Romani people, etc; any place that is open to you people turns into this. It doesn't matter if every right-winger does it or not.  The only person you can logically blame for this is you, yourself.  Your quadrant(s) are the ones that have refused to debate or acknowledge the points the opposition makes.  Your quadrants are the ones that ruthlessly censor all opposition, pretending it does not exist, rather than actually proving their points wrong.  The fuck did you THINK would happen?  You have the absolute fucking gall to put on airs as if you're ANY better, while your most highly-regarded entertainment outlets shovel out shit that dehumanizes whites and right-wingers as routinely as anything Nazi Germany ever produced.  You fucking hypocrites.  >You keep going on and on about how I want to be coddled, but the exact opposite is true. I come here to have genuine conversations with the full expectation that I will be downvoted. That's the nature of willingly participating in circlejerks. I enjoy talking with people who disagree with me.  If that were the case, you would be ready and willing to acknowledge the massive hypocrisy of the modern left.  The fact that you clearly aren't ready to do so shows how genuine your sentiment is.  >My issue with this place becoming more and more of a circlejerk isn't about me wanting to be coddled, it's about the spirit of the sub dying.   The spirit of the sub will die - not because of the right, but because none of the modern left's ideology can ever survive in an environment of free debate.  This is why sites like Reddit routinely devolve into disgusting authoritarian shells of what they once were.  >The moment people don't using downvotes rather than their words to express disagreement, the moment the dominant narrative becomes so overbearing that this place essentially becomes another libertarian safespace, is the second PCM dies.  You're completely right about this, and I totally agree with you.  The problem is that Reddit's staff and moderators are hard line aligned with the most extreme views the Left quadrants espouse, and they have repeatedly tried to force the rest of the site around to their point of view.  You put on all these airs of being so much better than your political contemporaries.  You are not better than they are.  Your ideology, like theirs, cannot survive a fucking hot second under any serious scrutiny.  No school of conservative thought that survives today was permitted to evolve under cover of darkness, and that's largely because of people like you.  Think about that the next time you're surprised by the sheer vitriol of the arguments headed your way.	1642998743.0	htza629	t3_s7vbc3	t1_htuzp42	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/s7vbc3/when_youre_used_to_privilege_equality_feels_like/htza629/

7d2q844p	yes but they are not entitled to jobs, people really be complaining how they can't make more than 15/hr, when they left school at 16 and have absolutely no marketable skills.  like, yeah, you have to increase your value by attaining skills, if you want to earn higher salaries. and it's not like it even necessarily costs anything to gain those skills.  i was a car salesman for a while. got hired with no experience and no relevant qualifications, just because i was confident and displayed the qualities they wanted. literally just learned on the job for a week and got the hang of the process and shit. already after 1 month i was making more than someone flipping burgers.   i literally challenge anyone who wants to get more money, to send applications to every dealership in your area. i can say for sure at least one of them will give you a shot, and you will make decent middle class money if you grind. plus, it's one of the easiest industries to rise to management, then transition to another industry with higher pay.  that's just one example but there are plenty. you don't need money to acquire valuable skills, but expecting career money for burger flipper effort is just unrealistic.	1642999247.0	htzb5w4	t3_sb9f0f	t1_htz9l5l	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb9f0f/generation_gap/htzb5w4/

7d2q844p	but that's not what i'm saying, i'm not saying you can *determine* the value of something from its objective characteristics, just that those objective characteristics give it some kind of non-zero value in a broad sense. it's up to the market (i.e. you, and all the other participants) to decide what that price is at a given time and place.  intrinsic value is used, for example in the stock market. if i calculate how much the assets and cashflows of a company are worth, i can establish the intrinsic value of a share of that company. if the actual stock of the company trades above the intrinsic value, we can infer that investors believe there is some additional non-quantifiable value - maybe future potential or consistent innovation - since there must be a justification for that price differential.  the existence of intrinsic value doesn't mean that the intrinsic value dictates the price. price and value are different, insert warren buffet quote etc.  this applies equally to the labour market. the intrinsic value of a burger flipper is not zero, but it's also likely not minimum wage either, it's somewhere in the middle. it's just illegal to pay that little.  you can't cite extreme examples that barely if ever occur in the real world and use it as an argument that nothing has value	1643001179.0	htzervd	t3_sb9f0f	t1_htzbfeo	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb9f0f/generation_gap/htzervd/

6hxnj	It's more akin to William Blake's old verse:  *"I must create a system, or be enslaved by another man's. I will not reason and compare: my business is to create."*  The human mind since time immemorial populates itself with its own ingenious creations and fantasies, inwardly and outwardly. The world, the mind, and their respective movements turn us around endlessly, leaving no foothold. We're caught in a thunderstorm with our flaccid dicks in our hands.  In the vacuum of ideology (*ideation writ large*, ultimately) rests the autonomous spark of human ingenuity and creation which very few face in their lifetime. The cradle of genius, the still point of the turning world.  In effect, it inverts the universe and the being therein. The fresh initiate assumes their throne--they grasp the earth and turn it about themselves, the ground trembles beneath them. In the company of others, their knees bend. How can they bear the sight of a true man?	1643002515.0	htzh5c9	t3_sb489x	t1_htze912	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sb489x/i_wonder_why_hes_depressed/htzh5c9/

8mw50n0t	>On the one hand, too many folks adopt outside their culture for brownie points, only to leave the child confused and feeling detached from their own people.  International adoption kind of weirds me out sometimes. Like why go all the way to the other side of the world to pull some kid out of their culture when you could just go to a local orphanage?   I come from a family heavily involved in international adoption and I'm speaking from experience when I say that a lot of the people involved are creeps. My parents, who have two internationally adopted children, no longer recommend it because they've grown to view the international adoption industry (and that's what it is, an industry) as no more than human trafficking minus the sexual stuff (and even that happens sometimes).   There is sort of an international adoption community. Parents who adopt kids from other countries all seem to hang out together, and from my experience, a lot of them can be really fucking weird about it. It's like they treat the kids they adopt like different dog breeds or something, like certain "breeds" have more value or something. If you manage to adopt an Asian kid they'll be super impressed because "those ones are really expensive" (I have literally heard this sentence before). They'll show them off their children like "this is my Chinese one, and this is my Kenyan one, and this is my Vietnamese one..." It's like they're collectors or something. They gotta catch em all lol. It can be kind of gross.   Then there are some who aren't as weird and creepy about it, but just have the so-called "white savior complex" which can get *really* annoying.	1643008897.0	htzr1jj	t3_sbbg7d	t1_htyyia0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbbg7d/libleft_or_authright/htzr1jj/

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

But I'll start with the fact that the second amendment actually mentions nothing whatsoever about SPORTING purposes. The law was written in the context of the right to bear arms such that those arms would be used to murder a future tyrannical American government. When that law was written they specifically referred to the full military arsenal, not just small arms.  Private citizens owned and operated not just every type of military rifle, musket, and pistol, but also every type of artillery, mortars, and rockets.

I'm using it to describe low IQ reactionary takes from old fashioned conservatives that are willfully ignorant of the world and trans people specifically.  Do you think RooshV has autism?https://theprovince.com/technology/internet/roosh-v-the-pro-masculinity-man-has-been-found-and-its-claimed-he-lives-in-his-moms-basement  Is this the guy you're defending right now? My description matches him but you seem to take issue with it.   It's almost like if I was referring to someone with autism, I would have given them a description that closely matched those with autism, or I would have just said they had autism. And honestly I didn't even describe a neckbeard all that well. Since I didn't mean either of these things, I didn't describe them. Just because you think of them a certain way doesn't mean that other people do.  I've met a lot of people on the autism spectrum, including my brother, that are nothing like what I described in my first comment, but growing up I met a ton of teenagers/preteens that meet the description exactly. Hell it could be describing any bigoted person in their mid twenties that doesn't have enough money to move out of their parent's house, and practices poor grooming habits. This doesn't mean none of those people are autistic though, autistic people don't have a monopoly on poor grooming habits and basement dwelling, that's a pretty wide open space. Autism is a pretty wide open space too, people with autism are every bit as varied as everyone else (referring to lifestyle). They're people like you and me after all.  Maybe watch that college humor sketch where nobody lets Raf pay for anything because they assume he's too poor due to him being black (even though he works in the same office as them). In an effort to be considerate, his coworkers overcompensate and end up stereotyping him and being hurtful.   And also, I don't support transphobia, even if it is coming out of an autistic person. It's wrong no matter who is doing it, which is why I'm not sure how to respond to the rest of your comment which seems to be a tangent about a terf association with autistic men? I didn't know about this to be honest.  This is a tangent to a tangent that had no business being a tangent in the first place. Yeah, terfs are bad and all trans people are valid (even if they happen to be a sloppy misogynistic basement dweller, or have autism).	1643027390.0	hu0f39k	t3_satg72	t1_htzkb1v	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/satg72/based_authright/hu0f39k/

i784cdwl	Right. First, let me state that English is not my main language, so I apologize for any mistakes or strange choices of words.  I don't think an actually good man will ever start doing that. People who end up falling into addictions and becoming violent are always broken people from the start in one way or another, and you will quickly notice if you simply pay attention.  There are a lot of things you should look out for in how he treats other people, how he speaks of them, his lifestyle choices, but the most important thing to look out for is: See how the guy treats his mom. That's literally all you need to do. He **WILL** treat you like he treats her, once he starts taking you for granted, so make sure he treats her well.   My father always treated his mom well, and lo and behold, despite the fact that he has a VERY painful background (born in extreme poverty even by the standards of the third-world shithole that is my homeland, had to get a job at age 7, has 3 brothers but one of them is dead and another is a drug addict), and despite the fact that he is a military veteran, and despite the fact that he has always had more things to be stressed about than almost anyone (has received death threats from an actual terrorist group, it's a very long story), he and my mom have been married for around 30 years, and not once has he ever raised his hand against her. Not once did he ever raise his hand against me either. Even the very few times he has gotten drunk, he never did.   Alcohol doesn't magically make people violent, it just removes inhibitions. Stress is not an excuse to strike your wife or kids and good people will not do that no matter how hard their life gets. Get a highly virtuous man with no violent tendencies, just like my father. Choose well, not only for your own sake, but for the sake of your future children too.	1643036328.0	hu0wttg	t3_sbd6vw	t1_hu0tngb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbd6vw/retvrn_to_tradition/hu0wttg/

2uywjpui	I'm not entirely sure the definition of intellectual you are looking for. A leftist who speaks of leftist ideaology vs the right? Do I really need to name names to show they exist? Besides, current politics from the right are so far from mainstream that anyone who analyzes anything without pandering to "Marxist conspiracy taking over politics" would be considered a leftist.   The truth is the left is constantly trying to solve major issues that affect every part of the country from economic inequality, healthcare, the environment, gun violence... everyone of these issues are "regular headlines".   You know what the most regular healines are for the right currently? White supremacy and what the left says about it. Gender politics and what the left says about it... The right talks more about how the left is obsessed with these issues more than the left *itself* talks about them. Ironic isn't it? Now, fairly so you are going to want proof of this. I invite you to listen to NPR, and pay attention to how often white supremacy is mentioned. Current events... Ukraine, voting rights bill, stock market... you'll have to wait a bit to get to what you want to hear. And when it is mentioned, try to listen to what that person is saying instead of writing it off as a "Marxist approach". And also, something that might confuse conservatives, just because you hear a Black person talking about their experience on the radio, doesn't mean they are talking about white supremacy.

The average age of "COVID-related" (not even COVID-causal) deaths in the US is roughly the same as the average age of natural death in the US. The lockdowns caused far more measurable destruction than the virus itself.  You lived through a bunch of karens and emilys who need their phones taken away.	1643038961.0	hu139pe	t3_sbnc1r	t3_sbnc1r	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbnc1r/based_john_lewis/hu139pe/

1h6oc57z	This is a good point. I attended a Catholic high school with mandatory religion classes and even at a Catholic school they basically taught us that most of the Old Testament basically isn’t real. Some of it is (there’s historical evidence and accounts for some of the people and events) but it’s mostly just stories to teach lessons and establish the history of the Christian faith. They called it fundamentalism, which is the belief that these stories are fundamental to the faith but not necessarily true. Literalism, which many Christians do believe, is that everything in the Bible happened. Im not judging anyones faith but some choose to believe that.   We were taught that stories like Adam and Eve and Noah’s Ark and even the creation of the world aren’t true. My school didn’t try to convince us that our modern understanding of how life came to be aren’t true. In fact we were taught all about things like evolution and the origins of the universe.   My mom, the most devout Christian and religious person I know, actually came to me one day and asked me about what we were being taught about the Bible. She asked if they were teaching us that Old Testament isn’t necessarily fact. Not in a disapproving way though. She’s read the Bible multiple times and still does every day. It seemed like she was starting to question if it could actually be true, and if so, why was God such a dick. Basically. (He tends to be a real asshole in the Old Testament.) She seemed relived to find out it was okay to not take the Old Testament literally.  The New Testament however, almost all Christians believe to be true. Whether or not you believe it is up to you, but the New Testament is much more valuable in my opinion. Unlike the Old Testament, God tends to be good. Jesus is also often portrayed as flawed and human. He is tested, tempted, suffers, exhibits fits of rage, doubts himself and even God, but is ultimately a light of hope in a very imperfect world. It teaches actually useful lessons and offers multiple viewpoints of the same story. It’s pretty interesting if you go into it with an open mind. It’s also WAY shorter, which is nice.  Tl;dr: Old Testament is long, boring, and basically entirely a fictional story where God is a dick the whole time. New Testament is much shorter and teaches actually valuable lessons that anyone could benefit from reading.	1643042524.0	hu1ci2c	t3_sbj5kx	t1_hu0bd4w	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbj5kx/still_so_many_things_to_learn/hu1ci2c/

5k1mem9j	Her's some armchair analysis:      Russia and US, both signed an agreement with Ukraine to protect it's borders as part of post USSR collapse demilitarization treaty.  So Ukraine getting rekd by Russia would have significant diplomatic damage to US in the future.    &#x200B;  It's also one of those countries that were created post collapse by itty bitty titty committee post collapse, where multiple nationalities are lumped under one jurisdiction resulting in high tensions.      I have some coworkers who live in Ukraine and straight up cut me off when I called them Ukrainian, they insist on being called Russian.    &#x200B;  Ultimately I don't think Putin really wants to invade Ukraine, just doesn't want NATO at their border. The solution here is to kick the can down the road, make a deal with them to not admit Ukraine as a NATO member. Have both sides throw the dog a bone and reinstate their treaty with Ukraine.     Ultimately what's keeping Russia from Europe is the V4 countries that militarized, while the rest of EU is just leeching of security feelings NATO membership gives them. So putting NATO in Ukraine is not necessary for the security of the rest of the NATO.	1643055233.0	hu2alln	t3_sbpqsv	t3_sbpqsv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbpqsv/gettin_spicy_over_in_eastern_europe/hu2alln/

7964a	The society of genes. The problem of cooperation between selfish actors is one that is reflected throughout biology. In a sense, every gene can be seen as an individual, which joins in a rule bound society enabling teamwork between different genes. These genes then form cells, which too can be seen as individual who cooperate (when they dont they become cancer or parasites). And then there are human societies which historically have been based on genetic relatedness.   This perspective may posit that every cell in your body achieves its incredibly complex feats of unity because they are basically genetic communists, where gene propagation is the currency that is shared equally.  However there are also two or three regulated "free markets", the bacteria in your gut, the memes in your brain, and the antibodies of your immune system.   This view may suggest that the reason communism fails, is because it can only work starting from a starting culture of highly altruistic and genetically related humans. This may have been the historical default, and is the basis of most tribal societies.   Finally this perspective may posit that historically, humans all behaved as genetic propagation maximization machines, which can explain much of human political behavior. If you manage to take into account how that programming has been corrupted by modernity. The modern world is a battlefield of political genes striving for dominance, and failing spectacularly	1643057550.0	hu2go84	t3_sbj5kx	t3_sbj5kx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbj5kx/still_so_many_things_to_learn/hu2go84/

sw7gl	I'm a non-white liberal from Europe too. It's a bit easier go see things clearly when you're outside of the groups in the conversation.     White people have drowned in guilt. Anything critical of any group of people, no matter the clear evidence, will be ignored. This of course is by design. It's funny because other races are also critical of each other and much more freely but living in the western world, where white people are the vast majority and have been brainwashed, stops other races from being open about these issues because of fear of societal rejection.      White people really do need to wake the fuck up. Difficult to do though however when all major aspects of society are controlled by the very people that they forbid criticism of. I fear that at some point, many of them will simply turn to the other extreme which will in turn negatively affect other groups who are not at fault and themselves have even less power as a collective and will end up facing persecution for the actions of groups who do have power.	1643061353.0	hu2qshr	t3_sbsbg7	t1_hu20ktd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sbsbg7/germans_are_sadly_going_back_to_their_roots_of/hu2qshr/

Last year, [the Supreme Court threw out the lawsuits against Nestle 8-1 because it was based on their actions abroad rather than in the United States](https://www.scotusblog.com/2021/06/justices-scuttle-lawsuit-against-nestle-cargill-for-allegedly-aiding-child-slavery-abroad/)	1643067572.0	hu36dp1	t3_sby50j	t3_sby50j	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/sby50j/mms_debacle_compass/hu36dp1/
tzaizmg	> Irrelevant. Four of my links are direct .gov, which are not funded by massive news companies.  Well, this really just about says it all, doesn't it?  Still, I'll humor you.  >Irrelevant. Four of my links are direct .gov, which are not funded by massive news companies. Link number 10 specifically includes the entire PDF of the court case, word for word, DIRECT FROM THE SOURCE, and concludes that there was no proof of corruption and only speculative accusations.  "Government investigates Government, determines there was no wrongdoing."  Do you seriously think that anybody involved with the Federal Government would report on actual wrongdoing with any degree of honesty?  This isn't a gotcha.  >Even if you want to throw literally everything else away, you cannot argue that these are 'other people paid to lie to do it for me', unless of course you want to make the argument that direct transcriptions of court cases, which include data, are 'regurgitated trash from paid liars', in which case, ill just peace out.  Yeah, they absolutely are, and the fact that you regard this as cause to peace out says you understand the underlying issue I'm getting at on some level - you just don't want to admit it.	1643067671.0	hu36jwu	t3_saz4fj	t1_htzpncz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/saz4fj/i_wonder_what_brought_this_on/hu36jwu/
