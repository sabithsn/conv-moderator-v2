gvy0s	I did not talk about government mandates. I am very against them. I talked about getting mad a private company made their own mandate. That's the opposite of anarcho capitalism. We are not a socialist government democrats and Republicans are capitalists who socialize the success of capitalism. I will agree we're a corpocracy. A lot of democrats probably lined their pockets from the pharmacy companies. I don't believe in a federal government in the first place but vaccines work and mRNA vaccines work. Can we talk about property laws?	1642707843.0	hti0r89	t3_s8md7y	t1_hthycs1	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8md7y/carhartt_fuck_this_private_business/hti0r89/
gxe1v27t	You’re clumping a bunch of things that don’t really have much in common with one another. Those who were rioting and looting would identify themselves as being on the far left end of the spectrum. Those who support tax increases and ‘socialised healthcare’ would identity as centre-left.  Now, I’m not a upper-middle/lower-upper class white liberal who makes $200k-400k a year but I can say confidently that being wealthy does not exclude you from progressive politics. You can be wealthy and also want to see those from lower classes have access to healthcare or have more funding for public schools. Not everyone has the mindset of ‘I’ll only vote for what benefits me’, I personally vote for what will better my country, because rarely do political parties have policies that’ll directly benefit me.   New York in particular has always been more progressive than most places in the U.S. It’s acted as a hub for internationalism, progressivism and diversity for decades, and whilst there are divides amongst different parts of New York, wealthy liberals *do* exist and don’t mind having to pay more tax if it means better funded public schools or public services.   I remember reading about 100 millionaires who wanted the government to tax them more to help distribute wealth better and provide for the working-class. Rich people wanting to help the less fortunate isn’t a myth, albeit it isn’t as common as I’d like it to be.	1642710862.0	hti7pmp	t3_s8s1vo	t3_s8s1vo	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8s1vo/what_do_affluent_white_liberals_get_out_of/hti7pmp/
gvy0s	Not at all, I honestly don't see much of a difference between the left and right. They're both trying to get power in their own way, but one side literally just tried to overthrow our democracy. You can complain about it but I don't see what it has to do with anarcho capitalism.	1642710870.0	hti7qfj	t3_s8md7y	t1_hti6glu	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8md7y/carhartt_fuck_this_private_business/hti7qfj/

When we had a corporate tax rate in the 90s, society had a fucking explosion of benefits.   I do think government is corrupt, the only problem is most anarcho libertarians have no problem holding their nose and voting for a republican statist - while most anarcho communists hate dems and repubs equally and refuse to vote for them. So who is really practicing what they preach? You guys are mostly republicans that want to smoke weed and pay less taxes. Guess what? That's just a young republican, not an anarchist of any kind.	1642741035.0	htk5zqe	t3_s78bxb	t1_htk4ctt	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s78bxb/when_antiwork_finally_gets_a_job_only_to_have/htk5zqe/

a42h7iy9	Yup, a lot of conservatives poke around here thinking workers joining to bargain together = COMMuNISM  The argument that government regulations make this somehow against anarchism is wrong as there is a helluva lot more partnership and power between industry and government than there is government laws legislating rights of workers. And people banding together to collectively make an influence, is more in the spirit of anarchism and decentralization of power than some industry titans who have already benefited by government legislation butting heads over who gets the bigger end of the pie the government cuts for them (ie, who is the better pet....its actually sad to see the power that certain companies could have but they just waste it...often citing they do so out of responsibility to their "employees" that in other circumstance theyd lay off to preserve the company).   Giving a shit about working class does not = communism.  That's caring about most of the people on earth whose labour provides most of the things we call ESSENTIAL, and yes, it's undervalued compared to someone who sits in a boardroom. Theres lots of shit that goes on to keep the average person out of genuinely competing in the free market. There aint no free market right now.	1642743190.0	htka1dy	t3_s8vmrr	t3_s8vmrr	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8vmrr/i_think_this_sub_is_full_of_people_who_dont/htka1dy/

I guess the question is… how come I have to reconcile the fact that I wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for slavery. My great grandfather was born a slave in Columbus MS, the product of a rape by my great great grandfather against my great great grand mother his Slave.  All you are doing is supposition. Teddy Roosevelt has had his Time in front of one of America’s great institutions, sitting on a horse towering over two Natives, taming these “Brutes” and lording over the land stolen from them and destroying their nations and utilizing the land to populate it with Enslaved Africans to build an economy from free labor.   Black people have had to reconcile hundreds of years of this atrocity-the privilege and legacy of white folks frees them of having any reason to observe or honor to the past by knowing it should never happen again. Teddy going to a new museum somewhere is fine.  Decolonizing our public spaces is mindful and empathetic. and making way for new voices and a vision for the future with knowledge and respect for the past and how it benefits many and terrorize many others.	1642761524.0	htkzw9a	t3_s8zs1c	t1_htkckwq	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s8zs1c/without_the_government_how_can_we_erase_history/htkzw9a/

fpbeozg2	How is this different than **"that's not real communism"** that I hear about all the time?  It seems hypocritical to mock the other side for dismissing their flaws with the no true Scotsman defense, and then using the same defense when someone sees a problem in a capitalist country.  Capitalism allows for high inequality.  High inequality leads to the rich and corporations buying politicians to get biased regulations, large subsidies, and free use of state violence.	1642865259.0	htr2vhd	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htp4j9g	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htr2vhd/

fpbeozg2	How does that relate to what I said?  Even if capitalism works good at first, the winners can change the system to give themselves free stuff.  If communists need to be responsible for what their system evolves into, so should capitalists.

fpbeozg2	I understand you're making a distinction, my whole point is that communists are mocked for making this exact same argument.  You understand the problem with communists dismissing corruption in the Soviet union as "not real communism", right?  Yet when a capitalist state evolves into cronyism, you use the same line.  So far you've changed the topic to individualism (which isn't the topic) and now you're just repeating the original thing you said while ignoring the point I made.	1642866135.0	htr4xih	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htr47j0	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htr4xih/
3vtyyfca	This is you but instead of “cops” it’s “black people”  Nah dude, I made other points too. But when I specifically said "my respect" it's because those”black people” that did nice things for people, I don't know them, I don't know of those events, so I can't have an opinion on those “black people”, I don't even know they exist. I can only base my opinion on a “black person” I have interacted with. And upon instigation of an interaction with a black person, at that point he has done nothing to deserve my respect. If he does something nice for me like these other black people you're talking about and he earns my respect, then I'll respect him. But not because he's a cop, in spite of it.  People keep saying cops deserve respect. No one deserves respect. Respect is earned.  And if those motherfuckers stripped me naked and made me take a cold ass metal prison shower I wouldn't be out here talking about respect.  Bro, about the shower part, it’s so they ensure you’re not a harm to urself or others… and if you’d knew that you wouldn’t be spending your time getting made about it you’d be accepting the mistakes you made to end up there (bc it was my own mistakes that led me there).	1642866750.0	htr6eim	t3_sa168t	t1_htr51fb	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sa168t/a_classic_you_probably_seen_before_had_to_post/htr6eim/

fpbeozg2	It's not false equivalence, both are example of the "no true Scotsman" fallacy.  Wealthy interests have tried, and succeeded in buying political power for their own gain in capitalist countries many times over.  Dismissing that is the same as communists who dismiss workers councils consolidating power for themselves.  >Communism has been attempted multiple times before. It failed to deliver on strong welfare, or it’s high ideals of utopian collectivism. It’s ended in famine, financial collapse, genocide, and dictatorships.   This is another double-standard.  Yes, the communists had genocides, so did capitalist countries.  If you think communists need to take responsibility for Holodomor but capitalists have nothing to do with the Trail of Tears or the Trans-Atlantic slave trade then you're being a hypocrite.  This isn't complicated at all, you're setting a standard and only applying it to one side.  You aren't even trying to apply these consistently.	1642868087.0	htr9lsc	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htr8opq	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htr9lsc/

fpbeozg2	You can't see the link between buying people to increase a private businesses profits, and capitalism?    Trying to call it "mercantilism" is like splitting hairs between socialism and communism.  It wasn't mercantilism, by the way.  Mercantilism is a policy of reducing imports and increasing exports.  These slaves were brought over to serve the interests of private interests who owned plantations.  It was not a national policy designed to improve trade balances, so I'd really like to know what you think "mercantilism" means.  As for forced collectivization, that increased Soviet agricultural output.  Ukraine s famine was artificial, it was closer to an ethnic conflict than an actual lack of food.  Even the CIA claimed the Soviets we're eating just as well as Americans overall.	1642871575.0	htriepk	t3_s9s2cj	t1_htreuox	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/s9s2cj/what_are_your_thoughts_on_this_fascist_take_on/htriepk/

bxkwye1i	This seems like an own-goal. It establishes that a duty of care begins at conception, and it's not so far from that to a pro-life stance.   Once born, most people believe the parents are duty-bound to care for the child or keep it safe until they can hand care to somebody else. In other words, the baby has a claim to use their parents' bodies in a certain way.   Using a part of the body that evolved to care for the fetus is not the same as being a parasite or having an organ forcibly extracted (two common pro-choice arguments).   This could also be extended to people who smoke, drink or abuse drugs during pregnancy.   For what it's worth, I am a fence-sitter. To me, whether abortion should be legal depends on when that duty of care begins. I don't know when that should be.	1642941400.0	htvgh1q	t3_saktm1	t3_saktm1	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/saktm1/what_do_you_think_of_this/htvgh1q/

54kvp	> You guys are all idiots if you think Trump was good.  Point me to the post in this thread where someone said that. Oh that's right, you can't, because you're arguing with a straw man.  > Go ahead and hate Biden, but acknowledge what an absolute train wreck Trump was or you have zero credibility.  Why would such a thing have to be acknowledged in a thread **specifically about Biden and no one else**? Really, explain that to me. Are you of the mistaken belief that a majority of people here supported Trump? If that's the case I'm sorry to inform you you're dead fucking wrong on that front, so unfortunately your go-to tactic of using a whataboutism "argument" in response to any Biden critique with "yeah, but what about Trump doing this and this..." doesn't work on us. The majority of us didn't vote for Biden. The majority of us didn't vote for Trump. Maybe this garbage logically fallacious argument tactic of yours works on a lot of the voting public, but not on a group of people who mostly votes either third-party or not at all.  Over 80 million people eligible to vote didn't vote. Nearly 3 million people voted for someone not named Biden or Trump. Combined, that's ~35% of eligible voters (and 2020 was an incredibly high turnout election; the non-voter percentage is normally much higher than that). It would do you well to remember that next time it enters your head to make a moronic whataboutism, straw man, assumptive "argument"...especially when speaking to a radical ideological group which you have very little understanding of.	1642992357.0	htyvf9c	t3_sb4eb5	t1_htyal5r	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sb4eb5/how_the_fuck_did_this_guy_become_president/htyvf9c/

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.
