dz7cdv1m	Actually it does matter. There are studys that show that a large part of pedophiles are actually gay. The chance for a homosexual to be pedo is a lot higher than for a hetero. Thats why boys are more often molested than girls. Many countrys use that as reason against the right for adoption for gays.	1641548537.0	hrm8t2t	t3_rxh42x	t1_hrk7b82	/r/russia/comments/rxh42x/two_days_ago_in_kostroma_two_men_an_old_gay_and/hrm8t2t/
dz7cdv1m	Yes it does matter because gay people are more likely to je pedophiles than heterosexuals. Some countrys deny them adoption because of that reason.	1641548625.0	hrm8x8o	t3_rxh42x	t1_hrku0tn	/r/russia/comments/rxh42x/two_days_ago_in_kostroma_two_men_an_old_gay_and/hrm8x8o/

16vres	Your tinfoil conspiracy theory is straight up disinformation, no way around it. No evidence ever existed, nothing ever happened, you just "want to believe".  The american regime was defeated after their color-revolution completely failed, they have been raging about it ever since. But they can't do anything about it, hence the panic and propaganda. Have you noticed the propaganda about China too? same story, they can't do anything, as China defeated the american regime in the "trade war", the pandemic, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Taiwan, etc. Notice how in all these cases, the american regime is the one who can't stand the status quo and launches propaganda campaigns and interference to try to change it, only to be humiliated (be it Ukraine, Xinjiang or Hong Kong).  Why does the american regime fear the status quo so much? because america is in terminal decline and has no answers to it, that's why the propaganda you gladly consume exists, it's an expression of impotence. That's the harsh reality you are scared to admit.	1642195205.0	hsoiofe	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsobnxh	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsoiofe/

9f97d	> I mean Putin did lie that there were no Russians troops in Crimea  We rented space at Crimea for our fleet since 1997. But in reality there were no troops forcing anyone to vote for Crimea to join Russia.  Take a look at video footage from the streets of Crimea when it joined Russia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9AWGnFCi9U  . Does that look like they were forced by anyone or rather finally came home ?. Crimea was always Russian, only due to stupidity of Gorbachev overnight everyone living there somehow were now forced to consider themself 'Ukrainians'.    > Putin seems unsatisfied, so I'm scared he'll try another little war to heat up nationalism and revanchism.  By 'another' you refer to Georgia ?. Please educate yourself on that matter, this has nothing to do with Ukraine attacking its own russian-speaking territories of Donbas and Lugansk which happens now.	1642202496.0	hsp0rhr	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsp0rhr/

5vb9espk	I'd say China has much larger nuclear capabilities than both Russia and US, do not underestimate them. They have the world's largest naval fleet and have the most influential economy. Any battle fought outside of China, only benefits China at this point. China collecting DNA from citizens across the globe by obtaining companies and using said DNA to develop bioweapons that only affect non-asian DNA is currently a very valid theory as to why China is doing the DNA collecting from medical chinese companies across the globe. Touching China would crash the entire world economy though.	1642209173.0	hspfw5y	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsob6l3	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hspfw5y/

4kcp6a11	>The average american is frankly sick of this and wars.   I want to believe you, but that's not the case if you follow popular subreddits) Anywhere you go - Russia IS just bad, nothing positive comes from that place. "Russia wants war and annex more lands". Your average american is completely ignorant about anything concerning russia - they don't know and they're not interested to know and go deeper, find out, research another party's point of view. Ask the simple question - WHY. All they do is blindly reiterate CNN, NBC and FOX primitive propaganda.   Look at the latest example: NO ONE in russia (officials) ever mentioned that they want to invade Ukraine, annex Ukraine or go to war or whatever, yet all the popular US media talk about it like it is a sure thing. And here on reddit every american reiterate this BS. "Putin wants to restore the Soviet Union, annex lands because he is a macho man". BULLSHIT! In my opinion putin is a crook and an asshole and he needs to go, but he doesn't need "more land", it's not that simple.   Yes, there are russian troops on the border, but did you (not you, but an average american) know that Ukranian president went from 75% supporting rate to 20% in the last couple of months? Did you know that they have political and economical crisis right now? Did you know that he was blamed of treason by the ukrainian people and journalists who actually brought him to power, not the opposition, but his core supporters? Did you know that there is a big oligarch fight going on right now in Ukraine? and the result of that fight could turn into the bloody mess?	1642229554.0	hsqjg2b	t3_s3b2in	t1_hsp4kjf	/r/russia/comments/s3b2in/does_the_russian_media_portray_the_united_states/hsqjg2b/

y2hmths	The fact is, while I can understand the need to feel more security near their border, in regards to Ukraine, the way Russia is going about it is not wise. If they truly want more security from the West they’re going about it the wrong way, they’re not contributing to any sort of peaceful diplomacy instead they’re straining the relationship and Putin knows this.  He’s be willing to lose millions of Russians in order to secure territory and resources from neighboring countries, of course it will be justified through patriotism and national security and many would die willingly for their country, just like America to its own military. We’re not so different.  Part of me wonders why the US and Russia do not work together to keep China in check, the enemy of my enemy sort of thing. We have more to gain from working together and more to lose from fighting eachother. No American wants the US to invade Russia ever, but I’m sure China would be plenty happy to relieve Russia of some territory and resources if they had the opportunity	1642242012.0	hsr0aw1	t3_s49wxk	t3_s49wxk	/r/russia/comments/s49wxk/mods_of_rrussia_arresting_a_bunch_of_western/hsr0aw1/

Imagine a gerrymandering on a country level, but instead of it being for voting, it was for administrative reasons, and/or to please the local “boss”.

Tiedän mitä Kaurismäki ajattelee, ja tiedän mitä te maanpetturit yritätte tehdä. Siinä on sinun vitun hinttis saatanan koulumattoman juntti. Valmistuin Helsingin Yliopiston yleisen kirjallisuuden linjalta H.K. Riikosen johdolla (siinä on yksi taas isänmaallinen koulutettu ihminen), ja teidän paskanaamojen ja pellejen valehtelun takia Suomi on menettänyt täysin pelin. Ja jos joku vitun maailaisjuntti, joka tuskin edes tuntee Haavikkoa, Tikkasta tai Veijo Merta vielä kerran täällä tai jossain muualla käy mun kimppuuni, niin tulee tupen rapinat. Ja sinä ja sinun vitun trollisi, kouluttamattomat juntit. Katotaan mikä pelle siellä on jostain saatanan Kärsämäeltä joka on varastanut näiden vitun käteisten, stuppien ja mariinien kanssa meidän maan. Onko selvä, vitun maalaisjuntti? Sinä olet se vitun trolli ja minä olen kirjailija, jota lukee yli 200 000 ihmistä joka kuukausi. Tommoset saatanan tavalliset pulliaiset, onko töissä vähän tylsää, onko se oma pieni siellä Kärsämäellä käynyt vähän tylsäki. Painu junttiin vittuun, ja nyt saman tien. Kyllä on vitun mielenkiintosta, eikö ookin, saatanan tavallinen pulliainen. Ja nyt vittuun täältä ja vähän äkkiä.	1642603556.0	htbmsn1	t3_s4fuwf	t1_htbgu4z	/r/russia/comments/s4fuwf/white_house_russia_prepping_pretext_for_ukraine/htbmsn1/

hy5g2klo	That's what I was talking . People use that movie as evidence of their nazi propaganda. Most of the casualties were civilians who were simply murdered because they were slavs, but people shift the blame and downplay what the Germans did with excuses like"human waves", "Stalin killed more people than Hitler" ect. And that movie made that "human wave" myth witch a nazi propaganda popular.	1642604466.0	htbp02n	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbl985	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htbp02n/

6ksc4euo	In honesty we were taught that they fought without (or with empty) weapons because the military budget ran out. Sometime in the early 40's brass became internationally scarce and soviet rounds were fitted with steel casings which work good enough for a while but destroy the "upper" and barrel over time. At the same time I can buy a mosin nagant at the pawn shop for $500 so idk just how bad they were. But I guess even then Russia had way more troops than they had bullets and we were taught that near the end, the eastern front was won by charging soldiers with empty weapons  We were also taught that the war devastated the russian male population, some 20 million casualties I think, which caused economic and population problems that can still be measured today  Is that different than what you are taught?	1642614274.0	htcefvs	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbk8e3	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htcefvs/

That shocked Europe which feared the loss of its identity and when the USSR took that to the next level and the US appeared on the scene with Europe, that age old battle went to the next level. Today it is the West that projects its own sins on Russia in a bid to make Russia in its own image. I predict that the West will eventually succeed and Russia will split between Asia and Europe.	1642705545.0	hthum3t	t3_s8dt3d	t3_s8dt3d	/r/russia/comments/s8dt3d/anyone_else_in_the_russian_diaspora_get_asked/hthum3t/
