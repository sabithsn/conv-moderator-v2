g00r7	My bad, I was confused by your rhetoric:  > Rus = Ukraine, Mongols-Tatars mixed local Finns aka Moskals can fuck off.   > Moscow Church is sect, they are not recognized by World Orthodoxia. Ukraine has it's own independent Church which is part of World Orthodoxia and soon will Belarus.  Modern Russian language was influenced by invasion and a lot of foreign words were added. Moscovia remain vassal of Horde and paid it's dues to Horde until early 18th century. There were no books printed in Moscovia, until Belarusians came and print them.   > That's bullshit invented by Moskal occupants to brainwash people who they occupied. Belarusians and Ukrainians have nothing in common with Moskal pigs.    > Moskals clean shitters and suck dicks for 3 times less money. At Pidarashka. If someone is qualified to only clean toilets, they can at least get paid better than Moskal toilet cleaners. And it works for every profession.   > What a stupid Moskal. Your country lays in fucking ruins. People dying from poisoned vodka in bunches and he's worried about Polish people going to UK for top salary.

ajf56	>I thought white replacement meme was just in the west but its in russia too?  It's simply the attempts of politically illiterate people to conceptualize the cause of problems their society is facing. It isn't difficult to understand why this is the case - in the Russian context, it's far easier for Central Asian labour migrants to get into Russia than it is for people from the Russian diaspora in Central Asia to repatriate.   So what does that look like at first glance if you don't understand anything about the political and economic situation? It looks like the government would prefer to populate the country with foreigners who do not integrate and have a strong tendency towards aggression rather than Russians.  In reality it's an unsustainable model of oligarchs exploiting foreign workers from the poorest countries for the sake of profit margins, just like in the West. The end result **is** the replacement of entire cultures, but just like with climate change or any other problem driven by corporate greed, the end result is totally irrelevant to those responsible.	1641573297.0	hrnl5ij	t3_rxceto	t1_hri8zb6	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxceto/are_you_worried_about_the_future_of_russia_and/hrnl5ij/

avgpx	Yes.  They celebrate it on December 25, which is now January 7 in the new calendar.  It's not Catholics who switched to it, it was the whole world.  But Catholics went along with it, and Orthodox Christians did not.  Also, many Russians celebrate "the Old New Year Eve", which is January 14, as you can guess.	1641581980.0	hro9gh2	t3_ryeq77	t3_ryeq77	/r/AskARussian/comments/ryeq77/can_anyone_explain_in_detail_why_russian_orthodox/hro9gh2/
ajf56	> Somehow, she thinks Tatars or Bashkirs or any other predominantly Muslim ethnicity do not deserve to be Russians  The ones you listed happen to be the ones that are almost universally excluded from these judgements, because they're secular and have been getting along with Russians for centuries. I didn't see her mention them anywhere, so I'm going to assume that, like the rest of the country, she's judging based on behaviour and thus doesn't have any problem with either of them. Also, she didn't say anything about "deserving" to be Russians. What she said is these migrants hate Russians. People who hate Russians obviously will not become Russians.  >She did not get much of approval here, which is a relief, but what if her goal was to just plant the seed, the idea?  Leaving aside the fact that this sub is an extremely skewed sample of Russian sentiment, I have seen her discuss this issue before and the reaction can swing one way or the other. In my observation, her frustrations are shared by a huge majority of Russian people, but her way of framing the issue is unusual. I also think it's pretty clear that the impetus behind her posts is the fact that she's a woman who is distressed by how increasingly vulnerable the female experience is becoming in her country. Exactly the same thing has already happened  en-masse in the West and there's no reason to think it won't happen in Russia. The old 5 year rule holds true yet again.  >When somebody says some illegal shit  What did she say that's illegal? There's a law against criticizing religion but it only applies to broadcasting, not individuals on social media.  >I am not an ethnic Russian, so this hits too close to home.  Neither am I, but I don't see how that matters. In my view, if someone chooses to live among a particular group of people then they shouldn't want to see foreigners come and act like they are entitled to be the dominant culture. In Altai there is a problem with tourists, mostly Russians, defacing sacred sites with graffiti (literally carving "Illya was here" over 3000 year old rock carvings etc). I think any rational, decent person should be able to admit that this is a problem and accept that the Altains have every right to be angry about it. Even though these tourists are obviously a small minority, I think any ethnic Russian should be able to admit that these incidents show that there is a flaw somewhere in Russian society that is producing those people who have no respect for culture or history. Unfortunately, with Muslims, this is a pattern of behavior that goes back thousands of years and has touched every corner of the world by now - and although defacing cultural monuments is certainly part of it, there are much worse crimes that come with these kind of huge influxes of Muslim foreigners.  I think the problem you're having is that you have no ideological attachment to Islam, but you try to attach yourself to it in other ways. When Muslims are judged on an ideological basis, you can't make sense of it, because you consider yourself the target of this judgement, but in reality you're not because you don't believe in Islam and thus your behavior cannot be influenced by those beliefs.	1641582042.0	hro9mjw	t3_rxceto	t1_hrnurkl	/r/AskARussian/comments/rxceto/are_you_worried_about_the_future_of_russia_and/hro9mjw/

66y1jqr0	"I felt bad for him because he always pays".  Well, that's fine. Why did you only say, "I felt bad for you." Why not: "Oh, you're so pathetic, so pathetic.You're puffing up to play the majestic prince, but I know that you're a loser and all these expenses are burdensome for you."  It seems to me that it would be a better option to encourage him to feel sorry for you and explain that you feel uncomfortable when you are constantly being paid for. You have been brought up in a different culture, and this situation brings you suffering. And you are sure that he will understand you, because he is so wonderful and gives you a sense of security. A sense of security in everything except this terrible way of paying.	1642009589.0	hsdi0hx	t3_s28erw	t3_s28erw	/r/AskARussian/comments/s28erw/russian_men_and_paying_for_dinner_dates_and_so_on/hsdi0hx/

5d2jjari	*Hello! My source is small - I can share u how appeared my opinion about this and some about my parents opinion. I hope opinion of two adults and one young can be helpful for u*  &#x200B;  When I was a child who devided world to black and white, due a lot movies about ww2 I hated German people and I thought, that they are actually evil. Then my mother told me story about my grand grand mother in ww2. (Sorry, but I don't sure that it is possible revive details of this story)  She with daughter (my grandmother who was very young) lived in little town name of which we can't remember. And once this town turned to battlefield. Shootings, explosions and similar shit was around. Stay here was dangerous, but they didn't decide to risk go out.   Some time later one Germany officer found them and helped to find more saveful place - he placed them to something basement and regular visited with food. Grand grand mother was very sure that he felt in love with she. Next he disappeared due unknow reasons  After this story I realized that national of people don't make them 'evil' or 'good'. And I also have few German friends in internet, they r good   &#x200B;  My stepfather very much love (at least loved few years ago) movies about ww2. And he is convinced that present time German people feel shame for this part of they story and we must not condemn them. I guess generally he think neutral about them. He honor quality of they technic.  Opinion of my mother who told me this story I guess haven't any sense to talk. And she too love and honor they technic and cars. She always bought only Samsung phones cause thought that this is german brand	1642195985.0	hsokpg9	t3_s3z7oy	t3_s3z7oy	/r/AskARussian/comments/s3z7oy/what_do_russians_think_of_germans_germany/hsokpg9/

iep3pod7	But as a whole, Russians tend to be conservative than Americans are. But the US is still more conservative than is Western Europe, with a very strong Evangelical Christian Community. I mean that as a compliment. I say this because I've lived in Los Angeles for some 8 years and have grown to hate it. If you live in Los Angeles or New York, per say, you are likely to come across some sexually questionable and effeminate men. Whereas if a man in Russia dressed up like a woman and acted feminine, he would likely be given some harsh stares at best.  I want to move to your country. It's not too far from where I currently live and it's run by a guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind and despite the extensive maligning of him by the West, is a mild-mannered, eloquent individual with a hefty dose of common sense and decency.  I don't see your president mandating lockdowns, openly saying that he wants to anger unvaccinated people by making life as hard for them as possible, and promoting CRT/LGBTQ/feminism/transgenderism in schools. I don't see him allowing illegal Chinese immigrants to vote like the Democrat Party of the country where I'm currently at is trying to push for.  He's a sane man in an insane world.

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

9f97d	> Why would they suddenly start bombing this region  Ask faschists in ukrainian government, or this general from usa  https://youtu.be/bvn3LEx9dhw who literally proposed to start killing Russians SIX YEARS AGO.  I understand its hard to believe for some European or regular American that literal faschism exists nowdays, but it not just exists, in case of Ukraine it is supported on a government level and celebrated.   Google 'Azov Ukraine' - openly nazi national guard unit responsible for numerius mass killings based on race and nation, OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED BY Ukrainian governments and presidents.  Or google 'Stepan Bandera' - national hero of Ukraine, faschist from ww2 not only responsible for mass murdering Russians and Ukrainians, but also Europeans like Polaks.   Its hard to grasp for an outsider, but Ukraine's ruling elites are so pro-west that they became anti-Russia. For Usa its benefitting to make Russia, China and other geo-political opponents weak, so they will do anything to destabilize the situation there.   And don't pretend like you are shocked that this lead to racial cleansings and bombing of their own territories to please west. If you still believe in kind and compassionate USA or European governments, google 'bombing Yugoslavia', or Colin Powell lying to entire world about weapons of mass destruction they found in Iraq (which turned out a lie ofcourse) which led to destruction of entire country / over a million civilians dead and them stealing the oil.  Western civilization instigate wars, not prevent them, forcing Ukraine to attack its own territories to provoke conflict with Russia (because Russians live in those territories) is only natural for them.	1642253168.0	hsrgkwh	t3_s402cm	t1_hsqn6j7	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsrgkwh/

g00r7	Like 5 years ago, I was willing to give the Westerners the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were brainwashed by their media. Nowadays, not so much. I think that the Westerners are just hypocrites.   Crimea was a political move. There was no fighting, virtually no casualties (one man was killed, IIRC). A third of Ukrainian troops defected to Russia. Can't really call it "war".  Donbass is another matter. Naturally, Russia supports the separatists, but the vast majority of people fighting there are not Russian military.	1642260827.0	hsrwsvf	t3_s402cm	t1_hsrhhqc	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsrwsvf/

You were burning people alive for being pro-Russian,  that is unforgivable and all Ukrainains who were supporting this completely deserve, that parts of their country fled under Russian protection. And all your post is about hatred, you were hating pro-russian citizens of your country for years, you would be happy if they would just emigrate to Russia and you would just take their land and property, but suddenly these people had enough of humiliation through all these years and decided to go back home together with their land, and they asked and found full support of Russia. That is why all this hate, cause you are helpless to do anything about it even with all your US ass licking. You and US don't care about people, you care only of money and land.	1642260940.0	hsrx2ht	t3_s402cm	t3_s402cm	/r/AskARussian/comments/s402cm/has_anyone_experienced_unusual_treatment_from/hsrx2ht/

It started in late August 1918 after the beginning of the Russian Civil War and lasted until 1922. Arising after assassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin and Petrograd Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky, the latter of which was successful, the Red Terror was modeled on the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, and sought to eliminate political dissent, opposition, and any other threat to Bolshevik power.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642504633.0	ht5x4p7	t3_s6uw46	t1_ht5x3t5	/r/AskARussian/comments/s6uw46/why_do_russians_consider_felix_dzerzhinsky/ht5x4p7/

cke4duas	Стиль русского языка у ОПа такой, как будто бы он дворянин из 19-го века (это комплимент).  По поводу Варламова - он стал крупной (в масштабах русского ютуба) медийной персоной и в первую очередь его цель это заработать деньги. Не обязательно предоставлять точную информацию, главное привлечь побольше зрителей. Ютуб для него это бизнес. Поэтому стоит задать вопрос почему его бизнес процветает? Почему он привлекает такое большое количество зрителей?  Потому, что стиль его повествования, это ругать недостатки своей страны. Недостатки других стран он знает лишь поверхностно, а своей собственной знает вдоль и поперёк. Точно так же как и многие другие обыватели, он жалуется на то, что у нас всё плохо. И якобы в других странах всё прекрасно. Это очень популярный нарратив среди обывателей, которые считают, что в других странах трава зеленее. Такую именно точку зрения и транслирует Варламов. Поэтому он находит отклик в сердцах россиян и поэтому он такой популярный.  Он ни капли не достоверный докладчик. Он просто шоумен который паразитирует на невежестве большинства наших соотечественников. Я имею в виду Everybody knows things are bad. Но это не означает, что в других странах things are great. В каждой стране things are bad in their own unique way. А Варламов пропагандирует, что только в России всё плохо. А в других странах всё хорошо.	1642637206.0	hte2qvu	t3_s7y20v	t3_s7y20v	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7y20v/какое_мнение_россияне_имеют_о_варламове/hte2qvu/

cke4duas	For me it initially has been natural to pronounce this word as a "neuter", but at the age of approx. 16 I learned that mostly country boys speak it as "neuter" so every time I order coffee now I'm super aware about not to accidentally pronounce it in "neuter" but to pronounce it in "masculine" lol.  Kind of the same for "espresso" vs "ekspresso".

Because it's so common to start your conversation with howdy or something similar it became so common and boring that it's better to throw some old school pickup lines in an ironic way and laugh at it. IDK about English-speaking countries but in Russia post-irony is big right now. You intentionally behave/speak in old-ass cringy way. Some examples:  \- Твои родители случайно не ювелиры? Тогда откуда у них такой бриллиант? (are your parents jewelers? because you are such a diamond!)  \- Вашей маме зять не нужен? (by any chance doesn't your mom need a son-in-law?)  \- Ты такая сладкая, что сахар горчит после тебя (you are so sweet, sugar feels bitter compared to you)	1642639882.0	hte8pt6	t3_s80lb6	t3_s80lb6	/r/AskARussian/comments/s80lb6/pick_up_lines_in_russian_language/hte8pt6/

Some of these videos are gonna go viral in the US and elsewhere.  Really how hard is it to not understand that its not ok to  - park ABMs etc right across the border - spew propaganda that too from a country that has track record of faking its way to bombing nations or 50+ overthrown govts - leave arms treaties - constantly provoking  - american military industrial complex badly wants a war to revive its bullshit economy mostly swelled by unregulated banks  I wonder how Ukrainians who have suffered and are blinded by falseflags and psych warfare feel?  How do Russians feel about this?   Most redditors are completely brainwashed by the propaganda, wish to know more from the ones who saw through this bullshit.  I am not promoting Russia but can see clearly that it is definitely what the Americans claim. We need to move away from this fucking geopolitics and fight hunger/poverty and this broken system.

fdfb1d4o	So firstly NATO members all need to agree for a membership, and not all would vote yes.  Secondly, for an aggressive organisation like NATO to have access to a land border would be a great shift in the balance of power and that is good reason enough to not join.  The analogy would be Cuba or Mexico to have Chinese/Russian ABMs. I wonder if the US would be happy with that, and yes most Mexicans or Cubans if given adequate incentive would happily vote for this to happen.  Also as you can see most of these votes you spoke of also aren't a significant majority but barely making 50%. Hope you realize that most Ukrainians have suffered from American Propaganda and hence most of these votes don't really have much actual credibility, even Biden many years ago himself said that being a country with high corruption rate etc would not be a good idea for joining NATO.  The best would be if the US didn't interfere with other countries. US policing has only shown to be with an agenda of obtaining resources or to sell more arms in conflict. So yeah same goes with the Ukraine, strategic reasons of course. Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have seen enough war crimes being committed on false pretence. This is just another reason for war literally sponsored by American companies.	1642723535.0	htj2omd	t3_s7uppw	t1_htj0a2p	/r/AskARussian/comments/s7uppw/ukraine_crisis_megathread/htj2omd/

No, despite of what your leaders tell you, emotions are not the right way to deal with politics. One's self-esteem has nothing to do with supporting or not supporting Putin.  True, corruption is rampant in Russia. Still less rampant than it was in the 90's so I guess Putin has improved something, haha.

So yeah, I wouldn't count on Paypal/Visa/MC or any other American company, including Google, if I were you.	1642753988.0	htkqef0	t3_s8tek2	t3_s8tek2	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8tek2/will_russia_be_cut_off_international_banking/htkqef0/

g00r7	Ukraine stripped Crimea of its autonomous status on 17.03.1995.  > How much death do you expect to follow.  According to Western opinion polls, up to 3/4 of Crimeans support the reunification with Russia, and the nearly all people living in Crimea are Russian citizens. Ukrainians have no qualms about killing ethnic Russians, because they don't consider them human beings. Most civilians deaths in Donbass happened on the pro-Russian side, the fact that the West prefers to forget about. So yeah, it would either be a bloodbath or an ethnic cleansing of 2 millions of people. I can't imagine a Russian leader beside Yeltsin who would turn a blind eye to a situation like that.	1642756679.0	htktw4l	t3_rzlhld	t1_htks82g	/r/AskARussian/comments/rzlhld/whats_the_reason_behind_the_us_threat_to_russia/htktw4l/

It's funny how the Westerners pretend that the war in Ukraine is the worst thing since WW2 while simultaneously downplaying the amount of civilian deaths.   > Also why would Ukraine do such a thing  Do you realise that a million of Ukrainians have fled to Russia since 2014?

The hall goes silent.  - Comrades, who have sneezed? - Says Stalin.    Noone responds.   - First row out. - Says Stalin.  Security brings the first raw out of the hall and executes them.  - Comrades, who have sneezed?... The audience stays silent.  - Second row, out.

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.
