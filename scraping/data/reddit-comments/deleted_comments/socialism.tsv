htcmby30	A couple of years ago I asked Caleb Maupin what the soviet economic growth rate was. He sent me sources such as Libary of Congress Country Studies saying the soviet union grew really slowly like 2% because "planned economies don't work" and he told me they are the best sources.   I never said or did anything negative towards Caleb Maupin and barely interacted with him since the end of 2020.   I came out as trans on twitter and he instantly blocked me despite only interacting with him positively and barely interacting with him since 2021 (as you can see I am blocked at the bottom of the pic).	1642732260.0	htjmy44	t3_s8zoc9	t3_s8zoc9	/r/socialism/comments/s8zoc9/communist_caleb_maupin_tried_to_trick_me_into/htjmy44/

5kall6by	As a friendly reminder to all comrades, whether we find Stalin good or bad is mostly an irrelevant and useless debate.  We should seek to understand the history of the USSR *based on the conditions they faced at the time* and extract whatever lessons we can insofar as they reflect the present day.  There were tremendous gains for the working class under Stalin, yet there were also many excesses and misguided policies.  Our job as 21st century socialists is not to bicker with one another over whether the legacy of this particular era falls into the "good' or "bad" column- it's to learn from it and use it to help us understand our current situation.	1642796462.0	htn87qb	t3_s9hpwg	t3_s9hpwg	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htn87qb/

92u3hwv9	Buddha was an innovation - a bit more thinking and equality over standard dogma. Not truly revolutionary, or beyond common sense, and he was granted a modicum of security due to his lineage as a prince. Hence, we hear of him and not a million others who met a tragic fate at the hands of the zealots.    But, Jesus is an invention. Far too little of Jesus is upto historical scrutiny and even the book is written by different people, compiled by others, amended and changed by yet others, modified and bowdlerized by others, still. Arrian Christianity, for example is fundamentally distinct from Catholicism as it is from Protestantism.   Anyways. None of them were revolutionaries. Che was.	1642849648.0	htqb1om	t3_sa03ye	t3_sa03ye	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htqb1om/

Neither of them were evidence-based.   > ...else why do people today have entire religions in their name?

[The actual quote, in full context](https://youtu.be/QGNzYEj_BrQ) (2:29:10 - 2:31:30 for the full question and answer), shows a fairly off-the-cuff answer where he seems to be talking about large scale war between major powers. In other words, the risk of what could *follow* an invasion of Ukraine, not the idea that invasions themselves are rare.   And then "RNC Research" clipped a line to misrepresent what he said and /r/socialist dove in to trust the GOP.	1642852385.0	htqexzr	t3_s9qwnw	t3_s9qwnw	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htqexzr/
92u3hwv9	You are sadly making an argument built upon the fallacy of special pleading with zero-evidence to back up your claims or counter any position.   Of course, we don't need social classes. But, Jesus was built upon exclusionary principle and in agreement with slavery. This is not in dispute. So, Jesus was closer to ISIS level fundamentalists than say a revolutionary like Che.   Buddha is a bit complicated, since he never classified himself as being a Buddhist. Only a seeker of truth, a teacher. But, he was an obvious liar, wrt the ideas of Samsara or Nirvana and the rest.   Anyways. None of them were revolutionaries. Jesus, a theocrat was not even close to socialist principles.	1642853354.0	htqgc64	t3_sa03ye	t1_htqfjw5	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htqgc64/

Dude your own source contradicts your claim in the line quoted from your own comment:  > We have very limited information on exactly who Jesus was...  The only consensus is 'we do not know exactly'. I mean if the son of god, born of a virgin mother, inseminated by a sky-daddy sperm, re-animated after his death, etc was historically proven, then it would be some real special news. Alas, nothing of this sort is presented by you.   In fact, most of bible is a contradiction to known history - Herod was dead for about 4 years before Yeshua/Jee-suss' birth, for example. And no massacre of the children either.   And there is a Jesus who lives down the favela. That someone bears a similar name, proves not that it is the 'Jesus' of the myth.	1642875359.0	htrs677	t3_sa03ye	t1_htre4x3	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htrs677/

o5af9	If Ukraine requests help, the US has a moral obligation to help. A lot of people forget that after the breakup of the USSR, the newly independent Ukraine inherited the 3rd largest nuclear arsenal in the world. But instead of keeping the warheads as a deterrent, they signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum giving up everything in exchange for security assurances from the US, UK, and Russia.  If the US and UK don't back up their assurances, we can kiss goodbye any hope of a world free of nuclear weapons. What country would ever give up their nuclear deterrent again?	1642881891.0	hts8p7f	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htqkaqn	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/hts8p7f/
fhdlo4eu	It has been my experience that there is no argument in existence for someone who has no interest in opening their mind or is just not open to having their minds changed by new information.   The problem with a lot of MAGA nuts is that they know absolutely everything and only seek information that reinforces what they already believe and any argument or evidence to the contrary has next to no meaning.  The left has theory, and discussion; the right has talking points and suppression. You can see it in their politics. They’re not really *for* anything.  My only advice is to give them the info, or the resources, and leave it be. If they care, they will seek it out. Don’t beat a dead horse. Save your energy for those who are open to having their minds changed, or espouse left wing ideals but are stuck with a negative connotation of socialism.	1642882591.0	htsaerf	t3_sa87wd	t3_sa87wd	/r/socialism/comments/sa87wd/is_there_a_more_clear_argument_to_a_maga_that/htsaerf/
