16j9q5	When I went through a very dark space in the beginning of my marriage, I shut my wife out. I thought I was protecting her from my pain also, when in reality I was hurting her very deeply because she wanted to help me and I pushed her away.   She didn't cry because of your pain, man. She cried because she loves you, and you refused to let her help you.	1640870064.0	hqjje2q	t3_rrps6d	t1_hqhxegi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rrps6d/aita_for_not_wanting_my_brother_to_bring_my_ex/hqjje2q/

7e60b7rc	NTA, that really sucks from your brother. But to echo everyone else here GO GET YOUR WIFE!! I can only speak for myself, but my boyfriend who I’m *desperately* in love with had an abusive childhood and severe depression the last few years; we wound up involuntarily separated due to COVID for more than a year and he would barely speak to me, tell me everything was fine even though I knew it wasn’t, etc etc- it was rough. But not nearly as rough as when he broke up with me because he thought it would spare me somehow from having to suffer with his depression. I worried about him ALL THE TIME, and the fact that I knew he was going through it alone made it even worse. I didn’t need to be protected I needed him. Your wife clearly needs you too and has waited all this time for you, I hope you listen to all the Reddit people and reach out to her ♥️ also sending you a big hug for everything you’ve been though, and still managing to be a support for your bro, don’t underestimate yourself	1640872406.0	hqjno9o	t3_rrps6d	t3_rrps6d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rrps6d/aita_for_not_wanting_my_brother_to_bring_my_ex/hqjno9o/

However, you called the clothes that MIL gave as "ugly" which honestly is a thing somebody with an agenda would say, just because you dislike a style of clothing, doesn't make it ugly. Imagine if somebody did not like your style and chose to call it "ugly", how would you feel? You both blew up instead of actually addressing the matter like adults and putting forth your point of view, so yes you are both TA for being immature over a bunch of clothes and colours which doesn't matter any which way.	1640875788.0	hqjup6z	t3_rrpb9w	t3_rrpb9w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rrpb9w/aita_for_dressing_my_daughter_in_boys_clothes/hqjup6z/

hxxv10g0	So you’re correct! I never went to Japanese school, but I have a cousin that does. From elementary and middle school is mandatory for students to learn English, but it’s very basic stuff. I’m not sure about high school, but maybe it’s the same? Similar to American school systems, most high schools require us to take a language class and achieve certain amount of credits. That doesn’t mean all students will become fluent in that select language they learned. Just like how not all Japanese kids will be fluent in English because they learned a bit in school.   One of the things I learned from another friend of mine learning English. She has a difficult time speaking (she has a heavy accent and her vocabulary isn’t really high) and understanding people because people talk fast (that’s how it feels to her). I feel like learning languages takes a lot of time and to get to the point of being fluent takes more than a basic classes in school. In the defense of my friends girlfriend.   Anyways I do see them struggling to speak to each other, but I usually see them whip out their phones and communicate through google. So at least they have that for now.   > I think it’s also possible that someone in this chain of events is not completely forthright.   You mean my friend (the bf)?	1640878127.0	hqjzzij	t3_rs3hv1	t1_hqjxzjz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs3hv1/aita_23f_for_not_wanting_to_be_the_translator_for/hqjzzij/

hxxv10g0	Well it’s not uncommon for Americans (military) get into relationships with local women in whatever country they’re stationed in. Personally, I don’t think I could get into a relationship with someone due with a language barrier. Just my preference, seems really stressful.  > relies on a third party   That’s where it bothers me, both of them aren’t actively try to learn each other’s languages. Plus, she’s not really nice to be around either… I didn’t even know about the invite situation until after it happened (heard from our mutual friends). I literally don’t want to have anything to do with her. My friend isn’t a bad guy, but I really don’t appreciate trying to put me in between their drama. I have distanced myself between them already, but I do occasionally see them whenever we hang out in a group with our mutual friends.	1640879236.0	hqk2n08	t3_rs3hv1	t1_hqk1f7q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs3hv1/aita_23f_for_not_wanting_to_be_the_translator_for/hqk2n08/
5jkdtpp0	YTA  Your husband is right. You did go behind his back and betray his trust, and worse, with regards to the well-being of your child. How will he trust you after this?   As for your mother, that's horrible advice she gave you, and the sort that will destroy your marriage. Women are not powerless any more, and so manipulation and deceit are horrible leftovers from an awful system that no longer have a place in a healthy relationship today. Also, we know better today about respecting babies'/children's rights and safety.    Is this the person you want to be, OP? Someone who cannot be trusted to honour her partner's role and wishes, who cannot be trusted with her child's well-being and safety, and who goes behind her partner's back to get her own way?	1640879240.0	hqk2nbx	t3_rs1qmi	t3_rs1qmi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs1qmi/aita_for_getting_my_daughters_ears_peirced/hqk2nbx/

jtmol	ETA but you're the larger one here.  If it was that important then you shouldn't have waited weeks for him to bring it up again.  Instead you decided to go behind his back?  If you two can't communicate like adults about the simplest of thing then you probably shouldn't have brought a child into this world.  But now that you have, get counseling ASAP.    A normal relationship would discuss the pro's and con's and make a decision.  With my daughter I thought it would be better doing it when she wouldn't remember the pain while my wife wanted to use it as a award for doing good in school later in life.   Never once did I think, 'screw that I'm going to do it anyway'.    The only reason I give your hubby the A is because he did drag his feet about the issue.  I don't know why but your solution was not the correct response to his.  You get the primary A for 1. going behind his back, 2. listening to your mom over your husband and 3. thinking you have more say over your kids than your husband.

3yb1sorc	Years ago my parents traveled back and forth from their retirement home to their old home 2 states over. I happened to live in between their two homes so when they traveled to and from, they’d spend the night to rest. It was about a 16 hr drive for them. My dad asked for my house key so in case they arrived and I was at work or out and about, they could let themselves in. (This happened prior to cell phones) One day my husband and I returning home from being out, saw my dad’s car in the driveway. Immediately I thought, oh crap, did I clean up? Is there a mess? Is the bathroom clean? I felt like when you’re a kid and parents get home and you haven’t finished your chores. When I went in the house my parents were sitting in the living room watching tv. I asked why didn’t they call to let me know they were coming and they just shrugged it off. I told them to please call ahead in the future. They never did. Later we moved in to military housing on base. My dad asked for they key but this time I had a great excuse. Guests on the base require a sponsor, I have to escort them on, where they must register their vehicle and issued a pass for a day or two. My dad wasn’t happy about that. But it turned out worse for me. They still wouldn’t call ahead so I’d get a phone call at work that they were waiting across the street from base at a gas station. I would have to leave work to go sponsor them on base (long process, wait in a line with others sponsoring their guests where military police would then write down all their info (drivers license/proof of insurance) and finally issue the pass. Then I’d have to rush back to work. Sometimes I couldn’t leave work and I’d have to call my husband to go sponsor them in. They did this for 6 yrs while we lived on base. I should have set boundaries early on. My dad was a snoopy person. He would go into my sister’s house and look through her mail and around the house. My sister asked for the key and it caused some tension but that was on them, not her. I regret not standing firm, after all it was my home.	1640880541.0	hqk5u3g	t3_rrjhmz	t3_rrjhmz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rrjhmz/aita_for_giving_my_mil_a_fake_copy_of_my_house/hqk5u3g/

The student council came up with “janitor day” to thank the janitors, Mrs. Smith got butthurt about it because she felt more attention should be paid to the teachers. You make a meme about Custer’s last stand, only replacing Mrs. Smith for Custer and her “last stand” being this whole janitors day situation. The school finds out about the meme because they think it makes them look bad and because you changed Native American chiefs into (I’m assuming white) Mrs. Smith, which they took to be racist?

43eo47ym	YTA - I did a similar thing when my daughter was three. My husband was hesitant to allow me to take her to get her ears pierced before she was old enough to really choose for herself and take care of them properly. I took advantage of his hesitation and took her to get it done. He was rightfully angry that I went ahead with it, and it took some time to rebuild trust. I ended up taking the piercings out and letting them heal, and my daughter eventually chose to get them done when she was 14. The only reason we came away from that moment in tact is because I acknowledged that I was in the wrong and didn’t try to shift blame or justify my actions.

4wbvbnnc	as someone with over 10 piercings, YTA. you mentioned in a comment it was “done safely” but i’m 99% sure any reputable piercer who is trained in cross contamination and minimizing infections would absolutely refuse to perform any type of body modification on a literal infant. it’s hard to sleep on healing, and even healed, piercings so your daughter is absolutely SUFFERING every time she rolls over in her sleep or accidentally touches her own ears. all because you wanted her to be “pretty”.  that being said, i am mexican and it’s sadly normalized to pierce your own baby’s ears (usually with the actual earring that hasn’t been sterilized correctly) and it was done to me. the metal was not a hypoallergenic one like titanium, so i constantly dealt with infections growing up until one day i told my mom i don’t like earrings. i did like the look, but i was uneducated in how to take care of them so i just thought my body was broken and couldn’t handle earrings. once i was of age, i got my lobes repierced by a reputable piercer who chose to pierce slightly above the original holes cause they were unsalvageable and when you get them done as an infant, your body grows and proportions change, so they were no longer even. since then i have not had to deal with the problems i dealt with in the past and i’m responsible enough to keep them clean (something an infant isn’t able to keep up with). op, unless you’re cleaning her lobes twice a day with a saline solution, it was pierced with a correctly sterilized needle (fun fact: piercing guns cannot be sterilized), and now have a nickel-free metal like titanium, surgical stainless steel, or gold in her piercings, WHAT YOU DID IS UNSAFE. at first the bar in the piercings are longer than needed to accommodate for swelling and once swelling is down (a few weeks usually) then you switch to smaller bars to minimize snagging and migration of the bar. also if her earrings are butterfly clips in the back (not flat screw on backs) those generally close too tightly and do not accommodate for normal swelling, so you’re running the risk of the back of the earring getting stuck in her ear and requiring surgery to remove it. i’m not giving you this information as advice that you should put into practice on your infant daughter, but as a wake up call so you realize you might not actually be doing anything safely and are actively endangering your daughter’s health. my advice is take them out ASAP, let them close, and if SHE ever wants them done, take her to a reputable piercer. also maybe we should just let people consent before performing any body modifications on them???  all that being said, the worst part is how you treated and spoke to the father of your child when he voiced his very valid concerns. he and his family are right in not trusting you and your mother with your infant anymore. absolutely terrible parenting. she is not a doll to dress up how you want.	1640889027.0	hqks0zv	t3_rs1qmi	t3_rs1qmi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs1qmi/aita_for_getting_my_daughters_ears_peirced/hqks0zv/

rjxlrny	He’s exaggerating. It’s perfectly normal to pierce your baby girls ears, if he wasn’t okay with it he should’ve compromised as I’m sure you’ve done for him, giving him time and approaching him about it was enough. However, you are the mom and no one should be allowed to top your final word. That’s just my opinion. You even gave him a heads up, it’s what you wanted for her. So in 10 years when she wants a pink laptop and you really wanna get it for her and he’s against it because he needs to be a white laptop? Your just gonna side with him? So he doesn’t get mad? So when she begs you for ONE RED OR BLONDE HIGHLIGHT, you gotta ask him? You gotta go through him? And if he says no? Even if you and her want it, you gotta go back and tell her no? Sounds like he just like the control. Your the mother, you wanted them, you got them.

In reality it's more like a line that starts horizontal and curves upwards.   In other words, you don't get gradually more drunk over the course of drinking; rather, you can slug several drinks and feel tipsy at best, and then suddenly have all those drinks hit you at once and suddenly you're trashed. This is especially true if the drink "isn't that strong" (which makes it easy to drink lots of it) and you're unused to alcohol and don't know your limits.   Your friends are the assholes for pressuring you into drinking. It sounds like you didn't want to drink but wound up doing so out of peer pressure. And pressuring unwilling people into drinking is never OK.	1640898597.0	hqlgnmm	t3_rs9idj	t3_rs9idj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs9idj/aita_for_getting_drunk_and_humiliating_my_husband/hqlgnmm/

If I was a surgeon and I pierced an adult’s ears under general anesthetic, everyone would be horrified and ‘lots of people have pierced ears, it’s normal, and they don’t remember it happening/didn’t feel any pain’ wouldn’t be a very valid excuse for changing somebody else’s body.

If she earns lesser, it makes sense for her to spend lesser but the percentage of both incomes spent should be similar.  (Eg: if you earn 10k and spend 4k, she must expect to shell out 2k from her 5k)  INFO: What does your mom do?	1640901143.0	hqln4np	t3_rsd0yz	t3_rsd0yz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rsd0yz/aita_for_not_paying_my_sister_half_of_the/hqln4np/
1hxws185	 Your not an asshole maybe just a bit of a sap no offense intended.   But she’s is with you for your financial stability. If she’s not offered to pay her way in 50/50 for all things utility or thing that are disposable/degradable then that is a clear cut sign she’s only in it for self value, and I can tell you her argument would be “I don’t own any thing here, if you leave me o will lose everything” how do I know I’m her on the opposite side of the coin, My girlfriend owns her house and I live here rent free, but from day 1 I’ve accepted that she wants to do it her way and have her own home and as such I have and stand by paying 50/50 on everything utility - food, electrical domestics, water, gas, car fuel, take aways, bedding, covers, dog food - even though it was me that wanted the dogs she’s still pays 50% of the vet bills because we are on the same page we look at things with the same picture in actuality the only thing we don’t share 50/50 on is the Electricity bill because I work from home I pay that 70/30 basically if we can spilt it we do I only refuse to pay the mortgage because as your misses might argue I wouldn’t see a return in my amount paid in because I don’t own or have a mention in the ownership of the house.  I don’t do it out of generosity it’s understanding that a relationship is a situation of compromise and being the person willing to stand in the others shoes, if it was me owning the house I would expect her to own up to what I am doing and I trust that she would. So much so that with our daughter due in May I have told her and will stand my ground on it that she can take 1 year unpaid leave after her Maternity and I will cover the mortgage and all of the bills why say that when I argued I wouldn’t get a return on that? Well my daughter needs her mum for that first year so I’m not investing in the mortgage I’m giving my daughter everything she needs until she’s old enough to be taken into day care or I can watch her at home will I am working.   For further context we took some friends to a very high end Chinese restaurant and let them order as they pleased. I used a benefits card I get from work to pay the 300€ bill and when we got home my girlfriend transferred me the 150€ for her and her friend.	1640902198.0	hqlpsf0	t3_rs71rq	t3_rs71rq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs71rq/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_will_no/hqlpsf0/

That said if you are driving so slowly that you impede the flow of traffic to the extent they can overtake you then that may be an issue.  The only reason not to feel in control of a car in a national speed limit zone is because its country roads so shouldn’t be driven at 60mph or you are an inexperienced driver who hasn’t got experience driving at that speed.  Also i don’t think any roads have a speed limit of 55…  Your mum isn’t a safe driver if they never drive at the speed limit. They are an unconfident driver. Drivers without confidence tend to hesitate and do unexpected things which is specifically what causes accidents. Just because she has never been in an accident doesn’t mean she is safe, it just means she is lucky. Plenty of accidents happen regardless of how people are driving.	1640905198.0	hqlx81m	t3_rse5sq	t3_rse5sq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rse5sq/aita_for_not_wanting_to_drive_too_slowly_on_a_two/hqlx81m/

I remember EVERY single comment about my body made by the people near me. I remember my classmate in HS telling me my butt is big when I gained a little. I remember (and use as "fuel") my 2 BIL telling my SO that they think I'm pregnant because my boobs were bigger (I broke down crying, I gained 2!! Kg..), i look in the mirror and see my puffy cheeks and want to purge until my stomach is out. I cut when I'm frustrated because I'm not losing fast enough. My throat hurts. My teeth are fucked. My hair is falling. I'm scared I'll die while I puke, the same way some girl did some time ago (look her up, there are images). And I haven't been bullied. Now imagine all that, but while some girl constantly makes remarks at you. Because no matter how many people will tell you that you're beautiful, you'll only focus on the bad comments.  Sure, this post might be fake, but I hold bullies accountable for the suicides of their victims. and no, Becky, or anyone with bulimia, can't just stop puking, you can't make a person with PTSD suddenly be okay with their triggers. Eating disorders are complicated, they have the highest death rate compared to any mental disorder, and recovery takes years.	1640905430.0	hqlxse6	t3_rs6den	t1_hqlgz9o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs6den/aita_for_telling_a_woman_i_hope_shes_nicer_to_her/hqlxse6/

The other night I had sleep paralysis where I was convinced someone in the form of a dark shadow stood in the doorway, slowly approaching me, stroking my hair, then slowly pressing down on me and all I can say is I felt like I was about to be killed.

aakmfkuq	I don’t know if the volunteering thing is that great of an idea for a punishment and probably should have been done before this happened with all of the kids to show them what people go through with pity rather than hatred/irritation. Also how long are you keeping the electronics and what are they? You’re definitely NTA, but there might be some problems here. The apology and taking care of herself are perfect, but make sure the dog is taken care of and she doesn’t neglect them. I’m assuming she knows how to do these things. Be careful about automatically believing your nanny. Either this is a common thing with your daughter and you haven’t been paying attention or she snapped for whatever reason. For the former, that would also indicated that you don’t know what the nanny is doing either. For the latter, you should keep an eye out to see if your daughter is overwhelmed with something in her life, doesn’t know how to handle her emotions properly, et cetera (none of these things excuse her behavior).   TLDR: NTA but the punishment has some potential problems. The post doesn’t have a lot of information in it so I’ll just say it might be a good idea to pay more attention to both of them and not believe your nanny immediately.	1640908208.0	hqm4iy9	t3_rs96kt	t3_rs96kt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs96kt/aita_for_the_punishment_i_gave_my_daughter/hqm4iy9/

hfeokrfs	I pay the bills. I am currently in paid maternity leave and I will be returning to work in February.  During the day I care for my daughter let's say 70-80% of the time. He watches her if I have to do cooking or cleaning. At night my daughter is 100% my responsibility since she only sleeps with me. In regards to keeping his money all to himself I am not sure because I never ask how much money he has. Like I know he receives a significant amount of money from his mom but I do not check his wallet nor have access to his bank account( I don't find this appropriate). My money goes on bills, the bank loan that I took to buy my house, daughter's needs, books and whatever is there left to buy something for me or for the house. He is in charge of buying groceries and contributes to what it is spent for our daughter.  From my income, around 60% goes to the loan and the bills. Like I said in another comments, my frustrations are in regards to: 1. Him gaming all night( at least 6h a night) and sleeping all day after 2. Spending ridiculous amounts of money on himself because unlike me, he does not have debs for the house. Since the house is legally just mine, he will not help with the loan so that's on me. Even though he lives in this house. The situation is pretty ridiculous and I did not really want to give so much info, but the post I made is unclear due to lack of details so I am just trying to clear things out.	1640908244.0	hqm4m52	t3_rs6jkf	t1_hqm2zfn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rs6jkf/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_husband_for_buying_2500/hqm4m52/

The “bully” comment comes from the way my mother used to talk about her and her brother when my sister and I grew up. Seeing herself in my sister I think my mum would tell me off the way she wishes her brother was; when she was growing up she was the unfavored child. - just a theory of mine   Truth is, in my sisters words I’m “the weaker one” I’m no good in confrontation, horrible at being mean and I’m dreadful at quick whips.

You are seeing your older daughters treatment of her younger sister as malicious and intentional instead of trying to see the HURT BEHAVIOUR behind it.  I agree with the golden child/scapegoat analysis because of the comment that your younger daughter has  DONE NOTHING WRONG  No child has done nothing wrong. I have three and for every conflict there are so many moving parts. So many places I COULD lay blame. But ultimately siblings work out their conflicts with one another.   It is our job as parents to not take sides but to address the underlying issues.   Sounds like your eldest feels like she is NOT the favourite child at best, and the unloved child at worst.   Your eldest daughter isn't the problem. She is HAVING problems. Help her solve them. The human brain doesn't fully develop until 25! And it does some weird stuff during the term years.

We don’t know if OP kick her out first and then she sued for inheritance but according to the storyline, she sued first of course it’s going to back fire on her and that’s what i meant by she had it coming. He didn’t take everything from her, the will said everything belong to him and it’s his father’s fault for not updating the will but I can’t blame the deceased here.   I’m speaking from OP’s experience. His action is justified and it makes sense. No one is going to have their arms open for their deceased parent’s partner to stay rent free (for a while) after being sued over inheritance unless they miraculously have the heart to do that. Moreover, OP doesn’t owe her anything. I stand by what I said, that woman was naive (or was a leech i don’t know) for expecting too much and 100% financially dependent on her boyfriend. It’s on her for not having any savings and she has no shame since she expected her partner’s son to sympathize for her and her sick mother after suing him. This is real life, not everything is in her favor. Yes, she might have meant something to his father, doesn’t mean that she has to mean something to OP. To OP, she was his father’s girlfriend, nothing less, nothing more. She might’ve done something for his father but we don’t know if she has done anything for OP, therefore he doesn’t owe her an once of compassion.	1640913119.0	hqmg6lg	t3_rrdti6	t1_hqmboak	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rrdti6/aita_for_making_my_dads_girlfriend_pay_rent_when/hqmg6lg/

For example, Job descriptions are often HR documents where they cover all the basis for every single person in that company with that title. My job description says that I might be in a lab setting up to 75% of my time. I haven’t been in the lab in two years because of my specific role in my specific department. Other people in my position in different departments are though. So the descriptions have to say that. Being able to do some physical tasks might also be expected SOME times and almost every HR description has to include that. Also, the company probably want you to live close to the office so when they bring people back, they can do that easily.   So they could’ve been telling you the truth. Or  could’ve explained the differences and cleared up any discrepancies.

69howvl2	I'm not saying that at all.  I'm saying that unless a parent can literally watch their child 100% of the time it is *impossible* to prevent them from having sex.    Repressive parenting behaviours like preventing your child from being in a room alone in your house with a boy only serve to make your child feel ashamed if they are having sex (meaning they won't talk to you) and to push them into having sex somewhere else, which can often be much more dangerous.    The vast majority of American families (at least until recently) have approached this issue by repressing their children, and experiencing abuse during childhood is alarmingly common - it's *clearly* not working.  The best way to keep a child safe is to foster an environment where they can be honest with you.  At 11, I'm definitely not saying you should just "let" a kid have sex - but if your kid is trying to do so the correct response is to take them to a therapist and engage in an open conversation with them so you can find out what is going on (and in the case of grooming by an older person, you can find out who to report), not punish them.  When I was 13 and being abused, my parents went with the punishment route instead of actually asking me what was going on and it left me in danger and just guaranteed I would never talk to them about it again - this shouldn't happen to anyone.	1641132673.0	hqxogfj	t3_rt7nbf	t1_hqww0a3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rt7nbf/aita_for_grounding_my_daughter_for_sneaking_a_boy/hqxogfj/

A story for some context: my grandfather used to make waffles and claimed it was an old family recipe that he wouldn’t part with. When he came down with cancer and we were spending our last Christmas with him, I begged him to give me the recipe so I could be the one to make the waffles when he was gone. He refused. On the second to last day I was there, he admitted the “secret recipe” was in the back of the waffle iron that my grandmother bought him in the 50s. Did it change how good the waffles were? No. If anything, it made it an even better story, and my brother and cousins and I can all make the recipe for our families when we need to remember or just want some great waffles.

While you wife waxed nostalgic about family it came to a head emotionally for him.   You should be addressing your son being alienated and, instead, you alienated him further.   Your son is adult aged and you should not be surprised when he goes no contact with all of you for his own mental health.	1641138443.0	hqy09dx	t3_ru89xu	t3_ru89xu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ru89xu/aita_for_refusing_to_force_my_son_to_apologize_to/hqy09dx/

I haven’t had a place in my childhood home in 19 years (yeah, do that math),  and it still hurts, so have fun with the hurt you gave your daughter to carry being here years later.    Just selfish and sad. Your job is to take care of your kids. Just because she isn’t under 18 anymore doesn’t magically make her stop being your flesh and blood that you should care about. Sadly you appear to be the kind of person who will not understand this as your emotional intelligence seems to be nil.    Good luck with your future loneliness.

You and your family are living in the past and your close minded , rigid adherence to tradition is destroying your relationships with your sister and her husband.

3qkvesiy	Hey so I dunno if anyone has mentioned this yet (I haven't read all the comments) but pooping while pregnant is probably more common then you might think. While I haven't experienced it personally my mom went through it when she was pregnant with me in delivery. She would laugh and tell me the story about her being very embarrassed but the nurses ensured her that because of the amount of pressure your using to push out the baby your colon muscles can sometimes relax enough to release excrement in the process. Try to not get upset at yourself for having a pregnancy poop! That being said though the way your husband treated you because of it is extremely inappropriate, imagine making your wife feel bad about something she couldn't control and making jabs at you like there was something wrong with you. It wasn't an 'accident' it was your body pushing out a baby. I hope maybe that he could educate himself if you guys plan on having more children.	1641145063.0	hqygtrq	t3_ru7yin	t3_ru7yin	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ru7yin/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_infront_of_his/hqygtrq/

2mdtgqle	I'm a South Asian afab, and honestly reading the comments here boils my fucking blood. I've grown up in a more rural area and currently live in a more metropolitan area (so I have experienced both), and have known of dowry related deaths/harassment since childhood. Just search "dowry India/Pakistan", "dowry deaths/suicide India/Pakistan", and see the results. I can even link some articles here if necessary.  So many ignorant people so eager to blanket defend at times horrendous "cultural" practices (which is outlawed in my country btw, but still gets practiced under the covers)... all for the sake of what? Showing off their "progressiveness"? Easing their white guilt? Honestly I'd rather these people just shut up rather than spout their faux woke bullshit.

I’ve been friends with her since I was 18, she was my first friend in this town, and I offered her the room during the pandemic when her landlord decided to move back into the house.	1641145240.0	hqyha1a	t3_rueac6	t1_hqygn28	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rueac6/wibta_for_taking_clothes_from_a_trans_woman/hqyha1a/
ern20s1	I have never given birth but have heard that this is a really common thing to happen. All those muscles down there are connected - just pushing vaginally is impossible. Have you ever gone #1 and ended up either farting or doing a #2 at the same time?   I may not know entirely what to expect during birth, I just know there ends up being a whole lot fluids and what not released while giving birth and all that is totally normal.    Your husband is being a grade - A dick and AH here.  Google it (BMs during Birth) and have him read up on it.  I would also consider not having sex with him again until he apologizes to you in front of his whole family.   Normally I wouldn't advocate withholding sex as punishment (that's a whole different can of worms) but here's my line of thought with that.   He's so concerned about you having another accident - well the only way that will happen is if you get pregnant again and have another child with him. Best way to avoid pregnancy is no sex.	1641145254.0	hqyhbcr	t3_ru7yin	t1_hqxc8n2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ru7yin/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_husband_infront_of_his/hqyhbcr/

So relax and chill stressing out won’t help over something that if you look at it from the outside is both stupid and foolish to overthink.

OP and family definitely sound like the type of "respect/participate in my patriarchal customs!" people I dislike immensely, but I finally gave the NTA anyways because I felt that sister the sister couldn't have it both ways (like benefit from their- patriarchal- customs while not following them) I guess? However I can definitely see your point too!   Best thing would've been if both sides sat down, discussed and reasoned though the customs and practices *both sides* were comfortable following through.

You shouldn't let anyone take advantage of you, however, when you sell something, it no longer belongs to you and you need to return it back to the owner. It is because you have put a price tag on your product, the consumer has every right to test, critique, and feedback on the said product. If you don't want your work to be critiqued, then don't sell them.

That your sister married outside of the culture and didn’t follow an old custom? Sorry that’s her choice not anyone else’s. As a westerner the dowry thing really cuts at my values, guessing it would at the husband’s as well. You have no right to get upset about this IMO.  The rest of it - sounds like the husband is an AH for the first name thing, that would be pretty easy for him to do. And the sister is possibly an asshole for not properly communicating what is expected. You are correct that your sister chose this path and shouldn’t be surprised about not getting a cow slaughtered for her, so yeah she’s an asshole for getting upset and talking about preferential treatment.

16j9q5	Yeah, as Alex was saying, I am one of the Christians that left the church because of the constant hypocrisy.   I had one pastor growing up, and he *embodied* the concept of "Christ is Love". He wasn't biased with his preaching, his views felt like the pinnacle of what I truly felt the Church should be. The type of pastor that also burns out quickly. (I found out that he is no longer a pastor because of the political side of it.)  But it was the politics and hypocrisy that infuriated me. The head pastor when the *good* pastor was there was the ultimate political mover. Everything had to have a motive, a hook and line attached. His wife was the absolute negative stereotype of "Pastor's Wife" who cultivated rumors and gossip to intimidate and control what her husband could not. The head pastor actually ran the good pastor off.  The fact that politics even play a role in the Church makes me intensely upset. The fact that these pastors call themselves "counselors" when they receive **nothing** in the way of psychological training unless they go out of their way to get it. And then, of course, the hypocrisy of preaching about Love, when they all seem to spew hate and intolerance.	1641150411.0	hqyvccg	t3_ru89xu	t1_hqyswfp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ru89xu/aita_for_refusing_to_force_my_son_to_apologize_to/hqyvccg/
77giowv0	YTA - So is your husband. You owe your brother in law an apology and your husband owes you one.   Your husband shouldn’t be coming in and asking you to make drinks for anyone, he could do it himself, so that makes him the AH.   You are an AH for your lack of understanding and empathy. It’s been a month, and all he talks about is his wife? Of course. Wow, OP.   (My husband things that it is E S H because the brother in law asked to stay but then brought a ton of stuff and should be a better house guest, but I disagree. Your brother in law doesn’t suck, just the two people he is staying with, but mostly you!)	1641150411.0	hqyvcdi	t3_ruen7w	t3_ruen7w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ruen7w/aita_for_calling_my_widowed_bil_a_moocher_after/hqyvcdi/

Hell, when I was OPs daughter age (I'm 30 now) and working full-time at $8/hr I was required to pay $400/month in rent on top of covering my own groceries, phone bill, etc. That paltry $100/week went towards electricity, water, insurance, rates, etc, and was a lot cheaper than when I moved out and started renting. My parents covered my costs when I was studying full-time.   There is an awful lot of privilege in this thread. Kids aren't the only ones being affected by this shit house of an economy, parents are seeing their savings take hits too, and I think OPs arrangement is more than fair.	1641150535.0	hqyvorw	t3_rty7o4	t1_hqyszqq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rty7o4/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter19_move_back_in/hqyvorw/

I think it takes a level of maturity to accept that some decisions should be made with a focus on the long term. If it's the dad's girlfriend, different story. But this is a fiance, likely to be married soon. OP will have to deal with this woman for a potential long time. Best to try to improve the relationship with the fiance than exclude her father from her life. Unless that's what OP really wants to do.

I just wanted to say that OP did ask, it's not like OP didn't do it at all. I felt like you thought OP didn't say a word to him. I agree that OP should have been harsher. Idk what's up with people not setting hard boundaries with these instances. I see a lot of people come to reddit with their stories but no, they think acting up is "too much". I find that weird. If it was me I'd have made a mess out of this the first time. While I lived for a while at some relatives (crowded place) I'd wash my own stuff (to not get lost in their endless clothing) and hang them somewhere separate so it wouldn't cause confusion. Somehow at first my inner garments took up wings and flew 😂 they were marked (I stitch square roots in them) When I asked for those things they had no clue even tho they hadn't done laundry for a few days to be confused with mine still, I asked them if they had accidentally put them among their own things and my cousin blew up at me saying almost all of her inner garments had been lost and she never said a word so I should get over it because it's 'normal'. Idk why she got so protective like that. Needless to say I made sure I got those back. Another time my mum had sent two large bags our way with food and snacks (she supports them financially and with groceries) and one of my hats I'd left home for me. I wasn't home when they got them and by the time I got back they'd ravaged those bags and no hat to be found. Kept saying they hadn't seen a hat even though they'd all been in the room when they opened the bags. Kept putting my foot down until it was 'found'. But goddamn if my food gets eaten. Lo and behold the hell that'll break loose. No one touches my things.

OP even admitted they shouldn't have used the word violent. I'm not trying to be condescending I just wanted more details on what this teacher said to the students.  *"im pretty sure they know how they feel better than you do"*  This is literally a subreddit designed to ask for other people's opinions on a situation. I couldn't give mine until I got all the details. I even admitted the teacher was inappropriate for yelling about her depression to the kids.

5gcdlwi	INFO Is there a reason that she thought you'd kick her out for this? Like is there precedent there?  Aside form that question, this is one of those times where I'm very confused about what people actually wanted you to do here.  In my opinion, excusing yourself to manage your emotions was the proper course of action. People can't help if they're upset in a moment, so removing yourself from a situation to calm down is the correct thing to have done.  As for that tattoo, everyone's right that you have no say in what she puts on her body. However I think it's shortsighted on her part. I also think that it's one of those things that could go very wrong very easily as lots of people would have issues with someone getting a commemorative tattoo of them. Like if my cousin gave me a present of having my name, birth stone, and birth flower tattooed on their body I'd find it super weird. I would distance myself from that person because it would be uncomfortable for me.   So if your MIL was acting with pure intentions to get a deeper bond with you I think she was fucked over by everyone who said it was a good idea. It would really suck to so something with the hope of getting closer with someone only to have that action push them away. I say if, because apparently your husband was already telling his mom that it was inappropriate before you even excused yourself. That does not speak well on her intentions if he also thought it crossed a boundary before you even discussed it.  In isolation of the comment about being kicked out, her comment about wanting to be your mom comes off as unaware at best in my opinion. The way you framed it makes it seem like this is not the first time she's expressed this to you. The thing is, that's not really a role that you can ask for. In my opinion it's just one that happens over time as two people become close. And I think it's really manipulative for her to use the desire to fill that role as an excuse when she did something that made both you and your husband uncomfortable	1642544820.0	ht8ljap	t3_s729ie	t3_s729ie	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s729ie/aita_for_hating_my_mils_tattoo/ht8ljap/

One time she purposely threw a basketball at the back of her ‘best friends’ head during gym class and claimed she was trying to make a basket and then confessed she was mad that she was hanging out with the another girl. She also put gum in the other girls hair when she was sitting behind her in class. I want to say she was in 6th or 7th grade when this occurred. She got suspended from school for 3 days. Her mother didn’t discipline her instead told her she should’ve made a scene and publicly embarrassed the girl.	1642552500.0	ht94elm	t3_s78s09	t1_ht91id5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s78s09/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_either_takes/ht94elm/

k1a6f	NTA but know it can be hard to get a job right now in some cases. November/December is a terrible time for hiring except seasonal retail workers. My advice is to tell her that she has like 1-3 months to find a job. If she fails to get one, then she will be extremely restricted in the house. You won't pay any bills for her (cell phone) she won't be allowed wifi or internet unless supervised job hunting. And other privileges removed. It will just be room and food and little else. The reason is that if she has no job and you push her into the street at 20 years old, that's a bad situation for her. She could be forced to become a stripper or prostitute or some other bad situation. You'll just make it so miserable and boring to live with you that she'll either get a job or find a way to move out. But you won't be kicking her out. It have been all her choice.

awha2bt9	NTA!! at all! im 19f and would avoid going to school as much as i could for years because my mental health was in terrible condition, it ended up becoming so severe that I had to leave halfway through my last year and delay my uni plans while i focus on rehab (still ongoing). anything you can do to avoid that happening is good for you, but if something like that ends up happening anyway thats also ok. the people who struggle very badly with mental health during school cant operate the same way their peers do and you may even need to completely restructure how you go about school to help alleviate some of the pressure on your mental health. you could try to talk to the school and get their support to talk to your parents to understand the gravity of your situation so that you can make the right changes. as someone who delayed it for years because i thought i had no other choice than to attend school like everyone else while i was severely depressed, you NEED to find support and try to make changes. if attending school is at the centre of your stress, it is not worth it to keep going despite your mental health!

Yes it's very unfortunate that I don't know but this post has opened my eyes that I should really learn. I've never come across this situation before and no one has ever shown me how to boost a car before and I've never witnessed it either. I'm honestly wondering how I've gone this long and never encountered it until now! I use an electofisher at work and I know the potential dangers of electricity so I guess out of an abundance of caution, I went straight to worst possible outcome.	1642548390.0	ht8ukdd	t3_s763xo	t1_ht81ai8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s763xo/aita_for_refusing_to_jump_start_my_husbands_car/ht8ukdd/

The car cost $38,000, the new car he bought himself to have as a second car cost $60,000. He himself said it was a gift…  He was very firm in saying that I needed to pay all of it. No room for discussion on that. Entitled for not wanting to pay for a gift that I clearly expressed I didn’t want?

gya5jdm	NTA  But I think your mom should have confronted your dad about this two years ago. If she’d said “You gotta do a better job of hiding this stuff next time our kid visits. Make sure that one door is locked and make sure ALL posters with the name of your party are taken down”, then maybe you wouldn’t have had to miss 2 whole years with your dad.  Honestly I can see why your dad would be upset. Leaving a normally-locked door unlocked and leaving up an “only flush toilet paper please” poster with a Google-able name on it could be honest mistakes if he was cleaning the house in a rush. (I’m assuming the cage thing was just a photo you found online.)  To miss two whole years with your kid because one time you cleaned the house in a hurry? That’s awful.  It’s not good that he flew off the handle and called your mom names, but it’s also very not good that your mom waited two whole years to tell him why you weren’t visiting.  As for not wanting to sleep in a bed that someone else has slept in… it’s totally understandable that a 13 year old would feel that way. But realistically, if you’ve ever slept in a hotel bed it’s exactly the same thing.	1642700918.0	hthhvtq	t3_s8lsgt	t3_s8lsgt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8lsgt/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_dads_house_on_the/hthhvtq/

b3nvi0f	As a foreigner that moved to the us a couple years ago and has been dating a chicana for the past year... I've noticed Americans seem to have a sort of idea about race and culture that to them is all-encompassing across the world. To Americans there are only a handful of "races" and everyone falls inside that category in one way or another.   To me I'd say its this:  White = anglo-germanic / European  Latino = a mestizo from Mexico or Puerto Rico  Brown/Middle eastern = Greeks, arabs, Persians, central   Asians, and even INDIANS fall under this category it seems  Black = anyone who has any African blood (even just a tiny bit)  Asian = any east Asian (Japan, Indonesia, Philippines, Korea)  To me (in my experience) most Americans don't really seem to understand that the world is much more complicated than that outside of the us and if someone doesn't easily fall into one of those categories they'll be all confused and ask why you're not the stereotypical example of that category??	1642717000.0	htiokhl	t3_s8rf1r	t3_s8rf1r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8rf1r/aita_for_refusing_to_embrace_africanamerican/htiokhl/

47pkhwn	I'd like to give a slightly different perspective on this.  I totally understand why everyone is upset with Fran. She overstepped boundaries and the public call out was not necessary. But I wonder if you would have reacted differently if she had spoken to you individually and said that what you said hurt her? Especially since you had reservations from the beginning.   I understand that for single parents the bond between mother and son is very special. But your son is also a mature adult and needs to be able to navigate these decisions on his own.   I would take a step back and rather than "figure it out together" that you let Fran and your son figure it out on their own. I understand you had your reservations regarding the relationship but I'd ask you to take an honest look at how much was wanting your son to go to school, and how much of it was really you simply not believing they would work/approving the relationship.  I personally just wouldn't be OK with knowing I had a huge influence on my sons decision to end something when what he really needed was time away from everyone to figure things out on his own.   Just my two cents. If he comes to you great, but this is thier relationship. I personally wonder why he even told her at all what you said? But nothing really changes the divide that now exists here with everyone.

I grew up in a very similar situation to Ruth, and as a young girl, knowing that one of my parents didn't love me was more hurtful, more heartbreaking than I can even begin to put into words. But no matter what was going on with my parents, with my horrible mother, my grandparents on both sides were absolutely ride or die for me and my sister. I can honestly say I would not have made it to adulthood without them, the most cherished loves of my life. In taking in Ruth and Josie, and caring for them the way you have, and continue to do, not only have you helped ease the burden of that pain for Ruth, but you have taught her what it really means to be family. You're the best kind of grandparents. Sorry your son is such a jerk though, that sucks.	1642721355.0	htixf5y	t3_s8uw0w	t3_s8uw0w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8uw0w/aita_for_telling_my_son_id_rather_have_his_ex/htixf5y/

On top of that your mother wouldn’t pay for your college because of debt? Clearly you haven’t been her priority. I know that Americans think that its ok to make their kids finance their college on their own with some minimum wage job but I think that’s very wrong. Imagine the kind of stress that you put your child through. I think that it’s every parents duty to save for their child’s college. I would have done something similar if I were in your position.

d0ct7v5g	I’m really similar to you, in that I get frustrated quite easily. Over the years I’ve realised most of the time I get over the frustration (or sometimes sadness) fairly quickly, so I just stay quiet for 10/15 minutes until I calm down.   My BF used to also get annoyed with this at the start of our relationship (2yrs ago) and eventually I just sat him down and explained that if I’m ever annoyed with him I’ll tell him directly, and promised him that. Outside of that, I told him sometimes I just need 10 minutes. Since then, when it’s happened he’ll notice and give me that time. If we’re together we’ll just play on our phones or watch TV, and if we’re on the phone he’ll just tell me to call him back when I’m feeling better.   Just talk to him, when you’re not angry and he’s not angry either. I can see both sides of the issue  *Edit - I probably shouldn’t have assumed you also get frustrated easily, so sorry haha.

fvbj3zus	YTA.  Your daughter listened to what you said and took responsibility for herself and your son was rewarded for doing less.  It is not difficult to see that him "following his passion" is the only "privilege" here. Actually a bit taken that you believe her working at 14 and limiting her college experience due to the fear of debt that you instilled in her is a "privilege." The responsible one is bearing the burden.  To be fair, there is no issue with how you parented your son...if he were an only child. Though for some reason, he has been given more for doing less.  The only gesture would be to calculate every dollar (insurance, loan, etc.) that he had the "privilege" of receiving after the equal $2k and give that to your daughter. WITH NO EXPECTATIONS.

2xsiozra	Pretty much how it was with my siblings and I. Two younger siblings never worked in high school or college, while I had to quit a few things in high school to work. They both had cars over 10k  bought for them. One sister got pretty much a brand new car in college because she didn’t like the car she had in high school anymore. My dad did get the loan for my car. Imagine being handed a car payment book at 17. LOL. It did help me manage money, though. Oh the stories I could tell!

4yuds8ti	I’m curious what the other reasons were for her to ‘cut off’ her parents, as well as what exactly ‘cutting off’ means.  Beyond that, working a full time job while going to school is not a privilege. It’s a huge sacrifice. Did she also get an allowance to go out with friends and such despite this ‘privilege’? Did you never think that she had the same rights to pursue special talents and interests, or free time to be a kid and hang with friends, or believe college was an option?  Also how is the son paying for college?	1642730269.0	htjideo	t3_s8wtd9	t3_s8wtd9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8wtd9/aita_for_buying_my_son_a_car_and_not_my_daughter/htjideo/

b00nhcl8	I want them to say yes or no or decide to do something themselves. Yesterday my partner suggested we watch a movie, I said ok. Then because I didn't pick the movie for them, they put the laptop away rather than pick a movie they wanted to watch. Or if my partner is hungry and I ask them what they want to eat, they say "idk" and if I say "well idk either" they get hangry lol. If we are walking on the street deciding on dinner if they brought it up first, if i say i'll eat anything my partner will say they don't care either, but wont point out a restaurant while also complaining that theyre hungry. The burden of decisionmaking and planning always falls on me, but my partner doesnt even give a direction for me to work with.   The concern is i dont know what they want to do, i now also am in limbo in terms of how to plan my eating (i am in recovery for an ED, my partner knows this and thats why sometimes i have to figure out whats going on so i dont trigger it). I am concerned it would come off as petty to not just explain how im feeling to my partner, and just order food now since they havent indicated whether they want to do it or not. If they were at least to say no then i could just move on.	1642732081.0	htjmjbd	t3_s8wdz0	t1_htjjgbb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8wdz0/wibta_if_i_ordered_my_own_food/htjmjbd/

Every kid who wants to dive asks me to check the spot out from below if they climbed a high thing and then realized they haven't checked the depth. 14 is Darwin award territory for stupid water antic. However, the issue is the helicopter parents. You don't say "Don't jump off high stuff into water" you say "Oye, you muppet, get your ass down and check the depth. This camp will never happen again if someone breaks their damn neck and drowns"   If the parents weren't such lazy bastards she'd have had basic water safety skills.	1642732183.0	htjmrsg	t3_s8oem6	t1_hti3w76	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8oem6/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_put_all_their/htjmrsg/

Because my father knows I can be counted on to help the family not just with his resources, but my own. I guess what I am trying to say is, it may not be as straightforward as “give the most to those who need it”. Inheritance has the undertone of trust and love and other such emotional issues.

Conversations happen between people.   You state that you are happy to talk with people outside of class.  Perhaps your focus for the remainder of class should be on shifting your mindset rather than getting out of group work.   I get social anxiety, but it seems like you have some sort of resentment in this particular class with this particular teacher and you may be able to duplicate how you do in other settings if you are able to let some of that go.	1642738418.0	htk0p6x	t3_s8xnru	t3_s8xnru	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8xnru/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_group_work/htk0p6x/

53oskzg2	It depends on how serious you are with your boyfriend. You're certainly under no obligation to consider his needs, but if it would have been nice since he's 6'2". As far as his kids go, it seems like buying a car that small is pretty much sending the message that you don't want to get involved with them. Which doesn't make you an AH by any stretch of the imagination. It just seems like he thought the relationship was more than you think it is. . .   As far as his comments about the car being "Me! Me! Me!" well.. . yeah, and so? He can get the message instead of being snippy about it. As others have noted since he didn't contribute any money to the purchase there's no reason it should have been an "us" moment	1642742263.0	htk8brf	t3_s8rvpj	t3_s8rvpj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8rvpj/aita_for_buying_two_of_the_same_small_car_instead/htk8brf/

ij24j	I'm in the US and I used to work at a nightclub that served alcohol. We were allowed to drink as much as we wanted, given we could handle our shit, knew our limits, and paid for it ourselves. No outside alcohol could be brought in.   The bartenders also were allowed to cut us off if they felt we'd had too much to drink.  The company had us employed as independent contractors so I think that's how they got around it. It meant if we got hurt it wasn't on them, because technically we weren't "employees" so workers' comp wasn't a thing.  I could see similar things happening at breweries, bars or any business where the focus is alcohol, so it's not completely unheard of here.	1642745126.0	htkdhji	t3_s8mhuh	t1_htj71q8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8mhuh/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_employee_time_off/htkdhji/

Since she also works and doesn't take care of your kids, tell her to get a babysitter when she wants to go to the bar. She's not contributing to the household expenses, she can afford a babysitter.

7bcr69do	I can't understand stepmom's logic.  * "I did *so much* for this family!" I fucked a married man, caused a divorce and a custody battle for the daughter, both of which turned daughter's life upside down! Shouldn't they be grateful for my services?" * "I can't trust my husband to look after our child for 10 minutes, but I still chose to have children with him! TWICE!"  OP, you do not owe Susie anything.  * You're a child, not a free babysitter. While it's reasonable for siblings to watch each other for 10 minutes, a) you're working, and b) you're justified in not seeing her as a sister. She's your (half-) sister in the same sense your dad is supporting you  - purely legal obligations, and nothing more. * As you yourself said, she could've asked her husband and May's dad to look after her, but she chose not to. If a parent is not qualified to look after their own child, that paent's other chld shouldn't be, either. He's not a drug addict. * She's asking for your favors in exchange for 'what she did for this family'. Did she mean destroying your family? Because that's what she did.  Please seek therapy, way more often that just once a month. This level of anger is not healthy for you. Is there anyone who can help you with this?	1642746777.0	htkg6y6	t3_s92wts	t1_htkbfh5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s92wts/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_wife_that_i_didnt/htkg6y6/

I have a half sister that way and while we aren't super close because we are 12 years apart she knows I love her and am there for her.

isfxzjvz	NAH   This is a difficult one because I can understand both sides. I can see why she would be hurt by not being invited but you deserve to have a fun party with your friends on your birthday without worrying about your wife not enjoying herself/feeling insecure. If she has given the go ahead that she’s happy for you to still have the party then wouldn’t cancel it, but don’t brag about it or anything (not that it seems like you would, you seem very considerate). It’s great that she is working on her insecurities in therapy, hopefully in time she will be more comfortable in those settings.	1642749284.0	htkjxqi	t3_s94usq	t3_s94usq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s94usq/wibta_if_i_dont_invite_my_wife_to_my_birthday/htkjxqi/
5v5e5a8q	Well, this gets into an entirely different story LOL  I got engaged in 2019 and we quickly decided to do a destination wedding and booked our trip. I asked her to be my bridesmaid then because she was one of my best friends at the time and she was adamant that she was going.  But, covid hit and our trip got cancelled. Our friendship started to fall apart but right before I booked it again she apologized for all of the issues we’ve had and things got better, so I kept her as a bridesmaid thinking we could repair our friendship but over the last few months it’s started to fall apart again. But, she’d already paid and I really just wanted to get through the wedding on good terms and go my own way after the wedding.	1642749406.0	htkk44g	t3_s93f63	t1_htkj915	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s93f63/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_friends_luggage_with/htkk44g/

I blocked him and told him no. After all the issues I’ve dealt with I decided no more Saint Berdoodles for SDs.  He attracted way too much attention.  Too many people wanting to take his pic or running up to grab him.  He was an awesome SD and broke my heart when he passed but it was really stressful dealing with people when all I’ve ever wanted was to go about my day in peace.  My new prospect is a white German shepherd.  Hoping people won’t automatically try and grab him since he isn’t as fluffy and cuddly looking compared to my last one.

You are old enough to decide which parent you want to live with and judges will take that into consideration when they issue their custody order. If you want to live with your mom full time (this wasn’t clear from your post), your mom can petition the court to have the custody and child support agreement changed. If you live with your mother full time, your father is legally REQUIRED to pay child support. It’s not optional. Until it’s changed, you need to abide by the agreement because if your mother doesn’t comply, she is legally responsible since you are a minor. It sounds like you’d be better off not staying with them and I know that no one wants to go to court but it might be worth it for your mental health.	1642762923.0	htl1pdd	t3_s92wts	t3_s92wts	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s92wts/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_wife_that_i_didnt/htl1pdd/

What he did was wrong but also parents suck at times and he didn’t even know what he did wrong for 5 years so he could try to fix it. The mom should have at least told him when she found out so he could make a change. If he didn’t change after his mistake was pointed out then no contact makes sense.   I grew up with a gaslighting narcissist who I am low contact with now. I get that sometimes parents just suck but as a current teacher I’ve learned that some parents don’t realize that they suck until you tell them exactly what they are doing wrong.   15yr old may not be the asshole but both parents are.	1642766443.0	htl6nfn	t3_s8lsgt	t1_htkrib3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s8lsgt/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_dads_house_on_the/htl6nfn/

YEs what she said could have been harmful but you reprimanded her on the spot and she apologised, you've then gone out of your way and manipulated the situation to get the girl fired? That is gross.	1642766518.0	htl6ris	t3_s98s3t	t3_s98s3t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s98s3t/aita_for_leaving_a_bad_review_on_a_diner_and/htl6ris/
