glu4t2xq	>Not formed. Hamas won a democratic election. They did so because Hamas actually has an incredibly large civil service wing. They were providing a lot of the shelter, medical and food needs of people in Gaza, so people in Gaza liked and voted for them.  You're right, they were elected. That's kind of the scary part. They're not as humanitarian as you think. They steal money from civilians and use it for rockets into Israel. They use civilians as human shields. They are, by US legal definition, a terrorist group.   >Could we just not repeat blatant Israeli propaganda as if it were facts?  What propaganda? Hamas using human shields? That is a fact.  >This isn't the same as having a peace agreement.  >Like yeah, no shit Israel tends to agree to peace agreements when those agreements are almost always on their terms.

8zfrjw3	I think on some level you are right, OP. As the saying goes, sex is about everything but sex, meaning there's more going on in the minds of those in act. It's not just some mechanical process done by thoughtless drones. Sex is orchestrated by human who love to indulge in abstract thought and narrative often influenced by the context they find themselves in.      So naturally, sex is more of a representation or symbolic dance of ideas in a certain environment even when you just wanna get down and fuck.      Now this part might sound like I'm justifying the usage of aggressive sexual language, but I assure you I'm not. I am explaining what such aggressive language symbolizes, since language at its core is about turning an otherwise random group of sounds into a symbol that defines an idea.      Now what idea "getting fucked" symbolizes will vary depending on the person and context. In the context of consensual sex, I think the phrase generally represents receiving raw uninhibited carnal pleasure from another. For a lot of women, when they are in the context of consensual sex with someone they find attractive and comfortable with, this idea is very pleasurable. It is in no way othering to them, but sexual gratifying.      Where it becomes othering is when there is no attraction or comfort to be found in their partner or when the sex is outright nonconsensual. There's only disgust, anxiety, and trauma. Receiving their "raw uninhibited carnal pleasure" feels very unfulfilling to say the least. This is where I feel you are valid on your view, OP.      Anyway, I'm not sure if any of this will budge your view. Just thought I muse about the phrase you presented.	1640876456.0	hqjw60j	t3_rryt5i	t3_rryt5i	/r/changemyview/comments/rryt5i/cmv_the_way_we_use_sexual_language_is_deeply/hqjw60j/

c8ay6	What you mean to say is that it is absurd to enter into a relationship based on transactional exchanges and expect it to lead to an equal partnership with healthy boundaries.  The way you're describing the issue is problematic because you're couching it in terms that highlight and reflect the sexist outcomes of a provider/dependent arrangement.  It seems you're upset that transactional women haggle or set their price really high ("call the guy cheap"), but I think this is a symptom of the larger issue and is mostly besides the point... But I'm assuming you're not interested in a transactional relationship.  If that's the sort of relationship you are interested in, then I'd suggest that transactional women are allowed to set their price and transactional men are allowed to put a ceiling on what they'll pay.  For my part, I'd prefer to avoid transactions altogether.  It's easier to tell if someone loves you if they're not constantly asking you for gifts.  A week ago, I considered the idea of writing a CMV post about the female expectation that men be "adequate providers" to qualify as potential mates.  Although I do believe taking on the "provider" role in a relationship makes love untrustworthy ("do they stay with me for the money"), I ultimately rejected posting the opinion because part of the reason I hold this view is because I am not an overly wealthy man and dating apps make it clear that many women expect their next romance to lift them into a new tax bracket.  So, it's at least partly a rationalization of sour grapes.	1640879571.0	hqk3glx	t3_rrzncy	t3_rrzncy	/r/changemyview/comments/rrzncy/cmv_women_who_feel_entitled_that_guys_should_pay/hqk3glx/

dbb07lp0	This feels like a cookie cutter rant about cultural appropriation. One that has been made many, many, many, many times.  So how one sided is it exactly?   I hear/read/see more people bitch about the concept of cultural appropriation than the other side. In fact, I have never in my life seen an interaction where somebody got pissed at somebody or "called out" for cultural appropriation. I've only ever seen it third-hand online... And even then, mostly in the context of people mocking it or complaining about it.  So if you think it's super one sided the other way, I would suggest that you are just spending too much time online in certain circles where these interactions are being sought out and amplified for one reason or another.	1640881264.0	hqk7myj	t3_rs56oc	t3_rs56oc	/r/changemyview/comments/rs56oc/cmv_peoples_view_on_cultural_appropriation_show/hqk7myj/

America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so.

1i4rjbib	It’s my understanding that press very much can be arrested and convicted for breaking the same laws. In the case of civil unrest: they would need to prove that they were/weren’t engaging in the civil unrest and not just a bystander (similarly to how you and I can stand and watch while someone raids a liquor store). As far as curfew orders are concerned: it’s my understanding that curfews typically have a press exemption for people actively engaged in exercising their press freedoms and not other activities (investigative journalism where you are just watching wouldn’t be covered. But recording with your phone or journaling the series of events would be). There are currently some big constitutional fights going on about whether a curfew can be legal without allowing for people to exercise their freedoms, and it appears to be leaning in favor of it being unconstitutional.	1640882903.0	hqkbtnd	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqka6tl	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqkbtnd/
1i4rjbib	The two are disconnected: You can both be press and break laws/go to jail  for laws unrelated to your freedom to film. If there is evidence you smashed a window to climb through then started filming, you can go to jail for the window breakage even though you are exercising your first amendment right. Press is far from a get out of jail free card, which is why in cases like the capital riots, you won’t see any major news organization entering with the crowd, as there are a number of laws that can be broken that aren’t protected by 1A.	1640883579.0	hqkdkyo	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqkc7hl	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqkdkyo/
1i4rjbib	It’s not that everyone can be press, it’s that everyone is press, and can use the freedoms granted by that when they choose. In the case of your example: it would very likely be illegal for any press to unlawfully enter the building, there are no protections that protect press from trespassing laws. Calling yourself press, whether established or not, grants you zero extra protections other than to film/express yourself in public. Established press don’t have any additional freedoms or allowances that allow them to avoid arrest for any other laws, unless codified in the law that those exercising their 1A are exempt (see most curfew laws). To wrap it around your first point: no established or unestablished press has a right to unlawfully trespass. For example: the news can’t break into your backyard to film if police catch a criminal hiding back there.	1640884295.0	hqkfgjx	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqke8go	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqkfgjx/

4a3yu	As an Australian, I am currently living in a scenario where, at least in theory, I have access to everything you name, here.  I don't get free food, but I do get sufficient money that if I am willing to accept living in a one bedroom unit in the middle of nowhere, then I can feed myself.  I also have access to free health care, although I personally don't want to go anywhere near it, due to already having lost a kidney because of it.  This supposedly equitable system, however, is presided over by criminals; one of whom had to recently leave office due to a criminal investigation.  We have also experienced one of the most restrictive Covid lockdowns anywhere on the planet; and if Americans want to pass comment on it, you should remember that you don't live here, and you would not tolerate me passing comment on anything that happened in your country either.  There can never, and will never be a Socialist scenario without at least a degree of inprisonment for the entire population; and there will also never be a Socialist scenario where the provision of food and necessities will not be administered by the most evil members of the given society, as is currently the case in Australia.  Psychopaths will always gravitate to the management of such a system, because of their level of desire for complete control of everyone else; and there is no greater control of people in existence, than determining whether or not a person can eat.  Socialists themselves can often be compassionate people, and I recognise and acknowledge that; but because of their own compassion, they are incapable of recognising just how truly, indescribably monstrous those who would run a centralised Socialist scenario would be.

There's no logical reason the stories need to be told through exclusively white people, there's no way to logically get there when it's a fantasy story set in a fictional universe. Just because there's inspiration from predominately Caucasian societies doesn't change the reality that the need for exclusively white actors is a lie.  I get where you are coming from about the differences between Black Panther and Witcher, but what about if it were a Chinese story, say a Hollywood adaptation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms with a mostly white cast? Or speaking of movies that have been actually made, the 1956 Genghis Khan movie?

g2d45waj	You are right about the discrimination being true.  As for the second part, I think it is more productive to help fight discrimination that black people with natural hair face rather than to oppose white people that appropriate the hairstyles. Even if "everyone that is white benefits in someway from being white" is true (which I am doubtful about), it is unclear that getting mad at people who use those hairstyles without racist intent helps create much change other than some momentary stress relief about the discrimination.	1640886722.0	hqklxgi	t3_rs56oc	t1_hqkl0ft	/r/changemyview/comments/rs56oc/cmv_peoples_view_on_cultural_appropriation_show/hqklxgi/

g2d45waj	>There's a reason stories like the Last Samurai are viewed as respectful, and something like Ghost in the Shell wasn't and was viewed as cultural appropriation and a cash grab for a white actress to take a role from an Asian women... because that's what it was. Tom Cruise wasn't stealing an Asian man's role, the story being told required a white actor. With Ghost in the Shell, there was no respect for the source material and the culture it came from when they switched the leads, they simply did it from a money hungry perspective that they felt Scarlet would sell more tickets. It was purely done out of greed, and not out of respect.   >That's the big difference with cultural appropriation that people often ignore, the credit and the respect. And particularly with acting it gets complicated because so many POC and so many marginalized groups can't even get good respectful roles in the first place, that the roles even they would be best suited for get cast by white people simply out of greed and a desire for money. If everything was even these things wouldn't matter as much, but there's a reason that it's generally not a big deal when POC take "white roles", and a large part of the reason is because those aren't actual white roles. Just roles a white person would have normally because they never give POC the chance.   Something that worries me about arguments like yours is that it can be used by pretty much any group to justify their stances. For example, a white nationalist could say that Hollywood is evil because many white roles in movies are taken by Jewish actors instead of "real" white people.  >There's a fine line between telling a story how you wish, and just stealing and profiting off another culture without them getting their due from it.

D&D, Lovecraft, even Tolkien all have problems with their worlds being inherently racist of pro white, which adds to the racism in these genres that we see today.

1i4rjbib	Although the one guy is being pretty rude, they both are right. Press don't have protections from trespassing or curfews, unless otherwise specified by law. I've worked in public affairs, press are required to follow all normal state laws with no exceptions.   Something that might help clarify is this: https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/imported/RFG.pdf  Particularly the pieces on public and private spaces. To summarize it basically says reporters are only allowed where the public is. I pulled it from this link: https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/civil-matters-and-disturbances/	1640894246.0	hql5msz	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hqkygvl	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hql5msz/
1i4rjbib	So yes, journalists are equally at risk for being arrested for being past curfew. If the cops are only arresting journalists for being past curfew, they could be in their own hot water, but that still wouldn't excuse the journalists for breaking the law (an extreme example, but imagine 30 people are robbing a bank, and the police only arrest the black people even though people of all races were there. The police can be in trouble for racial bias, but the people arrested are still in trouble for robbery). There's no first amendment defense for violating laws, regardless of police bias. If you break laws as press (curfew, trespassing, tax avoidance), you're equally as susceptible to arrest and prosecution.   As far as treatment impacted by motivation: it depends. If there are a bunch of people physically fighting cops, and you can prove you weren't fighting cops you have a legal defense (which often reporters use their video evidence), but that's a defense specific to reporters, that's a defense capable of being given to anyone that can prove they were doing something else at the time span. If people start punching babies at 12:00, and I start tweeting every minute at 12:15, I have no defense to say I wasn't doing it, but if I'm tweeting every minute starting at 11:59, i have a defense. Its a crazy example but it highlights how journalism and filming is disconnected entirely from other crimes (trespassing, curfew), aside from the fact that they happen to be people in the US with equipment that proves what they were doing at a specific timestamp, but nothing in particular about being press.	1640895193.0	hql80e0	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hql6sq1	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hql80e0/

1i4rjbib	That's not correct, replace tweet with a timestamped speedrun on a cell phone game and it still holds true. You are always a member of the press, but your "press" activities aren't coupled to a defense other than that you have timestamped proof you weren't committing a crime. If I have a twitch clip of me eating donuts at that time, or a security camera sees me running laps around a fire hydrant at that time, it doesn't matter, all are equal defense with someone doing reporter-esque things. The only freedoms and protections given with everyone being press (either professional or not) are  the ability to record in public/freely express yourself, nothing more. "doing press shit" doesn't net you any additional protections other than protections from loitering rules in town halls and such, but that just requires that you are doing some form of expression (photography, videography, interviews, what have you) and not just sitting on the floor with an ipad playing angry birds. To reiterate: being "press" at a curfew protest or riot or civil unrest scenario doesn't give you any additional protections more than anyone who can prove they weren't rioting, and the act of being some sort of official-sounding press (fox, nbc) doesn't protect you from being arrested for getting involved in the illegal activity (trespassing, being out after curfew, ignoring lawful orders from police, etc). Press is not an exemption in any scenario unless press-activity is otherwise stated in the law, and in those cases where press is exempted, you have no burden of proof required that you are an official member of some sort of journalism company, you just have to proof you were exercising your 1A rights (filming with a cell phone, taking notes on your phone, whatever).  In the case of jan 6, if there was some sort of Capitol law exemption that said reporters are allowed to freely enter the Capitol, then anyone following the crowd with a cell phone video cam out is well within their right to do so, and wouldn't be arrested. If they kicked over a fence then rushed in the building, with their cell phone out, they can be arrested for kicking over the fence, but still not the entry.	1640896269.0	hqlaqqj	t3_rrjzy3	t1_hql8ptz	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqlaqqj/

You can be imprisoned. The government takes these cases and prosecutes on behalf of the people.   In a civil case, you are being sued. You have done something to harm another person or entity. They are seeking redress. You can be ordered to make redress financially. The impacted individual is taking this case against you on their own behalf.  The former - prosecution by the government - is what people typically mean is protected against by ‘freedom of speech’ in America.   But [there are limits. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions)  > Categories of speech that are given lesser or no protection by the First Amendment (and therefore may be restricted) include obscenity, fraud, child pornography, speech integral to illegal conduct, speech that incites imminent lawless action, speech that violates intellectual property law, true threats, and commercial speech such as advertising.

This past year I inline skated over 2,000 miles. I competed in 5 marathons and won a medal in each of them.  I still smoke pot. Every. Single. Day.  The point of my contrasting anecdote is that pot affects everyone differently. The ratio of THC to CBD matters. Wether you smoke it or eat it matters. The amount of pot consumed matters.  We need to stop painting with a broad brush and acting like this plant is 100% evil or 100% medicine. Allow individuals the liberty to do what’s best for themselves and offer treatment for those that abuse substances.	1640906849.0	hqm18gk	t3_rs5g3c	t1_hqllq3k	/r/changemyview/comments/rs5g3c/cmv_weed_is_not_nearly_dangerous_enough_to_be/hqm18gk/

f2x4kuc9	1. The not caring is a feature. Being deeply personally (emotionally, financially) tied up in a person's medical care creates a layer of complication in decision making. If we argue that there is an objective correct decision, then it may be harder to come to for people who have other interests in the ill person. This is why doctors can't treat their kids or parents.  2. Almost everything that is prescribed is dangerous: doctors are liable for that risk, and practice with an awareness of those risks. These risks are far more complicated than a list of adverse events in a monograph. Particularly when considering combinations of medications. In the case that there is an avoidable drug error who's to blame? Upto date? The pharmacy? The drug company?  3. Most medical knowledge is experiencial. Books say so much, but the application to an individual is a synthesis of formal knowledge and experience that cant be taken from books alone. That's why doctors increase in seniority with experience. No one could argue that doctors are perfect or even very good, nor that all doctors are good all the time. But the same weakness would be present in people prescribing and taking meds for themselves.  There are circumstances where a non-medical person knows far more about the care of themselves or the person they care for. And I certainly think that doctors should work extremely hard to be responsive to their experience, including providing prescriptions with lots of leeway or discretion for the patient.	1640920786.0	hqmwzaf	t3_rsjmaq	t3_rsjmaq	/r/changemyview/comments/rsjmaq/cmv_people_should_have_access_to_any_and_all/hqmwzaf/

Chess pieces are entirely circumstantial. The symbolic meaning of pieces as "King", "Queen", etc, these are dramatic representations that have no practical bearing on the mechanics of the game beyond establishing a hierarchy of which pieces can move which way. Why wouldn't this same logic apply to Chaturaji, a Hindu variant of chess with no female pieces? Or Shatranj, the Persian version of chaturaji which is literally the pre-cursor to modern chess and again has no thematically female pieces?  It seems like the entire argument hangs on the fact that a piece happens to be symbolized as female but this is just one of hundreds of variations of the same game which the majority don't share. So the argument would be somehow limited to "Culturally Western/European fathers who happen to live in these certain countries and happen to play this specific variation of this game at this particular point of history" and when that's the case, I just don't see it.	1640926981.0	hqn9gv4	t3_rslo34	t3_rslo34	/r/changemyview/comments/rslo34/cmv_fathers_who_teach_their_sons_chess_are/hqn9gv4/

ld53i	> How do we know Oedipal complexes aren't more common in countries with Western chess as opposed to those with an elephant-piece? I have no data on the subject whatsoever.  How do you know they are? It's your claim, not mine. Complete lack of evidence is just conjecture and while I think that's fine, expressing a false-positive with complete lack of evidence is somewhat redundant because I can just throw that back at you like I've just done, right?  My hangup on this is this specific paragraph:  > Chess represents the Oedipal battle in reverse with taking the other's queen and "queening a pawn" (mother-son), as well as the final goal, checkmating the opponent's king. Of course, it's also possible to knight the pawn, to bishop or rook it, but queening is most common.  Because we're attributing symbolic meaning to the arbitrary movement of arbitrary pieces here. [I've found this site that makes claims about the origin of chess promotion which seems to verify that promotion as a mechanic is not specifically Western](https://new.uschess.org/news/evolution-modern-chess-rules-pawn-promotion), so the argument based on promotion of a specific piece's perceived symbolic value (which itself again could as easily be an elephant instead of a female monarch depending on where we are on the globe and in time) to me doesn't address the arbitrary nature of assigning symbolism to the pieces.  If I create a Harry Potter themed chess set with Harry Potter themed pieces which doesn't share this same perceived pawn-queen-king parallel of son-mother-father but otherwise is functionally identical to chess even to the extent of "queen'ing" the relevant piece, would this Oedipal theme still apply?	1640930133.0	hqnf32e	t3_rslo34	t1_hqnc2b7	/r/changemyview/comments/rslo34/cmv_fathers_who_teach_their_sons_chess_are/hqnf32e/

ld53i	Thanks! I don't blame you at all for that. I actually was the exact same way until moving to Phoenix AZ where I started being an adoption counselor at the local animal shelter. I was afraid of pitbulls when I started, but now 6 years later, *nearly every single one of my favorite animals from the shelter have been pit-terriers*. They've consistently been my favorite and I personally handle up to 50 dogs per week. I've also had to take classes on dispelling common myths (this being the biggest one in this field) specifically so I don't perpetuate them while I'm going through the adoption process with future owners.  The reality is that:  - Yes, pits are indeed responsible for the most bites and fatalities of any breed in the US (while this is somewhat murky because of breed identification issues, it's still very likely to be true). No one is really in a position to deny this. - No, these numbers are nowhere near as outrageous as certain people claim. If 10-20 million killing machines were truly on our streets and in our homes, the numbers wouldn't be so comically low as 20/year in a country with ~330mil people. - Yes, any pitbull who exhibits any explicitly aggressive behavior and is deemed as a risk to society should be euthanized. **That's already how it works regardless of breed in shelters, however.** You should not trust a dog because it's a dog and you should educate yourself on their body language because the majority of all bites are fear-aggression, not dominance-based or predatory. - Yes, there's about 1 new video per week showing a very tragic and often brutal display of a pit attacking another dog or human. But consider that we live in a world with over 6 billion smartphone users so only one video a week is again, in context, extremely low given these claims. - No, genocide and breed-wide euthanization is not an option I'm willing to entertain. **If you want me to compromise, you should present me with a reasonable compromise that isn't limited to eugenics or genocide.**	1640931115.0	hqngqgk	t3_rsk2fd	t1_hqndr14	/r/changemyview/comments/rsk2fd/cmv_pit_bulls_are_a_danger_to_society_and_should/hqngqgk/
ld53i	> I am 90% sure it was your claim. I don't believe I made any claim in that regard and you brought up the topic.  It's your claim that Oedipal themes are present at all to begin with. It was my claim that I don't see how that would be possible unless it was also the case for the various other iterations of chess with nearly identical features, to which you essentially reply "Maybe their more present" and my response is essentially "Are they? Are they present at all? That's your claim, it's a false positive when you present no evidence".  > I don't understand the relevance of the Harry Potter chess set.  > Just because you can use the rules of chess with other pieces... how is that relevant at all?  See I don't understand why the symbolic value of a piece being female is of so much significance. If my father teaches me how to play chess through a themed set; and all pieces and mechanics are performatively identical to normal chess; the fact a Queen isn't called a "Queen" is enough to make us sitting at a table regularly over two decades suddenly *not* Oedipal? If it's the exact same thing and just painted a slightly different color, but under such a small and slight change it would no longer apply, then that appears to be an extremely shallow theme.  > We can use numbers for money or time. Why would it make any difference in counting money to point out that numbers can be used to represent times?  I don't think you're connecting what I'm saying here. I'm saying that your argument is something to the effect of "Fathers who play baseball with their sons are good fathers because of the symbolic or underlying dramatic value of baseball" and my argument is "Well softball is basically identical, shouldn't that mean fathers who teach softball are also good fathers" and your answer is no? Because the difference between these (and the symbolic value) is completely arbitrary and surface-level.	1640932075.0	hqnianj	t3_rslo34	t1_hqnfr3m	/r/changemyview/comments/rslo34/cmv_fathers_who_teach_their_sons_chess_are/hqnianj/

You don't need to have sex right now, just chill out. If you get side effects from birth control you should get a copper IUD, it contains no hormones and as such doesn't cause the side effects. It's the most effective birth control out there as well.  I don't think you are aware of the struggles many women face. First of all, teenagers' brains haven't finished developing, so are you really going to make them have a baby if they get pregnant, or even worse if they got pregnant because they wanted to use protection but we're unable to? This doesn't make sense. Birth control always has side effects in some regards as a hormonal medication. Plus it is easy to miss a pill. The IUD reacts badly in some people and you need access to quality medical care to do it.	1640937546.0	hqnq80e	t3_rsnhc0	t1_hqnomn0	/r/changemyview/comments/rsnhc0/cmv_abortion_really_isnt_great_and_encouraging_it/hqnq80e/

7z1oto59	This is entirely anecdotal and most likely won’t change your mind I didn’t believe in the concept of soul mates either until I met mine. I thought the idea you had one person to find and be with was ridiculous as relationships require work, commitment, and shared values to work. Coming from a practical background, I was also personally very staunchly anti-marriage, anti-fairy-tale-romance/unrealistic expectations. Then I met my husband. It was like getting hit with a ton of bricks. We just *clicked* right from the moment we met. I can’t even describe it to you, it was very instinctual for both of us, like everything had finally fallen into place and I had finally found what I wasn’t even looking for even though I didn’t even know what I was looking for. It sounds cheesy and unbelievable even now, but neither of us can even remember what life was like before we knew each other, and even now we have this overwhelming general feeling of “how have we possibly lived this long without each other?” It is a feeling of belonging.   I’m not saying it isn’t hard work, of course it is. Like everyone else, we have disagreements and go through hard times. But I think it’s easier because we both know to our bones the other person only wants the best for us and are willing to do anything for the others happiness. Everything we own is jointly ours and we are partners in every sense of the word. It isn’t a magic catch-all, but it *feels* like magic everyday to be with someone who is quite literally my other half.	1640991119.0	hqqm5nx	t3_rslzdc	t3_rslzdc	/r/changemyview/comments/rslzdc/cmv_soulmates_dont_exist_and_pretending_they_do/hqqm5nx/

(This is part of why Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock and so many other comedians all use such distinctive stage voices.)   And if your initial reaction to their distinct style is to think that it's ugly or unpleasant? Well, aside from the fact that your opinion is subjective, after watching a few episodes, you won't notice it anymore. Because Our sense of beauty is rooted in familiarity and typicality. (If you're curious, you can google \[beauty familiarity\] and see a slew of articles and studies examining it.)  Basically, we have an idea of how things "ought" to look and appreciate those that conform to our expectations. But those expectations are moldable. Repeated exposure to an unfamiliar style makes it familiar, and seeing it duplicated in other places makes it seem typical. It's not even limited to cartoons: Think about hairstyles over the decades. We laugh at '80s and '90s hair, but why weren't they laughing then? Distinctive looks made people stare. Copycats made it familiar and attractive. Oversaturation made it lose its distinctiveness. We all moved on.   \*\*\*Distinctive visuals (and voices) also serve another solid purpose. The *initial* unfamiliarity makes you uncomfortable, which itself primes you to laugh. And laughing keeps you engaged which helps you build up that familiarity.	1640997003.0	hqqytht	t3_rt2go6	t3_rt2go6	/r/changemyview/comments/rt2go6/cmv_the_philosophy_that_nothing_is_ugly_cartoon/hqqytht/
944l62xo	I think it is hilarious how so many people approve of citizens rioting - until the political side they do not like does it.   I actually strongly approve of the Capitol riots. Partisan politics aside - it is far more appropriate than most other riots I have seen. Most other riots I see on tv involves burning down, destroying, and looting private property. Citizens punishing other citizens for the actions of government.   At least in the case of the Capitol riots, the citizens rioted against the very government they had an issue with.   I remember back during the Seattle riots when the left took over a part of downtown Seattle - I disapproved. Except when I heard they took over a police station. Then, even though I largely support the police (not completely but that doesn't matter for this post), I shrugged. They were taking their complaints and riot directly to the government entity they had an issue with.   The Capitol riots - in my ever so humble opinion - was the CORRECT way to riot if you are going to do so.	1641025505.0	hqsc6ja	t3_rrjzy3	t3_rrjzy3	/r/changemyview/comments/rrjzy3/cmvif_you_illegally_entered_the_capitol_on_jan_6/hqsc6ja/

2h8owb	First, if the "simulation" is so complete that its component elements have individual identities and personalities, is it at all meaningful to call it a simulation? It's simply a different part of reality. All you're doing is expanding the scope of the unexplored territory in your universe. Like Europe discovering the Americas, it's just more reality that we didn't know about before. It only means that space isn't the *final* frontier.  Second, if we are outsiders inserted *into* the simulation a la The Matrix, then the scale of the universe makes no sense. What need is there for Saturn or galaxies outside the milky way when we're all confined to Earth? And if other faraway planets *are* hosting life, why? When you could just simulate it in instances?	1641031668.0	hqsja3q	t3_rtfaut	t3_rtfaut	/r/changemyview/comments/rtfaut/cmv_we_live_in_a_simulation/hqsja3q/

3a3smqa2	You do understand how people use language, right?  Like you know that old canard teachers used to love to use? You'd say "Can I go to the bathroom" And they'd try to make it a learning experience by asking "I don't know, *can* you?"  Well that has always been really stupid, because it ignores how language is used. The teacher knows what I meant, which means the message was conveyed by the use of the word 'can' instead of 'may'. Moreover, the phrase 'May I go to the bathroom' suffers the same damn problem. "May you? Sure you may, but do you mean may you do so now?"  See, the way people use language includes a whole bunch of assumptions in essentially everything we say. Can I go to the bathroom is "Can I go to the bathroom now". It is also "Can I go to the bathroom because I need to pee" and "Can I go to the bathroom during class" and "Can I go right now" and so on and so forth.  So when I said:  "These markets aren't tied into anything people actually use. AIG's collapse broke the buck in money market mutual funds which caused the commercial paper market to pop. The biggest connection to reality of a crypto crash is that I might be able to afford a GPU."   A reasonable person would, or should, be able to understand that I'm talking about how they are not interconnected in a systemic way. And that same person would, or should, reasonably understand that chiming in with "Well ackshually, a miniscule amount of people are taking bank loans so it will have a minuscule impact" says nothing. It is pedantry for the sake of pedantry.  At best, you've said nothing of value.

q1r4t	Imagine two co-workers, one male and one female.  They are both individually in relationships, but they've known each other for a very long time are quite comfortable around each other.  While mostly their relationship is platonic, they can be occasionally flirty, but it's understood that they don't mean anything by it and no one has shown discomfort regarding their behavior, including their partners.  One evening, they have drinks after work, get a bit drunk, and do something that crosses a line.  It's hard to know where the line was, but they both understand that it was crossed.  They don't want to leave their relationships, they don't want to stop being friends, but they MUST stop the flirty banter if they don't want things to go bad.  It means policing their habits and occasional awkwardness as they find a new normal.  \_\_\_  Honestly, this metaphor breaks down really quickly and I wish that I was clever enough to come up with one that fit better, but there is still a lesson here.  Men are being policed for their sexualization of women because we, as a society, have agreed that they crossed a line.  We're all looking for a new normal that keeps us further from the line to prevent it from happening again.  Eventually, we'll get comfortable enough to allow some of that behavior to become acceptable again, but probably with a bit more caution than it used to have.  This transition isn't affecting judgement of women's actions because there is no consensus that women crossed the same line.  Unfortunately, as we adjust, not everyone takes it well.  Some women and SJWs react overly harshly, expecting habits to disappear overnight or being unduly willing to further damage the relationship.  Some men and conservative women take offense to having to change their behaviors, going so far as to argue that "the line" was never crossed in the first place.  And many men and women have trouble with the apparent hypocrisy of policing one dominant sex's actions and not the other.  I think it all really boils down to trust.  It isn't acceptable for men to sexualize women because we are rebuilding trust.  It is, marginally, more acceptable for women to sexualize men because they aren't rebuilding trust.  Also, women who take advantage of this dichotomy to behave however they want while still claiming the moral high ground are rubbish people.	1641134882.0	hqxsnqy	t3_rtzi3u	t3_rtzi3u	/r/changemyview/comments/rtzi3u/cmv_it_is_much_more_acceptable_for_women_to/hqxsnqy/

4riao	It's not about sexualization alone, it's about power.  Have you, as a man, ever been catcalled on the street? Or had an older woman in a car follow you while you were jogging? Have you ever had a boss hit on you at work? Or had a person staring at you at a red light and whine clearly masturbating?  Because all of those are things that have happened to women I know personally. The issue is not about whether men or women sexualize each other more, it's about the freedom men feel to objectify women who are trying to live their life. It's not equal and it's not really close. Ask the adult women and men in your life if these kinds of things have happened to them. I think you'll find that the counterexamples are few and far between.	1641147913.0	hqyoea3	t3_rtzi3u	t1_hqw683r	/r/changemyview/comments/rtzi3u/cmv_it_is_much_more_acceptable_for_women_to/hqyoea3/

flajjc9n	I guess you can argue it’s not a racial slur based on the origin of the word.   If I’m not mistaken, the word cracker usually referred to poor white people particularly from the south. While this is a term directed towards a particular group of people, it’s not like it was a word that was only used by non-white to specifically degrade white people.  White people referred to other white people as crackers.  While more commonly known racial slurs such as the N-word, spick, wetback, or chink more or less we’re not actually used by the POC communities these were retarding. They were used by people who considered these particular groups as less than.	1641149060.0	hqyrm2h	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqyrm2h/
1lf6zu76	Okay, so generally people who call themselves proud Americans have a very specific idea of what America is that is exclusive to a very small group of Americans. They paper over the blood that built up their jingoistic fantasy and they can potentially be radicalized into zealots with little reflection upon the weakness that was America's bigoted history.   Native Americans also tend to ignore the negative elements of their cultures, but their cultures are nearly dead, so they have the leeway to do so. Their won't be a returning to scalpings, human sacrifices or the like, so why step on their toes in the preservation of their cultural memory? We don't all share their story and we don't fear their future. It's not our business to repaint that narrative.   As an African-American, so-called proud Americans erase our role in building this nation constantly. They see us as "unAmerican," in some way, an other that has been there instead of as the people who raised the leaders of the nation, who built it's first economy, who altered it's culture and we're acculturated by it moreso than any group except possibly Anglo-Americans and Scotch-Irish. How can you love America and erase our story? You can't and you don't, you love a fiction. A dangerous fiction. They're allowed to of course, but why should we not take part in adding the details so long erased? And if they don't want to hear it, they'll stop spreading the false story.   I am a proud American by the way, and I invite White Americans to continue being proud Americans in spite of the shaming they'll get for it. Prove the haters wrong like every other culture had to.	1641149705.0	hqyteps	t3_ru8dkr	t3_ru8dkr	/r/changemyview/comments/ru8dkr/cmv_other_cultures_who_are_proud_of_themselves/hqyteps/
flajjc9n	Words change over time…..  Cracker, like I said, used to refer to poor white people. Other white people fed into the use of the word cracker. It’s not a racial slur because it did not exist to specifically degrade you based on race.   The N-word did.  The N-word still exists to degrade you based on race. Black people referring to each other as the N-word does not do this. However, people still very much use the N-word as a means to degrade you because you’re black.  Quite frankly, I personally believe usage of the N-word with a black communities is a very western phenomenon so I don’t have the greatest opinion about it. But I’m points does stands, that other recognized racial slurs more or less are not commonly used by or within POC communities.	1641149881.0	hqytvv4	t3_rug2bf	t1_hqytbn9	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqytvv4/

35a93s8y	I agree with your 3 questions. Thanks for making these topics more clear. I'll give a piece-by-piece analysis of my response since I had to read it a few times.   > Firstly, there's an economics terms that explains why no nations ever want to go to war: pareto efficiency. Hence throwing cookies away is pareto inefficient.  This sounds like a lose-lose scenario in negotiation. This is a logical point of view but there can be uncertainty (due to lack of trust), mistakes can happen, resources can become limited, etc. I think it's just more complicated than thinking about win-lose lose-lose scenarios.  The world isn't that black and white. I'd argue there are more questions to be discussed, maybe such as should China, Russia, or the US have the influence it does in the world? What are the intentions of all these countries?   I don't believe war is good for anyone but nationalism/competition seems to be a spark that causes countries to aim to increase influence through extreme measures, which I guess is really what my view is on the matter. **To this point, I have a solution that would be a win-win and I'd be interested to hear what you think.**  >The CCP isn't stupid, far from it. They want Taiwan, they want the South China Sea, they want control over the Himalayas. They might be willing to go to war, but they would prefer the US just gave up first. They would prefer the US just looks at their military, thinks "eh, not worth it" and surrenders support from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea.   Full disclosure: I'm a Gen-Z American and went to public schools. we learned about something called "[Manifest Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny)" in school. So for those of you talking about Texas, I can't really argue with you on that. I think what should be argued is the reasons behind conflict at a moral level because we are complex individuals and societies after all. Is it bad for Russia and China to fundamentally want control of Ukraine and Taiwan? I guess not, but I can't say it is fundamentally bad for Taiwan or Ukraine to want to be sovereign states either. Why do China and Russia want this control?  >   >   >Secondly, I'm not sure that American hegemony is so clearly beneficial to the world.  I'd argue the US is the lesser of two evils. My solution is related to this if you are willing to hear.   >For China, Hong Kong is dangerous because it's a source of internal dissent and international control within China. The American strategy has been to control the seas around China to block it in (alliances with Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea). This makes it so that the US poses, again, a real threat to China. If there is a war, China will be hemmed in and the US will control what happens. This was essentially the problem in the century of humiliation, and has been shown to lead to China not having control.  Is it possible Hong Kong aided China to become as powerful as it is today? Also, I think the real issue is what the dissent is about, which is related to my solution. This sounds like a chicken and egg kind of argument too.	1641150543.0	hqyvpkj	t3_rtc4b4	t1_hqs2a4v	/r/changemyview/comments/rtc4b4/cmv_russia_and_china_are_looking_for_war/hqyvpkj/

2h8owb	Technically? Yes.  Meaningfully? No.  It's *literally* a racial/ethnic slur, as it is a term that disparages a person for their membership in a racial/ethnic group and nothing else. End of discussion.  But as far as slurs go, it's pretty much worthless. As John Mulaney put it, "If you're comparing the badness of two words, and you won’t even say one of them? That's the worse word!" And no one really hesitates to say "cracker."   I'm a white dude. I've been called it a few times in my life, but never in a conflict, and never with any degree of hate behind it. It's been, at worst, vaguely dismissive? But even if that was the intent, it was never the effect. Because the word is empty. It doesn't actually convey anything insulting because no one actually knows what it's supposed to mean.   * Are they Scots-Irish Americans who like to brag (cracker from "craic," and the original documented use of the word)?     * Not really insulting. Maybe slightly demeaning, but lots of people take pride in their chattiness.  * Are they bland and uninteresting (soda cracker)?     * Not really a *racial* slur. It's targeting at an individual's personality, not identity. * Or are they powerful people with control over the insulter (from a whip's crack)?    * Not really a racial *slur.* It's certainly racial, but the "insult" is pretty weak. You'd be better off feigning subservience and saying "yes massa" and "no massa" to just make people generally uncomfortable.  The problem is that no one's actually using the word as if it means any of those things. They say it as if it means "you're white and therefore bad," just the same as any other racial slur. And how do those work? Well they tend to serve as a stand in for saying "you embody all the negative stereotypes commonly associated with your race." So if you call someone a "cracker," what are the *negative* stereotypes associated with white people inside the US?  I'm seriously asking. Because as far as I can tell there aren't any *universal* ones.  So again, is it technically a racial slur? Sure. But is it actually a racial *slur?* No.	1641163946.0	hqzv1ju	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hqzv1ju/

2h8owb	What you've outlined essentially boils down to "being taken seriously; being treated as though your words, thoughts, and actions all have meaning; and being rewarded or penalized accordingly." And *many* women would absolutely love to have that as their default status instead of something they have to fight for.  Plenty of women would find some aspects of it intolerable, I'm sure. But it's not a categorical thing.   And it's not really a meaningful point to argue over. Because the things that men find frustrating aren't the only things that define the experience of being a man. There are a *ton* of great things too. So you could just as easily reverse this and say "if men were treated like women, they would hate it."   The problem isn't a blanket statement about "how men are treated," but a criticism of certain specific aspects of how men experience daily life or how they're expected to behave. i.e., the *toxic* aspects of masculine standards contrasted with the healthy and positive ones.	1641165187.0	hqzy6iq	t3_rulxnz	t3_rulxnz	/r/changemyview/comments/rulxnz/cmv_if_women_were_treated_like_men_they_would/hqzy6iq/

htwiy9av	Cracker is a slur. However, I think it's important to consider what's behind it, as opposed to, say, the N word.   Cracker is a reference to the sound of a whip, evoking the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. As such, when used toward white people, it comes from a place of relative powerlessness. It brings up a history of violence and oppression by white people.   The N-word is almost the opposite - it comes from a place of power, further degrading its targets. It brings up a history of oppression *to the oppressed,* and conjures histories of poverty, myths about intelligence, and memories of violence. The N word's goal is to tear people down. The word "cracker" doesn't tear people down - at most it may alienate someone.	1641170120.0	hr0aho5	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0aho5/
4p6wj88t	What mansion are you living in that requires 8 hours straight of chores every single day? If was anything close to as strenuous as you describe, then how do single people/even single parents with kids work and complete chores?  My high school sweet heart had a stay at home mom (the dad brought in 150k as a safety supervisor or some such) who was awesome. My girlfriend had a younger sister who hadn’t started school just yet.   Everyday she would:  - get up early, go for a run.  - make a ridiculously good lunch for my partner to take to school.  - every single day, drive my partner to and from school.  - every day, do a general tidy of the house, complete all the laundry and start cooking a complex meal (she likes cooking, think like slow cooked roast etc) and often proclaimed she would be doing a “fun” activity with the younger sister before 11am.  - she would then spend the rest of her day hobby chasing, reading or watching movies. She was very vocal about how much she loved her life and how she couldn’t believe the husband made the deal that they lived (he hated all domestic chores and was always appreciative.  So, I witnessed this spouse growing up (easily could have been roles reversed) be an absolute weapon of a homemaker, having all “work done” (even including excercise which is realistically leisure) done in 4-5 hours (and she did it to a, sometimes comically, high standard) then having 6 hours to do whatever they wanted. It’s not even like at 5pm when the husband gets home, the day is over either. Then she would just tack on to everyone else’s “normal” leisure time. The only negative that could be presented is sometimes yes, the younger sister may have just general child issues that take up time randomly throughout the week, tantrums etc. Tbh tho, it just doesn’t compare, even if it took up 6 hours that would just start to equal a genuine job. The only caveat being the mental exhaustion that you don’t get to leave the workplace.  Imo, I’ve seen the dynamic multiple times throughout my life, especially entering my 30’s as my friends have started to settle and the balance is clear to me. Which ever partner takes on the house keeper role deserves recognition, appreciation and gratitude because the tasks can be seen as less desirable or sometimes just unpleasant but once the actual math is done: it’s simply less work in quantity. If they treat home making as an actual job of employment, they will always finish earlier and even if they don’t, it’s under their own steam as they are their own boss which in itself it’s unbelievably liberating. I’m just trying to imagine if I was allowed to have Netflix blasting in my work place while I completed my tasks for the day, good perks lol.  Obviously, exceptions to the rule such as 10+ kids, the first year a baby is born and if they own a massive property that requires maintenance etc.	1641170131.0	hr0ailb	t3_rulmib	t1_hr03jgr	/r/changemyview/comments/rulmib/cmv_its_the_stay_at_home_parents_job_regardless/hr0ailb/

8n24i	This is a narrow definition of privilege which is kind of nonsense. You're basically saying if I'm in a 400m race and I get to line up at the start line but everyone else has to line up 20m behind it, I'm not privileged, I'm precisely where I should be, rather they're disadvantaged. Whereas, if they're at the start line and I get a 20m head, then I'm privileged and they're not disadvantageous?   Sure, whatever, who cares? It's bullshit either way.  Also, even employing this very-narrow definition of privilege, white people are still *very* privileged. Even if we limit to times where the black and white rule rarely applies to white people in the same way it applies to Black people but the application to Black people is in keeping with the wording of the rule.  Speeding and other common traffic infractions are against the law, you're much more likely to get pulled over for them if you're Black. Weed is still against the law on the books in a number of places, but in practice it's basically legal for white people and has been for a generation. And on and on.  Even if we limit "privilege" to instances where a teacher says to 5 kids everyone is going to lose one cookie, but only actually takes a cookie from 4, it's still the case that that happens a lot.	1641171607.0	hr0e2ll	t3_ruoepp	t3_ruoepp	/r/changemyview/comments/ruoepp/cmv_white_privilege_does_not_exist_poc/hr0e2ll/

I also take shifts taking care of my son during the day or at night because I love my wife and kid. My wife is not a babysitter and a maid, she is the mother of my kid and needs proper rest and respect.   My work is not too demanding and if I were to act like how you think working parent should act, my wife would leave me in a second and I will deserve it.	1641174129.0	hr0k3my	t3_rulmib	t3_rulmib	/r/changemyview/comments/rulmib/cmv_its_the_stay_at_home_parents_job_regardless/hr0k3my/
dqntho5j	>But the usage of the word would only be for appeasement then since you only change your usage due to their preference.  well yes, but isn't that how social constructs work? you say in your OP that pronouns are "constructed to assist communication", and allowing people to express themselves and their identities more accurately certainly assists with that   >Could you confidently draw a line between a hotdog and a sandwich? Of course not but this does not mean that we should begin calling toasts hotdogs  if a piece of toast became sentient and politely asked to be called "hotdog", i would gladly meet their request. objects do not have their own internal gender identities, but humans do  if i'm understanding you correctly, your argument is that people should not be allowed to determine their own pronouns because it makes language more "confusing". i think this is a shallow way to look at the issue  transgender people (and people who have existed outside of the binary of "male/female") have existed throughout the entirety of human history, and by saying that people should not be allowed to determine their own pronouns, you are erasing their very real experiences  the cost of simplifying something as nuanced and personal as gender into a binary that people aren't allowed to deviate from in any way is that it means transgender people and gender non-conforming people will suffer as a result. in my view, your position goes against the lived experiences and reality of millions upon millions of people solely in the name of "simplifying" language, and i find that to be inhumane	1641174267.0	hr0kfrj	t3_ruonrl	t1_hr0iphv	/r/changemyview/comments/ruonrl/cmv_self_identifying_pronouns_does_not_make_any/hr0kfrj/

2az883be	This is a useless CMV. This isn’t a “view”. Are you really going to contend that a terms meaning is it’s meaning?  When you use the word cracker to describe a thin baked snack it doesn’t refer to a person of a certain race. When you use it to refer to a person, you are using it to infer a race.  If your CMV was contending it being comparable to a variety of derogatory racial terms used to describe people of non-white races, then that would be a view to contend. You’re not going to find anyone who disagrees that “cracker” describes a white person and not in a complimentary way. But try to argue that it’s hurtful or offensive in a way comparable to any of a number of other racial slurs and you’re going to get owned.	1641175862.0	hr0ob04	t3_rug2bf	t1_hqzbtr9	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0ob04/

2ru41zdc	Listen, I acknowledge the existence of institutional racism and the lasting impact it has had on African American people to this day. I think enslavement, lynching, segregation, and other forms of oppression that have been thrust upon African Americans are absolutely appalling.   My quarrel with the word “cracker” and racial slurs more broadly is how some are seen as inoffensive to certain people, and the asinine justifications these people make up as to why they aren’t offensive. I am aware that some racial slurs are worse than others - I know that. I like to see progress, and when I see people condoning the use of racial slurs against white people, it honestly confuses me. I myself am  not offended by cracker, but it’s important to note that one person’s feelings( mine in this scenario) are not representative of everyone. I think racial slurs of all forms should be cast into the abyss and never used again, but that obviously won’t happen because there are a lot of racist people out there.   My brain is fried. I’m taking a break.	1641176568.0	hr0pzpu	t3_rug2bf	t1_hr0nd37	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0pzpu/
3mqd2	Part of white privilege is having our experience and perspective be considered the default or norm. We are the standard that everything else is contrasted to. In our society we are the “us” that every “them” is defined as different from.  Changing the term from “white privilege” to some variation of “POC disadvantage” is perpetuating and capitulating to the exact phenomenon it is used to critique. The term comes from conversations made by POC for POC, so of course it is from the viewpoint of POC—and subsequently that the POC experience is the baseline to be compared to. To me at least it feels like the height of entitlement to demand POC reframe their ideas and their discussions around my perspective as white person before I’m willing to even engage with the topic.  The fact that many white people are so uncomfortable having a discussion where they are the “other” and crudely lumped together under a label is not unexpected, nor is it unique to white people. It doesn’t feel good when it happens to any person or group. The difference is that white people largely have the privilege of not experiencing that with any regularity in regards to their race. It’s a discomfort that we as group have not gotten used to, and don’t know how to cope with. Other races experience it all the time in our society, and they have been forced to learn how to live with it.  So it’s not even anything along the lines of “white people have treated us badly so we will treat them badly in the same way to show them what it feels like” which is how I’ve seen things rationalized before. It’s literally simply that the conversation around white privilege is from the perspective of POC. Even if your argument is that we should remove disadvantages—one of those disadvantages is POC not being allowed to center conversations from their identity and their perspective. Equality in that sense is white people not using our discomfort as justification for marginalizing or outright dismissing those conversations and viewpoints.  As long as human brains function with and in-group vs out-group mentality everyone will experience being placed in an out-group by someone else. It is a privilege that white people have forcibly established a monopoly on being considered the in-group in order to not experience the discomfort of being in an out-group. The rule isn’t that no one should feel like they’re in an out-group, and POC are disadvantaged by being placed in that position. The rule is the that in-group vs out-group is an inevitable aspect of human interaction, and white people have done just about everything in their power to exempt themselves from that at the expense of everyone else.	1641176837.0	hr0qmgy	t3_ruoepp	t3_ruoepp	/r/changemyview/comments/ruoepp/cmv_white_privilege_does_not_exist_poc/hr0qmgy/
espobaf	Yeah but MOST white people lose no sleep over being called a cracker. It's like someone calling you short. Are short people oppressed in society? No. Are they going to care when you call them short? If you're not a friend teasing them they'll probably be offended or annoyed but it's most likely not gonna give them nightmares. That's unless they do have trauma associated with it and they are being bullied. But in that relatively rare case the same applies to white people and bullying for any physical feature you can't change is wrong. The thing with the n word is that it has trauma and the history of oppression associated with it. Racism is still alive today and no matter how much you try and distance the word (especially the hard r) from that racism it's never going to lose that impact until every black person has lived a full life free from being called the n word or affected by those who call them that.	1641177354.0	hr0rv7r	t3_rug2bf	t1_hr05bdv	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0rv7r/
171sgb	You're right that it's technically a racial slur. But in reality nobody actually cares. Like...I've never seen it affect someone, because they don't care.   I'm not a fan of feigning offense where none exists, or getting offended "on principle" in lieu of any real-world effect, or getting offended on behalf of other people (none of whom are actually offended). So in that spirit: I'm not gonna pretend to care about this one because not only do I like...never hear it outside of TV and moves, but even if I did it's so weak it would mean nothing to me.   >...and people that get offended by the word are either white supremacists or just frail.  Well, this is a thing that racists and/or garbage people say because they take +any excuse to act like the very shitheads they pretend to oppose. There's nothing people love more than to belittle, insult, and watch other people suffer, *and feel righteous for doing it.* But that's a separate issue.     Someone who turns the slightest disagreement to anything they say into "das racissss" is just a shit person and you can ignore them and move on with your life.   TL;DR: While you're technically right I don't see how it benefits anyone to focus on it or to search for more reasons to amp up the language policing.	1641177671.0	hr0smee	t3_rug2bf	t3_rug2bf	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0smee/

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia\_cracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_cracker) (Also, Florida.)  Yes, the *original* meaning of the word is not the intent behind its use as a slur. But that's why I said "no one's actually using the word as if it means any of those things." Rather, its original use strongly suggests the *origin* of the slur (it's in the right location too, in the heart of the American south), which may have had other meanings tacked on after the fact.	1641177912.0	hr0t70h	t3_rug2bf	t1_hr0jmzb	/r/changemyview/comments/rug2bf/cmv_cracker_is_a_racial_slur/hr0t70h/

bcbhlary	Kind of the first thing you said. I'm saying that men's ideal height being at least 6'0 and anything less than that being considered short is a meme because it's only just recently been so widespread and popular. Specifically 6'0+ height. I believe it's a passing body ideal trend just like being extremely skinny was in the 90's/early 2000's.  It seems this is something that affects men very personally so I wanted to challenge people on the idea that it has always or will always be this way. I posted it here because I wanted to see if anyone had any evidence to the contrary. I also wanted anyone seeing it to realize how much you shouldn't base your value on the whims of society, the goal post that always changes.  It's just a meme that a lot of people are taking way too seriously when before, nobody really paid that much attention to any specific number and being less than 6'0 tall wasn't nearly as big of a deal as it is today.	1641184110.0	hr171cb	t3_ruqn0v	t1_hr13h21	/r/changemyview/comments/ruqn0v/cmv_ideal_male_height_being_60_or_more_is_a_meme/hr171cb/

I'm not sure if a guy that height has any significant disadvantages specifically related to short people, other than being socially perceived as short due to the popularity of this meme, which will hopefully not last forever.	1641184285.0	hr17en8	t3_ruqn0v	t1_hr124mh	/r/changemyview/comments/ruqn0v/cmv_ideal_male_height_being_60_or_more_is_a_meme/hr17en8/

It might be plausible that a sex doll user might be more likely to become a necrophiliac, but without actual evidence they do, then we really don't know this.	1641189717.0	hr1hjbr	t3_ruskf3	t1_hr1gir4	/r/changemyview/comments/ruskf3/cmv_having_sex_with_a_sexdoll_may_push_some/hr1hjbr/

42n355dn	Not seeing race in the long run might be usefull however, for now it is important, here is why:  Racism can exist in a systemical way, so teaching people to not see race would lead to them not realising that the system might be prejudice towards some races, here is an example:   In the 1800s someone made a law or something that said that if your grandfather could not vote, you also could not, (how could this be racist?) well this was in the times where slavery recently ended and with that black people could not vote, therefore  racism would still exist even if we did not see it, the damage of the system has already been done and the victims would still be opressed.   I think a better way is acknowledging the fact that race is a important thing although meaningless, under todays society it plays a huge role, the damage of racism has been done already, and, without being able to see race those problems will still exist.

Let's call a spade a spade here.  >Whether they're high school dropouts or Stanford engineers, his employees are the highest paid workers in America for their level of education. Unions are a response to crappy executives. Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX are currently ranked the number 1 and number 2 most desirable employers in America.  They aren't though? None of this is true. Both Tesla and SpaceX are known for underpayment & you're delusional if you think they pay anywhere near comparable tech companies. Also, not sure where you found them to be the most desirable places to work. Couldn't find a single poll showing that. All I found was Glassdoors top 100 work environments - which I didn't see Tesla or SpaceX on.  Then again, that's not surprising considering SpaceX got sued, and lost, for illegally denying employees breaks.

4xzidbky	From a policy standpoint the card balances are a liability of the company and the money isn't subject to taxes until the gift card is spent. The card balances also need to be escheated to the local states after they're considered abandoned property under state laws. If they never expire and are good forever this allows the companies to keep the money forever tax free. This sort of thing shouldn't happen.	1641200067.0	hr1wccf	t3_rux1o2	t3_rux1o2	/r/changemyview/comments/rux1o2/cmv_gift_cards_should_never_expire/hr1wccf/

Businesses do take on that risk. Every gift card sold isn’t treated as cash but as a liability for future services or goods. It’s like airplane miles.   Most people use gift cards within eight weeks. Those that don’t: three to four years. The rest, you shift from liability to asset.   In that case, the later the person uses the card, the greater the business cost. I’d want late fees to encourage use. I wouldn’t want the opportunity cost of outstanding gift cards as an anchor on my balance sheet.	1641201192.0	hr1xrqu	t3_rux1o2	t3_rux1o2	/r/changemyview/comments/rux1o2/cmv_gift_cards_should_never_expire/hr1xrqu/

There's tons of cultural groups that support white communities and aren't used as a weapon. Milwaukee for example hosts an Italian fest, German Fest, Irish Fest, Polish Fest a place near me hosts Swedish fest. These are all put on by identity interest groups that are made up of white people. In many situations black people can't really host Ethiopia fest or Ghana fest because many don't know where their ancestors came from (due to them being captured slaves).

4g6va	A long time ago I read a quote from one of the writers of the Exalted TTRPG talking about one of that setting's ultimate evils, the Ebon Dragon, that I didn't think I'd be paraphrasing on this sub of all places but here goes:  > "His evil is pathetic. It's contemptible. That doesn't make him weak, but neither is he heroic in any sense of the word. He's a force of evil without scruples or morals that stands for nothing except making life worse for everyone. He will stab you in the back at every turn and cannot be reformed. But when you pull back the curtain and really *look* at him, you can see him for what he is: Not different or alien, just a loser. A dangerous loser, a loser with nothing stopping him hurting you any way he thinks he can get away with, but a loser nonetheless. None of this makes him less dangerous - he's smart and powerful enough that there's a very real threat he might win, but it won't be a triumphant victory and trying to frame it as such misses the point. He doesn't get to be cool for being evil. He doesn't get to win at his own game, he gets to lose at everyone else's. Give him half a chance and he'll go on and on about how virtue and morality are a tangled mess of pointless delusion and hypocrisy, but it's all to cover up the fact of the matter: That he's stuck playing in the same moral sandbox as everyone else, and he *sucks* at it. And on some level, he knows it.  A villain that's a loser isn't an oxymoron. There's something compelling about someone who's so insecure and shitty that the only thing they know what to do with that is make everyone else as miserable than they are. At the very least it's *a* valid way to write a villain.	1642555278.0	ht9apbg	t3_s7d4ii	t3_s7d4ii	/r/changemyview/comments/s7d4ii/cmv_voldemort_is_an_insecure_manchild_that_sits/ht9apbg/

Also if you treat media as escapism it's a disservice to it as a creative endeavor. It means that you are not really appreciating it for what it is but for some temporary relief. You could replace the media with something else and it wouldn't matter because it's just a distraction.  The whole idea of killing time or distractions is a bit sad in itself. Time is our most precious thing. Life is strange and mysterious. Why not live each moment fully? Even if you're just watching a show to rest, why not enjoy the show instead of tresting it as an escape? Plus it won't work since your problems will not go away.  Adorno's comments are pretty relevant today because it seems as though escapism is cannibalizing whole swathes of culture, making it interchangeable.

gzycg4vs	I agree with a lot of what you say, but I think your last point there is a bit disingenuous.  I'm not saying white nationalism is okay because black nationalism is okay. I'm just saying that it is completely unrealistic to expect white people NOT to rally around their identity overtly while other races are doing the exact same thing. Whether or not it's justified is besides the point. Unfortunately I do believe identity politics sort of plays into white nationalists wet dreams as it helps create a unified white identity by painting society as an eternal struggle between White People and POC. I don't like it anymore than you do. I certainly would prefer an identity politics movement that focused on class and improving the material conditions of the lower and middle classes through a united front but that is fundamentally incompatible with the modern approach.	1642533315.0	ht7qd9i	t3_s74jq4	t1_ht7o95q	/r/changemyview/comments/s74jq4/cmv_conservatives_pandering_to_white_people_more/ht7qd9i/

They also have zero incentive to muck around with the Constitution because its structure benefits them quite nicely.  The 2006 Democratic Party could still beat the stuffing out of them under the existing rules, the problem is that Democrats both want an electorally unviable coalition based on liberal social issues (as opposed to their old coalition based on rural-friendly economic populism) AND to win at the same time.  I don't know what it's going to take for people to figure out that's untenable, but the GOP will keep will be able to get away with pretty much anything until they do.	1642535761.0	ht7wzvr	t3_s6jhhk	t1_ht72flr	/r/changemyview/comments/s6jhhk/cmv_be_careful_what_you_wish_for_by_getting_rid/ht7wzvr/
3s4ve8nm	>I see them as all "needs", they are just on a hierarchy where some need to be fulfilled before others (e.g. Mazlow's hierarchy).  Which doesn't necessitate that that need be an (optional) career.  >Agreed. But being a full-time parent rather than balancing parenthood with a full-time job is not necessarily the right or moral choice.  It would be an issue of morality and responsibility if you're prioritizing an optional career over that of your children. You're own sentence implies that balancing that with a job would mean you're a part-time parent. If this is already the situation with one parent who works and is able to provide for the family comfortably, why would you want to have *both* parents be "part-time" parents?   >How much time is one expected to devote to one's family before one is allowed to take time to do something for oneself as an individual?  This is reframing the role of homemaker as someone who doesn't have any autonomy or agency for themselves. Are mothers who don't have a salaried job really not able to do anything for themselves? They don't have their own friends, their own interests, pursuits, hobbies, etc? They don't act as individuals? Why is a man who is *expected* to work and provide for himself and his family seen as being somehow freer?   >It relies on the assumption that these boys, consciously or subconsciously, see this as a "failure" of parenting (or of "strong" fatherhood) in the same way you (an adult with the benefit of years of experience, hindsight, and frontal cortex development) have.  I never said that they see it as a *failure* of parenting, subconsciously or consciously. What I said is that they begin to look up to other role models, and that gradually that erodes the respect they have for their parents, in this case, their fathers. As I said before with the example of condescension, it's an issue of respect through actions, not necessarily through conscious thought.   >I agreed allowing others the opportunity to save face in business situations was useful.   You initially were dismissive of it in general application though, as you said it's something that needs to "stay lost."   >I Googled for this poster and from what I found it looks like just an average rap artist poster.   It wouldn't matter if it looked like the "average" rap poster, as something being commonplace doesn't mean it should be seen as acceptable, or that it doesn't produce a negative effect. Racist caricatures of black people were common in the U.S., pre-Jim Crow, from entertainment to advertisements.   >The tattoos don't even really stand out, it's just ink I wouldn't otherwise pay much mind if you hadn't pointed them out as something you believe to be a problem.   This speaks to people being deficient in standards and lacking awareness. And as a parent, you should have higher standards and be more aware of these things when raising your children. And we've already agreed that Tupac Shakur is a horrible role model, an example of actual toxic masculinity, and a performer who's entire catalogue consists of promoting criminality, misogyny, drug use, and violence. Not to mention, hip-hop music itself is generally problematic in what it promotes. I have a hard time believing that adults, let alone parents, are that clueless.  >There doesn't seem to be anything overtly immoral or objectively wrong with these posters. So why assume any given father would be holding the same beliefs as you with the same experiences as you and react the same way as you would?  This is a signifiant lowering of general moral standards then if you don't find anything morally objectionable about someone with "Thug Life" tattooed prominently on their body. As I mentioned before, I'd assume that you would object to a poster of an entertainer who had "White Pride" tattooed on their stomach, or "Rapist 4 Life." But promoting a criminal or thug lifestyle is seen as "just ink" to you.  The poster is telling you what he's about, and you're arguing that there's no reason for a parent to draw conclusions from the poster. Again, this speaks to the deficiency of adults and parents if they were to see that poster and not see a problem.   >I'm basing it on my own experiences and the experiences of people I've interacted with. Why do you believe that as a general rule it does not not benefit men to show emotional vulnerability?  I edited my previous comment right before you replied, but I'll repeat it here as I think it better illustrates my point:  **I think a problem is that many people don't realize that men in general express vulnerability and empathy differently from how women in general do.**   [YouTube: Why “boys will be boys” is a myth—and a harmful one at that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydzfQ1X7ips)  I think an example of this lack of understanding is apparent in the above video featuring developmental psychologist Niobe Way.  I don't want to focus too much on saving face, as social dynamics among men are more complex than just that, but the concept itself is one way men express vulnerability and empathy. But if you're not a man, or if you haven't learned those types of social skills, then you might mistake it for a lack of emotion. You wouldn't understand why it might be healthier or more beneficial in certain situations or environments.   >Why should they seek support from their parents/fathers first before their wife and children?   One big reason is that the parents have more life experience then that of a man's wife or children. They're more likely to have been through what he's going through. The parents, and in particular the father, would likely and ideally be more capable of support because of that. And the problem is that the wisdom and experience of men's parents, as a form of support,  isn't even mentioned in the article. They suggest men going directly to his wife and the children with his problems.   >Does this stem from your belief that men must be seen as invulnerable protectors to the people they "protect" at all times?   Partly yes, although I wouldn't use the term "invulnerable," as its hyperbolic and inaccurate.  >You've already indicated that there is a benefit to fathers not showing fear in certain situations so that their kids can remain calm, which I agree with. Why do you believe seeking support from one's wife and children constitutes a "burden"?   It's important that the husband and father appear strong, and that the wife and children have a sense of safety and security from him. If he's seen cracking under the pressure, and if he's confiding in them all these worries, concerns, fears, etc that he has, their sense of safety and security is being eroded. This doesn't just apply to life or death situations, but for day-to-day things as well. If he's worried about finances or his job, and he confides these worries to his children, then *they* are now worried about their situation, and whether or not their father might lose his job, if they lose their house, etc.   >Why does seeking support from one's own own fathers/parents, religious figures, male friends, etc not constitute a burden on those parties?   To some degree it may create *some* degree of burden or concern for the parents. But parents are used to that. It's their job as parents to parent, to listen to their children, to help them and support them, throughout life. It's not the children's job or responsibility to parent the parent, at least not in the context of adolescent children.  Additionally, in most cases the parents wouldn't be directly dependent on the son, as they are likely married to each other, living on their own, in their own home, with their own savings. The man's parents' physical, emotional, and financial safety and security, is not being directly threatened.   As far as male friends, again, the male friends are not dependent on the man, nor is their well-being directly threatened. So why would it be a burden on them? Most friends confide in each other.  And why would a religious advisor, who's job it is to console and advise people, be burdened by this? People in those roles are usually better trained and equipped to deal with these things than children.	1642536074.0	ht7xut1	t3_s05bon	t1_ht7c6cv	/r/changemyview/comments/s05bon/cmv_trans_men_are_often_ignored_by_conservatives/ht7xut1/

In the hospital, absolutely none of them would even dream of introducing themselves as "doctor" even though they've earned the right to do so outside of the clinical context; in a medical setting, there's an issue of ethics when it comes to accurately representing yourself.

You say that as if people controlled criminals to be mostly dangerous to women just to spite women.   No, there's nothing wrong with it, it's reasonable, most women fall victim to rape more than men so people naturally tell them more to be careful, that's reality.   >Why isn't advises given to men to "stay at home", "don't approach women"    or "castrate yourself" because men have higher risk of committing these    crimes?

Just as a man should view his wife and children as his top priorities.   >There is always more she could be doing for the children, always. Why have hobbies and friends when you could focus on your children even more?   Because human beings require some degree of downtime. In the U.S. we have a 5-day work week, with two-days off, typically. The typical work day is limited to 8 hours. Even in Abrahamic religions people are required to at least one day of rest.   >Point being, at what point can a woman say "I am doing enough for my children, this next choice I am making is for the sake of myself"?  I think there's a significant difference between having additional interests in your life, and being away from home for 40-80 hrs a week.   >I think you need to clarify here...  It's not a binary choice. It could be one, the other, or both. It even be none of the above as unlikely as that is.    >The "art" of being insincere with the intent to manipulate social dynamics is one that I think should stay lost, but that's me.  Something like saving face is showing intent to manipulate? I guess you could categorize it as that, but that's creating a low bar for what's considered manipulation. Parents, managers, and teachers could be seen as manipulators.  >Idolizing the thug life is not acceptable, but having a poster like this does not necessarily mean the person who hung that poster idolizes the thug life, because it could simply be they really like the subject's music.  You would be idolizing someone who is a thug and who promotes the thug lifestyle. And you've come back to saying it could simply be they really like the subject's music, which just so happens to be about promoting criminality, misogyny, violence, and drug dealing.   This would be akin to a teenager putting up a poster of a swastika tattooed, racist skinhead rock performer on their wall, and listening to the racist skinhead's music that promotes violence towards blacks, Jews, gays, and other minorities.  *They could just like the music.*  Maybe, but it would be irresponsible of me as a parent to just accept that.  >I would be surprised if most parents of that day and age with children of an age to like this type of music knew who Tupac Shakur was, let alone what he stands for.  That's hard to believe consider the reputation rap music has had since the early 1990s. Not to mention the CD album cover art and track listings, the lyrics from the music being played in the house or in the car, or again, posters where Shakur is showing off his THUG LIFE tattoo, wearing a gun medallion, or wearing bandanas and throwing gang signs. We're getting to the point where we're assuming that parents aren't just deaf and blind, but apparently live under a rock.   >Maybe this is due to a difference in perspectives and experiences between us, **but I see this sort of ink as an acknowledgement of a reality** rather than a celebration of that reality.   Did you have this belief prior to the article you linked? It would be a strange acknowledgement of reality. I don't see too many people getting tattoos of "White Supremacy," as a simple acknowledgment that it exists.   >I'm just looking into this further now, and I would have never known this if I just took his ink at face value.  Did you consider that this may be an instance of a charismatic entertainer manipulating a gullible audience in order to deflect from legitimate criticism of what he promotes in his music and personal life?  [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU) of Shakur's most popular and well-known songs:  *First off fuck your bitch and the click you claim/ Westside when we ride, call me quick with game/ you claim to be a player but I fucked your wife/ we bust on Bad Boys/ Niggas fucked for life...*  *...This is how we do it on our side/ Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it/ But we ain't singin'/ We bringing drama/ fuck you and your mothafuckin' mama/ we gon' kill all you muthafuckas...We mothafuckin' Thug Life riders/ Westside 'til we die!*  And if you don't know the context of the song, he's bragging about having sex with the Notorious B.I.G.'s wife, Faith Evans, while threatening the life of B.I.G. and several other New York rap artists, which ignited a eastcoast/westcoast [feud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast%E2%80%93West_Coast_hip_hop_rivalry) that resulted in both Tupac and Biggie being murdered in separate drive-bys.   >Perhaps you can provide an example of these different ways and methods of expressing vulnerability and empathy.  Ex 1. In high school one of our friends got into a fight with another dude after school, with what seemed like half the school watching. Our friend got knocked out, laid out on his back, dazed and not able to get back up, with the fight obviously being over at that point. Instead of asking if he was alright, or showing open concern, my other friend just put his hand out to him to  pull himself up and said, "Damn bro, what are you trying to do, run down the clock?"  Ex 2. In college, a friend's girlfriend got a new car. A few days later when our group were going back to her car, someone had scratched "BITCH" in giant letters across the hood. She was devastated, and everyone felt bad for her. Her boyfriend broke the awkwardness by flippantly remarking, "Damn, that sucks...But at least they got your personality right."  Ex 3. Three older teenagers are walking through an area when someone from somewhere yells "Fuck you pussy!" One of the three teenagers yells back, "Who the fuck said that!?" A larger teen emerges with his own group behind him and says, "I did." The one who was initially insulted responds, "So what, you just like to yell random shit at people to make yourself look cool?"  >Yes, that's definitely a pragmatic choice, but I think whether it's a good idea to go to his parents or wife first depends on the situation.  Of course, but the article itself is skipping all other possible options, while also recommending that the father go to the children with his problems. So the most obvious, pragmatic choices are being completely ignored, in an attempt to counter, what the writer thinks is toxic masculinity.  >This idea that he can't open up to his own wife about difficulties or else she'll lose faith in his ability to provide safety and security comes from where exactly?  It's kind of human nature, as seen through history or personal experience. Just from my own life, having the only parent in the home cry to me about not being able to make the rent and what is she going to do, or waking me up in the middle of the night because she thought someone was breaking into our house didn't make me feel too secure as a 13 year old. I think it would have been worse had it been my father acting this way.   >Or is it because you don't see you and your partner as a team?  You can still be part of a team, while being team leader.	1642562410.0	ht9qyqr	t3_s05bon	t1_ht85jld	/r/changemyview/comments/s05bon/cmv_trans_men_are_often_ignored_by_conservatives/ht9qyqr/

The very idea that someone knows your sexuality better also goes against a lot of what people making that claim argue in general. It’s either people know their own sexuality the best or they don’t. The vast majority of people are 0 or 7. We know this because they’ve said they are.

4kzvpbvd	none of that makes any sense.  you don't just magically get better gas mileage because your car produces torque at a lower RPM range.  And the argument isn't about having torque or not having torque, it is about having torque at a low RPM range.  A car that produces peak torque at high RPM accelerates just as effortlessly as a car that produces torque at low RPMs.    Why does it matter if a dealer won't let you test drive without a deposit (which I have never run into personally.  All they have ever asked is proof I had insurance)  If you can't manage a deposit to test drive the car, you shouldn't be buying the car.    I can understand some people buy cars sight unseen, but in that case, there is far more to performance than its torque at a certain RPM range.  Since the point of this is for non-enthusiasts, do they want the car that produces 250 ft-lbs of torque but weighs 4000 lbs or the car that only  produces 200 ft-lbs but only weighs 3000 lbs?    What does being pulled by a sprinter or pushed by a football player have to do with anything assuming both are capable of doing the job and the sprinter just happens to takes smaller steps at a faster pace while the football player takes larger steps at a slower pace?  take drivers who aren't car enthusiasts and have them drive 2 different cars that have 2 different power bands but cover up the tachometer and you know what will happen?  They will push the pedal as far as they feel they need to to get the performance they are wanting.  And if the car is more powerful than they need, they will reach their desired power to overtake a car on a 2 lane road with less pedal travel, and if their car has less power than they need, they will end up bottoming out the pedal and still be disappointed in the acceleration.  They are in an automatic, there is nothing they need to do regarding the tachometer.  And as for engine noise, you can easily tune exhaust to make a high revving engine sound more mild and a low revving engine sound more intense, but for most modern non-sports cars, you are still getting a pretty quiet and calm cabin even when you are revving to 5k.    No driver is or should be trying to pass in an oncoming lane with an automatic transmissions and basing their driving on watching their tachometer.	1642566839.0	hta06tg	t3_s746xb	t1_ht9tejj	/r/changemyview/comments/s746xb/cmv_they_should_clearly_label_all_cars_with_how/hta06tg/
5c5jxlcp	The issue is they are highly confrontational by nature because it comes along with a social norm that you expect others to call you by the pronoun of your choice regardless of whether or not they agree with the underlying assumptions.    What people forgot almost instantly about the gay rights movement is it spent a good 25+ years normalizing being gay in popular culture as "we are just like you and we just want the same rights as you."  That was a highly successful approach, gay rights are now basically non-controversial politically.    Pushing pronoun usage is the oppose tactic.  It assumes one can ignore the mores of people who aren't on your page and actively seeks confrontation with them just by going around day to day life.  One may argue that's unfair and they  shouldn't have to worry about how others will react, but that's a very unrealistic view of social change.	1642568074.0	hta2l8r	t3_s7hlem	t3_s7hlem	/r/changemyview/comments/s7hlem/cmv_there_is_no_problem_with_neopronouns/hta2l8r/

4kzvpbvd	being at low rpm doesn't automatically get you better fuel economy.  being in the correct rpm range for your needs and your vehicle gets you better fuel economy.  lower rpm tends to get better fuel economy because you aren't accelerating as quickly as if you were at higher rpms.  tune the vehicle to accelerate more at low rpm and you just hurt fuel economy.  dealerships being a thing has nothing to do with this.  if people slowly get up to speed, wouldn't they just push the pedal more slowly if their vehicle seems to be accelerating faster than they expected for the rpm or pedal position?  also, pedal position can be tuned to be whatever you want.  its not a direct tie to rpm.  luckily since cars don't have a single gear transmission, you don't have to choose between these two.  lower gears function like the football player, higher gears function like the sprinter, and the automatic transmission automatically shifts between them.  push the pedal to go faster and your car will downshift and accelerate.	1642578483.0	htajah5	t3_s746xb	t1_htah0v3	/r/changemyview/comments/s746xb/cmv_they_should_clearly_label_all_cars_with_how/htajah5/
s0g4g	Not necessarily. Molecular cell biology covers a lot of turf. Just as the same person pointed out there are many different specializations in medical studies. Like I said before, it’s not too hard to check credentials of someone that is calling themselves a doctor while discussing specialized topics in a public setting. Although OP told me it was hard to find information on this individual, OP also uses “a tiny bit of research shows that he has a PhD in theology” in their original post. Admittedly a PhD in theology is a stretch for discussing virology. This is also a question of media throwing people on a stage with a fancy title that also support their rhetoric or increase viewership with controversial views. There are plenty of MDs in the public eye who dole out sketchy information and advice as well. Sadly, the viewing audience has to be careful these days with where they get any information. OP basically wants to strip people of their title in public settings that they’ve worked hard for unless he/she thinks their qualifications are suitable to discuss medical sciences or if they are an MD.  Further, OPs post is not well written saying that he thinks it’s ok for PhD’s to introduce themselves as Doctors (WoW thanks!) but ‘it’s immoral’. What’s immoral? Just to reiterate the point that was made by izzawlgood, there are plenty of specialized doctors in different scientific disciplines who may have stronger knowledge about a medical topic than a medical doctor, how do we decide when someone is or is not ‘allowed’ to use their credentials in a public forum? Secondly, there are plenty of MDs hawking bad information backed by their title but that’s a different conversation. Consumer has some responsibility here to eke out reliable sources with ‘a tiny bit of research’.	1642579826.0	htal33z	t3_s6vnxe	t1_htah7np	/r/changemyview/comments/s6vnxe/cmv_people_with_a_phd_in_an_unrelated_field/htal33z/

c14jklqh	Humans are inconsistent and it can be a matter of both not wanting to see a complex living being with a developed sensory system suffer and finding certain animals cute and cuddly. But the fact that humans are inconsistent doesn't mean that we can't reduce suffering in a limited or localized way, ought of a sense of moral outrage that we aren't saving all animals. This is the reason why I used the word whataboutism. If you transpose to helping humans it becomes clearer. Example 'Why should I help this American kid in foster care get an education when we don't even help Yemeni children not starve?' This is no different from saying 'I'm not going to improve factory farming conditions in my city because Orcas are being treated poorly in SeaWorld.' The urge to morally condemn actions should not be stronger than the thought given to things that can alleviate the problem. This is actually a moral argument rebranded as a form of rationality, since the rational strategy would be to actually do things that have an effect. Even if you educate just one foster kid or save just one whale from living in a pool, that's still something.  It's true that we can't reliably turn people into vegans. But some progress has been made in that area. In turn that progress has led to research on developing new types of food, and this in turn will have ripple effects in unrelated fields such as ecology since the environmental impact of meat is so large.	1642599577.0	htbdx7v	t3_s6lv89	t1_htagi24	/r/changemyview/comments/s6lv89/cmv_many_animals_we_consume_are_too_intelligent/htbdx7v/

I suppose I could keep a burrito in my pocket, but I think the scotch egg has it beat in terms of transportation. Health wise, I could imagine you could make the burrito as healthy or as unhealthy as you wanted which makes it very customisable. Though I've never made one, I'm going to assume that the scotch egg is cheaper to make just due to the ingredients needed, although this could vary depending on your burrito.   Hmm. Interesting. It hurts to say it but if I'm being objective here, it sounds like the scotch egg has been beaten. I don't think anything can ever take the spot it has in my heart though.

Who makes the determination of what worth is? Human beings. No animal is there with us to partake in that debate. We narrowly define worth according to our own instincts and anthropocentric reasoning. Even if we determine that animals are of equal worth, that's still us making that decision collectively. Therefore we are still on another plane of existence since we can add a layer to the world that animals can't.  To be clear, I am not advocating for the poor treatment of animals, just saying that the debate is circular at its core.	1642600063.0	htbey33	t3_s7qezu	t3_s7qezu	/r/changemyview/comments/s7qezu/cmv_the_belief_that_humans_are_special_godshaped/htbey33/

c14jklqh	Based on your answers in the thread it seems you are redefining what 'worst' means to fit depression specifically. Sounds as though you are simply frustrated at comments you have received in real life, and are trying to counter them. But the more rational response to those would be to avoid their framework altogether instead of trying to argue against them. It doesn't matter if there are other illnesses out there given that you have to deal with this one currently. Defining your illness as the 'worst' will not help in the slightest in the fight against it. At best you'll 'gotcha' the people in your life but their comments are probably in response to not wanting to deal with your negativity and complaints as a result of the depression to begin with, so that's a pointless fight since it does not address the source of their hostility.  On a purely logical basis it should be obvious that there are worse illnesses in absolute terms, given the existence of cluster headaches, cancer, genetic disorders, being almost entirely paralyzed but conscious. Heck even gender dysphoria has an incredibly high suicide rate.	1642602531.0	htbkeij	t3_s7ovpt	t3_s7ovpt	/r/changemyview/comments/s7ovpt/cmv_depression_is_the_worst_illness_out_there/htbkeij/

5c5jxlcp	Re confrontation, how do you envision the reactions and social norms around someone who doesn't use a neopronoun when you would want them to?  Is it something you use yourself and if others mis-pronoun you you're fine with it and hope they adopt it on their own later, or do you tell them you are unhappy about it or try to create social sanction around it in the wider culture?    The former is a non-confrontational strategy, the later is highly confrontational.  My impression is that the proponents of neopronouns seek to create a high level of social sanction around misgendering or using the wrong pronouns which is by nature forcing a high stakes social confrontation.  RE the Civil Rights movement in the 50's and 60's, I don't think you have the history right.  The movement consciously adopted the a very non-confrontational strategy culturally (non-violence, focus on religious imagery, highly conformist clothing, etc).  Also, I don't think use of specific names was a big focus although I don't know the history well enough to confirm that 100%.	1642603652.0	htbn12n	t3_s7hlem	t1_htahi09	/r/changemyview/comments/s7hlem/cmv_there_is_no_problem_with_neopronouns/htbn12n/

l4fasxy	Let me correct some of your errors as far as Catholic theology is concerned.  1. Per Aquinas, humans are animals. The distinction between humans and other animals is that humans are the only animals we know of that are rational, defined as capable of abstract thought. 2. In Catholicism, the soul is defined as the form (Aristotelian sense) of a living being. So animals and plants have souls. But as far as we know, humans are the only life forms that have *rational* souls. Catholic theology does allow for the possibility that we may discover one day some other animals (e.g. ceteceans, corvids, other primates, aliens) also are capable of rational thought. 3. It is possible to prove that a *rational* soul survives death. (If you are interested in the details of this proof, ask about it on /r/catholicphilosophy.  Note this does not rule out the possibility that non-rational souls, such as those of animals, also survive death. Also note that this is not the same thing as consciousness surviving death, because it would just be the faculties of will and rationality that survive death and not the ability to experience qualia. 4. Believing that human rational souls survive death is NOT a response to existentialism, because the theology of the soul was worked out many centuries before philosophers developed existentialism.	1642604626.0	htbpdvc	t3_s7qezu	t3_s7qezu	/r/changemyview/comments/s7qezu/cmv_the_belief_that_humans_are_special_godshaped/htbpdvc/

It's a bit like weed. It's not likely to fund terrorism or make you crazy or any of the boomer fears about it but it will make you fine with not doing stuff in general or having a mediocre existence. It will keep the edge off precisely when you need to ask yourself uncomfortable questions.  What I find funny is that opposition to porn is often done for sex-negative reasons but in reality porn is one of the most sex-negative facets of modern life out there given that it sedates so many people and makes them fine with getting less action than they otherwise would have.	1642605447.0	htbrea2	t3_s7r2vr	t3_s7r2vr	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htbrea2/
c14jklqh	Nofap is pseudoscience. But you are confusing giving on porn with giving up on masturbation, and the fact that nofap is dumb with the idea that there's no drawback to porn.  My point is that you have ambivalent views on porn and hentai. So why not drop them? Shouldn't that be a huge part of the convo?	1642606576.0	htbu69s	t3_s7r2vr	t1_htbrq9b	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htbu69s/
c14jklqh	Another way of thinking about it: so you are already of the view that mainstream porn is unethical. Let's imagine for the sake of the argument that you find that hentai is also unethical for whatever reason. What do you do now? Do you continue watching hentai?  The answer is important because you might be evaluating hentai from the starting point of *needing* a substitute for regular porn, as per your own post. So a strong bias in favor of the status quo will creep in. It would make more sense to confront what your stance on ethics and values are, and then evaluate both porn and hentai separately and on their own merits. The answer might still be that you will continue watching one of them, but the decision should at least come from an actual ethical decision as opposed to being the result of being accustomed to something.	1642608639.0	htbzdyu	t3_s7r2vr	t1_htbwf3s	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/htbzdyu/

4kzvpbvd	Look at most chefs through history.  They were men.  Cooking isn’t a feminine thing, staying at home because they weren’t working was a feminine thing, and since they were at home, cooking was something they could do.    Most of the tasks around the home became associated with women not because it was a feminine thing, but because it was essentially a smaller scale of a profession that they felt a woman could manage.  They didn’t trust a woman to run a commercial kitchen, but she can at least feed the kids and have something hot for her husband when he gets home.    Men didn’t not cook because it wasn’t a manly thing to do, but because they had more important things to do that they women couldn’t do (partially due to physical labor and partially due to education, and other social factors, so women did what was left, not what was best suited for them. Men couldn’t be the ones to stay home with children because they can’t produce milk or get pregnant, and if you have 5 kids, and you breastfeed each one for 1 year and are pregnant with each one for 9 months, that is around a 9 year span (let’s call it 10 years because statistically there will be at least one child that doesn’t make it) during which the mother can’t reliably work outside the home.  So it made sense to prepare women to care for the home and family and men to work outside the home.	1642700888.0	hthhsxs	t3_s8nd8z	t1_hthbutj	/r/changemyview/comments/s8nd8z/cmv_nobody_is_more_preoccupied_with_the_opinions/hthhsxs/

4kzvpbvd	I saw that comment, you say you are going to give a definition then give an example that never explains why that is related to the term homoerotic. I think you know that definition makes no sense based on the structure of the compound word homo and erotic.   Can you cite a legitimate definition of how this is used sociologically?  Otherwise it feels like an attempt to force the use of a more dramatic sounding name to a fairly simple behavior.  If you were asking your coworker how much they get paid and your boss decided to send out an email to the company saying certain employees, and then name dropping you, are engaging in erotic behavior with their coworker on company time and that while it isn’t officially illegal, it is not appreciated, it would be very strange and unlikely he chose that word with pure intention, and instead chose that word to gain an advantage in the situation.	1642706377.0	hthwtfp	t3_s8nd8z	t1_hthj1ku	/r/changemyview/comments/s8nd8z/cmv_nobody_is_more_preoccupied_with_the_opinions/hthwtfp/
4kzvpbvd	Yeah, the use of that word and the defense that it means something different is pretty weak.  If I am writing a sociological research report and refer to women as “poopy faced whiney babies, but when questioned, I explain that I have redefined that phrase to mean “average women in the US”.

4kzvpbvd	So since women have those same traits toward women, women are homoerotic as well?  Since children love and mimic their parents and love praise from their parents, children are erotic towards their parents?

l4fasxy	The point is to increase demand for people to go into these fields. In the US there appears to be a shortage of physicians, so making it so they don't have to deal with these high amounts of debts would help greatly.  Please note that in the US, not everyone who gets a MD degree is able to obtain a residency and then practice medicine.  One of my neighbors got a MD degree but could not get a residency (because there are fewer residency slots than people getting MD degrees each year in the US, which is just plain wrong!)  so he was stuck with his huge student loan and no chance of getting a high pay position to pay it off.	1642707176.0	hthyy2n	t3_s8qeuu	t1_hthx6tl	/r/changemyview/comments/s8qeuu/cmv_forgiving_all_student_debt_is_a_bad_idea_and/hthyy2n/

3s4ve8nm	>There are plenty of wants/needs that I think are acceptable to pursue in addition to maintaining parental responsibilities; I contend that having a job/career is one of those.  But you based this on fulfilling a personal need, not on whether or not it was acceptable. Why is one it acceptable to fulfill one need and not the other? I would argue is that it's because we see a career that's traditional (law, medicine, business, etc) as acceptable and "normal." So because a traditional, high-paying salaried job is seen as respectable and aspirational in society, then it's gradually come to be acceptable for a mother to *choose* to do that, instead of taking advantage of the opportunity provided by her husband to NOT stay away from her family and kids for 40-80 hrs a week. We talk about the problem with traditional norms (gender norms for ex) , but yet we like to reinforce others without really thinking about them.  >I think it's important for teenagers to buck the norms of the day a little bit.  I've heard that same argument as well, but it doesn't seem to have much substance. What if bucking the norm is morally wrong? It's justifying rebellion for it's own sake instead of basing it on logic and reason.  >I don't see how "just being a teenager" is problematic. You'd have to demonstrate some problem extending from that before I'd consider agreeing to it.  A kid gets caught smoking weed. Parent: *He's just being a teenager, that's what they do.*  A middle schooler is in a gang: *That's just what teenagers do. He'll grow out of it. I remember when I was in a 'gang.' We used to drag the main in my Plymouth and sometimes get into fisticuffs with the kids across town. And look at me now. I turned out fine.*  >Why would it follow that because I'm unfamiliar with gang culture I couldn't come to the conclusion that gangs exist and gang violence exists?  I wasn't questioning your awareness of whether gangs or gang violence exists. I was questioning how you've come to the conclusion that it's a result of poverty, racism and a faulty system.  >I assumed he was just another gangbanger who made it big because he was a talented and popular rap artist.  This goes to my point about assumptions, conditioning, and relying on pop-culture and mainstream beliefs that don't seem to be very helpful. You assumed he was a gang banger, and because of that, he was a victim of circumstance and didn't have control over his own actions.  >Am I wrong that poverty and crime are connected?  In a way, yes. Crime exists at all levels, and it's actually counterproductive to view it as something that the poor mostly engage in, when it's rampant at all levels of society. This thinking is why society differentiates between crime and "white collar crime." Or how, the average person stealing is a "thief," whereas someone rich and of high status stealing is considered an "embezzler." I've known gang members of all different races, from a variety of gangs, and none of them were in a position where they were deprived of any basic needs. Not to mention, I've lived in hood areas, big cities, the suburbs, small towns, and they all had gangs.    >Or that poverty, crime, and institutional racism are connected? I didn't realize I needed an intimate understanding of gang culture to grasp these basic well-established facts.  I would think you would if you're trying to argue that these are well-established facts. Again, where are you getting these facts from exactly? I've heard the same claims and beliefs throughout my life, whether it be from books, academics, professors in college, documentaries, etc. But I can't say they're facts.  For example, one [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crips_and_Bloods:_Made_in_America) claims the gangs started in Los Angeles in the 1960s because black youth were turned away from joining the Boy Scouts due to racism. I've seen this and similar things repeated in college social science classes, to various news articles like "How Boy Scouts Racism helped Spark LA's Bloods and Crips." It sounds good, but it's not true.  >The difference from my perspective is that one is a symptom of a problem and the other is a cause of a problem (although technically still a symptom of core human tendencies IMO).  But you said earlier you don't have a problem with entertainers like Shakur who promote criminal organizations, gang violence, violence, misogyny, homophobia etc in their music, but you *would* have a problem with a white supremacist entertainer doing the same.  >Maybe you don't. I don't either, but I'm not going to pretend like it's some moral violation to do so...It's not some scandal. And also: rightly or wrongly, topless men != topless women in our (US) culture.  I think this comes back to the topic of masculinity, respect and social etiquette, and how people don't have an understanding of these things because they're not being taught anymore.  You seem to be implying that I'm some type of prude, especially when bringing up being at the pool. I think it would be obvious that a kid's bedroom is not the pool, nor is it the beach.  As a husband and father, I wouldn't walk around the house without my shirt off because I'm setting the example for my children to follow. I don't want my son (or daughter) walking around like that in the house. And why wouldn't you want your children, in particular, your son to be walking around shirtless? A variety of reasons, but one being the more casual the wear, the more casual your attitude and behavior is to be, which is why some jobs and schools have uniforms or a dress code. Being in a state of undress increases the likelihood that kids/teens will gradually become too casual in how they interact with their parents, to the point of disrespect, however big or small that may be.  There's many other reasons on the meaning of a man being shirtless in a environment that doesn't require it, but...character limits.  >Probably true to a certain extent, but is there not a grain of truth to it?  In the case of the former, yeah. For example kids who grow up in the gang life due to their parents being active gang members, in the same way white supremacists grow up thinking that way because of their parents. They were screwed up due to that type of indoctrination.   In the case of the latter, them being these scrappy underdogs, trying to do right in their own way? Absolutely not. And I'm not saying this as some social conservative, who's on the outside looking in. I grew up with these types, I had close friends who were gang members. You can't be a gang member and have any type of morals. It's a very cut throat life that the average person doesn't realize because of media portrayals. And what I mean by that is that it's very political, in that everyone's plotting on one another, even people from within the same hood and those that they consider friends. *If I can take from you, I will.*  >I was ready to see him exactly as you portrayed him, but now I'm ready to see him as someone much more complicated than that.  You seem to be  letting yourself be swayed by hagiographic accounts, romanticizations and outright falsehoods.  **The Baltimore Sun** You know it's a puff piece when they won't even call rape "rape," and instead, describe it as "forcing someone into sex." I read the whole thing, and yeah, it's a gushing puff piece, maybe written by a fan.  **Reddit TIL** Full of misinformation. Tupac relied on the NOI for security after he was shot. He also included a speech by NOI leader Louis Farrakhan for his 1995 song ["Da Struggle Continuez."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFkD3pCkwtQ) Tupac Shakur was befriend by Haitian Jack and saw him as a criminal mentor by his own admission. They were close friends until they were both accused by a woman of gang rape. That's when he started to put distance between himself and Jack. Jimmy Henchman never tried to extort Tupac, but offered to pay him $7k to record a song for one of his artists, to which Shakur agreed. Tupac was not released from prison because of new evidence regarding his case, but because he made bail, which he didn't have money for initially. And no one is "found innocent" in a court of law. It's either "guilty" or "not guilty," the latter meaning there's not enough evidence to prove a guilty conviction.	1642715636.0	htikxcy	t3_s05bon	t1_htgy5dc	/r/changemyview/comments/s05bon/cmv_trans_men_are_often_ignored_by_conservatives/htikxcy/

I believe I've understood your view, at least in relation to sub-topic, but I'm trying to show how it appears to be inconsistent, which is why I mentioned how we're conditioned by various norms, for better or worse.   >Why does someone want to do OnlyFans? Are they trying to validate their insecurities? Are they trying to make ends meet? Are they cashing in on some asset?...I think I already alluded to this with the gambling example.  I'm not trying to sound flippant, but for the vast majority of the time, it's just people (mostly women) looking to make easy money. And if we're to have some degree of moral standards, and I'm sure we both do and even shared ones, then OnlyFans and porn in general is not something that should be normalized. It's in very rare and extreme cases where someone would need to rely on porn as their only option to clothe, feed and shelter themselves, and if that is the case, it would then become an issue of exploiting the poor and vulnerable.  >If her husband is working full-time and her kids are in school full-time, it will largely make no difference in terms of being "away from her family and kids" if she works full-time or stays home full-time: either way, she's away from her family and kids for 8 hours of the day.  Kids go to school from 8am and get out as early as 2pm. A traditional 9 to 5 has the mom getting home as early 5:30pm. If dad's working too, who's watching the kids from 2pm to 5:30pm? And this is in an ideal situation, and not one where the mom is choosing to work a salaried job where she's putting in way more hours than that.  >I'm pretty sure we were talking about listening to certain kinds of music and hanging up posters in one's bedroom.  But you asked me how the expression/justification "just being teenagers" is problematic in the same way "boys will be boys" is. So I gave you examples.   >I don't view it that way, but it doesn't mean they're not connected. You're bordering on pedantry here.   It may sound like I'm being pedantic if you're not aware of the amount of corruption and crime that goes on in the "legit" world. Hence, why I don't believe that poverty or racism is the root or main cause as much as ideology.   >Redlining   >   >I'm not really here to convince you systematic/institutional racism exists or how it manifests.  I'm not arguing that those things don't exist or that they aren't a problem. But sayings gangs were created as a result of that is misguided and simplistic. You've admitted that you don't know much about gangs. I've grown up in that environment and know it pretty well, but even if I hadn't, just reading up on American and world history in an objective manner would tell me that this isn't the case. If you feel confident that it is, tell me which gangs you believe are a result of this and how exactly.   >I think what I said was I don't see them as the same. I don't like it. I don't like songs like that. I don't like people who promote behaviors like that. But I don't see it as the same as a similar situation with white supremacy instead.  I wasn't trying to say that you *like* the content, but my point is that you seem to be saying you would object to one but not the other. In that, you don't see anything wrong with a kid having a poster of an entertainer who who promotes and commits violence,  but you would if that same entertainer was a white supremacist. Unless you're saying that now, with new information you would object to both.  >OK so these are beliefs that stem from tradition. Fair enough if that's how you want to run your household.  But it's not for tradition, it's for a purpose. That's the disconnect we seem to be having. You let your son or daughter get into the habit of walking around half dressed you're cultivating poor social skills and a lack of respect in them. And that's just practical reasons off the top of my head.   >I'm so disappointed by the existence of character limits right now.  If we get back to talking directly about toxic masculinity and gender norms, hopefully I can work that into it.   >Do I have reason not to take Tupac's own words in that article at face value?  I mean, yeah. The author himself is cherry-picking Shakur's quotes to paint him as this rebel-saint. Additionally, Tupac was a master manipulator and liar, like most of the gangbangers I grew up with. As I said before, even as a teenage fan I knew when he was running a con with some of things he was saying. He lied about why he was fired from the set of *Menace II Society*, he lied about being shot five times (he shot himself in the groin), he lied about Biggie's involvement in his shooting, and so on and so on. He's definitely the Marvin Gaye of hip-hop, and a tremendous artist in every sense of the word. But he was also a scumbag who promoted degeneracy and violence in the community he claimed to love.   >Good news: you're on reddit and you can correct the record. Or better yet, challenge that user publicly so that none of us have any misapprehensions about Tupac Shakur's life.   I don't think it would be very productive, as the person who typed all that seems to be extremely biased and has an agenda. I grew up on Tupac's music, I was a big fan, I know his entire life story, and even I wouldn't make the errors or claims that he made in that post, so I'm assuming it's intentional on their part.   Not to mention, we have Google where people can separate truth from lies. Anyone that wants reads that Reddit post and believes it wholeheartedly is doing so because they want to.   >I have now received conflicting accounts of Tupac's life. I don't know what you're expecting, but needless to say I'm skeptical all-around.  I'm not trying to have a have a pissing contest here and brow beat you so I can say, "Hah, I win the debate!" I'm trying to give a heads up to someone who seems like a good person and who's reasonable. Maybe you won't ever come across anyone that's connected to gangs or crime in any capacity. But if you do, you might be more able to pick up on the signs so that you or your family don't get harmed in some way, and this extends to outside influences as well.  Tupac himself is a fascinating figure as an artist, and the Reddit post has a lot of truth, but mixed in with a lot of lies and conspiracy theories as well.   At the end of the day, we should judge people by their actions. But you, me, and others get swayed by charisma and talent, and subconsciously use that as an excuse to either justify these people's reprehensible behavior, or convince ourselves, "*he/she* couldn't have done that. They're so sincere and genuine. And look, at the great songs/movies they made! And everybody else likes them.

And this is in an ideal situation, and not one where the mom is choosing to work a salaried job where she's putting in way more hours than that. And that's just scraping the surface.  Depending on how old they are they might be able to look after themselves. Again, *context-dependent.* There is no hard and fast rule here.  There are going to be plenty of circumstances where we can both look at a situation and agree that it would be better for the kids if mom wasn't working the way that she is.

4kzvpbvd	no they wouldn't.  Even if was just a tiny minority of people, that's all it takes.    Just look at how people reacted when even the most minimal restrictions were imposed in the US.  A woman in Oklahoma shot and killed McDonalds employees because only the drive-thru was open and she wanted to eat inside.  People have lied about being vaccinated and fake vaccination cards can be found all over online.    Companies have sprung up bragging that they make the thinnest and most useless masks possible just to stick it to the people who mandate masks.  Are you going to completely shut down any human to human interaction?  Because any less than that, and the people who care the least who are infected will absolutely hide their symptoms in order to not have to be isolated.   Even workers who have paid time off to use for sick days don't want to waste vacation days for the sake of their coworkers, and when you try to give people unlimited time off with no punishment for using it if you are sick, some people will absolutely take advantage of that.  With any virus there will be higher and lower risk populations, so even if covid killed 10% of the people who got it, there would be some subset of healthy men in their 20's or such that only have a 1% chance or so, and some of those people would doubt those numbers and happily contract covid to get 2 full paid weeks off of work.    My in-laws believe covid is a conspiracy spread by the wealthy elite New World Order.  If it was more deadly, they would believe this even more strongly, and they refuse to wear masks, get vaccinated, get tested, or take any precautions for themselves or others.  They owned a restaurant and refused to have their workers wear masks, or even increased the frequency of workers washing their hands, and while my father-in-law has never been tested, he insists he had covid and was sick for 2 weeks before feeling better, the whole time he worked at the restaurant.  I agree a majority of people would take more precautions, but with it being more deadly, the minority of would actively oppose any safety measures would more than make of for any slowdown efforts from the majority.	1642750103.0	htkl3nx	t3_s8hryl	t1_htgl7ge	/r/changemyview/comments/s8hryl/cmv_covid_would_have_killed_less_people_if_it_was/htkl3nx/

yyhba	>Secondly, it gives students that are talented at something besides academics a taste of talent and interest being rewarded. Even if "gym" isn't a skill always required in the adult world, giving students a taste of success outside of raw academics would be beneficial for students self esteem.

It's not like these establishments are trying to trick people into the type of environment they offer.  >It also does what a lot of these CMV's related to kids do, which is divorce the concepts of how parents should behave, the reality of the challenges you face raising kids, and the place of new generations in supporting older generations as time passes. Without parents, human race doesn't just die but our current system collapses hard. But raising a child to modern standards is fucking hard.

3s4ve8nm	>Obviously it would be better if Hollywood just cast more Asian-American women in roles that weren't "roles for Asians" but you know, this is Hollywood, right? They probably won't, especially not after the whole Rose Tico debacle  This is what's so frustrating, with both sides of the argument. I always thought it was silly (although I get it) that "Hollywood" believed that female superheroes just don't sell based on a few awful female superhero films (Supergirl, Catwoman, Elektra). On the other hand, I don't think that one big superhero hit starring a woman means that audiences are craving female superheroes, and that that's where the money is. I would like to think it's because of the quality of the film that has audiences resonate with it.   Kelly Marie Tran seems like a lovely person, she seems like a solid actress, and very attractive. But holy crap, they made her to be a very cringey character in the film, while giving her a look that was very unflattering. I would like to think that anybody could see it was the writing and make-up/wardrobe that that turned people off from the character, not her ethnicity or acting.   But people forget too, it's not necessarily "Hollywood" but it's about convincing investors to fund the movie in the first place. They don't care about quality, they don't understand nuance. They just want to be convinced that they'll get a big return on their investment, and the producers do that by saying "Look, we got this big name actor/actress who's last three films grossed over a 100M! And look, this particular genre is a sure thing because of other successful films! Our film will be just like those ones!"	1642793955.0	htn1b8i	t3_s8musd	t1_hth6wd6	/r/changemyview/comments/s8musd/cmv_whitewashing_of_live_action_japanese_media_by/htn1b8i/

672cekt	> There are indeed several ways to formalize Occam's razor (or at least something derived/inspired by it), but they all actually came about much later than the original proposition. What you're proposing is just one of many possibilities, but it's a more limited statement than the original Occam's razor that was around long before it. I actually tried not to suggest anything to the contrary in my original comment, because I still think the important issue is this: These formalizations (particularly the one you're proposing here) really don't really seem to apply here, specifically.  But it seems like we agree only one of them is objectively true in a fully general way and that Solomonoff induction would allow us to use Occam’s razor to construct standards for *objectively better* explanations. I can get into this more but it seems like a can of worms we don’t need to open.   > Your proposal in particular only applies precisely if we can say that any competitor to many worlds strictly implies it, which is clearly not the case.   It actually is though. At least in the same sense that looking at the sky and thinking “those are stars not galaxies” requires all the same laws of physics that would cause galaxies *plus* some new exceptions to the rule to prevent galaxies from forming.   > It's equivalent to saying "assuming the other interpretations imply that many worlds is already true, then many worlds is at least as likely to be true as them."  Other interpretations do imply that many worlds is the physical outcome of quantum theory. It then posits some new unexplained phenomena that *prevent* those worlds from forming.   > Your description is of course very good, and I don't want to dismiss that, but I still think it's sweeping under the rug the fact that many worlds also does bring along some "more stuff," and we'd need to drop that entirely to make a strict inequality here. Simply: many worlds doesn't really conjecture nothing extra compared to its competitors.  Why does the amount of “stuff” matter? Does the extra stuff required for those stars to be galaxies mean we should conjecture that something prevents galaxies from forming?  The universe can have as much stuff as it wants.   We should already accept a far greater sudden expansion of “stuff” considering the possibility of a functionally infinite universe. And that has nothing to do with quantum theory.   > And we'd actually need there to be nothing extra at all, at least for a true, formal argument based on this law of probability.  Logically speaking, there is nothing extra. I think you’re conflating the parsimony of a logical proposition with the amount of physical things predicted.   A logical comparison of statements like:  *(A) all men are mortal*  Is far simpler than:  *(B) all men are mortal except Socrates*  There’s less mortal stuff in the second statement. But I hope it’s evident why removing things adds complexity.   > I have almost the opposite takeaway here, actually: the true advantage of the Copernican model is that it does have the potential for making better predictions (and better explanations, but I'll get to that in a moment) -- you can predict the motions of bodies that are moving at a constant speed with fewer special cases than the alternative model, and those predictions can be made in a general way.    Exactly. But not with what we knew about the world at the time. At the time, the geocentric model was exactly the same as the heliocentric model but with extra steps added to explain all the exceptions to the rules (epicycles, etc.).   Collapse postulates are exactly the same. MW requires merely the schrodinger equation. Collapse postulates add:  - spooky action at a distance - instantaneous faster than light effects - retrocausality (in quantum erasers) - indeterminacy - uncertainty leaving the realm of the mind and existing in the world instead  The number of exceptions required is truly staggering. Collapse postulates are the only law in all of ~~quantum mechanics~~ physics that is non-linear, non-unitary, non-differentiable, CPT symmetry violating, causality violating, and discontinuous.	1642795161.0	htn4nzt	t3_s8w8as	t1_htmx5b1	/r/changemyview/comments/s8w8as/cmv_everything_that_has_ever_happened_and_will/htn4nzt/

htnpbfml	I’m not a fan of the couch of “one of the best” since that’s an ejection seat for your view.   In my faith complex music like Casting Crowns as a means to preach is frowned upon. Personally I agree: I don’t understand why worshipers of any religion think rock music is a faithful way to teach us biblical themes. It’s extravagant: a man made tool to ease the bitter medicine of learning holy lessons and attract people through catchy earthly means.   But beyond my own faith, I have no idea why this genre exists. There must be huge demand and great profits/prophets surely. But didn’t many Christians this music is targeted at besmirch rock music?

64e6d	Heh, you didn't read your own link.   "The use of placebos in cancer clinical trials is rare..."  While I'm not sure why you're stalking my posts, it's quite obvious that you do not understand how clinical trials are conducted. Here's some more information so you can learn something new. Terms to look up -   Historical Controls  Standard of Care  https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-13-44  "It should be noted that there are many types of trials for which it is    not reasonable or even possible to use placebo controls. Examples of    these include surgical interventions, behavioral interventions, and    conditions for which there is a standard of care or an effective active    drug. While placebo, or sham, controls are theoretically possible for    many of these trials, ethical or practical considerations limit the    feasibility of conducting such trials. For example, alternative    approaches to case management in mental health care cannot employ    placebo controls. For the purposes of this discussion, we consider    trials for which it is both ethical and feasible to utilize a placebo    control group."  It's ok to not know how clinical trails are conducted, they're often quite complicated and require a lot of learning about to try and get your hands around.  Regarding your most recent misinformation, it's hilarious to point to Ian Miller. And regarding distancing policy, I am well aware and in agreement that there are variables to consider, such if you're in an enclosed space or outdoors.  You are continuing to underline your ignorance, so I'm glad you're in a position to be learning something new.

If NFTs were carbon neutral I might agree with your view. But we’re boiling the planet alive, and putting everything on the blockchain to create artificial scarcity so a few people can profit off of gullible buyers is a terrible thing to do, and we shouldn’t condone it on that basis.	1642822327.0	htp1vkh	t3_s9ptkg	t3_s9ptkg	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp1vkh/

5dkg4	At that point, why not consider how we value anything? Currency is just paper and bits on a computer somewhere. As a society, we’ve decided to collectively place value on it. Imagine if you only knew a world where we used bartering for everything, and some guy came around with tokens and tried saying “your home is the same as this token”.   If someone chooses to place value on an image, that’s none of my business. I don’t know why someone would pay millions for a canvas painted 1 color, but it happens. I don’t think spending money on luxury clothing brands is smart; it doesn’t mean I have a problem with people who buy them.	1642823609.0	htp4tcc	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp3g7n	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp4tcc/
5dkg4	The atoms that make up the paint on the canvas would be impossible to replicate from a photo. The pixels that make up a 30000x40000 digital photo would be impossible to replicate from a screenshot. Sure, atoms vs pixels is a different scale, but they’re both so infinite that it doesn’t matter because it can’t be done easily.   Also, you’re still making the argument that the ability to be replicated is tied to worth. Worth is entirely subjective.	1642824074.0	htp5uch	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp4ws7	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp5uch/
5dkg4	“If the art is easy to duplicate it’s worth less.” Definitely.   “If the art is easy to duplicate it’s worthless.” This is what I’m arguing against. It could still have some value to someone.   If your banana duct tape to a wall is valued the same by the buyer, they will buy it. If hundreds of people want it, it could go for insane prices. The likelihood of someone placing any value to this at all is very, very small.   Compare that to the NFT marketplace, where we have demonstrable proof that people assign value to different pieces of art. I personally find value in owning any NFT; that doesn’t mean I care if someone else finds millions of dollars in value in owning one. I could scream from the mountains about how much I wouldn’t like to buy one, but that doesn’t mean I’d ever stop someone who would.	1642824522.0	htp6td4	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp3r89	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp6td4/
5dkg4	I think you’re misunderstanding my second point, which better explains my first point.   The “Bored Ape” group of NFTs were specifically designed to be easy to create variations of. Different hats, glasses, hair, fur color etc. This was done in attempt to quickly produce thousands of unique images.  The motivations for creating that art are obvious. I don’t think the art is particularly good. This has fed into the image that NFTs are a scam.	1642824796.0	htp7e7y	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp6b3w	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp7e7y/
5dkg4	I just don’t think you’re addressing the fact that the only reason we don’t find money “weird” is because we have collectively as a society agreed that it makes sense. Same for backing it with gold; why do find gold valuable? If it’s rare, then why do we find rare things valuable? It’s almost a philosophical question. Value is whatever the buyer and seller assign to it.	1642824992.0	htp7suk	t3_s9ptkg	t1_htp60zn	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ptkg/cmv_theres_nothing_inherently_wrong_with_nfts/htp7suk/
5dkg4	The argument against NFTs goes beyond the fact that most major NFTs are speculative bubbles meant to make some people very wealthy at the expense of others, or that the technology isn't sound- it is that the entire model has no benefit for the artist, that in many ways it has detrimental effects, and that making digital goods unique and scarce is a bad idea.  > the entire model has no benefit for the artist  Have no NFTs been sold? Have no artists made profits by selling NFTs?   > that in many ways it has detrimental effects  I can’t really argue against this. I imagine in a perfect world, NFT transactions would slow down an insane amount, and that would lead to less negative impacts on the environment.

I figured he has some ability with the eye rolling and someone else did the eyeroll part aswell so I assumed they are some form of organization like the Bene Gesserit but more explanation would have been great. I just assume we will learn more about them in the upcoming movies. There is just too much to introduce at once and to be honest it wasn't really necessary for the story so far.  The betrayal by the Emperor was very obvious. They explained fairly well that House Atreides was getting too influencial with other nobel houses and thus too powerfull and the Emporer doesn't like that (they even say something along the lines of the Emperor being jealous man), so he set them up. Same with Dr Yueh who clearly was the royal doctor (he had multiple appearances where he checks the health of someone from the royal family or was talked about) and betrayed them because the Harkonnen had his wife and tortured her. That's why he also gave that fake teeth to kill the Baron, he didn't like them but had no choice.	1642856073.0	htqkmii	t3_sa0bgn	t3_sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/htqkmii/

That being said, your comparison is not fully equivalent because your actions had nothing to do with the violinist being connected to your body. Other than cases or rape or incest (which make up a tiny fraction of abortions and I don’t often see anyone debating against), the pregnancy occurred as a direct result of choices made by the couple. I feel like that adds more obligation as the woman was at least partly responsible for the pregnancy, making it less black and white than the violinist comparison.	1642857944.0	htqnt77	t3_sa1tlj	t1_htqmfms	/r/changemyview/comments/sa1tlj/cmv_abortion_shouldnt_be_seen_as_a_womans_rights/htqnt77/

(this is also big-budget of course but you get what I mean) I was about to argue with each of your points with specific details shown in the movie but the other posters have done a great job of that already.  I don't want to say it's Cinema with a capital C or anything pretentious like that, but it's clearly a movie that does show don't tell to a greater extent than Marvel. I had the opposite viewpoint in that the flow of the movie seemed really to work better than usual and it felt incredibly refreshing. They did not do the usual overly detailed exposition scene commonly found in sci-fi movies where one character drops down aspects of the lore during a contrived conversation that a person already living in the universe would not be having.  Actually a way to change your view would be to see Villeneuve's other movies. For instance, in 2049 he had some huge pacing and plot issues that didn't show up in Dune. The conclusion being that with a pre-cooked and well marinated plotline to follow he was able to effectively work on his scenes, and was clearly able to tell the story of Dune.	1642867075.0	htr76k5	t3_sa0bgn	t3_sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/htr76k5/

Of course, I know some were taking the 'zoo' hypothesis seriously in the past, despite some decrying it as pseudo-science.

3pqaxquz	In the case where there was no one to adopt and no state to take the child, then I don't see how the utility for the child is greater than the utility for the fetus. In both cases, they will be able to live their life instead of being chopped up or starved to death.  There is other negative utility to forcing a woman to carry a child that doesn't apply to forcing parents to feed and house their children. But I don't see how there isn't *any* utility to be gained, or maybe I don't understand your wording.  Also, utilitarianism is somewhat controversial.  Edit: I must not have seen your edit.  Okay, if the difference is labor vs liberty, then we need only change the violinist analogy such that you must work X months of the year for the violinist, as for some reason, only the work that you do can save the violinist. Does it seem wrong that you work a large amount of the year for a stranger? Seems that way. Then it would also be wrong to do that for your child if the child is also considered to be a stranger by the analogy.	1642867847.0	htr90yr	t3_sa1tlj	t1_htr7gbk	/r/changemyview/comments/sa1tlj/cmv_abortion_shouldnt_be_seen_as_a_womans_rights/htr90yr/

9isyki51	 "it's quite obvious that if someone is all-loving they wouldn't want to cause suffering especially the terrible suffering so many endure"  Why is God the cause? Is humanity not the cause? To love someone means to allow them to exercise their own freedom. A God could click his fingers and make us all bow down and worship him, but he does not. The heart of the problem is the problem of the heart, suffering is not God's doing. It's ours. Since you are loved by God and free to not choose him, and you remove yourself from relationship with all peace, all perfection, and all justice, then the suffering that is a consequence of that is a human responsibility. An inevitable result of rejecting God. God does not cause it. Humanity does	1642874217.0	htrp6wx	t3_sa5b0h	t3_sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/htrp6wx/

Revenge doesn’t work and capital punishment/the OPs suggestion is on the verge of being worse than a stereotypical child sex offenders crime.   People forget nuance. Not every child sex offender is a paedo. I.e. a young adult 18/19/20 are very unlikely to be repeat offenders once rehabilitated	1642876234.0	htrueq4	t3_s4ffvu	t1_hst2vgk	/r/changemyview/comments/s4ffvu/cmv_repeat_pedophiles_rapists_and_sex_offenders/htrueq4/
771dooie	One of the issue if we conflate all child sex offenders as paedophiles, when clinically some may not be deemed so. I.e. links between prior abuse, religion, social standing.   There is so much nuance to crimes such as these that ‘paedophiles’ in the UK rightfully undergo deep psychological assessment prior to sentencing to assess any potential future harm and as a guidance for sentencing.   Two cases i’m quite familiar with is two people who had attended my school. Later in life, one was found to have had received oral sex from a 14 year old when he was 19. His background was that he was autistic, abused at home and socially ridiculed prior to the offence. He was deemed to not have an active interest in children and displayed remorse for his actions. The other was another socially reclusive boy from my school who had an active interest in children. No abuse etc but was diagnosed as a paedophile under IDC and DSM criterias. He has reoffended twice and had prison sentences each time.  Now, I don’t condone either persons actions. But the former I would not define as a paedophile, nor bash him for something he did many many years ago. The other. Well he has an active interest in children, has received rehab for his condition etc but has reoffended. Will I judge him? A little but ultimately, I am not in his head. The only thing I hope is that he is segregated away from children and vulnerable adults, receives any help that is deemed necessary and hopefully gets better.  In a nutshell. There is too much nuance and a pitchfork mob mentality when it comes to this demographic. The threat of Torture, castration, segregation will never stop a potential sex offender.	1642877420.0	htrxh4z	t3_s4ffvu	t1_hsta4ng	/r/changemyview/comments/s4ffvu/cmv_repeat_pedophiles_rapists_and_sex_offenders/htrxh4z/

The simulation argument doesn't actually assume that "any other species" capable would do so, it assumes that more than one would be created per universe, so you have exponentially many universes as you go deeper. Technically, you can still meet this condition with a universe with many species, each of which has a minuscule probability of choosing to build their own simulation.

jt7tc	The counter argument i have heard most eloquently stated is from ravi zacharias.  Suffering and pain in the world is the result of free will.  If there is no free will then god could take pain and suffering away from people.  However, without free will you do not have a huge host of things you can do and that make humans capable of achieving great heights, indeed, achieving their potential in life.  This leads to massive questions and answers and speculation, but thats the jist of it.  So without free will, we would not ever be able to achieve our potential.

y9f2x	I think you fail to see that once a civilization manage to create a simulated reality that is indistinguishable from their own, there is no point in living in the physical reality anymore and abide by its limitations. Assuming the civilization is fairly advanced (judging by their ability to build a planet sized computer) they would be able to tackle the physical challenges of connecting every individual on their planet to the simulated reality, and thereby solving all their problems, e.g. lack of resources, conflicts/war, global warming, pandemics etc. (albeit not any non-controllable disastrous events such as giant meteors). You could ague that an advanced civilization would already have tackled most of these problems, but there is still no reason to live with the physical worlds limitations. The physical world could be run by AI, which would limit the need for unnecessary spending of resources and pollution. Its purpose would be to keep the individuals alive, and ensure the wellbeing of the planets ecosystems (which would thrive in a situation like this).   Everything you could do in the physical world, you could do in the simulated one and more, thereby removing the need to continue living in it.	1642904043.0	httqcbo	t3_sacb46	t3_sacb46	/r/changemyview/comments/sacb46/cmv_any_being_advanced_enough_to_create_planet/httqcbo/

Shouldn't take them more than a few weeks.    > I know hiding a post only hides for myself now but when I was a new reddit user, how tf can I know?  Google exists.  > My friends know my username on reddit. That's how they know  And how is reddit supposed to know the names of your fiends?  > Bruh Every point you make is bs  Let me just recap your argument as to why you want the hide functionality changed: "I posted something on the internet where everyone can see what I post and got upset when people saw it".  Or did I miss something?    > Also for the pop up thing, maybe only appear for the FIRST time you use it?  You are aware that most people close popups without ever reading them, right?    You have yet to respond to any of my actual argument.  The combination of everyone being able to see your post except for your friends is literally impossible as reddit doesn't know who your friends are.	1642934288.0	htv6yy8	t3_saq1rb	t1_htv6hr7	/r/changemyview/comments/saq1rb/cmv_reddit_should_allow_users_to_choose_not_to/htv6yy8/

In a lot of rural towns in the US, a DMV can be 10+ miles from where someone lives. What this feeds into is a lot of rural poor people not having IDs - they can’t walk there because it’s too far, can’t drive there because they’re not licensed - so they lack a solid form of transportation to get an ID. They also have to miss work to go get their ID and pay for likely a taxi (in rural America, which is not insanely common) / ride service / hope someone they know can take them. So there’s also a much higher opportunity cost of a missed day of work + paying for a ride service for a poor person living paycheck to paycheck.   I like the ID of voter ID. but until licenses/state ID are available online or via Mail *the first time you get them* you’re absolutely creating a scenario where a certain type of citizen (poor folk not near a DMV) are disproportionately advantaged, and that’s anti-democratic.	1642950648.0	htvxmkr	t3_sam3w3	t3_sam3w3	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3w3/cmv_voter_id_should_be_legalized_as_getting_an_id/htvxmkr/

Some people overcome that baggage, many never can.

5c5jxlcp	I say this a a serious theist - there's a good way to talk about God in science and a destructive way that I suspect taints the discussion.  The destructive way is there's an old tendency (the "God of the gaps") to say "I don't understand this phenomenon, therefore let's say God did that part, or that my lack of understanding proves an outside force is at work."  That attitude is antithetical to scientific inquiry because it suggests giving up looking for deeper understanding and using God as a knowledge crutch.   The more productive approach is to look at the beauty and unlikeness of the universe we live in as a very strong argument for the existence of God.  But that's not a "proof" in the sense of a mathematical proof, it's a proof in the social science sense of "this is the most likely outcome given currently available evidence.  As a related aside, the best take I have heard on this is that God created a universe quite capable of running itself without outside intervention.  The idea of searching for "outside intervention" as a proof of God basically assumed God did a bad job creating the thing in the first place.  So "why would there ever be a miracle" is a better question than "why don't we see miracles."	1642969442.0	htx9i20	t3_sam3n2	t3_sam3n2	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/htx9i20/

Viruses **only** reproduce, but lack mechanical structures for all the other characteristics. The field of biology generally agrees (there are many nuanced versions, but nearly all models require a metabolism, which a virus lacks) that these attributes define life:  order sensitivity or response to the environment reproduction growth and development regulation homeostasis energy processing  Importantly, living things posses all of these. As far as your question about a hypothetical robot, so long as it checks these boxes, then yes I would say it qualifies as inorganic life or just…life. It would need to check a great number more boxes before I’d ever view it as possessing sapience or even sentience.	1642974658.0	htxn8o0	t3_sb1i9b	t3_sb1i9b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/htxn8o0/

96ioh	“What is a woman?” is a fair question to ask, but is there really a clear cut definition that you can apply without excluding some population of cis women. If you base it in biology, there’s cis women born without reproductive organs, there’s non XX chromosome pairings, there’s about 1.7% of the population that’s born intersex (in the US alone that’s about 5.6 million people) so based on this SEX isn’t even a binary. Now even if we operate under the binary understanding of sex, gender is something that is separate from sex. So modern understanding of gender is that it’s a socially constructed set of norms and behaviors that is typical for people of a given biological sex. But even within these norms and behaviors, there’s not a clear demarcation that you can draw between man and woman. Additionally our understanding of what’s “manly” and “womanly” has evolved over time. If you look at pictures of 17th century French royalty that doesn’t exactly coincide with current days standards of “manliness”. The reason why the trans activists brought on didn’t give a definition is simply because there isn’t one. If you give any social norm that we typically ascribe to bring a “man” I can almost guarantee you there’s at least one cis woman out there that has Matt Walsh beaten on that metric. Does that make Matt Walsh a woman? No, of course not. The whole point is that the metrics that we use to define these categories ARE arbitrary and have evolved over time so trying to gatekeep who can identify in those categories is silly.	1642976258.0	htxrcr4	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htxcj0c	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/htxrcr4/

i163riup	I know I’m missing out on important parts of film history too, but I feel like if I watched his films I would be very distracted by my impressions of him as a person (maybe that’s not always a bad thing though?). It worries me that someone who I think is a bad person could profit from me consuming their work, but certainly there are ways around that.   To me the phrase “separate the art from the artist” implies that a work of art should be viewed independently from its creator but I’m sure people have different definitions.   Picasso is an interesting example, thanks for bringing it up. I think visual art is interesting in this scenario because it’s not “for sale” in the same way as films and literature (unless you’re the mega-rich) so viewing a work of art feels less like an endorsement than buying a copy of something.	1642982035.0	hty6h3v	t3_sb77vg	t1_hty4hh7	/r/changemyview/comments/sb77vg/cmv_i_dont_want_to_separate_art_from_the_author/hty6h3v/

In my field we answer the question of "what is true" using a combination of statistical inference, repetition, and biology.

Regardless, if you can catch the illness multiple times, the odds of fully eradicating it, even with a fully-effective vaccine, are low. That's why we still have outbreaks of polio, measles, smallpox, and more. Not because of ineffective vaccines, but because of how interconnected our world is woth different regions and cultures who share different beliefs, different societal norms, and different levels of access to healthcare.  The only way to fully eradicate these diseases and others like it would be to implement a zero-tolerance worldwide vaccine mandate with ZERO exceptions, whoch violates a whole list of human rights.  https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article254111268.html	1642982291.0	hty736p	t3_sb7l0v	t3_sb7l0v	/r/changemyview/comments/sb7l0v/cmv_the_only_way_this_pandemic_will_end_is_if_we/hty736p/

42j663tx	Can you clarify your view for me: are you saying that we should not watch films (or other types of artworks) by artists who were bad people? Or that we should not forget about their badness when we watch them?   To take the Woody Allen example from elsewhere in the thread, I was a fan of his films before I knew about his daughter’s allegations. I still like some of them quite a lot, but I can’t view them the same way now — and my understanding of them is much richer than it was. I’m able to see not only (more of) the sexual weirdness that’s there, but also the outright sociopathy that animates movies like Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors, which before I thought was part of their clever take on the “crime and punishment” narrative. Knowing about an artist’s flaws doesn’t mean we accept or condone those flaws, or become uncritical viewers of the work. If anything it can sharpen our critical eye towards a work.	1642983622.0	htyaba9	t3_sb77vg	t1_hty462b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb77vg/cmv_i_dont_want_to_separate_art_from_the_author/htyaba9/

171sgb	The simplest answer is that yes, any time you make a transition like this it will be inherently unfair. Some will benefit, some won't. Some will have *just* paid off their loans right before a loan forgiveness happens. It will seem unfair. But this will be the case no matter when or how you do it, unless you make all tuition free and then just wait for those with student loans to die out. But that doesn't help them either.   If it's a good idea then it should be implemented as soon as practical. That it will be unfair to some is unfortunate but unavoidable, and we shouldn't delay its implementation just because of that.  Whether it's actually a good idea or not isn't in the scope of my answer, I'm just providing a background to why haggling over how "fair" it is is missing the forest for the trees.	1642984566.0	htyclnx	t3_sawxc2	t3_sawxc2	/r/changemyview/comments/sawxc2/cmv_until_college_is_made_free_in_the_usa/htyclnx/

gtwwl3w5	I understand the confusion! I think faith has indeed gotten a bad rap, in large part due to people of faith not explaining it very well. But the truth is, ‘Faith 2.0’ (love the term, I’m stealing it!) is actually quite a bit older than the ‘leap of faith’ idea (which comes from Kierkegaard).  When I explain faith to students (I was a youth pastor, and still volunteer) I use the story of Jesus walking on water. In the story, Peter walks out to Jesus on the water but lets his fear get the better of him, causing him to sink. Jesus chastises him for his lack of faith.  How did Peter lack faith? Jesus isn’t criticizing him for failing to ‘irrationally cling to an unproven belief.’ In the context of the book, Peter saw Jesus walking on water with his own eyes, and had seen Him perform countless other miracles before. He knew that Jesus was perfectly capable of keeping him safe despite the wind and waves.   Peter’s failure was allowing his momentary, animalistic fear get the better of his reason. He allowed his irrationality get the better of his reason.   Hope that helps!

This is quickly dismissed because we have so much evidence against it.  -  The creator is stated to have made the universe in a completely unfalsifiable way that happens to align with all evidence we have (eg there's an all-powerful god who created the universe in seemingly godless fashion, which has never done anything to the universe since before the big bang and is literally impossible to detect). This is seen as useless and irrelevant in scientific discussion - there are plenty of scientists who believe in this kind of god and face no conflict about it, but there's no reason for them to bring it up in a geology/physics/biology/etc conversation.	1643002244.0	htzgo52	t3_sam3n2	t1_htullam	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/htzgo52/

3muzmzop	In my opinion you are 100% correct.  I've read every argument against and I do not see much merit in any of them. Worrying about the game going on forever? During the regular season it's 10 minutes. So those games aren't going on forever. In the playoffs, there is some more potential for overtime to go a little longer but even that is unlikely. How often do teams match score for score constantly unless neither team can score and in that case it would go on forever anyway in the playoffs until there is a winner...  Besides, there is always going to be an element of sudden death. Like right now, if one team kicks a field goal and the other team returns a field goal, any point scored ends the game immediately. Which is perfectly fine as long as both teams were given an equal opportunity to possess the ball on both sides. This would be exactly the same only extended to touchdowns.  I keep also seeing the argument that it would switch the advantage to the defense which I find lacking as well. First of all in the NFL, because of the rules the offense already has a massive advantage. Second of all, the offense already knows what they need to do to win the game immediately, which is score a touchdown or a field goal and a stop.  So in that argument, if the initial possessing team scores a field goal, it's an advantage for the defense because they know they can win the game with a touchdown? Either way they have to try scoring a touchdown to either tie the game or win the game just by the very fact the game is continuing on. Or if the offense did not score any points, they just need a field goal which changes nothing since that's how it is right now anyway.  As it is right now the defense knows the exact same information. If it was a field goal they need a field goal to tie and continue on to true sudden death or a touchdown to win. Obviously if they don't score at all the game is over.   The game would be more fair to both teams if they kept the rules the way they are but extended it to touchdowns as well.   Btw, I am a huge Patriots fan and they obviously benefited from the rules the way they are now in the biggest game and immediately I did not think it was fair.  The idea the game is going to go on forever with this change is nonsensical. Especially in the regular season. I can't believe anybody would even argue against this.  Last point on this ridiculously long post. Saying the defense had a chance to make a stop and didn't therefore the game should be over is also very flawed. If that was the case, we should also be saying if the defense makes a stop the game should be over immediately. The initial possessing team had every opportunity to score points and they failed. Game should be over right there. But obviously that wouldn't make sense. Same as this argument against the defense having a chance to make a stop.  I'm really looking for any argument against both teams offenses having a shot to possess the ball before "true sudden death" begins which would result in the game being less fair and I can't find one. Besides once the game is tied up 7-7 in OT, a field goal wins because it is now sudden death. Exactly the same as if it was 3-3, making winning the game significantly easier for whoever possesses the ball. The games will still end relatively quickly only it'll be a more fair outcome.

Well, since over a million voters were purged in Georgia, that’s at least the right order of magnitude.   > In the minds of many people who are photo-voter-id proponents, dismissing their concerns in this way comes across as a malicious disdain for their own votes. In their minds, someone who cares so little for whether a vote comes from a citizen or not is someone who wants the election to be tampered with.  That’s fine. People can be wrong about stuff. In order for those views to be legitimate, they would have to comport with the data. And they don’t.   > So these kinds of accusations of malfeasance go both ways, and it's just as easy for people to point fingers as it is for us to recognize the other side's concerns and try to find a path forward that meets them all, or at least doesn't cause any new harm.  No. Only one of the ways is backed up by data.   > I think it requires the assumption of maliciousness on the part of the person who thinks that better verification of citizenship status is good, in order to reach the conclusion that they either lack respect for thousands of peoples votes, or actively want to suppress those votes.  We don’t have to assume anything. They’ve told you their intent is malicious.        What systems are in place, how are they ensured to work properly, and what are the adversarial checks and balances to protect against interference? While I'm sure an answer to all of those questions could be had, simply saying "There's no voter fraud" is a pretty bold claim without also providing some transparency to the methods by which that answer is determined.  Eventually, a person would have to point at some other person, group, or agency, who did some study, or some investigation, but you can't actually say with certainty, unless you happen to be one of the lead investigators in sniffing out voter fraud every election?	1643034373.0	hu0sdwf	t3_sam3w3	t1_htza1wd	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3w3/cmv_voter_id_should_be_legalized_as_getting_an_id/hu0sdwf/

16mqhm	I don't come across a lot of people who just are filthy rich from inheritance, so maybe that's just you?  From what I've seen dating (a lot of dating) and my buddy's dating lives is that their earnings are just part of the equation in their value as a partner. For men, men don't really care what a women makes, money wise, so it's less weight in the pool of things men look for in a woman.  However, if a man makes a lot of money, women can and will overlook other minor flaws. Most women will not date just some slob with money. The concept that you have of "a slob with money" is also extremely rare, as typically people with money also have some positive characteristics that help them with their earning (charismatic, charming, good-looking, extremely knowledgeable in their field).

htnpbfml	It’s a safety feature. The assumption is that a person buying a safe pistol or safe places a premium on safety. Most gun owners are normal people. If you think a bunch of guys are going to break into your house to assault your wife, personally I think you should get out of the drug selling business and get a grip. I know many here won’t agree.   I’d rather have a barrier (not high barrier) between my kids and my guns, because as we all know, we are more likely to shoot ourselves or each other in our home than ever be near a self defense scenario. If you think that’s different in your life, why bother with a safe at all: keep your shotgun by your door locked and loaded. If you place a premium on safety, invest in a lock and if a smart lock works for your situation, great. Rationally, most gun owners fear self defense but will never use their gun that way:  > Most gun owners cite multiple reasons for owning a gun. In fact, eight-in-ten say they have more than one reason for owning, and 44% have more than one major reason. Still, protection tops the list, with 67% of current gun owners saying this is a major reason they personally own a gun. About four-in-ten say the same about hunting (38%), while three-in-ten say sport shooting, including target, trap and skeet shooting is a major reason they own a gun. Fewer cite a gun collection (13%) or their job (8%) as major reasons for owning a gun.  Four in ten compared to six in ten, hunt to defense (give or take). It’s not a massive gap: many people appear to use their guns in ways beyond self defense as the primary purpose. In that case, factor safety precautions like smart locks into what the usage is.	1643047773.0	hu1qrs7	t3_sbs3k7	t3_sbs3k7	/r/changemyview/comments/sbs3k7/cmv_smart_guns_are_a_good_idea_in_theory_but/hu1qrs7/

42geoc20	Absolutely not. We don’t try to define humans by your terms for the exact reason you think we should, but we do define them.   From evolutionary biology to phylogeny, all the way to the human genome, we have ways to categorize. Just today my biology teacher reminded us that when you have an XX chromosome, you’re a female.   There’s a reason why you’ll never find a textbook that claims the way to categorize a species is through a similarity in limbs- those are called homologous structures. We have generalities because they apply to the majority. Sex and gender are the chromosome type you have, which is why people with the condition of intersex are called intersex.	1643048345.0	hu1sb56	t3_sb1i9b	t1_htyg9hc	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/hu1sb56/

Also, the larger population means a greater variety of goods and services can be provided, so the non-Californians already there benefit from that as well.	1643049268.0	hu1ut4f	t3_sbpb0c	t3_sbpb0c	/r/changemyview/comments/sbpb0c/cmv_californians_should_be_required_to_file_an/hu1ut4f/

We can legislate anything into the definition of income, we could literally legislate the amount of rain water your yard receives as income and require taxes on it if congress chose to do so.

4sf5ov1r	Thanks, I was working off the little I remember from that one episode of Community with the foozball.  I think my point stands anyway. We can't just allow small scale territorial expansion without inviting more aggressive escalation. Allowing China to annex Taiwan would be analogous to allowing Germany to annex Austria. They would be emboldened to assert their influence over the South China Sea and eventually maybe even SE and Central Asia.  Putin's a lot more obvious about his intentions to reform the USSR, so it's either prevent Russia from invading Ukraine or start warming up the nukes.	1643051519.0	hu20uu1	t3_sbqywx	t1_hu1yizk	/r/changemyview/comments/sbqywx/cmv_taiwan_is_not_worth_igniting_ww3_the_us/hu20uu1/

If you don't believe this, consider an example.  Suppose we have a drug test is that is 95% accurate, meaning that if 100 drug users are tested, 95 will test positive, and if 100 non drug users are tested, 5 will test positive.    Now suppose we do this test on 400 high school students, and some test positive. Lets say one of the positive ones is Joe. What is the probability that Joe is actually using drugs?  If you say 95% you are misunderstanding probability.	1643057135.0	hu2fkuz	t3_sbvm3h	t3_sbvm3h	/r/changemyview/comments/sbvm3h/cmv_probability_and_statistics_should_be_part_of/hu2fkuz/

mxq6r06	> Do you think the factory farming industry responds to a single hunter going out and deciding to kill an animal or not each day? That's what I'm debating here.  No you aren't though. You very explicitly stated that you want to talk about the *individual* decision to hunt, and your argument is because hunting causes X+1 animals to die instead of X animals. My analogy explained why this isn't true. Less demand for factory farmed animals means less animals killed. It won't abolish factory farming as a whole, but it *will* mean fewer animals killed.  >You, /u/thinkingpains aren't going to change how much meat the factory farming industry produces.  Yes, I can. If I eat less factory farmed meat, less animals are killed in factory farms. That is an indisputable fact.  > Do you think if 10 people started/stopped hunting, factory farming would change how much meat it produces?  Yes. Obviously. Again, this is how supply and demand works.   >The answer is no, and if you think it does, then you are extremely naïve.  No....I just know how supply and demand works.  >You think that supply and demand in an industry the size of factory farming responds on an individual 1-to-1 change, than this conversation has run it's course.  Again, it doesn't matter, because you *explicitly stated* that you only want to talk about individual choice. I as an individual cannot personally abolish *all* factory farming with my choices. But I can, with my choices, choose not contribute to factory farming, which to me, as an individual, is a moral choice, because factory farming is immoral and hunting is not.  Let's take a step back here though. Can you explain to me by what moral principle you have decided that killing X animals is fine, but killing X+1 animals is morally wrong?	1643068054.0	hu377wi	t3_sbwknv	t1_hu34k62	/r/changemyview/comments/sbwknv/cmv_hunting_animals_is_generally_immoral/hu377wi/
