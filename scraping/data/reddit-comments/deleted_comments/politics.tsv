ky6kn	There's no incentive for the Republicans or Democrats to change how elections work unless there's a threat of vote splitting. If either of the two major parties becomes seriously afraid of vote splitting, then that major party becomes motivated to push for proportional vote allocation (as opposed to first past the post) and/or ranked choice voting. They won't change a system that put them in power unless it's the only way to defeat something that threatens their power going forward.   And I'm not endorsing any particular third party, but I do believe people voting for Third Parties can make a difference in significant enough numbers. Or, at least, their odds of making any sort of impact on policy aren't much worse than the rest of ours. As is, many politicians can do almost anything short of openly cooperating with their opponents (and sometimes even that) without risking their office; they don't really need to listen to voters at all.	1642719395.0	htisndz	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hti7vqc	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htisndz/

They knew once the US soldiers left and were not "occupying" the South any longer they could dictate how blacks were treated.  So they had a pact each man was to be responsible for keeping two black men from voting. There were states in the South were blacks outnumbered whites and if they voted it would not be good for them.

6hkff	This is interesting for sure, but this is about his actions in 1984. Is there anything more recent to suggest that his *current* net worth is understated.  Again, if I was citing celebritynetworth.com I’d have a lot of suspicion that the numbers wouldn’t be accurate lol. But I would expect better from Forbes and assume that they are more on the ball in reporting his net worth, particularly considering his notoriety and whatnot	1642723483.0	htj2k6r	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htixgz5	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htj2k6r/

You just can't win with these terms that one day are expected and the next you are a monster for using them. What was he supposed to say? African American and what? The other americans? Yes its bad how he said it but its totally understandable why he did it and it doesn't make him racist. He is racist, don't get me wrong but what if someone insists on a distinction then this shit happens. Then don't insist on the distinction African americans and call yourself  Americans.

Policies should be the one going hard "on the police." Your phrase has only turned off moderates and given Republicans yet another talking point about how Democrats are not the party for law and order, something that incredibly relevant now as crime is spiking. Even Obama spoke out against it.
