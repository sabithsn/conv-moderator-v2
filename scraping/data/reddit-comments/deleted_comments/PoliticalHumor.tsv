14cz12	It's a little like when Julia Roberts went shopping in Pretty Woman and no one would help her. But instead of going home and getting backup and some self-respect, she just stole everything she thought was cute and put it all together in a blender and Bam! It's Kyrsten Smoothie.   She's wearing a bunch of pieces she obviously perceives to be high fashion. But that monstrosity of an outfit is wearing *her.*   The coat could be going for a Jackie Kennedy vibe. On its own, this is a very pretty piece. But there's no harmony here. The competition between the hemlines with the coat vs the busy dress peeking out is so distracting I almost missed the statement shoes with the giant decals on them. How, I don't know, because you can probably see those shoe decals from the moon. And I think Miss Kyrsten dropped/left her tiara somewhere, because that's the only reason any 5 year-old girl would get dressed up like this and skip the tiara.  And what the hell is with that bag? The big buttons on the coat are too close in scale to the dots on the bag, not to match perfectly. Are there puppies in that purse?! It certainly looks like some sort of mammal is being held captive. Does she actually want us to start calling her ~~Cruella~~ KKKyruella	1642705717.0	hthv2il	t3_s8nto0	t1_hthdg9c	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8nto0/kkkryrsten/hthv2il/

The whole Democratic party calling for him to fall on the sword and end his career over a single photo and some credible accusations is politics at its worst.

Im not denying Mitch's subtle racism, i cannot deny that. What i can tell you is that he OBVIOUSLY meant black americans vote at the same rate as Americas average as a whole.  Its honestly weird to see this sub get so angry at a statement like this while it simultaneously defends biden to death when he made comments about how Obama was the first main stream black american who is "articulate and bright", or if you vote for Trump that "you ain't black."	1642711660.0	hti9vir	t3_s8pkg0	t1_hthz7wz	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s8pkg0/the_unspoken_part/hti9vir/

7b9bj	It would be 3 or 4%... do you really think the number has to be exactly the same to say "just as high"? Even if if he was 6% of, is that such a massive difference that black voters are now insignifiant to politicians? His entire point was that black voters are NOT staying at home in the polls. At this point yall are grasping at straws, it is quite obvious what he meant.   60% and 63% are essentially the same rate. That is like saying a porche doesnt go at a high speed because it hits 192 instead of 200 lol.   You can say im defending him, I am just telling you the facts. If facts defend him than so be it.

3vwjnuw2	No. Wrong. Nothing at all at the time regarded rural states. Just smaller ones.  The Senate is there to give each state equal voting power in the Legislative Branch. It was introduced because smaller and less populated states feared they'd be entirely strongarmed by large and more populated states.   It is there for the purpose of checks and balances and to encourage bipartisanship.  "On the final vote, the five states in favor of equal apportionment in the Senate—Connecticut, North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware—only represented one-third of the nation's population."  Sauce: [Wikipedia History of the United States Senate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Senate)  It was northern, less populated states that wanted it.

Or the unelected, powerless parliamentarian would say 'nope' and Biden would roll over and say "oops! Guess we can't!" despite being entirely able to.  They aren't trying to help working people. They will promise a committee to discuss not letting millions of more die from covid/having a living wage/not killing brown people indiscriminately/not allowing corporations to run the economy etc but they won't take action. You defend them because they aren't the Republicans. They know they don't have to do anything because what are you going to do about it? Vote Republican?

1713up	That’s your opinion that it made sense 200 years ago and not today. I’m stating a fact that it was designed to operate that way. It is in fact, despite your dislike, “correct” that it was formed as a collection of states.  No level of frustration does not make that less true and it’s why the senate exists the way it does. In fact, the senators were originally appointed directly by the states themselves and not through a public vote. Because the senate represented the states and their rights and the house represented the people.   Maybe if you get more passionate about your alternate facts being correct that will make it magically come true 😂	1642785893.0	htmffbg	t3_s9agk7	t1_htm9dxp	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htmffbg/

8isfruvf	>maybe a bunch of white  You really don't have to say white people, you could just say slave owners but you have to make it inflammatory. Yes, the slave owners in America were mostly European. It is exhausting how much people blame "white people", regardless of involvement, hundreds of years later. Rich Americans were doing the exact same thing every "race" was doing around the world. Every single "race" was affiliated at the time, and "white people" were also enslaved. Poor "white people" didn't enslave people; people in power did. But hypocritical woke racists cannot help blaming everyone for the actions of a few. I promise you, my Irish ancestors had nothing to do with enslaving people while they were starving in a ditch.   Seriously. [Right now](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/findings/regional-analysis/overview/), there are 10 million slaves in Africa and 25 million slaves in Asia today.

7mugovoj	For the Republic and its avenues of Democracy to survive, having the seat of the federal government to be within a state is not also extremely dangerous to every single institution, but it will also lead to the threat of infringing on everyone else's democratic rights across the country. I think it's wrong to even suggest to make the District a state. In fact, it's pure stupidity and it's even more ironic that people saying bUt My DeMoCrAcY  are the ones pushing a system that would actually see their democracy threatened. Unfortunate your home is in a federal district, but sorry, your feelings don't supersede the security of our elections, government, and institutions.

7mugovoj	You are correct, but you're missing the other half of it. Read the Federalist Papers at least once in your life.  "It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment of senators by the state legislatures. . . . It is recommended by the double advantage of favoring a select appointment, and of giving to the state governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government. . . .  The equality of representation in the Senate is another point, which, being evidently the result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and the small States, does not call for much discussion. . . ."

Giving the power to a governor and state government to not only surround the enclave, but to be in control of the airport is extremely dangerous. Not only that, the prospective statehood pushes almost every single consulate and federal department outside of the federal zone. Statehood is a political ploy to upend deadlocks for one political party over the other.	1642800105.0	htnidz3	t3_s9agk7	t1_htneq7k	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htnidz3/

And now there are people who are calling for the extermination of white people, and are racist towards them.   Dont you know that the vast majority of whites that came over and settled in appalacia did so to escape and live freely. Hamilton, Washington, and the like ended that with taxation. Those scotch-irish whites didnt come on fancy ships. They came on cattle boats. Many lived as slaves.   Here the oligarchs have done it again. First with the jews to steal their family legacies of hard work and frugal sacrifice, now it is happening again. This time with whites. It is sad to see they have us fighting each other, and it is terrifying. All we truly need to do is be honest with ourselves about our life experiences with people of all kinds.

I've been there, I've worked there. The problems of DC aren't because of lack of representation in the federal government, it's because of the culture of those there. A few extra Congressmen won't change anything and the District will still have the same issues whether or not it is a state. All it will become as heavily in debt because it will carry the same policies (while fixing nothing) like Maryland, California, NY, etc. As well as adding layer upon layer of government and laws to further push those issues off. DC will just be used as a pawn by a political party. Preventing housing for government employees, etc. At some point, the national guard will most likely even be used to hinder the operations of the federal government over some political BS. This whole rose-tinted glasses notion qnd not seeing the future implications of such actions is so dangerous.   Only place that deserves statehood at this point is Puerto Rico.

So, Virginia’s percentage of the free US population was less than twice Virginia’s Senatorial representation.  Today, 12% of the population lives in California, but they only have 2% of the Senators. Six times the population compared to Senatorial representation.

b44xhpqh	Let’s slow this down before it gets spread too far by the people who got the idea to abolish the senate from Steven Colbert (really look it up). The US legislative branch or congress is bicameral, meaning it is made up of two bodies, the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate is made up of two representatives from each state regardless of population. The House is made up of a number of representatives from each state based on the population of each state. The Senate allows states to have an equal amount of representation regardless of size in order to prevent large states from controlling everything and the House makes sure that doesn’t go too far by allowing large states to have more control there. This was a compromise in the making of our government. A good example of balance would be in the picture above, California has a population of 40 million people, and every other state’s population when added together equals 40 million people. They are all equal in the Senate, but California as a state has much more representatives in the House because of their much higher population. Not to mention how many electoral votes that one state gets in the presidential elections.	1642868744.0	htrb82n	t3_s9agk7	t3_s9agk7	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/s9agk7/very_likely/htrb82n/

As a welder I have to buy a $400 pair of boots every 6 months at least, new shirts monthly and a pair of carhartt coveralls at $200 a pair only lasts about 3-4 months. For myself alone I spend thousands on work gear a year and there are guys who buy way more than I do. Compile that and Carhartt will definitely be taking a hit unfortunately.	1642897177.0	htta734	t3_sa6ppt	t3_sa6ppt	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sa6ppt/all_the_way_to_the_bank/htta734/

4e0nh	>The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  >Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  >But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  >This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.  -― Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms: The Play	1642916594.0	htuhvgm	t3_sa6ppt	t1_hts3jlq	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sa6ppt/all_the_way_to_the_bank/htuhvgm/

jj37y	One specific point- the house no longer does this. It has an arbitrary headcount limit of 435 reps, which means that the actual population representation is very heavily skewed. That's just objectively true, it's not politics or party bias, right now the House is completely non-representative of the actual spread of population throughout most of the country. The fact that that's the case means that the Senate still being "two per state no matter what" gives an overall massively disproportionate power push to low pop rural states. I don't want the Senate to be deleted and I personally haven't seen that suggested all that often, but either it needs a SERIOUS rework and/or the House needs that representative limit to be abolished entirely.	1642921522.0	htuq4gl	t3_safz85	t1_htunlez	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/safz85/blue_states_make_while_the_red_states_take/htuq4gl/

gvfdv7vx	Haha, that's fucked up, but it made me laugh. I'm not sure if I buy his, "I'm allergic to the Pfizer and Morderna vaccines, and I just don't want to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine" spill. It might be true he can't take some of the vaccines, but I think he talked to Joe Rogan, and they had similar views on the vaccines and alternate treatments.   I'm just glad I don't have to hear his smug ass talking about how he won the game for the Packers on his weekly appearances on the Pat McAfee show. I don't think he's going to continue making appearances. I would be shocked if he did. On the downside, I have to hear all the "What is A-Aron going to do?" segments the next few months as he leaks information to fuel the sports media's need for content.   My wife is a Packers fan, so I can only talk so much shit. I don't root for professional sports teams, but I do root against some players/teams for various reasons. His swarmy, I'm smarter than everyone else because you all are morons and sheep, and I'm not, attitude grinds my gears.	1642931584.0	htv3hkx	t3_sakybh	t3_sakybh	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sakybh/pro_vaccine_people_watching_aaron_rogers_lose_to/htv3hkx/

Those 600+ billionaires aren't spreading antivaxxer lies, nor are they bombing Planned Parenthood buildings, nor claiming the COVID shot is the mark of the beast, nor are they condemning gay marriage or trans people. Those billionaires mostly could care less who has control of Jerusalem or the West Bank and aren't willing to drone anyone over it.  The church love it when there's trouble though.

9qiib	The part of CA he’s from is redneck as fuck. His hometown specifically is a university town, but outside of that small bubble around campus it’s middle-of-nowhere farmland. I have met people who were born and raised in that area who, no joke, speak with slight southern accents because they are so committed to the whole “country” persona. Obviously this isn’t true of everyone there by any stretch, but there are LOTS of people who are just caricatures.

xmbq4	I don’t have to “conflate” anything, in order to associate Bernie Sanders with progressivism. He ran on a progressive platform and, unlike Warren, didn’t take PAC money and completely abandon core tenets of progressivism.  There’s a cool interview with a colleague/professor of Warren’s, from her days at the University of Pennsylvania. At the time, the university had a very progressive law program. She recalls Warren as a “right-wing Reaganite,” who once opined in class that “there is no more ridiculous an idea than national healthcare.” Warren then helped spearhead a right-wing takeover of the curriculum. This, of course, before moving to Massachusetts and becoming a democrat.  Her professor concludes by saying “there is no more relentless, ruthless nihilist, that I have ever met in my entire life, than Elizabeth Warren.  People criticized Warren because she was dishonest, violated progressive ideals by accepting corporate money, and seemed to be concerned more with her own political gain than with the good of society.	1642994328.0	htz0ik5	t3_sb0qgj	t1_htxw695	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sb0qgj/wooderson/htz0ik5/

"good" people, regardless of their political beliefs, religion, and socioeconomic status do not have bad reputations. Even when considered by those who do not agree with them.

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Also - if you're a Republican and you're tired of being marked as all those things, tough shit, you're a Republican and your vote supports all of those things and therefore so do you.

wamg8	I put that link because I was trying to prove that she was not wealthy. I put that link because I did see that it said she made her money after.    I don’t think you are getting my point. I don’t much like her, and she will be fine because she’s got money now and if she can’t live on what she’s been able to accumulate while married to Trump, she’s an idiot, but she was not wealthy.	1643060271.0	hu2nxck	t3_sbskd3	t1_hu2kjnd	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbskd3/ever_wonder_why_she_never_put_her_name_on_anything/hu2nxck/

b9wkz	It’s a group of people that don’t care about achieving any tangible public policy goals related to that flag, rather they just want to *own the libs*.  Time and time again, they will joke about how overly sensitive the world is, but they will be absolutely TRIGGERED by the notion that the Green M&M changed her shoes.  If you really care so much about over sensitivity, then why the hell do you care about what a major corporation does with its own mascot?	1643062736.0	hu2udy0	t3_sbvfx2	t1_hu2pq33	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbvfx2/stupid_is_as_stupid_does/hu2udy0/
e5mz6	I love venomosity towards the “unvaccinated”here. What many of you are failing to realize is that many of these “antivaxxers” that are in the hospital with covid is because they are elderly or in a vulnerable group. More than likely they aren’t even antivaxxers and are just people who for whatever reason haven’t gotten the vaccine yet. I’m as liberal as they come and vaccinated as well, but at least I have some goddamn human compassion and try to understand the situation before villianizing people who are hospitalized with covid.	1643063140.0	hu2vfhm	t3_sbt81g	t3_sbt81g	/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/sbt81g/its_crazy_how_unvaxxed_covid_patients_are_being/hu2vfhm/
