gnimv1v4	>you’re coming in a little hot, especially with the whole pluck your eyes out    I explained my phrasing above.   >Bit dramatic to be honest.

gnimv1v4	>predominantly Muslim  We're all Arabs in this server before being Muslims, Jews, Christians...etc. I'm not here to spare anyone's feelings because my own beliefs shouldn't affect anyone.   The phrasing was accurate because thinking about my life with a Muslim man down the line makes me want to pluck my eyes out. Not because Muslims are inherently bad but their belief system doesn't align with mine and neither would the lifestyle, boundaries, expectations etc. I mean I would know, I grew up here.

gnimv1v4	I appreciate the long and thoughtful comment. Religion doesn't serve any purpose for me whatsoever and that's the main reason I'm not a Muslim anymore. It's not because I've been abused or "don't know real Islam". It'd simply because I don't need religion in my life. Never did. It serves no purpose and no benefit. It's only a source of discomfort, anxiety and burden which the cons of far outweighs any pros (if any at all) for me.	1641553695.0	hrmfjho	t3_rwwsim	t1_hrl5fko	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrmfjho/
xlc6p	I just want you to know how great it is that you're putting in the effort to make their new home a welcoming place.  Maybe it's presumptuous of me to assume they're new to the country, but you are potentially setting them off on the right foot and providing hope by being a thoughtful neighbour.  Inevitably they will have experiences of racism (or have already), so it's great that you're doing this.   I think my parents were lucky enough that people did this when they came to Canada, and I can tell you they have such a positive view of the country overall now just because of their first years here, despite all the negativity they faced over the years.	1641567103.0	hrn4ljx	t3_ry61pl	t1_hrn3el6	/r/arabs/comments/ry61pl/welcome_new_neighbours/hrn4ljx/

azmou57o	America is a particularly hyper capitalist society. Real estate is the primary form of wealth for the vast majority of the middle class. Real estate is the least productive form of asset, that the bulk of household wealth is tied up in. In less hyper-capitalist societies real estate ownership is not even a goal for ownership. Imagine spending all of your 20-50s earning a wage just to be able to own a house. If you lived in a society that valued housing as a public good (look up housing in Vienna, or even Germany which has a high proportion of renters), you would free up your prime life years in being able to choose work not based on monetary pressure of being able to own a home.	1642488424.0	ht5c25l	t3_s5pgh0	t1_ht4ox0w	/r/arabs/comments/s5pgh0/monday_majlis_open_discussion/ht5c25l/

He wants to have Saudi citizenship cause he is muslim? As a muslim, your benefits recieved from Saudi citizenship is basically nothing. I've met Saudi Muslims, Christians, and Athiests in my time in Saudi and they all had the same benefits regardless of religion.  My family isn't Saudi (nor even Arab), but my parents were born and raised in Saudi (so basically 45+ years), and same with my siblings (so 15+ years), and none of us are Saudi, and nor does Saudi citizenship interests us.   I'd say the only benefit of living in Saudi is being close to Makkah and Medina, but that is the same benefit all residents of Saudi recieve. Regardless of having or not having Saudi citizenship.   He should really enjoy his US citizenship in my opinion lmao.	1642835172.0	htpqis7	t3_s9rg3k	t3_s9rg3k	/r/arabs/comments/s9rg3k/what_a_show/htpqis7/
