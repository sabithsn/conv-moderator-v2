11iyz1	just to be clear, I'm not defending Biden. I think he's pretty shit too. My point is even if he was more strict with his anti-covid Protocol it wouldn't  Make a difference as so many people choose to ignore what he had put in place in the past and yet still want to blame him for doing 'nothing'.

41zh15ba	If they want to kill the remaining value of public education, this is probably the way to do it.   Conversely, I teach regular ed classes. I don‚Äôt grade homework and I accept work basically all quarter because I have realized that way too many students won‚Äôt do the assignment on time due to more factors than I care to go into and they won‚Äôt learn it if they won‚Äôt do the work. This is just the population I teach. It isn‚Äôt ideal. It is just what I am working with. The kids need to pass the class and their end of the year test to graduate, so I try to make as many opportunities available to them as I can so they can do that.  I absolutely would not teach an honors, elective, or advanced class with this many accommodations. Many still would argue I shouldn‚Äôt. I do have good pass rates, and I know my students learn the material and are prepared for the next level. I don‚Äôt know if I am doing them more of a disservice by accepting late work and not requiring homework or not. I do know I am doing them a disservice if they don‚Äôt pass that test. If they haven‚Äôt learned to turn in work on time yet, I don‚Äôt know that creating harsh penalties in my class would do it.   If my school required a late policy, I would abide, and if the school took a harder stance overall about commitments, I would be on board.  As it stands, all the powers that be only want to know what it will take to get them to the next level. Fortunately, I have a test where I can say, they need to do the work to understand and pass.   This is the benefit of standardized testing. I think we should have less of it, but we need it. ESPECIALLY, if as a system we are going to start letting kids every life circumstance dictate every teaching decision.	1640900775.0	hqlm6vj	t3_rsc4sc	t3_rsc4sc	/r/Conservative/comments/rsc4sc/in_the_name_of_equity_virginia_county_wants_to/hqlm6vj/

But...As a white, Jewish, 49yo heterosexual male who only has been married to one woman, i feel like I epitomize everything that is wrong with this world from Omar's point of view.   As a former refugee and now an American citizen i am eternally grateful to a country that gave me and my family a chance for a prosperous future. A chance that my wife and i eagerly took. I worked a few jobs while in college, she worked a few jobs and graduated law school. I think we did ok for ourselves and now our oldest is about to graduate law school so believe our kids will be ok too. Omar also did great for herself, by doing what she did (whatever the fck it was) and becoming a member of the House. So why do we see the US so differently? Why do we see it as a country that didn't have to do anything for us and yet gave us so much and she looks at it as a cow that should be milked for more and more benefits without a shred of loyalty on her part?

I couldn't imagine being that obsessed with another country, and I generally do not randomly encounter people complaining about other countries here in the states.  Apart from, you know, the internet.  As for the superiority thing, I do often get that feeling from coworkers in Canada--especially some of the French Canadians I have worked with.  It can be a little frustrating when their insecurity gets in the way of working effectively.  On the other hand, I have had exactly the opposite experience with Canadians here in the US.

1dy1hbqx	In order to turn this all around the country really needs to come together. Hand in hand.   We are all in this together.   Vaccines needs to be mandated. For everyone just like measles. Babies born should be given vaccines for COVID just like they do for Polio.   Kids under 18 that don‚Äôt get vaccinated should be barred from returning to school. We need to get this pandemic under control. The spread is literally a straight arrow up.   Vaccines really should be mandated for every adult. With fines and/or imprisonment if they do not comply. Annual boosters need to be included if it doesn‚Äôt go away.   I also think we are far too relaxed on masking. Masking needs to be required in every public space for all ages. N95 mask quality if you are not inside your home.   All the money we wasted on the vaccine development is going to waste. We need to start making masks. Making them free. Making them required.   If we did that in under 5 years this would all be history. Eradicated.   People need to just be responsible. Accept the next 5 years will be hard but worth it.   With possible monthly stimulus checks such as the $2000 a month for every American until it‚Äôs over ‚Äî that would also really make it easier for families who are struggling.   The Biden administration has had so many curve balls thrown at them it‚Äôs aweful.   I believe if he can step up, put his foot down, get vaxed or go to jail, mask up or be arrested, and provide a full income for every American we will be out of this nightmare by the next election.

Its not like he only reads and speaks Mandarin or something, then the English words on signs would be indecipherable.	1640958846.0	hqoj8sj	t3_rsh8m7	t1_hqns2xk	/r/Conservative/comments/rsh8m7/colorado_governor_commutes_truckers_110_year/hqoj8sj/

The nomenclature behind the two political parties shifted some time back, but the geopolitical breakdown of the US has hardly budged. If you look at the electoral map of today, it's pretty consistent with the political distribution at the time of the civil war.   The idea that Abraham Lincoln would have aligned with the Republican party of today is silly. He was overwhelmingly in favor of centralizing and strengthening the federal government, and was even called by many noted conservatives of the time a tyrant.   To be clear, I'm a conservative.

They (democrats) are repeatedly on the wrong side of it, however, over time they change the narrative with revisionist history (see racism). The problem is through their control of 24/7 media and social media, they are able to do this almost instantaneously now. I guarantee in 10 years, when kids learn about the covid response of 2020/21 the narrative will be a 180 to what it is now. I mean, look at when the virus first came out, the narrative was lockdowns are racist, vaccines are racist and rushed and cant be trusted, and that is almost 100% forgotten by the general public after a year, because they realized they could use the virus to their advantage.  As we learn more about how useless and detrimental their policies were, they will start changing the narrative, and its slowly but surely happening now, like clock work.	1640975883.0	hqpmjpr	t3_rsze7q	t1_hqpitrx	/r/Conservative/comments/rsze7q/welcome_to_reality_ben_shapiros_thread_on_what/hqpmjpr/

High cost of everything,  can't save, fuel killig me, rent killing me, now can't afford a home, company can't find employees, low margins, it's just brutal, and all a direct result of liberal policies and specifically Bidens policies.	1640976166.0	hqpn8u5	t3_rsia11	t3_rsia11	/r/Conservative/comments/rsia11/cnn_host_perplexed_by_bidens_low_approval_number/hqpn8u5/

Simmons, who at the time was working as a registered nurse, said she started using drugs following the death of her father in 2010. To support her habit, Simmons said, she resorted to stealing and selling drugs.        After her release from prison, during which time she went through a drug treatment program, Simmons was admitted to Seattle University School of Law and graduated magna cum laude in 2017. But when she applied to sit for the bar exam, the Washington State Bar Association voted 6-3 against admitting her.        With the help of another convicted-felon-turned-lawyer, Shon Hopwood, who served time for bank robbery and now teaches at Georgetown Law, Simmons successfully challenged that decision before the Washington Supreme Court. She took the bar exam in February 2018 and was sworn in as an attorney in June of that year.	1640976497.0	hqpo1u1	t3_rsd9yr	t3_rsd9yr	/r/Conservative/comments/rsd9yr/washington_state_looks_to_reduce_sentences_for/hqpo1u1/

84phe6s5	The thing is, I know the sub isn't always the biggest fan of Mitt Romney, but we know where his wealth came from(mostly). He's a venture capitalist. And he has taken a lot of flack from the liberal elites over it. But damn, he didn't make his money sitting in congress for 35 years.  Her net worth is reported somewhere between $106 million last year and maybe $114 million this year. If someone were to make what a congressperson has made(not counting extra for being speaker of the house) and invested 25% of their gross(because they are a high earner) and gotten 10%(historic S&P500 growth) then they would have about $9.42 million. That's midnight back of the napkin math. But it just gives an idea of how much extra her position of power has provided for her.

bedrcj7u	Hi Medical Laboratory Scientist here.  You are absolutely correct. There are also multiplex assays that test for common cold pathogens.  This has been a big season in my lab for RSV and Rhinovirus as well.  Thank you for trying to spread accurate information.  There's a lot of COVID misinformation here, "They don't test for flu!", "The PCR cycles are too high!", "The tests can't tell the difference!"  It's like people just make this shit up. I am trying my fucking hardest in the lab to provide rapid, accurate results to help people.  COVID is still the big one, we hit 25% positivity this week.    Everybody--please get vaccinated.  The vaccines do work.  They reduce severity of disease, shorten viral shedding duration by over half, lower viral load, and reduce transmission. Running 100+ PCR tests/day on top of my normal workflow is ruining us.  Morale is at an all-time low.  We had mandatory overtime and cancelled holiday leave.  People are calling out sick just to lay in bed and decompress so they can come back to work the next day which is putting even more strain on us.	1641042754.0	hqsw7mm	t3_rq5ik8	t1_hqc3e6y	/r/Conservative/comments/rq5ik8/flu_is_making_a_comeback_in_us_after_an_unusual/hqsw7mm/

So there may be minor inaccuracies here or there, but overall it's a "for the people by the people" type of operation. Arguing that Wikipedia is *propaganda* starts to sound like a delusional person arguing that reality is propaganda?  I'm curious if people here feel that Wikipedia has a bias?

I can't speak on her behalf, but I would guess someone with with Liz Cheney's perspective would argue that at some point what happened January 6th stopped being a peaceful protest and became dangerous (to law enforcement, others in the capital, and the democratic process). I think she would argue that the crowds respected and would listen to Trump, and if Trump had publicly asked them to leave they would have. Her "evidence" seems to show that Sean Hannity, Kevin McCarthy, and others texted Trump asking him to please do this, which he did not do for hours. The fact that he chose not to take action for several hours put law enforcement, etc., in more danger than they needed to be in.

af9ts	Naomi Oreskes March 22, 2019 Presented by: The Baker-Nord Center for the Humanities  https://youtu.be/Gc7RNrh8i-A  See around the 50 minute mark      Many people have forgotten if we think about times in US history where there have been gigantic violations of civil rights personal rights human rights often they've been associated with disease and contagion or with the articulation of a threat as a form of disease and contagion. So, if we think about forced sterilization of American citizens during the eugenics period, much of that argument was made based on the idea that eugenics was a medical threat, or I should say, eugenics was a response to a medical threat. And we know that over 30,000 people in California alone were sterilized without their consent during that period, and many more in other states. We know more about California because they kept better records, but we know that many of people in other states were similarly affected so this theme that the disasters that climate change will bring are the sorts of things that will justify or seemingly even necessitate the loss of individual liberty.	1642538196.0	ht83mh8	t3_s73xmv	t3_s73xmv	/r/Conservative/comments/s73xmv/the_virus_were_dealing_with_is_not_just_covid_its/ht83mh8/

3z1knao4	Patience, persistence, and getting me to understand that this is a stepping stone to greater knowledge.    As an actuary, he somehow got me to see that math doesn't always get you the answer; it's there as a tool to put you in the ballpark and then from there you have to use your other tools.  Looking back, he blew my mind.  For me it was incomprehensible that finding the answer to an equation isn't necessarily the end of the line.  That there was an entire world beyond and I had no idea what that world was.   He was the toughest man I've ever met.  His son operated on a completely higher level.  They're both dead now; I carry their stories with me and do my best to honor their memory by carrying on their teachings to other people I come into contact with.    In a very straight-laced environment, he was the "straightest".

4pip92r5	TX has indeed gotten bluer over the last two decades but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs imminently going to flip. I‚Äôm not super informed on the data, but many residents from states like CA are moving there to escape Dem policies, and as such they‚Äôll vote Rep. And the rightward shift in Hispanic voters also benefits the Reps.   Personally I‚Äôm way more concerned about GA. It‚Äôs been pretty Rep since the 1960s but prior to that it NEVER voted red. We‚Äôre seeing trends that are eerily reminiscent of what happened with VA. This year‚Äôs governor and senate races will be very telling of GA‚Äôs political future.   If TX does flip blue during a presidential election, it would be disastrous for Reps. They would need to keep their 2020 map, sweep the rust belt 2016-style, carry AZ and GA, and pick off NV or NH for a narrow win.	1642530756.0	ht7jg3b	t3_s71ll1	t1_ht75cxc	/r/Conservative/comments/s71ll1/beto_orourke_raises_7m_in_first_6_weeks_of_bid/ht7jg3b/

hkq1nxmz	Jerome Powell and the Dems gave liberal Wall Street elites the gift of free money. His policy of stimulus and quantitative easing enriched his liberal friends on Wall Street to the deficit of hard working Americans.  We needed Wall Street to invest in American jobs. Instead, Wall St took the money (and even borrowed more money at historically low interest rates) to perform stock buybacks at the same time shuttering US manufacturing and off-shoring jobs to China and India.  In addition, Powell used your tax dollars to buy up risky junk bonds furthering the idea of "moral hazard." If issuers of junk bonds (and those who invest in them) think that the Fed is just going to open up the taxpayer's pocketbook every time one of their risky bets fails, they'll just keep making more and more risky bets.  Once Biden stole the White House, Jerome was emboldened to continue his morally bankrupt plans to enrich his liberal elite friends while gutting the American economy.  Call me crazy, but I don't trust any Fed Chairman that vacations with the Clintons.	1642577420.0	htahu64	t3_s7jx2q	t3_s7jx2q	/r/Conservative/comments/s7jx2q/cnn_has_a_great_plan_to_curb_inflationand_its/htahu64/
hkr3zra	Why do "conservatives" hate white people?  JFK and Lincoln were two of our worst presidents. MLK Jr was an anti-Christian communist. Jim Crow and Segregation were ethnic groups asserting that their own society served them first and outsiders second. The Confederacy was the right to dissolving bonds with a federal entity that oppressed them.  Yeah, random lynchings are immoral (even if many were guilty and had activists judges free clearly guilty parties for political posturing), interment camps were discrimination with no real national security benefit, and the second and third Klans were just Freemason exercises... but in-group is the only moral position. "Conservatives" expect white people to hate themselves just as much as liberals do, but "conservatives" are just "classical liberals", and classical stupidity is still stupidity.	1642577964.0	htaild5	t3_s766uk	t3_s766uk	/r/Conservative/comments/s766uk/who_did_it/htaild5/

3zrsxvci	Gotta love the chumps who talk out Thier ass and compare RFID to long range, one way signals.  "Cutting the wire" on either side of the RFID system would keep your car from starting, the intended purpose of the RFID system. Any from of input signal can be stopped.   All forms of radiation can be stopped and all are if there is a tunnel, a mountain blocking the signal, a faraday cage (metal garages), sufficient rain, or even volcanic dust.  So, a "heartbeat detection" type system will fail and frequently due to nature alone.  The only thing they could try is an active check type of system, a shit ton of laws around disabling it, and having cops pull over anyone who's car doesn't respond to a 'ping' type check either actively from the police car or through a passive system like the ones they use in many Tollways.  Which leaves it all open for tampering.

There is likely an unconsciois revenge motive on their part that feels the scales are evened when non-minority status plebs die due to their "soft on crime" policies that only prioritize fewer POC prosecutions and incarcerations.	1642618871.0	htcqx8n	t3_s7snh3	t3_s7snh3	/r/Conservative/comments/s7snh3/la_da_ripped_for_being_soft_on_crime_after_deaths/htcqx8n/

464io8c3	Things can be racist by either intent (ie. I am doing X in order to discriminate), or by outcome (ie. I will enact X, I don‚Äôt intend to discriminate, but if enacted it will end up discriminating).  A voter ID law, in principle, is good! Added election security. However, if it‚Äôs enacted right now, it‚Äôs racist, because rather than improving election security (actual election fraud is extraordinarily rare), it will instead act as another barrier that will disproportionately affect minorities, primarily black voters.  And, it‚Äôs racist for BOTH reasons. The politicians are intending to block black people from voting because they know that black people disproportionately vote democrat, and it‚Äôs racist by outcome since it removes more black representation.  If, instead, you FIRST made it easy and free for people to get a state ID, waited some time for everyone to acquire one, then enacted voter ID laws, then it would probably make more sense. But as of right now, the time and cost puts off primarily black people.  See what Ontario, Canada does instead with their health card. Since there is socialized health care, the government allows citizens to get a free health card that doubles as an official government ID. In that system, voter ID laws are far more rational and less discriminatory since there are fewer barriers for the extremely poor to get an ID.  There‚Äôs way more to discuss about this issue, but it is more complicated than just ‚ÄúID makes elections more secure‚Äù.	1642700921.0	hthhw5r	t3_s8iczg	t1_htgeebq	/r/Conservative/comments/s8iczg/biden_claims_2022_elections_wont_be_legit_fouled/hthhw5r/

Their first patent filing specifically recognizing the S-protein as the immunologic target for vaccines was filed on November 14, 1990 (U.S. Patent 6,372,224). With a focus on swine and canine gastroenteritis, these efforts showed little commercial promise and the patent was abandoned in April of 2000.   During the same period, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) under the vaccine obsession of Dr. Anthony Fauci, funded Professor Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. This program designed to commercially weaponize a naturally occurring toxin is the beginning of the criminal conspiracy and violates 18    USC ¬ß 175, 15 USC ¬ß 1-3, and 15 USC ¬ß 8) Dr. Baric‚Äôs expertise was understanding how to modify components of the coronavirus associated with cardiomyopathy. NIAID Grants AI 23946 and GM63228 (leading to patent U.S. 7,279,327 ‚ÄúMethods for Producing Recombinant Coronavirus‚Äù) was the NIH‚Äôs first Gain-of-Function (GOF) project in which Dr. Baric created an ‚Äúinfectious, replication defective‚Äù clone of recombinant coronavirus.   This work clearly defined a means of making a natural pathogen more harmful to humans by manipulating the Spike Protein and other receptor targets. A year after filing a patent on this GOF CoV, the world experienced the first outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).    Under the guise of responding to a public health emergency, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) filed a patent application on the genome of SARS CoV on April 25, 2003. Accessing and manipulating the genomic data (which came from China making an ‚Äúinvention‚Äù claim by a U.S. entity illegal violating 35 USC ¬ß101, 103), Dr. Baric, Dr. Fauci, and the CDC violated 18 USC ¬ß 175 (a felony).   One year earlier, Dr. Baric and his team had already filed a patent which clearly the pathogen CDC claimed as novel in 2003. Three days after filing a patent on the genome, NIH-funded Sequoia Pharmaceuticals filed a patent for the vaccine on the virus invented a mere three days earlier.    At the same time, in violation of 15 USC ¬ß 19 Dr. Fauci was appointed to a board position with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (a competitor in vaccine manufacturing) thereby beginning the interlocking directorate anti-trust crime.  In 2005, the DARPA and MITRE hosted a conference in which the intentions of the U.S. Department of Defense was explicit. In a presentation focused on ‚ÄúSynthetic Coronaviruses Biohacking: Biological Warfare Enabling Technologies‚Äù, Dr. Baric presented the malleability of CoV as a biological warfare agent. Violating 18 USC ¬ß 175 and inducing the non-competitive market allocation (violating 15 USC ¬ß 8) for years to follow, Dr. Baric and the    U.S. Department of Defense spent over $45 million in amplifying the toxicity of CoV and its chimeric derivatives.    From 2011 until the alleged COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Fauci has routinely lamented about the inadequacy of public funding for his vaccine programs and the public‚Äôs general unwillingness to succumb to his insistence that everyone MUST be vaccinated against influenza. Despite repeated appropriations to advance vaccine dependency, his efforts have been largely unsuccessful.    NIAID ‚Äì under Dr. Fauci‚Äôs direct authorization ‚Äì encouraged UNC Chapel Hill and Dr. Baric‚Äôs lab to ignore the GoF moratorium in a letter dated October 21, 2014.    At that time, Drs. Fauci, Baric and EcoHealthAlliance‚Äôs Peter Daszak were in possession of an extremely dangerous Chinese pathogen identified a year earlier in Wuhan.        While many illegal acts were committed by the conspirators leading up to 2015, the domestic terrorism program (in violation of 18 USC ¬ß 2339) was announced by NIAID-funded Daszak at the National Academy of Sciences. Here, he announced what was to become the domestic and global terrorism event branded COVID-19.	1642742287.0	htk8da9	t3_s92ugb	t3_s92ugb	/r/Conservative/comments/s92ugb/the_nuremberg_code_1947_will_anyone_be_charged/htk8da9/

She‚Äôs no different than an uneducated redditor spouting off and making assumptions.   The only difference here is that she has the backing of a ‚Äúnews‚Äù organization.

What she did was a federal offense punishable by up to a $37k fine, jail time, and a permanent flight ban from all airlines.  She's a moron for making that choice.

Because of my legal, cultural, ethical & moral stance on the issue of an individual to bear arms.       > Why are all the other amendments up for debate?      I never said any of the amendments were up for debat. They're not. The Constituion is the cultural agreement we have to each other and the government. The Bill of Rights sets out broad boundries on the government. I see the breaking of the rules set out in the contract between the people and the government as just that, acting outside the law. The law being the set of rules we all, indirectly at times, agree to.       > Why do conservatives hold the 2nd so dearly?     This will probably get my slammed into downvote oblivion: I considered myself mostly on the left for most of my life. The idea of considering myself a conservative is a fairly new part of my life and did not set in easy. I was raised in Oregon, so a PNW version of left. I was not raised around firearms and had never actually seen one until I was 17. A .22 revolver. I had never shot a weapon until basic training at Ft. Gordon, GA. I never had an interest in firearm ownership until I had learned that I was really good at accurately shooting difficult targets. I've still valued the US Constitution as early as around my teen years. I had felt the right for citizens to own weapons is a just right.      > No ones taking your guns.

dzfv9a7y	I have maybe three hours to talk on this subject, but I‚Äôll keep it brief.  Beatles changed the entire industry, in the form as we know it today. Executives and producers realized at that time, that actual money could be made on music. A LOT OF MONEY. Before The Beatles, this wasn‚Äôt really a thing. Of course you had your regional artists on the radio, etc, but almost never anything nationwide.  Okay so fast forward. Once we realized money could be made we‚Äôve capitalized with every fucking ‚Äúhook‚Äù ring-dinger bullshit. The ‚Äúhook‚Äù is all that is. After money became involved, we‚Äôve lost all touch with the true greats, in my opinion.

Before that distinction is muddied its Venn diagram time: all vaccines are countermeasures, not all countermeasures are vaccines. What this means is in the rare case a covid shot hurts you, it falls under the CICP framework rather than the VICP legal framework which is substantially worse for victims:  https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/cicp-vicp  We've administered 200M+ doses, had two large pieces of covid legislation last year and multiple executive orders.

What matters is the specific situation that led to her death and the specific people involved. No one was thinking of the rand Paul or kavanaugh hearings when it happened. There‚Äôs no tit for tat score in this situation that the cop had to factor in before pulling the trigger. Don‚Äôt be a liberal idiot and see every instance as a systemic problem. She fucked up trying to jump through a window during a riot (not an insurrection like the libs wish it was) in the capital which armed guards were behind.

I can tell you first hand that every law or regulation about government requirements such as competitive bidding can be circumvented.  Also if you didn‚Äôt know, government entities are known to spend frivolously at the end of their fiscal year because if they have money on the books then they get less funding next year since they didn‚Äôt need it all.  This is why your government over spends and is always broke.  Schools are the worst for this.  My experience?  20 years working for school districts as a network admin contractor, and 15 years construction.

fes8z9r6	Most people who believe there was fraud think so because they don‚Äôt believe the results.  The results however, we‚Äôre not terribly surprising.  Republicans are terrible at adapting to changes in election rules, such as increased mail in voting, and usually lose elections where this happens, but adjust 1 or 2 elections down the line.  Take the California ballot harvesting law.  The fist state election Republicans were wiped across the board, yet the next one, despite it being generally favorable to Democrats, saw Republicans regain lost seats in areas that weren‚Äôt already trending blue before the rule change	1643057842.0	hu2hgd2	t3_sbnv2z	t1_hu2gw3o	/r/Conservative/comments/sbnv2z/your_right_to_vote_doesnt_include_a_right_to_vote/hu2hgd2/
