d6t1oytl	It is just a hypothetical question. When I said "somehow evaporated" rather than just "evaporated" what I meant was that I realise this is not very practical but what is the difference if we spread out the molecules that are in the foam into the gas instead. Does that change the speed of sound?	1642706735.0	hthxs2w	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hthtnvc	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthxs2w/

gekpw	The gravitational potential energy of some mass m in a gravitational field g is mgh, if we consider an approximately uniform gravitational field.  So the situation where the heavier material is above the lighter material has a higher potential energy than the situation where the heavier material is lower than the lighter material.  So when you say "There's no input of energy", there *is* a difference in potential energy. If the heavier material is higher, it would prefer to switch places with the lighter material in order to reduce the overall gravitational potential energy of the system.	1642741158.0	htk685x	t3_s90t6g	t3_s90t6g	/r/askscience/comments/s90t6g/how_do_less_dense_material_rise_in_a_denser/htk685x/

I start going in too deep in my thoughts, then knock out either from cbd effects or because I am overwhelmed. idk.   At one point, used it to go deep into my psyche to uncover subconscious stuff.

I've made a very crude illustration of some gravitational waves emitted from a planet orbiting a star:  https://i.imgur.com/3P3NJgS.png  There are three snapshots in time showing which direction gravity "slopes" space towards. (Ignore the star in this example)  What's interesting to me then is that the projected trajectory would take the orbit into account (which is also caused by gravitational forces).	1642777054.0	htlrzn5	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl3s34	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htlrzn5/
a5t2jv4h	The terminal velocity will actually be higher, not lower. This is because there is less atmosphere to put up resistance to a falling object. Remember that gravity *accelerates* things, so the question is how much accelerating can happen before atmospheric resistance begins to substantially counteract it. With less atmosphere to put up resistance, more acceleration can happen and so the thing falls faster.	1642787927.0	html0w1	t3_s8oqq7	t3_s8oqq7	/r/askscience/comments/s8oqq7/would_terminal_velocity_on_mars_be_the_same_as_on/html0w1/

39pradfe	I've heard that some of the newer opioids make the body 'participate' more in the painkilling substance synthesis (?) than Morphine or Heroin. Is this true? If so, then is it also true that because a person's body on contemporary synthetic opioids is more involved, the withdrawals can last way, way longer than in heroin or morphine withdrawal? That heroin can be physically worse but short term use is less addictive and thus better for acute medical use (surgeries etc)?	1642795776.0	htn6c2k	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htn6c2k/

This means that if you have two starts that look similar you might get a false positive.  Further more it is possible for the free amino acids used to fill in the rest of the gene when copying it in the PCR to bind to either the start reader or end reader strand of the gene, their by tricking the test into thinking that you have the gene present in the test.	1642810662.0	htoa38y	t3_s9kcvi	t3_s9kcvi	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htoa38y/

I also know that vestibular training is part of the astraunaut training regiment, as u have been told.   I could hypothesize that it would take some time (depending on the person, from a couple of days to a couple of months) to not feel dizzy when gravity changes. Either from getting into space or getting back to earth.

t877m	Some mutations are like inserting/removing extra letters into a sentence that make it less readable or unreadable completely. *These can be mutations in exons*.  Other mutations are like changing whether a sentence gets read at all, or puts white-out over it so it can't be read even though it's still there. *These can be mutations in introns*.  Note that many mutations in both exons and introns don't have any deleterious effect, but when they do you can see the above happen.  Intronic and other non-coding mutations often affect the *regulation* of genes (when/how often are genes read and used). Perhaps the most famous non-coding mutation is in the promoter region of the TERT gene. TERT is active when we're developing but turns off when we're young. It helps extend the ends of our chromosomes and is tied to aging since, without it's activity, our chromosomes eventually wear out due to all the growing and cell replication we do in our lives. Mutations in the TERT promoter (non-coding) region essentially turn that back on and is associated with almost every cancer: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26941407/.	1642883720.0	htsd5zj	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htsd5zj/

gekpw	>No, this is wrong even for most circular orbits!  No, it's correct for all circular orbits. In the (non-inertial) rest frame of the orbiting object, it's not accelerating at all. That means that the forces must exactly cancel, and the only two forces in the system are gravity and the centrifugal force.  >The only time this is true is geostationary circular orbits. That’s just a very specific orbit that has a period of 24 hours. You can’t generally say that circular orbits are gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out from Earth.  Absolutely wrong. You're mixing up the angular velocity of the orbit and the angular velocity of the rotation of the body that's being orbited. There's no requirement that a general circular orbit have a period synchronous with the rotation of the body being orbitted.  >I have a separate comment where I tried to dive deeper into explaining what centrifugal force is and how it works if you want to learn more.

hr8pzgcj	There is, we just don't really call them parasites at that point.   Parasitism describes 1 of 3 types of symbiosis:   **parasitism**: *Where one organism, referred to as a parasite, benefits at the expensive of another.*   **Mutualism**: *Where both benifit from their relationship together, think those small fish that clean other fishes mouths.*  **Commensalism**: *Where one benefits and the other isn't harmed but doesn't benifit.*  I see no reason why you couldn't bend it a bit can call it a parasite. Gives it an exotic spin and I imagine people would use the word for commensalism even though it's not technically correct. But if you wanted to be a stickler, it wouldn't be a parasite.

z7s2e	OP has a complete misunderstanding of how Botox is used to prevent lines and wrinkles. Like you said it's because of the loss of elasticity in the skin, which results in lines wrinkles when the skin is repeated creased by muscle movement. Slow or stop the muscle movement, and the skin isn't getting creased so much, thus no lines. Younger skin doesn't develop these creases because it's more elastic and bounces back when folded. It has nothing to do with more "hyperactive muscles".	1642958266.0	htwgozi	t3_sawt39	t1_htwc72q	/r/askscience/comments/sawt39/why_do_muscles_become_hyperactive_with_age/htwgozi/
iispz	Take an example of a piece of paper, and pretend there is a 2 dimension being that lives on the surface of that piece of paper. This being has the concept of up/down/left/right, but has no concept of forward and backwards and can only see and travel along the surface of that piece of paper.   If we then take that paper and crumple it into a ball, we would be warping that 2D sheet of paper in three dimensions, meaning the 2D creature wouldn't see a change at all, yet by crumpling it into a ball it's world now takes up less 3D space.  Now we live in 3 dimensions, up/down/left/right/forward/backwards and have no concept of higher dimensions since we lack the ability to perceive them. However, just like a 2D surface can be bent or crumpled in 3D space without a 2D creature knowing, a 3D surface can be bent and crumpled in 4D or higher space and we wouldn't notice a difference.	1642977355.0	htxu74g	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htxu74g/

There's you'd stand much more chance of getting hit by other bits of rock collected in the valley, while the tops of the hills stay relatively clear because you need a little effort to stay there.	1643043729.0	hu1fr8h	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1fr8h/
m0d0h	I just had a kidney transplant and have done the 24 hours tests since 1997. For me they were testing protein spillage. When you do a urine test during bloodwork it’s one spot in time. When you do a 24 hour test it’s the average of a whole day.  My protein was higher in the morning and after a meal. Fasting for a blood test it was generally lower than the 24 hour test where if I wasn’t fasting it was generally higher than the 24 hour.	1643048164.0	hu1rtji	t3_sboq6i	t3_sboq6i	/r/askscience/comments/sboq6i/how_do_hospitals_use_1day_urine_to_determine/hu1rtji/

a589v4op	Dust orbits L4 and L5 as well as some large objects. If a slightly larger object interacts **in just the right way** it would kick out some of the current orbiters and that slightly larger object would get "trapped" into orbiting L4/L5.  &nbsp;  If the above scenario reoccurs ever larger objects could become trapped in the L4 and L5 regions.  &nbsp;  Further interactions with outside stuff **Could (?!)** cause a "large" object to become "locked" into an orbit very close to L4 and/or L5.  &nbsp;  Capeesh?  &nbsp;	1643061439.0	hu2r0kx	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2r0kx/
