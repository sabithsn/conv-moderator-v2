6j55dguk	It’s really annoying to me how my coworker keeps jamming it down my throat forcefully. Like we’re going to talk about this and “ARENT THEY CUTE???” with regard to my nieces? Like I mustn’t disagree or must forcefully acknowledge it.	1640865834.0	hqjcswy	t3_rr88l6	t1_hqh334s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rr88l6/forced_female_bonding_over_kids_though_childfree/hqjcswy/

4qrd1k4w	Yeah. I have an HV dad, and hope to have a child on my own when I turn 35. I really worry about this, but it's true.  My ex also had a lovely mom and a cheating scrote dad that abandoned their family for his mistress. He ended up treating me spectacularly poorly for the last hear of the relationship, and then it came to light he was cheating. He mirrored his LVM dad *exactly*.  Most of the women I know from difficult backgrounds have done *so* much work and are some of the kindest, most mature people. Men handle it differently - they can project their anger out at those around them for years without seeing a therapist. The fact that there's a gendered response to trauma has also been documented in the research community.  It's really tough though; I've known really good men from some very difficult backgrounds (one of the best grew up raised by his father, because his mother had Huntington's). I've also seen some men turn out well after being raised by a single mother and surrounded by sisters. But mine treated me well for 5 years, and then flipped as soon as there was some adversity in his life.   I think it's fair for us to want to discuss these patterns with one another here on FDS and make decisions accordingly - it's one of the only places we can speak freely.	1640880576.0	hqk5x5v	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjlg3p	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqk5x5v/

h57msag5	I confidently and unapologetically advocate an FDS viewpoint among my friends and acquintances. Sometimes, I can hear the *click* of a mindset shift in others. So my solution is similar to the FDS forum: empower eachother. In my experience, people are most receptive to the message when they are themselves anxiously attached, or in a situationship with an avoidant, and being OUTSIDE of a group setting helps the most. Otherwise everyone will just start parroting the dominant hook-up culture dogma again.  Example: recently I had a private conservation with a friend who is pining over a man with multiple women chasing him. She had had sex with him once and he told her he found it moderately enjoyable. I let her vent and when she finished, I looked her dead in the eye and said:  "Or you could have standards. Why would you chase some manslut around who is obviously using you for sex, and says he didn't even like the sex? Why are you accepting this disrespect? This cannot be good for your self-esteem and this will reflect very badly on you in the dating pool. If you chase him you'll just be the next desperately available pvssy in his harem" ...and went on for another good three minutes non-stop throwing arguments for my case. Al she could exclaim was: "You're right. You're absolutely right."  I thought I had a breakthrough. 10 minutes later, she slipped back into hook-up culture mode and made excuses again. But, a seed has been planted.  **tl;dr: I try to contribute to a culture shift by being unapologetic, vocal, and ruthlessly advocating for FDS school of thought. I've noticed the most influence in one-on-one conversations with anxious attached individuals.**  DISCLAIMER: If someone is in a situationship with an avoidant, and they're extremely defensive about your message, let it go. Some people are too far gone in denial and will burn every bridge before they ditch their LV partners.	1640886612.0	hqklmxr	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqkfqdn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqklmxr/
h57msag5	Love your point on ignoring agency in relationships. Every action is a choice. Not taking any action, is a choice as well. Indeed like not course-correcting.  I feel like ""you can't force it" started as genuinely well-meant advice for people who'd obsessively throw themselves at their love interests. So a warning to PickMe behaviour.  Now it has been weaponised: "You have to accept low-value behaviour, otherwise you're a high maintenance b1tch who is forcing it". Not getting a text back for 24 hours-- Life happens!  Not seeing eachother for two weeks-- So busy! Not in a relationship but you've been dating for 6 months-- Oh well, I'm fine with the way things are. She never cums-- Can't force it!	1640887586.0	hqko85k	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqkfsp8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqko85k/

However, you seem to have some serious anger issues, if you are indeed a female which i doubt. I would recommend therapy and not in an edgy insulting way, but honestly. Even if i was the worst pickme on the planet, your tone in wholely inappropriate and seeping with rage. Keep that rage for males.

caxkcnil	Exactly. Their sons are going to be alright. It’s not because a some of us on FDS choose not to date them that they’ll be single forever.   This is still a man’s world and the vast majority women don’t vet/aren’t as ruthless as we are here on FDS.  I truly don’t understand why so many single mothers took this post personally, this isn’t an attack on them, and it’s not on their sons either, if they’re so sure they raised high-value men and have a healthy relationship with them, they shouldn’t be worried at all.  It’s weird to see women invalidate our experiences and downvote you to oblivion. If they don’t want to participate to this discussion, that’s fine, but don’t try to silence other women.   This isn’t about you, put your feelings aside, and let women find ways to protect themselves from low-value men who come from dysfunctional families.	1640897227.0	hqld5tj	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjq8z3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqld5tj/
h57msag5	Pre-FDS I thought Gordon Ramsey was an abrasive cocky arsehole. But now, he seems quite HV to me. He always treats the staff with respect, and his critique is fair. The shouting only begins in confrontations with LV people, and again, is always based and fair.  When asked to leave, he leaves. Don't want my help? Fine. Done. Bye.

You literally SAID that asking someone on a walk date signals disinterest to you. You gave him a Red Flag on a silver platter to dodge. He knowingly caused his own demise.

h57msag5	There is a deep sadness and internal turmoil within insecurely attached people...  My Avoidant LVW ex had an expectation of abandonment and was very closed off from day 1, putting me in the position that I had to 'open her up'. She was so closed off that she fulfilled her own prophecy: "Why be vulnerable? Everybody leaves" and I left hurt and frustrated, after trying to get her to open up for 4 months. I got crumbs for my effort and she triggered my Anxious attachment style by her scarce and unpredictable affection.    If you don't mind me asking, how long would you say you test people's investment/commitment, without showing vulnerability in return?  On the flip side, as a recovering Anxious, my deepest fear is "You don't really love me, do you?" so my gut instinct is to merge and smother. Earn their love, and have them prove they love me by constantly providing affection. This behaviour is also very toxic in its own way: the perpetual chaser leaves no room to be desired, is usually the first to compromise their wants and needs, and may be controlling to calm their anxiety.	1640904297.0	hqlv0a5	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqlqvto	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlv0a5/
j2z76	I remember my dad said he was happy to retire a senior manager.  I told him he can’t, I already told my friends he was on his way to become VP.  a little push and he did retire as company VP. LOL.   Mom told him in no uncertain terms are they buying a house with less than two garages for the future cars this was in the 90s when they only owned one which was second hand.  Fast forward today, 5 cars and two homes.   What can sound demanding to one can be a motivation for the other.  In our family, everyone is pushed to “level up”. Not gonna lie it can be stressful but it has it’s own rewards. It also gave us a mindset, “if others can, I can. And if I can, others can too”. And it was a great way to weed out mediocrity	1640913153.0	hqmg9g3	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqmg9g3/

h57msag5	Shocked that this is such a common scrote trope.  The absolute kicker in my case was the projection: he'd left me in charge of my own bedtime by the age of 12, so I could *"learn to self-manage and that my choices have consequences"*, fully expecting me to abuse this privilege and start sleeping in class. Instead, I demonstrated to him that a 12-year old has more discipline than his middle-aged ass.  Ofcourse he never held himself to the same standards as he did a literal CHILD 💩 Behold, the superior sex!	1641123490.0	hqxazzu	t3_rsih6h	t1_hqorfpq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqxazzu/

I noted it but never brought it up until about 4 months later when I suspected he had lied about working in that field. Little did he know that I had been obsessing and nerding out over that discipline for years.  One day I was bored, so I called him and asked if he'd entertain me with some of the neat stories I'm sure he had from his career. There was a sudden, uncharacteristic silence on his end of the line.  "Who told you I had [cool job] stories?" he finally asked.  I grinned as I sensed the low-level panic in his voice. "You did."

44zon0wk	When I was 21, I went on a date with a 33 year old man. He kept trying to touch my leg and I was visibly uncomfortable and pulled away but he kept trying. He told me he thought I was intelligent and mature for my age and wanted to get to know me more. We hardly had anything in common but he didn’t seem to care. He creeped me out even though he seemed nice, thankfully my gut feeling was a strong one and I decided not to see him again. A man in his 30s who is HV would not be interested in a woman who just graduated high school a couple years ago	1641178512.0	hr0ulde	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr0ulde/
44zon0wk	If they’re not doing anything to improve their mental health and not actively working on it, that’s a red flag. I have had anxiety since I was a kid but I went through therapy and am taking medications for it. Also have a counselor I can talk to which helps me work through some stuff. I’ve fallen into the trap of trying to “fix” someone who needs real professional help and is not at a good place in life to be dating. It’s very exhausting and takes a toll on you, and there are men out there with mental health issues who will use their condition as a free pass to gaslight and abuse you. With your date, you dodged a bullet and months of heartache. Count yourself lucky he showed his true colors from the very beginning and the trash took itself out	1641179386.0	hr0wlox	t3_rukyak	t1_hr06sz1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hr0wlox/
44zon0wk	Reading the book “Attached” helped me notice some red flags that I’ve experienced with avoidant men in the past. One thing is that they may mention a woman they met in the past that they were really into at first but then found some flaw that turned them off. I had an avoidant ex mention that he always found something wrong with the women he dated by the third date but with me I was still amazing and perfect then so I should be proud I made it the farthest. I was only 20 when I dated him and looking back I was able to tell he had an avoidant attachment style from the very beginning. They’ll put distance between those close to them including family members. The same ex would speak highly of his mother but also mention a weakness of hers he doesn’t like. He also would talk about one of his close friends but bring up a flaw of theirs. If a man says negative things about other people, he’s probably also going to say something bad about you to others.	1641180454.0	hr0z0ya	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr0z0ya/
f1bnc5re	Don't be so hard on yourself. We are human and we have moments of weakness.

caxkcnil	Our grandpas protected their wives, and took care of them financially. Young women married for security and a bit of “freedom” away from their families.  Today, scrotes want a barely legal bang maid, who he will emotionally abuse and hit in bed, on top of making her pay the bills for him. If she doesn’t she’s a GoLd digger, and she’s told he’s not heR faThEr.   These men are predatory youth diggers. They should be ashamed of themselves. There’s nothing to gain from dating them. Most of them won’t even fulfill their girlfriends emotional needs.

f1bnc5re	It's alright, I have a much healthier understanding of relationships now so nothing like what he put me through will happen to me again.  But yeah, not interacting with your posts is a red flag, and even more of a red flag is him not posting you. I don't mean that he has to post a pic of your date nights every week because in my opinion that's too much. But every once in a while is fine, or tagging you in stuff, mentioning you, etc. depending on how often you're both on the platform.  As contradictory as this sounds, don't even let your guard down then. Him posting you could be for a myriad of reasons, from insecurity to appeasing you to lovebombing to showing off for his buddies. That doesn't mean he's still not a whore 🙃  Also, keep a throwaway/blank account on standby so you can look at his stuff and potentially see all the things he's hiding from you.	1641185275.0	hr19f8j	t3_ruskk4	t1_hr186pq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruskk4/what_classifies_as_social_media_red_flags/hr19f8j/
8w9ask4b	In other words, one can infer that when he's around women irl, he's a mansplainer.   He didn't realize that he's a mansplainer until he was arguing online (, which is something that most people (I think) with the ability to control their impulses and the wisdom to know that their precious time is better invested elsewhere, don't do).  Now that he realizes that he's misogynistic, he may tell women (and maybe men, depending on the circumstances) irl that he now knows that misogyny is real.   That's all that I gained from his post.   I wonder if he'll ever catch himself mansplaining irl.	1641185559.0	hr19ze2	t3_rssu7e	t3_rssu7e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hr19ze2/

2tfkr8e	Truthfully, with children, it is still really shitty if you do things traditionally. It is *so much work* and lack of freedom. Even if your partner *actually* did half.  My husband actually does half including emotional labor (like, my child has a small growth and he went to two primary care appointment and has been coordinating with the dermatologist and urologist to have it taken care of). It still is emotionally crushing. You're taking your free weekend time and splitting it amongst 3-4 people instead on 1 person. You spend your time on home maintenance or scheduling home maintenance, soccer practice, more stressed at restaurants because children are still learning turn-taking in conversations. Like, my child loves the neighborhood children, and the neighbor are uninspired and no one I would consciously hang out with. But that's what I did yesterday because she's a person too and me drinking to stem boredom and meaninglessness in the interaction was a kindness to her. And yes, you could just not have you children participate in society socially, but that's a pretty shitty thing to do to someone you've created.  TLDR: married life with children is still not joyous, even if you have a contributing partner. Unless: you have lots of money to mitigate the time obligation of children OR children are going to Grandma's one weekend a month OR you opt out of truly considering your child's emotional-social needs as a person.	1641192262.0	hr1lm3f	t3_ruqx4w	t1_hr136ca	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1lm3f/

c9exsear	Post like these make me question everything I believe about the concept of marriage. It pokes at a hidden part of myself; a true dichotomy I live with.  I’m so torn about marriage. Is it a wonderful part of life; something to desire and hold and cherish? Or is it a trap of some sort, like having your leg caught in an iron toothed snare?  I use to work with a gal years ago who was just about exclusively attracted to married men. She bragged about her days as a dental hygienist. She ended up having a full blown affair with the dentist she worked for, who was married and had kids. Their marriage blew up and his wife left him. After all of this, she moved cities…and kind of started her quest over again. She never expressed an ounce of remorse for what happened in that marriage, she would actually talk about that dentist and how much she missed him.  She had a system for seducing married man. And, it wasn’t complicated. All she did was employ specific tactics; flatter/compliment, make herself sound better than the wife and/or have qualities and attributes the wife didn’t, signal interest, and laugh at everything he says.  There’s no wondering why married men have so much opportunity to cheat, when women like her exist.   I honestly believe all married men will cheat given the right opportunity/circumstances. But a part of me doesn’t want to believe that because if I did, I could never congratulate anyone on an engagement.   So complicated for me.	1642530895.0	ht7jtnb	t3_s6mv67	t3_s6mv67	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht7jtnb/

I don’t expect people to side with their daughter in law, even if it’s the right thing to do, they always seem to side with their family/sons. Despite what people say a daughter in a law is most of the time seen as a stranger, she’s not blood. Other subs have proven this to me.   The mother in this post probably wasn’t supportive of her, like ever. She probably disliked her since day 1.

Blocked and deleted.   - triangulating me with an ex or a dream girl that exists only in his mind “I’m looking for a woman who is like this and who does that” when no one asked in the first place  - word salad, gaslighting, instead of apologizing. The man is emotionally immature and has a fragile ego. If you’re an adult and you can’t self reflect and apologize for something you did or said, I don’t want you in my space.   - if he apologizes only to get something from me. You don’t apologize to people because you want their attention back, but because you know you made them feel bad and you regret it. If you don’t understand that, you lack empathy  - if he waits for me  to reach for my purse instead of immediately taking care of the bill.

3bii2bnm	Erm  I do meet some Pickmeisha’s with a similar bitter mindset tbh  They’re the type who take pleasure in tearing attractive women down or anyone they’re envious of   Maybe cos one bullied them in school  Most grow out of it…but some do not  They’re still the same at 55, the severe ones   As in they have too much internalised misogyny   But I think women are more capable of levelling up and getting a grip than men are  Men hold grudges against the entire female sex bc ONE woman they liked politely rejected them in school  Or they had one bad experience  It’s always ppl with fragile egos   They get stuck in a fixed mindset   Rather than a growth mindset  Healthy ppl can process shame & embarrassment & learn from it. Basically they can take an L  Fragile people cannot, they chronically avoid facing themselves & take it out on others subconsciously   This is why therapy wouldn’t work on a covert narcissist   They’d just use it as a way to get sympathy & not change   When most women have suffered multiple and still find it in them to give men a fair chance   Honestly the older I get the more I realise peoples limitations   Contrary to what we’re told…some ppl will never change. They will go to the grave as problematic   And by trying to ‘fix’ them too long you can become an enabler or end up collateral damage   I think some will always end up ‘stuck’ on a certain level  Bc they’ve been snowballing so long it’s second nature- & they can’t take harsh truths.   They’re almost resistant to anything except admiration, no matter how rude they get.   If they can’t even keep it real with themselves   How can they with you?

When my high school bf (we dated for a long time, but I wish we hadn't because he ended up being...well...a POS) found out I was a virgin and wanted to wait a while before losing my virginity (he lost his at THIRTEEN), he looked surprised, then irritated.  I'm pretty sure that having a large chest has effected how men see me in in relationships, too. Before meeting my fiancé (I live abroad in an Asian country) it was SO hard to find someone who wanted to settle down with me. They were all literally just looking at my tits and going, "Easy foreigner".

I know it is temporary and the effect withers away, that's why it's considered something minor and with little to no consequences in the future.  Yet, I remember vividly the time, when it was considered ugly and since young age, I've been so self conscious about my lips and have been shamed for them multiple times. Even to this day I can't put lipstick, without thinking of myself as uglier.
