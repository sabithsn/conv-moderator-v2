ef6w3stt	That's what I've been doing. I've just been avoiding them all for the time being. I don't want to tell his wife but we are also  close friends and she's gone through so much.

eqallg3w	While I understand this, I agree with OP. As someone in a similar field (not exactly this) the comment that ‚Äúour work should be enough‚Äù is very harmful to healthcare workers and to patient health as a whole. Because of course I care about my patients and want them to be healthy and happy, but I also need to take care of my family. If healthcare workers aren‚Äôt paid enough, and are completely burnt out, they aren‚Äôt able to provide the quality of care that their patients/clients need. Also, covering up the problem of payment and saying that we should all be ok with it bc we ‚Äúwant to help people‚Äù tends to cause therapists to not complain/try to change other issues that are detrimental to patients. For example, not having access to certain curriculum, assessments, or other materials. Which aren‚Äôt provided by the workplace, and can‚Äôt be bought by the therapists because they don‚Äôt have money‚Ä¶  I know that this is slightly a tangent but I hope that it gets the point across and maybe is similar to what OP is expressing!	1642706421.0	hthwxmr	t3_s8q4dl	t1_htht571	/r/offmychest/comments/s8q4dl/mental_healthaddiction_counselors_and_therapists/hthwxmr/

Most ppl would provide jelly doughnuts and I don't like them lol. I pretty much will only eat plain doughnuts (no glaze/no powder) or crullers.  If we didn't eat them, then the next shift is like "awe shit!!

ef6w3stt	I agree with you to an extent.  I don't want to put myself in that position which is why I haven't said anything yet. But both girls are close friends of mine and the cheaters wife had suspicions and confronted him about them and he straight out told her she was crazy and making things up  so I just feel it's not fair to keep this from her but I don't want to be the one to tell her.

h9cdx	Kind of a dick thing to say to OP, not cool man. That being said... for anyone out there that hasn't tried a Kolache, it's a MUST, those things are incredibly delicious!!   They are ridiculously more expensive than a donut though, complaining your coworker got you a free donut instead of a Kolache is just very arrogant and entitled. For reference, I once bought 2 dozen kolaches for my coworkers using one buy 6 get 6 coupon (so only paid for 18) and the total was $80. I've never bought Krispy Kreme but I imagine $80 of donuts is at least 6 dozens	1642714266.0	htih45f	t3_s8ndv8	t1_hthpcxd	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ndv8/i_bought_donuts_for_everybody_at_work_and_im_the/htih45f/

w7kjo	Sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I know how you feel. I was in a car accident a couple years ago. Airbag caused jaw fractures and dental trauma. I lost a tooth, a couple broken teeth, and a few that were knocked out of place. Had over $25,000 worth of hospital bills alone and a totaled car. Not to mention more bills to cover restorative and cosmetic dental work.	1642749677.0	htkki26	t3_s89793	t3_s89793	/r/offmychest/comments/s89793/please_dont_take_your_teeth_for_granted/htkki26/

Don‚Äôt just learn to memorize, learn to think critically. Read constantly. Get into a vocational school right out of high school. You can go for free in some cases and even get financial aid for going. Become an LPN in 16 months and get out making $30 an hour. You can move out and never talk to them again.  Surround yourself with good hearted moral people and you will be happy. One day have your own family. Stay away from drugs and alcohol, workout to relieve stress. Slow and steady wins the race. This is what I wish I would‚Äôve heard when I was your age. Good luck	1642753070.0	htkp6bx	t3_s95iuh	t3_s95iuh	/r/offmychest/comments/s95iuh/i_just_want_someone_to_know_my_life/htkp6bx/

4ekglbdu	I used to, but I'm stronger now.  When my ex cheated on me, I cried so hard and felt so much anger and betrayal. He cheated on me when I was literally dying in the hospital.  When I lost our baby, I cried even harder. There was a lot of guilt and shame. I was alone. Funny how some men run when things get serious. I speak to my colleague about this, and it happened to her as well. She told me he disappeared as soon as she found she was pregnant.   When I felt like my first job post hospitalization was in jeopardy due to a performance review and I was going through chemo treatments (not for cancer, but blood transfusions to treat an autoimmune disease) those were some stressful times. I cried at night. I needed health insurance to cover those treatments..that were a 20k a pop, glad its over now. Ironically the "does not meet expectations" performance review was due to something that no one was trained on so her manager told her that. Even HR was questioning her actions.   Now it's like whatever. I didn't deserve the things that happened to me. The struggles I went through made me stronger. The actions of another person isn't a reflection on your worth. This is a great learning opportunity to screen people out since all the trauma is in such a compressed time frame.   With respect to that job, the girl who started after me quit, so there's 2 people left. The manager is new, and didn't want me to grow. I felt like she was intimidated by my credentials or me taking her job. Funny thing is, I never wanted her job, I just wanted to learn. I don't judge someone by how many degrees they have. The important thing is, are you a good person.. do you treat others with kindness? Can you complete tasks and take ownership and responsibilities? When I shifted departments I'm learning things that could have helped their office had they given me a chance, I'm working with people who are a much better fit, and my manager is super chill and thinks I'm doing an awesome job. When I want to learn more responsibilities, she sends someone to train me. I really appreciate that. And I know I can take these skills with me.	1642756858.0	htku4ck	t3_s96ivp	t3_s96ivp	/r/offmychest/comments/s96ivp/do_you_ever_cry_about_all_the_sad_things_that/htku4ck/

The people who invalidate men or assume "they're all the same" are just as bad as the people who made feminism necessary.

5tatll8	Better doesn't mean good, as I said in my post. It's awful what's still happening in terms of sexism, but it is a fact that it has improved since the past. You can't challenge that.  Women can vote, own property, be fully independent. The job market is more open for women, more assaults towards women are getting reported and taken far more seriously, the governments are actively seeking ways to reduce the danger women face. Women are allowed to study freely, they're able to gain quslifications and benefits, they're able to lead in parliament and run countries.  None of that could happen in the past. That's the improvement I was referring to. It isn't perfect by any means but please stop adding to the problem.	1642772369.0	htlh7x7	t3_s98lnd	t1_htlganz	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htlh7x7/
5tatll8	You aren't calling me out though, you're trying to argue against a fact. Everything you've tried to call me out for is just you taking my words wrongly.  What's adding to the problem is your assumption that because I'm male, sexism hasn't affected me. You're saying that sexism can't happen to other genders apart from females. And to top it all off, you're responding like you didn't even read or understand the post. I know there is still sexism and it's predominantly not towards males, but it doesn't make militant feminism (which is bordering on sexism itself) ok.   No matter what I say will change your opinion because it seems you came here purely to argue so I'll leave it there.	1642773054.0	htliozo	t3_s98lnd	t1_htli12g	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htliozo/
gvkl7unj	You WILL still encounter all the same behavior with men who aren‚Äôt white. I do think that whiteness is a contributing factor in increasing some aspects of toxic masculinity. But these features you‚Äôre describing define toxic masculinity which is pretty much globally pervasive. If you‚Äôre really looking for love and a genuine connection, don‚Äôt exclude an entire skin color, exclude all of the behaviors you‚Äôre describing and you‚Äôll be left with guys of many different skin tones.

I also don't understand your idea of an "unsupported sweeping announcement about sexism" because I'm literally referring to the fact that sexism overall has decreased and that was what I was saying by it getting "better". Maybe I worded that incorrectly.  I'd also disagree that I've benefitted from sexism but if you made that claim I'm glad to hear where you got that information about my personal life from.	1642774843.0	htlmo81	t3_s98lnd	t1_htlj43y	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htlmo81/

10rtib	I relate to the issues that you have with your father (which are really just his own issues that he needs to sort out). When I was 0-4, I was in a similar family dynamic to yours. My father is a violent alcoholic loser and I still remember what he subject my mum to. We got away, but unfortunately my mother got into another relationship with an even worse man 10 years later as well. I remember having the same fear that you mention when you think about having to move in with your mum and her new bf. The change when we moved in with my step-dad was absolutely terrifying because what if he turned out to be the same as my dad? In my case it turned out that he was even worse than my father, but you have to try to remember that there are so many more men that do turn out to be great father figures. The lack of trust towards guys kinda stays with me today, although I'm getting better at managing it. Hopefully you will be able to as well.  In regards to navigating your trauma alone and feeling fucked up, I want you to know that NOBODY is naturally equipped to handle these things alone. It's the situation, it isn't you. I know this doesn't fix your situation but I want you to know how much I respect you for sharing it. If you'd like to talk about anything, I'm open to that. I wish you the best and I hope you and your mum stay safe.	1642794627.0	htn36jj	t3_s9irco	t3_s9irco	/r/offmychest/comments/s9irco/i_have_to_move_in_with_my_mom_and_her_bf_to_get/htn36jj/

duql0z2l	Yeah that's super selfish. I have friends that are definitely against the vaccine and he has a government job too. The vaccine is required. My friend (his wife) was pissed when he decided he would get it to keep his job. He still hates it and hates that he had to get it. But he made the choice with his family and their future in mind. My friend sees that he made the choice for her and their kids.  It sucks that people are having to be forced into this. It really should be a choice and no one should have to decide to put something they don't trust into their body against their will basically. But here we are and some people have tough decisions.  I am for taking the vaccine if people want it but against the mandatory mandates for taking the vaccine.  I'm pro choice and everyone should have a right to their own body.  Sodenote: It's amazing to see the same people saying women should not have the right to their own body are the same people saying they should have rights to their own body against the masks and vaccine mandates.

58c9gafc	I think the only way we really get through it is by trusting in the governments are doing the right thing by giving us vaccines. Unfortunately the trust isn‚Äôt there by everyone which can be frustrating. While I do totally agree it should be a choice I do think they need to know the outcomes of that choice. We can‚Äôt live in a society where covid is such a killer virus. By lessening the effects it can be tolerable and we can carry on living as normal. The problem here is the way a lot of people have see it. The ‚Äúnot being entitled to the same as the vaccinated‚Äù or not being allowed in because of a mask. People who don‚Äôt want to get the vaccine should be thankful that others are to keep them safe. There‚Äôs lockdowns in some countries for unvaccinated people. There‚Äôs a divide happening I do agree but you do have to see sometimes it‚Äôs self inflicted. If you don‚Äôt want to be let go from a job because it requires a vaccine it‚Äôs up to you to find one that doesn‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt be going to a doctor that didn‚Äôt believe in washing their hands for instance.	1642800313.0	htniyqa	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnhfup	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htniyqa/

duql0z2l	Yep that's what I was seeing. Especially when Texas came out with their ruling. I called out a lot of people that I saw posting pro life/ anti abortion stuff a year prior. Then posting pro choice in regards to the mask mandates. The vaccine wasn't even a thing yet.  When Texas came out with their abortion law I asked them how can you support what Texas is doing but you were just posting my body my choice and saying the government should not control a person's body and what we do with it. IE not wearing masks and not taking the vaccine. One person did tell me they had changed their views on abortion becausethey did not belongthe vaccine should be forced.   People can be pro life and still support another person's right to have an abortion. But to completely say these are not comparable like others have said. It's the bottom line of "if you don't want the government making choices about what you do with your own body, it has to be overall not just to fit your agenda".	1642800857.0	htnkhd0	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htniiyr	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnkhd0/
duql0z2l	THIS IS FALSE. It has not stopped the spread. Most out breaks I have heard about were amongst the vaccinated spreading it to the vaccinated. There is an issue. This false information that the vaccinated are exempt from getting it and spreading it. They can get it just like an unvaccinated person and they can spread it just like an unvaccinated person.  The only thing they have found is that they spread it for shorter period of time but that doesn't stop the spread of they are seeing people and going into large gatherings without testing.	1642801080.0	htnl3z7	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnjiy3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnl3z7/

duql0z2l	What's the link, I would be interested in reading it?   I was just stating about people around me and my job. All my vaccinated friends have been getting it. They get it from another vaccinated person. Or they spread it to another vaccinated person.  At my job also the spread is amongst the vaccinated.   The reason being is that the vaccinated can go anywhere and just show their card or proof of vaccine and never be tested.

ieznpwxl	I'm still mad at him too, if i ever see him i'll smack the bullshit out of him. I have a problem with the people that inhabit this place, including him. How can someone be so worried about other shit to forget their son? Maybe that person shouldn't have been so worried about getting laid. The fatherless children rate is at an all-time high. And the mom's are just as much to blame, for picking a POS father for their child. Maybe they shouldn't have been so worried about getting laid too. This all comes back to having too much downtime. I don't understand why people are so blind, and have been so blind for so long. Multiple generations of people with their head in their ass, that's how we got where we are today. This country has been dog shit since it started, but the first president at least fought for what he believed in.	1642819249.0	htoup0x	t3_s9q6sh	t1_htoo7sp	/r/offmychest/comments/s9q6sh/us_needs_hard_times/htoup0x/

He had come into the vestibule of the dorm sometime either late at night or very early morning (I found him around 7:00a.m.) and passed away while leaning against a wall. I told the security guard inside the actual building, and he put his jacket over his head until people could get there.

c4fxufwn	Can we please have some sympathy for this man?  Your attitude is exactly what's creating the division that is responsible for 40% of our population being unvaccinated.  This guy was suddenly told in the past year by heavily biased scientists to take a vaccine known to cause allergic reactions and myocardititis or whatever it's called, that hasn't until recently been FDA approved, etc.  Yes, scientists are biased, I am one.  Maybe not as biased as individuals or the news but peer review is far from the perfect filter people hold it up to be.    Yes, he should get the vaccine.  But for God's sakes, have some respect for the fact that this guy is scared and angry.  Stop calling him an idiot.  People like you are the reason for COVID being as bad as it is.  If you'd approach vaccine hesitant people with understanding we'd have a lot fewer of them.  I am a scientist and have been triple vaccinated.  I also have a severe nut allergy and was extremely hesitant.

il1qxnb0	I was in the same situation in my senior year of high school - People in my class (who weren't even my friends) would ask me to text them the answers to the homework and stuff after class. At first I did because I felt like it was the nice thing to do, but they took advantage. It got annoying and when I vented about it to my close friends, they were angry on my behalf and told me I should set my foot down, so I finally did.  The next time those people asked for my homework, I said no and went on to explain that I don't exist to do the work for them, and honestly I was pretty pissed when I sent that message so I was pretty blunt. They were shocked but accepted it and never bothered me again, though they did act like I had "suddenly done a 180" and that I needed to "chill" but I didn't care. I was just relieved they stopped asking and guilt-tripping me into giving them my work. These people really sucked for other reasons (like cyberbullying, being patronizing to me all the time etc.) but I was so glad I finally set a boundary and told them off.  You may feel like a jerk/guilty when doing it but later on you really see that it was for the best and it's a confidence-booster honestly. So don't be afraid of saying no :) I used to say the small lies like "Oh I haven't done it yet" etc. but some people are dense or won't care and will still continue to bother you. Being blunt can be scary but from my experience (even after high school) it's been the best remedy to leeches lol.	1642861839.0	htqvca2	t3_s9krkg	t1_htoewu1	/r/offmychest/comments/s9krkg/i_love_to_make_people_feel_wanted_and_included_in/htqvca2/

cfo5wnze	It seems like he did it when I was drunk/drinking. The first time I was drinking  and I never had someone cum in me before so I didn‚Äôt know the feeling. With my first born I didn‚Äôt even know I was pregnant until 3 months later.  The most recent time, we were on a date so I was drinking as well. I don‚Äôt remember if there were other times.  All I remember was the first time and most recent.  To be honest I also wasn‚Äôt looking for signs that he was stealthing me (like condoms being on the floor) because  I believed this was someone I can trust.  I was just enjoying sex and the cuddling after.	1642863599.0	htqz5kb	t3_s9rcs8	t1_htq3nww	/r/offmychest/comments/s9rcs8/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_it/htqz5kb/

cfo5wnze	I‚Äôm honestly starting to believe he is a narcissist. I‚Äôm just waking up to everything now. My mind was clouded for all these years because I was dealing with grief and postpartum . It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm having this awakening yet I still don‚Äôt want to be with anyone else.

5ujyzpev	The same thing happened to me. I'm a male(22yrs old), and used to be the athletic guy who used to go out with the hottest girls at high school and college. I have hypothyroidism and went through a depressive period, which caused me to gain a lot of weight. Though i'm overweight, i'm still rather fit, but now every single male person that knew me when i was athletic points out how fat i've become. I've avoided to meet people from college and highschool for that same reason. Girls have never pointed out my weight gain though.	1642864550.0	htr19bu	t3_s9xuta	t3_s9xuta	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xuta/im_a_former_hot_girl_who_gained_weight_due_to_a/htr19bu/

cfo5wnze	It probably wont feel real for a long time. Mine has been gone 7 years and I‚Äôm still waiting for her to come home. I have constant dreams of her and I have to remind her that she has passed on. I think that‚Äôs my brain still fighting the thought of her being gone.   I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss ,I hope you can find peace in her not suffering anymore.  Grief is not an easy thing to deal with however I do wish your life gets filled with love and positivity.	1642865472.0	htr3daa	t3_s9mlrn	t3_s9mlrn	/r/offmychest/comments/s9mlrn/my_mum_just_died/htr3daa/
iwibxopv	Thank you for responding! I will certainly do both of these! I think it'll take time but we will slowly get through the slump	1642867373.0	htr7w86	t3_sa54xc	t1_htr74wm	/r/offmychest/comments/sa54xc/my_entire_relationship_was_a_lie_i_am_heartbroken/htr7w86/
iwibxopv	I am glad to read your bit about feeling dirty-I keep feeling so used and secondary but I know all of this is just a reflection of his behaviour. I did the best I could have done and never knew someone could do this and its nice to hear I wasn't silly for missing this either. It sounds silly but even with all the evidence I still thought there is no way he actually cheated because I had real built faith in him. Thank you for your wishes, I really appreciate that and I hope with time things look up!	1642867537.0	htr8aei	t3_sa54xc	t1_htr7dwj	/r/offmychest/comments/sa54xc/my_entire_relationship_was_a_lie_i_am_heartbroken/htr8aei/

iwibxopv	Thank you, I appreciate the response. I think time will help heal some of this for sure.

iwibxopv	That does make me feel better!! I kind of hope most of the missing him (or the version of him) goes by six months! I think the deeper wounds will take time. But hopefully by summer it should feel less intense.	1642868980.0	htrbspm	t3_sa54xc	t1_htrbfbn	/r/offmychest/comments/sa54xc/my_entire_relationship_was_a_lie_i_am_heartbroken/htrbspm/
