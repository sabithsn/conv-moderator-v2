b4jsi9bd	I don’t know if I made it clear but I was joking by saying it was “impossible”.   I already speak good French, have been learning it for 7+ years. It’s just now and again someone will correct me for using “un” instead of “une” which are albeit minor mistakes and I’m sure the average French speaker will be able to understand what I’m saying regardless of the stupid gender mistake. I just don’t think that no matter how long you’ve been learning French, as an English speaker, you will always have some difficulty of the French language from what I and my non native peers have experienced.

kmynr	Sorry for not explaining it clearly.  A simple example:  J'ai vu une maison et je l'ai achetée.  Here, the direct object of the verb acheter is the pronoun "la" (i.e., the house - feminine), so the participle is achetée instead of acheté.    (Contrast with "J'ai acheté une maison."  Here the direct object follows the verb so the participle doesn't agree with it in gender and number.)	1641609639.0	hrq73zm	t3_rynwti	t1_hrq3a3f	/r/French/comments/rynwti/agreement_with_preceding_direct_object_why_though/hrq73zm/

kmynr	Thanks for the article and your comment.   It's sent me down a rabbit-hole of interesting reading about Marot and I think the next step for me is to figure out why Italian is the way it is.

drtz5lxy	It's the reverse interestingly. In France the feminist movements want to habe gender specific words and in english they want to remove gender specific words. The difference arises due to french inherently having male/female le/la and them not wanting it to be dominated by males (le).	1642454802.0	ht394tc	t3_s69w4n	t1_ht38epa	/r/French/comments/s69w4n/is_lieutenant_always_masculine/ht394tc/

I'm telling you it's the opposite of what you know in english... doesn't seem logical to non french speakers as having every name designated male or female is a completely alien concept in english.	1642455339.0	ht3aiqu	t3_s69w4n	t1_ht39u7f	/r/French/comments/s69w4n/is_lieutenant_always_masculine/ht3aiqu/
