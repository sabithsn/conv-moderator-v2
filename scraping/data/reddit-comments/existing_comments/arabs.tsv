1otjig3y	Pretty impressive if you look at the failed attempts by other oil rich nations + nations with raw materials that chose massive corruption instead of investment in industry and normal people.  So yes it's impressive relative to the nations around it.   Your comment honestly sounds like cope.  Nation X is rich in X material, and capitalising on it is apparently so dumb right? Using foreign labour because your current workforce aren't equipt enough is bad somehow esp when you don't even have enough numbers even if they were skilled. Those dumb bedu should have stayed fishing and in tents right?  Those moves aren't a bad thing, yes the nature of how it's done can be bad like Kafala but most industrialised nations in the west went through this. The British with coal, and irish/Scots immigration into England during the industrial era etc.  Not to mention their 100x massive exploitative Imperial system they used in India and Africa that put their foot up front, all foreign labour. All.  Think Dubai has less of an abusive footprint compared to other nations who are idolised historically	1641475696.0	hrhl6ez	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhhr36	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhl6ez/

1otjig3y	Bad leadership and incompetent foreign policies that cost them more than reward them  Yes the US dominates the world. But like China, or any other nations your interest matter too, esp when it comes to prosperity.  Shitting on the US will cost you, make sure the cost isn't going to damage your people's livelihoods. That's good leadership.  Challenging an entity you know you'd be crushed by so you can look like a big dick (Saddam) isn't going to mean anything to the average person. Even if people say you shot rockets at Israel that one time that never landed anywhere.  I'm not a fan of the US but I'm not a fan of lower the standards of life and throwing people under the bus for the sake of looking Chad when you have no grounds to challenge.  For me what matters most is general people getting a good crack at life. Even if it means showing the US some good will, because the other dudes around the region aren't going to be nicer (Russia, Iran or China).	1641476703.0	hrhn8xf	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhmn0w	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhn8xf/

1otjig3y	Tourism, oil and gas is a whole industry in itself that the world relies on, without it you wouldn't type a reply to me, finance industry etc  They're the top in the region.  So they do have and there's no shame in oil and gas, esp other oil and gas nations that have better reserves and can't so anything with it (Algeria, Libya etc).  Dubai itself right now doesn't run on oil and gas anyway.  Abu Dhabi does and they're pretty good at it with ADNOC.	1641480488.0	hrhvxkh	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrht86o	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhvxkh/
1otjig3y	They don't but don't pretend they didn't know, esp the ones who did so because they miscalculated and thought they were winning brownie points with local people etc.  No one deserves to get bombed that's not my point, it's knowing you'll get bombed and ignoring it because you think you can desperately cling to power by challenging something bigger than you, we saw Saddam and Gaddafi try that and Libyans and Iraqis suffer for it, ultimately it's the US's fault but let's not pretend dictators don't rely on using them as a prop for support when they're failing in every other aspect etc.   As I said I'm not a US fan but what I hate most is those who risk their whole nation to try and cement power and it backfires miserably.  I don't want to starve because my countrys leader is using palestine as an excuse and suddendly mad about Imperialism (especially funny when his power relied on it at a point) so he risks our whole economy by shit fisting publicly for 3roobah points.  I just don't find these people appealing nor do I find transnational groups like Hezbollah appealing, who's whole mantra is resistance and pretending to be defensive and using the flag of Palestine to mow down Arabs in Yemen Iraq and Syria because if they don't like them they can easily label them as pro US therefore anti-palestine or Islam etc.	1641481178.0	hrhxmh4	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhpewn	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hrhxmh4/

exa0uq8q	You always insist to act as if you're super smart do you?  The Lindisfarne context is not idiotic ranting. It is perfectly correct. Europeans did not loot St. Catherine's monastery like the Vikings did at Lindisfarne.  Plundering implies violently robbing or stealing something. You could've said "duplicitously acquiring" or "taking and not returning" and have been correct.  You make it seems as if Europeans are Vikings in some ways or another. Or suggesting the conquest and Islamization of Egypt wasn't a more adequate definition of a violent political acquisition which could be described as plunder. Whether this is of course the case is beside the point. It would be a better descriptor.  Conversely, I can't imagine how many artefacts were plundered by Muslims or how many churches were turned into mosques or how many converts were scored through abusive practices. Not saying that this is unique to Islam mind you.	1641482183.0	hri04vz	t3_rwk70p	t1_hrh1sjf	/r/arabs/comments/rwk70p/lost_languages_discovered_in_one_of_the_worlds/hri04vz/

1otjig3y	It costs less to export it then refine most of it at home.  You know that right? You're asking them to export refined product thats worth less? That's the whole point in why ADNOC Aramco and such invest in methods to extract cheaper cleaner oil, to lower the price of production to sell.  Refining is important if you're selling to local markets or regional, like Saudi has Ras Tanura that mainly feeds products around ME and europe but it's more profitable to refine them in India/Pakistan ror the Chinese/Japan market.  Yes you should, which isn't such a huge say in how oil revenue is managed, some countries here can't even scale half their development to their production if you're going to ratio them with the UAE.  You clearly don't know much about oil esp when you think refining them is a smart movie as a producer	1641482471.0	hri0v13	t3_rwvnv0	t1_hrhzbbl	/r/arabs/comments/rwvnv0/dubai_in_1964_vs_dubai_in_the_2020s/hri0v13/

The absolute dripping butthurt you must be feeling to even bring this up out of context in a post about Europeans thieving historical artefacts from Egypt is just mind blowing. Are you crying right now? Are you sobbing into a pair of panties? Gargantuan levels of coping in here, wow  And I can't think of a more idiotic take than trying to argue about historical artefacts plundered from the Middle East during the colonial period. It shows some enormous levels of ignorance that it's unbelievable. Fucking France literally invaded Egypt to plunder its artefacts. The Rosetta stone is in London solely because the Brits captured a French ship full of goods they had very literally plundered from Egypt. Invading a country and making away with its historical artefacts is the definition of plunder. The Brits and French even stole ruins from Leptis Magna and then rebuilt them in London to look like authentic Roman ruins. Then some butthurt little weasel wants to correct my terminology to "duplicitously acquired". There are more Egyptian obelisks in Europe than in Egypt. See if you can guess how many of those were gifted or sold and how many simply stolen. Fucking duplicitously acquired!

65330	OP, I think you’re a good person. You come across as very young and naive, and that’s okay. Everyone starts somewhere. Perhaps you grew up in the kind of Muslim household that leads you to hate everything about your faith and your people. So long as you recognize that perhaps the error is in the way you were taught Islam, you may one day be open to recognizing that your issues aren’t with the religion, but within yourself. I have many friends that I’ve brought back to the religion just by explaining to them Islam as it was meant to be taught. I suggest you find what you specifically dislike about Islam and study it. You may come to a place of understanding and a renaissance where your eyes open. Or you may not. Both are possible, but at least worst case scenario, you walk away with an even stronger conviction. That aside:  More or less, everyone is telling you the same thing. It’s unlikely that *everyone* is wrong except you. Everything you described can be done islamically. I, too, want an educated wife and no kids. I, too, want to travel with said wife and explore the beauties of life together. And what is a feminist, anyway, these days? Most of the time, husbands and wives do the same work for each other under the same household. I have a good friend and brother of mine, a Syrian, who is married to an African Muslim woman. He helps wash the dishes, watch the kids, and so on. His wife is in her PhD program and he is finishing his Masters; educated, sophisticated Muslim family. Is that what you mean by feminism? If so, then congratulations, you’ll find it almost everywhere even amongst Arab men. But if by feminism you mean the Western flavor, what’s the appeal? Westerners themselves are marrying more and more Latinas, Africans, and Asian women that prescribe to more traditional roles than their own compatriots. Believe me, it isn’t as “rosy” as you may think it is.  Besides that, everything you want can be done within the bounds of good taste. Will I be okay with my wife not wearing the hijab? It’s her choice. Will I be okay with her being half naked on the beach? Hell no. Do I want my future wife educated and sophisticated? That’s a requirement. Will we be bound by cultural norms and values? Yeah, as is every relationship. Arabism is one of the most beautiful cultures there are. But that isn’t synonymous with whatever you’re describing. Ironically enough, you’re glamorizing Western culture when they tend to have significant domestic abuse, alcoholism, incredibly stupid gender roles, and so many other traits that you seem to prescribe to your own people.  Anyways, this was a long post. My point is to relax, ya OP, oo تهدي بل رحمٰن. You think you’re open minded but you really aren’t. Be more open minded and learn to listen and inshallah you’ll find what you’re looking for.  Allah oo Mo7ammed oo Ali wiyach.  My point is: relax و صلي على النبي و آل النبي. What you’re seeking can be found but only if you’re reasonable.	1641525494.0	hrl5fko	t3_rwwsim	t3_rwwsim	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrl5fko/

8g2fp9gl	I didn't say that. Obviously it would be nice if there was a heaven, but that doesn't make your purpose in life any more "meaningful". It is still something imposed in you. It is like someone forced you to play a dangerous game and told you if you win i will give you cake everyday. Obviously cake is nice, but i would rather not play at all or play a game i chose.  On the other hand, you don't feel anything when dead; you're dead. You live life, choose your own purpose, and try to enjoy it and then that's it.	1641561423.0	hrmrv87	t3_rx0pr1	t1_hrkewyp	/r/arabs/comments/rx0pr1/درر_المخارج_في_العامي_والدارج_نقاش_حر_بالعربي/hrmrv87/

I met my now husband online, and he's my support and my best friend.  I want to say that your post does come across as angry and a bit condescending. And whereas I understand where the anger comes from, it's better to try and address it. What you're asking for in a partner is actually very reasonable, don't let anyone tell you otherwise, but maybe it's the delivery. Don't lose hope, don't settle. We live in a patriarchal society, but Arab men who see their wives as partners and not property do exit. I wish I had advice to give, as I used to live in an Arab country and know how hard it is. But maybe your best bet is to explore your options online.	1641599777.0	hrpk4f9	t3_rwwsim	t3_rwwsim	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrpk4f9/

You might not escape this Arabo-consnervative atmosphere that you find so nauseating because Ayrabs are everywhere, but you can practice  your freedoms more openly and easily. I am the opposite of you, a conservative traditionalist, but I can never deny the level of dysfunction  that our societies suffer from. It is bad for liberals and conservatives alike. Just *Get Out* of there and you'll definitely find that someone. I personally think Palestinians in general are much more liberal than most other Arab countries.	1641624112.0	hrqz02y	t3_rwwsim	t1_hrphvz2	/r/arabs/comments/rwwsim/im_an_arab_woman_looking_to_date_someone_from_my/hrqz02y/

Other common annoying translation mistakes include misgendering words, messing up the maaany plural forms, phrasing that is pointlessly long because the translator is "thinking in English" and lacks the right vocabulary (ex: الكمبيوتر الخاص بك vs حاسوبك).	1641634255.0	hrrcodj	t3_ryvw0v	t3_ryvw0v	/r/arabs/comments/ryvw0v/a_questionnaire_for_arabian_gamers_about/hrrcodj/

9k3699ws	He’s possibly referring to their ethnic phenotype or whatever. I think he does at one point show the whole Arab world with Middle East and North Africa as all assimilated into Arab identity. He says how South Arabians aren’t “ethnically Arab” as in they’re originally something else like Egyptians, Sudanis and Maghrebis. But I do get what you’re saying.   The thing is ethnic identity has to do with language and culture. What people like his channel are looking at is science like genetics, which can help explain identity, but isn’t the basis for it. Separating people based on genetics is pretty stupid. But people like to look at genetics and human migrations because I guess it’s a fun though experiment.	1641965133.0	hsbahpu	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsb6oup	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsbahpu/

3j3dj	Oh my god so much of this video is just confidently expressed conjecture and nonsense. Haplogroup J doesn't originate in the Arabian peninsula. It originates in the Caucasus or Eastern Anatolia. Some put it as far south as Mesopotamia. There are no adequate studies of South Arabians or Yemenis or Omanis that would allow us to confidently claim anything, especially that 80% of Modern South Arabians belong to J. Then he makes confident claims about the phenotypes of South Arabians as if he has visited southern Yemen himself or as if there's a phenotype database somewhere. He also claims they share "slim noses" like their neighbouring Arabs. Ok? Having been to Oman, I can tell you that lots of Arabs do not have "slim noses". At 7:00 he shows a photo of a typical South Arabian looking guy who is neither dark nor has a slim nose. This is garbage pseudoscience. It's like you can say any outdated nonsense you want if you add the word "phenotype" to it.  And where is he getting this claim that Mehris don't have African admixture like other Yemenis? Who has published these studies? I literally just saw [a Mehri guy online](https://twitter.com/AlmehriAman/status/1478120131209441280?t=A5ZWAbNlD9AoBFyVv9W_ug&s=19) who is not J and is mostly East African. Nearly all of his sources are blogs, not actual studies. He only cites 1 study. It's about Soqotra and is from 2009, a millennium in the timeframe of genetic studies. What's funny is that that study found Qataris, Omanis, Emaratis to be closer to Egyptians, Lebanese, and Tunisians, than to Soqotris. Nevertheless people insist on using Modern South Arabians as a sample for "pure" Arabian peninsula genetics.	1641977152.0	hsbryf1	t3_s1wnaj	t3_s1wnaj	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsbryf1/

However, there is a phenotype specific to South Arabians just as there is to Egyptians, Maghrebis, Mesopotamians, etc. The thing is there’s a big niche on anthropology of people who like to examine genotypes for some weird reason. I prefer to read up history. Historically, this region spoke many South Semitic languages until today. Much of them are not appreciated and unfortunately are dying. Genotypes are a weird obsession online.

cu0szb3y	The vast majority of the Mahra don’t have Bantu or Horner ancestry.They are the purest population in Southern Arabia at this moment especially when it compared to the Arabic speaking Yemenis and obviously the heavily Bantu admixed Omanis  They are just darker on average then other Arabians but that doesn’t mean anything as skin tone has little to do with how much West Eurasian a population carries.Look at the Maghrebis who are way more African shifted then Arabians with 20% West African & ANA ancestry yet are much lighter in complexion on average.  Also the Mahra have lower Anatolian Farmer ancestry compared to Yemeni groups like the Yemenite Jews,folks from Amran etc.They are far more Natufian/Arabian hunter-gatherer rich	1642010386.0	hsdk6vq	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsbryf1	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsdk6vq/

3j3dj	> However, there is a phenotype specific to South Arabians just as there is to Egyptians, Maghrebis, Mesopotamians, etc.  There's no phenotype specific to South Arabians or for any population. Where have you ever read a scientific paper published on facial phenotypes in countries? There are a thousand phenotypes in every country. It's not a science, it's like 18th century skull measuring. There is an enormously broad range of phenotypes within any Arab country.

3j3dj	What are your sources for these claims? Aren't you the person who was just telling me last week that you use Mehris as a proxy population for the Arabian peninsula? The sources in the video above specifically identify them (or rather Soqotris) as outlier populations compared to other khaleejis. Even their y-haplogroup, basal J*, has never been found in the GCC. The study cited in the video specifically says: "Since this lineage was not found by Cadenas et al. (2008) in the Arabian Peninsula, this raises the possibility of an earlier input for these lineages or more probably very strong genetic drift of a low frequency Arabian lineage in the Y-chromosome gene pool of Soqotra."   So why the hell would you use them as representatives of khaleejis??  Yemenis and Omanis are among the most admixed populations in the Middle East with Africans. So it stands to reason that Mehris are also mixed. "Purest" is a nonsense term. It's not a scientific term. Yemenis in general actually have more sub-Saharan African Mtdna lineages [than any other Arab country](blob:null/88e00ccd-1a8e-4c02-941c-f21ca93f33d0). More than double that of Morocco. (Although these are all highly spurious data since there are no decent or recent studies of Yemen to begin with). Hadhramaut is infamous for having 60% of all its Mtdna lineages be sub-saharan African, and Hadhramaut is in eastern Yemen near the Mehri homeland. According to wikipedia, the sub-saharan macro-haplogroup L subclades make up 21.5% of all Mehri mtdna lineages. That means they are just as mixed with Africans as any other Arabs.	1642015286.0	hsdxbzz	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsdk6vq	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsdxbzz/

Every single academic source states that Arabs settled most heavily along the coast of North Africa. You think they only settled the Sahara desert before you don't read anything and base everything on childish stereotypes.

Not J1. Do you even understand what that means? It wasn't found anywhere else in the Arabian peninsula. We're not talking about a subclade you moron.   You are in here arguing that the Mehris are autosomally the "purest" people in the Arabian peninsula, and therefore representative of them all, when their paternal lineages are completely distinct from the rest of the Arabian peninsula and a quarter of their maternal lineages are sub-Saharan African.	1642022527.0	hsegq98	t3_s1wnaj	t1_hsdz8x8	/r/arabs/comments/s1wnaj/modern_south_arabians_a_demographic_anomaly/hsegq98/

ovqdzum	That's why Rumi said don't escape but face them. Sit with them, you'll realise it's only in your head, once you see that then you are free from them. That's why I. Tasawuf there is this thing called muragaba which is watching the thoughts and going within yourself to understand why you have these desires or fears. If you wait for someone to make you happy then you are relying on others to help you escape your thoughts temporarily, but you'll soon realise no matter how many people are around you, you are essential alone on this path called life, that's why when things get hard not many people stick around to help.you out. It's good to have friend and people to love yes, but you have to know that Allah gave you the power to decide to be happy or sad, it's all up to you and no one else. Look withing.

9k3699ws	No. He had no other choice. Kuwait could have worked with Saddam to settle their debt that Iraq took on to fight Iran sacrificing hundreds of thousands saving Kuwait as well in the process. But no, the Kuwaiti royal family were snobs and expected Iraq who literally sacrificed everything fighting Iran to pay back in full and on top of that over producing the oil keeping the price low screwing Iraq over in process AND refusing to renegotiate the border issue that Iraq wanted settled. You living in the west or probably some pampered life wouldn’t know about struggle, so your naive comment doesn’t surprise me. So no, Saddam’s actions on Kuwait was inevitable. And funny enough, all the debt Kuwait could have forgiven Saddam for, Kuwait paid double to the Americans to save them. 👍	1642148425.0	hsls767	t3_s35aq9	t1_hslr6m0	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsls767/

Colonial/postcolonial countries all across MENA leaned towards the USSR or nonaligment for ideological reasons (except for the various monarchies, which had already been bought by the west); regardless of America's recognition in 1948, Israel, as a colony in need of an imperial backer, would've always been a natural american ally once the cold war intensified.	1642156467.0	hsm2ldp	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsjmz62	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsm2ldp/

f6avfqpv	I don't really agree.   The United States was the first country to recognize Israel after it declared its independence. The first country to do so was actually the USSR. At the time, Stalin felt that Israel would be a "natural" ally of the USSR because the vast majority of Israel's early elite political leaders subscribed to the ideology of Labor Zionism, which was a form of Zionism fused with socialist economic beliefs. Israel did not have a PM who did not belong to the Labor Party until the late 1970s, 30 years into the country's existence. On top of that, Stalin believed that many European Ashkenazi Jews would be grateful towards the USSR for stopping the Holocaust.   What really brought Israel and the US together, IMO, was Israel's relationship with the UK and France, who were America's key Cold War allies. And what brought Israel together with the UK and France was Nasser.	1642160390.0	hsm7xvu	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsm2ldp	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsm7xvu/
9muiw	>What really brought Israel and the US together, IMO, was Israel's relationship with the UK and France, who were America's key Cold War allies. And what brought Israel together with the UK and France was Nasser.  Yes, Cold War politics. This is the part that's inevitable - and the fact that the USSR was even quicker to support Israel, and many Israeli politicians had ties to european socialist movements, and yet Israel STILL fell into America's orbit, is exactly proof of what I'm saying. "Labor Zionism" was impossible, because social classes reorganized, and split between colonist and colonized(same thing happened in French Algeria btw; commies/anarchists who wind up exiled there more often than not became settler activists, and the french communists were loathe to admit algerian members). Further, the "internationalist" sentiment of arab nationalism/anticolonialism, and the natural distrust of the west shared by all colonized peoples, means the "Second World," and especially the "Third World" blocs were much more attractive to the people of MENA than the "First World." The dynamics are totally reverse in Israel, whose status as a settler colony puts it directly at odds with the USSR's/the Third World Movement's professed egalitarianism/internationalism.     Essentially, the "Third World" demanded wealth and land redistribution after colonialism; Israel and the US share a goal of stopping that redistribution, and the USSR (regardless of actual ideological convictions of the party/its leaders) stood to gain by supporting those demands. The mechanics of history and the nature of US and Israeli society drove them together more than any one discrete event, especially a discrete event post WWII.	1642162432.0	hsmb25n	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsm7xvu	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmb25n/
f6avfqpv	But that's not actually how it happened in practice. In reality it was balance-of-power politics during the Cold War, not ideology, that resulted in Israel being within the American orbit.  The stuff about settler colonialism and so forth is really just importing the way the conflict is framed now onto events that occurred 50+ years ago, when it was not described in those terms.	1642163197.0	hsmcbf8	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmb25n	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmcbf8/
9muiw	>But that's not actually how it happened in practice. In reality it was balance-of-power politics during the Cold War, not ideology, that resulted in Israel being within the American orbit.  That's what I'm saying to you. Whether George Marshall or Truman believe X or Y is irrelevant, even if it changes some discrete political event, because America and Israel shared concrete interests, which would inevitably bring them together, regardless of "Labor Zionism," the result of a given US election, etc. "The stuff about settler colonialism and so forth" is me explaining the interests they shared (which weren't totally unknown at the time; the General Jewish Labor Bund was a socialist organization that was also anti-Zionist, and anti-imperialist language was common among some leftists at the time, from Luxemburg, to Lenin, even to James Connolly in Ireland), and why these interest go deeper than the professed ideologies of particular politicians.	1642164134.0	hsmdwli	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmcbf8	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmdwli/
f6avfqpv	"Settler colonialism" is a parallel about the histories of the two countries, it is not a concrete geopolitical interest. And by 1948, virtually no Americans thought of the United States as a "settler colony" in any meaningful sense. They'd have said "well, that was true on the Western Frontier in the 1860s but that's about as relevant to today as the age of powdered wigs and pantaloons." Nor did any American political leader believe that their job was to "maintain settler colonialism" in the United States. It makes no sense to say that the US "shared an interest" with Israel in this sense.   In reality, much more influential politically were (a) the fact that Nasser sought support from the USSR, because the USSR was an adversary of Britain when Britain was Egypt's chief geopolitical foe due to the Suez issue, and (b) the influence of the organized Zionist lobby in the United States, which President Eisenhower and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, repeatedly stated acted against the best interests of the United States.	1642165621.0	hsmgldj	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmdwli	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsmgldj/

9muiw	I called israel a settler colony, and said it shared interests with the US in arresting any more equitable distribution of land/wealth among the colonized/ex colonized people of the world. All the talk about whether the US is/was also a settler colony, what americans think of colonies, etc you invented on your own, bit freudian there my friend    >much more influential politically were (a) the fact that Nasser sought support from the USSR, because the USSR was an adversary of Britain when Britain was Egypt's chief geopolitical foe due to the Suez issue, and (b) the influence of the organized Zionist lobby in the United States    A is explained by Egypt's postcolonial status, and B, by the shared interest I mentioned last paragraph. I also don't think The Israel Lobby acts against America's interest, I think that's a way to shift the blame onto Israel (and, imo, jews). We can see how America reacted to other postcolonial, vaguely leftist countries and leaders for proof - it wasn't the Israel Lobby that got us to back a military coup and mass killing of Communists in Indonesia or Chile, for example, lol.	1642167864.0	hsml62z	t3_s35aq9	t1_hsmgldj	/r/arabs/comments/s35aq9/time_traveling/hsml62z/

That's up to u in the end, but I think you know that there is profanity filters even for WORDS in many online games so we should label the devs as Muslims? Dude stop with this mentality.  Kids play as well and not every parents accept that his 12 yo kid sees a naked man/woman or wants to see blood or other things that's why you got age ratings for video games and filters in place to even turn off blood.

Beautiful irony.	1642172717.0	hsmwgnk	t3_s31a5c	t1_hsirotq	/r/arabs/comments/s31a5c/bono_moroccos_nt_goalkeeper_is_mad_at_the/hsmwgnk/

9k3699ws	Who said Kuwait should not be paid? You keep resorting to things I never said lol. Explain to me how is it fair for a county whose ass is saved by another country expect the other country to repay the money while at the same time keeping the price of oil down which is the main source of income? And where did I mention that Kuwait should be invaded? Those borders are disputed. Kuwait will remain. I can clearly tell who you are just by your lack of understanding of the whole geopolitical situation. You think of this as giving your friend lunch money and expecting it back. No. That’s not the same. Iraq lost 500,000 soldiers and a hurt economy while fighting a war Kuwait was desperate Iraq would win. Now that Iraq guaranteed their safety, Kuwait overproduces the oil and doesn’t engage to solve the issue? Clearly I mentioned that Saddam should not have taken the whole Kuwait. That’s dumb. The border region was reasonable because that was already in dispute and Saddam exhausted EVERYTHING to bring the Kuwaitis to the table and they refused. Like I said, this isn’t lunch money you give to your friend and expect them to pay it back.

1tbtx4f7	I can understand your idea that Kuwait has a duty to help Iraq after the war as the war helped Kuwait but I don't agree as the war would have happened either way as the main reason was that Iran was a huge threat to Iraq, so Kuwait being safe from Iran wasn't a main reason for the war so Kuwait doesn't have a responsibility to help Iraq after the war. If you could prove that the war wouldn't have happened without Kuwait then I would agree with you.

9k3699ws	Nobody has any responsibility to help anyone. Everyone has self interest. But if your interest is to strengthen the Arab nation as an Arab against regional rivals, then engaging with a reasonable plan to solve the debt issue with an Arab neighbor who sacrificed so much against that regional rival (Iran) so you wouldn’t be surrounded by them. Then you ask:   > so Kuwait being safe from Iran wasn't a main reason for the war so Kuwait doesn't have a responsibility to help Iraq after the war.   Iran was destroying Kuwaiti oil tankers. If Iraq lost the war, Kuwait would have a border with Iran if not be surrounded by them. If Kuwait was so safe, why was Kuwaiti government so scared? You seriously know little on this topic it seems.  > If you could prove that the war wouldn't have happened without Kuwait then I would agree with you. Also you’re poor  If only Saddam let Iran take Kuwait and see how you would like that situation. Lol. “You’re poor.” I knew you’re pampered. Once the oil price goes down, you’re irrelevant.

7lrof8uq	Don't know where you got your info from but your info about Oujda is completely wrong. The dialect is not the same as even Tlemcen. Only the dialect spoken in Maghnia, cause it was Moroccan, sounds like Oujdi. And culturally it's not a continuation of western Algeria. Even though Amazigh is not widely spoken there, the culture there is the same as in Berkane. You could call it eastern rifian. Only difference is that there are more arab tribes around Oujda.	1642370130.0	hsyepwo	t3_s5arma	t1_hswlsnb	/r/arabs/comments/s5arma/موسيقى_المغرب_الأقصى_حسب_المناطق_لائحة_غير_حصرية/hsyepwo/

kbbvo	I wouldn't say your face looks feminine, you just look rather boyish and "adolescenty." It might also help to think more about grooming and styling. The beard helps to masculinize your face, but it's also scruffy and thin in some spots so growing it out makes your face look messy. Having a well groomed and styled face can help you look more mature and masculine. I think you look best in pictures 8 and 10. Your beard is short but it helps to make your face pop and gives some more definition to your face.	1642399635.0	ht09m7g	t3_s5pgh0	t1_hszef9c	/r/arabs/comments/s5pgh0/monday_majlis_open_discussion/ht09m7g/

3j3dj	One of the things making me lose my faith in humanity is following Arab groups on social media that are interested in genetics. It's non-stop shit fest 24/7. Even the accounts themselves can see it. Check out [this meme](https://twitter.com/Archeoanthropo/status/1482348819220160518?s=20).   You have these massive arguments about who is really Qahtani and who is a dirty immigrant. You have groups dedicated to specific tribes banning people and shaming them for belonging to different paternal branches and then trying to find out "the original" branch of that tribe. You have others [building family trees based on  y-dna](https://www.facebook.com/groups/genomena/posts/1252287371848974/). All these ppl [accusing each other](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJLJO2uWYAEsBLM?format=jpg&name=large) of being Zagros Iranians or Afro-Abyssinian-Berbers don't have the required historical context to understand that these are haplogroups that emerged 20 to 40 *thousand* years ago. Then you get tweets that [literay say](https://twitter.com/ArabEM35/status/1482444501499138051?s=20):  في الاخير "E" المنتصر   The thing is that 99.9% of these people do not understand that autosomal results only pertain to less than 10 generations back. Some Jordanian guy msged me because i left a comment somewhere, and i told him i think his haplogroup is from southern Europe, and he got furious with me and sent me an image of his autosomal results.

8eqky01c	Operation Wealth had a successful first year. I clocked in 2,900 hours last year at my job for a gross total of 261k. (Commission Job). Worked essentially 7 days a week. And this was done with me legitimately starting my role in March. So 2 months weren’t fully at play. I still ended 5th out of 2,000 people in my region. And that includes all the vets that have been there for years.   I made way more $$ than I had anticipated. I have 120k in liquid cash. The next steps of the operation is to get into real estate. Apartment buildings specifically for now.   But first I put an offer on a home friday that is a triplex (3-unit home). The home got appraised for 350k and I offered 275k, just waiting to hear back today. Reason this is important is because I don’t plan on being stuck on the small side of real estate forever. A lot of guys buy 1-4 unit homes one at a time before finally moving to apartments after a decade. Reason this triplex im buying is key, is because it’s actually giving me access to more capital I can tap into. I can open a line of credit against the home for 50k+ because of the fact the home appraised for 350k and has built in equity. Also, I’m only putting 3.5% down, so only 10k of my reserves is being used. Reason I don’t need to put the normal 20-25% down is because any property that is 1-4 units can be qualified under a primary home loan if you plan to live there. So its a way to get the benefit of an investment property without putting the 20% down payment. 2 tenants already live there as well, and they will cover the mortgage. Living for free. Anyone can do this, but 99.9% won’t because you are trading comfortability for profitability.   So, the plan is buy that home. Get a line of credit for as much as I can. Take my cash reserves and put it into a crypto bank that can collect 10% APY. Cash in a traditional savings account is a waste. And finally im going to keep printing as much capital as possible at my job, while actively setting time aside to search for apartment deals. Which I already began.   I’m doing it yall. I will reach my goal.	1642451252.0	ht2zypo	t3_s5pgh0	t3_s5pgh0	/r/arabs/comments/s5pgh0/monday_majlis_open_discussion/ht2zypo/

19pfx66a	What's the problem ? There are indeed eminent Arab actors like Ghassen Massoud, Aysha Hart, Lamis Ammar and Sami Bouajila and the story seems to be good and it's really cool that they picked an Arab country as their filming location.  OP reminds of those Greeks who disliked 300 just because it wasn't filmed in Greece even though the movie paints Greeks as the ultimate heroes who are fighting humanoid demons and "a thousand nations descend upon them".  I hope the movie turns out to be a great international movie because it'll help to destroy the wrong stereotypes about Arabs and gives a new, better image and spreads the Arab culture to the world.	1642491078.0	ht5fwsb	t3_s6jlbk	t3_s6jlbk	/r/arabs/comments/s6jlbk/hollywood_and_saudi_arabia_teaming_up_to_produce/ht5fwsb/

z7om4	> It’s 7th century, when Arabia is made up of rival, feuding tribes, disunited and forever at each other’s throats. Emperor Kisra (Kingsley) has a fearsome reputation for being utterly ruthless. But when the Arabian Princess Hind (Hart) refuses to become the emperor’s concubine, the stage is set for an epic confrontation. It is a battle that, by its conclusion, will have changed the region forever and echo throughout history. Escaping with her father, King Numan (Massoud) into the vast and unforgiving desert, Hind is pursued by Kisra’s seasoned mercenary Jalabzeen and his bloodthirsty troops.   Wth? Lol this is the most orientalist plot possible. "Middle Eastern man doesn't take no for an answer, starts war specifically to rape this one chick".  Are the Saudis in it because Kisra is Iranian?

I'm much less likely to play a video game with overly sexualised female characters though. It's not even sex itself that bothers me, it's the girls dressed like a porn version of their own character.

o484e	Or one movie where the Arabs are shown as human. The only movie that was close to showing the good side of Arabs in the 21st century is Kingdom of Heaven, but even then, the idea of showing Sallahudeen in a film was already being done by director Moustapha Akkad who unfortunately was killed before getting to make it.  Besides that, Arabs are always shown as the antagonists, the servants or at most portrayed in an unflattering light. And today, they technically don't exist in Hollywood despite the Zionists preaching 'diversity'.	1642527372.0	ht7a6g7	t3_s6jlbk	t1_ht64hhl	/r/arabs/comments/s6jlbk/hollywood_and_saudi_arabia_teaming_up_to_produce/ht7a6g7/

11i6en	as usual, the discussion is never about the content but about the dumbest possible thing you can find in his statement. No one gives a shit about Mao, what he says is correct. Arabs have neglected the importance of our art and culture for so long. The thing that still pisses me off is how dogshit our television shows are and our non existstant movies.   Now we're moving to an era where western companies will come in to fill the void and portray us in a light that isn't very accurate or favourable but because they make it (in terms of cinematography, editing, etc) better than us and have and have a much better distribution they wills shape our popular culture in the decades to come.	1642532800.0	ht7ozia	t3_s6tgrb	t3_s6tgrb	/r/arabs/comments/s6tgrb/ختام_مقال_لغسان_كنفاني_بعنوان_إنقاذا_لكرامتنا/ht7ozia/

z7om4	Lmao life expectancy under his rule literally doubled. By the time the Brits and Japanese were gone Chinese life expectancy was *35 years.*  China alone was 1/4 of humanity on just 10% of the world's arable land with frequent droughts, and infrastructure that fell into disrepair under colonial rule. They had only one last famine in the early days post-revolution. Compared to [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines_in_China)  >Between 108 BC and 1911 AD, there were no fewer than 1,828 recorded famines in China, or once nearly every year in one province or another. The famines varied in severity.\[1\]\[2\] China has endured six of the world's top ten deadliest natural disasters, including the top three  Imagine a famine literally every year for the last 2,000 years (the USSR was very similar) and it's the last one in it's history that you blame. Arabs are not allowed to regurgitate imperialist propaganda. Not after the lies on Iraq and Palestine.  If china got sykes-Pico'ed like Western countries **wanted and already planned** into 20 starving countries all the time, we'd be taking it for granted that "it's just like that" and they're doomed to starve, the way we think of Africa today.	1642541945.0	ht8dwoc	t3_s6tgrb	t1_ht6705q	/r/arabs/comments/s6tgrb/ختام_مقال_لغسان_كنفاني_بعنوان_إنقاذا_لكرامتنا/ht8dwoc/

Lebanese producers have also put out some very good film/TV. Not to mention some quality shows from the 5aleej.   There many, many new independent Arab artists that are pumping out innovative & authentic music of all genres, only now starting to get exposure.  There is soo much potential and the state of our entertainment industry is inadequate at best, but I feel like you’re being somewhat unfair. We just need more deliberate, coordinated efforts on local, regional, and Arab World levels.  The Mao comparison certainly does not foster a sensible discussion.

236n78qc	Baswd on my experience in the witcher wild hunt, just cause 3 and far cry 5 I think the following will lead to optimal translation:  First: use fusha always, im as an egyptian read newspapers, books and websites in fusha as the dilect in egypt itself differs from place to place.  Second: never translate from the english script, niether translate the words or expressions them selves, you must reproduce the script in the arabic culture. You should read arab literature to achieve this,  people like nageeb mahfouz, mahmoud darwish,  nizar qbbani and abou alqasem elshabi.

3j3dj	As a rule, these articles are always confused about the issue of bedouins.  "these roads would have led Bedouin people and their animals to water"  Then 2 paragraphs later:  "The sheer number of Bronze Age tombs built around them suggests that populations had already begun to settle more permanently in these favorable locations at this time."  Yes, because these were settled people living around oases.  "By bouncing from one oasis or desert spring to another, ancient Bedouins could traverse much larger areas in search for better lands and climates"  Again: these are people trading with one another, conquering one another. Like any other place on earth. They're not "bedouins". Many of these burials won't even be the ancestors of modern Arabians. Humans were crossing through Arabia and into Arabia throughout this period, and like most other places on earth, Arabia saw an enormous demographic revolution in the Bronze Age. If these burials are "prehistoric" then most will be earlier than the domestication of the camel.	1642597250.0	htb9edy	t3_s7cuap	t3_s7cuap	/r/arabs/comments/s7cuap/spectacular_lost_highways_of_ancient_arabia/htb9edy/

But you can have some characters have some traits of marked dialects depending on their environments.  leventine, alexandrian, egyptian saeidi, badouin, tunisian, sudani, etc... it would make it. Bug only traits, like, zoul from sudani, barsha from tunisian Zalameh from leventine. Not making them speak the actual dialect all the time. That's how theh do it in dragin quest. They just change some words tk italian, spanish, french. Etc...	1642597458.0	htb9rxx	t3_s7ixyb	t3_s7ixyb	/r/arabs/comments/s7ixyb/translating_games_into_arabic/htb9rxx/

g12rh7	English article from the nytimes:  The Syrian doctor tortured detainees — opponents of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad — by beating them with sticks and kicking them, and even set one on fire, German prosecutors say. In one instance, they allege, he killed a prisoner with a lethal injection. The accusations against Dr. Alaa Mousa — at least 18 charges of torture and one of murder committed between April 2011 and the end of the 2012 — amount to crimes against humanity, German prosecutors will seek to prove in Dr. Mousa’s long-awaited trial, which began on Wednesday in Frankfurt. The proceedings started less than a week after German prosecutors won a guilty verdict in the world’s first trial prosecuting state-sponsored torture in Syria. Dr. Mousa, is accused targeting Assad opponents in military facilities. According to one charge, he doused the testicles of a teenage boy with alcohol and set him ablaze in a military hospital in the summer of 2011.  With this and other cases, Germany has emerged at the forefront of prosecutions against Syrian government officials.  In the case that ended last Thursday, a former intelligence officer was convicted in Koblenz, Germany, of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison — a verdict welcomed by human rights lawyers as a milestone in the search for accountability for war crimes in Syria. Dr. Mousa was not in as high a position of power as the intelligence officer, Anwar Raslan, who oversaw the torture of prisoners in a detention center. But indictment for his alleged role in Syrian military facilities was “a clear signal that Germany takes this fight against impunity very seriously and it will continue to commit itself to the international criminal justice system,” said Stefanie Bock, the director of the International Research and Documentation Center for War Crimes Trials at the University of Marburg in Germany. It demonstrated, she added, that last week’s verdict was not a “once-in-a-lifetime event.”  Image  Credit...Constantn Zinn/EPA, via Shutterstock  The trial of Dr. Mousa is expected to shed further light on abuses committed by the Syrian government during the ongoing conflict, and on mistreatment in the medical system, said Roger Lu Phillips, the legal director of the Syria Justice & Accountability Center in Washington D.C., which interviewed several witnesses involved in the case.  “In Koblenz, we saw glimpses of the mistreatment of the Syrian government within the hospital system,” said Mr. Phillips, adding that this case would offer more insights into such abuses. The challenge for German prosecutors, Mr. Phillips said, was that they would have to prove Dr. Mousa was acting under the direction or orders of the Syrian government for the accusations to be considered crimes against humanity. If convicted, Ms. Bock said, it was “almost mandatory” that Dr. Mousa would receive a life sentence. An assistant doctor who served in military facilities in Damascus, Syria’s capital, and the central city of Homs, Dr. Mousa stands accused of kicking and punching detainees in the head, torso and groin, and operating on someone without sufficient anesthetic. After one prisoner in Homs protested against a beating, prosecutors say, Dr. Mousa restrained the man and injected him with a substance that killed him. Dr. Mousa left Syria in 2015, alongside about a million other refugees who crossed into Europe, and settled in Germany, where he worked in a hospital in the city of Kassel. He was arrested in June 2020 after other Syrian refugees who recognized him reported him to the authorities. “This is quite shocking: the idea that someone who might have committed heinous torture has practiced as a doctor in a German setting,” said Ms. Bock. For many in Germany, the case of Dr. Mousa conjured memories of the Nazi regime, when doctors worked in concentration camps as part of the torture and genocide machinery. Initially, the Frankfurt higher regional court only accepted some of the charges. After federal prosecutors appealed to Germany’s Federal Court of Justice, that court ruled on Tuesday that all charges included in the initial indictment would be heard.  Human rights lawyers have begun seeking justice for victims of the Syrian government through the legal concept of “universal jurisdiction,” which holds that any nation’s courts can try people for grave atrocities committed anywhere. In the absence of avenues through the International Criminal Court in The Hague or a special war tribunal established by the United Nations, universal jurisdiction cases offer “a last bastion of justice” for many Syrian victims, Mr. Phillips said. Rights groups say that prosecuting less prominent offenders like Dr. Mousa is crucial in identifying witnesses and building an evidentiary record that might some day be used against higher-ranking officials. But prosecuting a case in Germany for acts committed against Syrians by other Syrians presents difficulties, like creating trust with the community and getting witnesses to come forward, partly because many fear retribution from the Syrian government. Organizations like Human Rights Watch, for example, have called for wider Arabic translation of court proceedings, warning that a lack of interpretation marginalized those who did not speak fluent German and did not understand legal language. The trial that began Wednesday was conducted in German. “To be meaningful, justice should not only be done, but be seen to be done,” said Balkees Jarrah, interim international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “Court authorities should make Arabic translation more widely available for these cases involving the world’s worst crimes committed abroad.” As a way of creating an unofficial public record, Mr. Phillips said that trial monitors for his center would be translating notes taken at the trial on Wednesday.  “This case is undeniably a matter of international justice and it has enormous historic import,” he said. “Those individuals who are most impacted by these crimes should have access to the proceedings.”   https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/world/europe/germany-syria-war-crimes-mousa.html	1642626882.0	htdclxx	t3_s80k4w	t3_s80k4w	/r/arabs/comments/s80k4w/18_قضية_تعذيب_محاكمة_طبيب_سوري_في_ألمانيا/htdclxx/

I'm quite good compared to my classmates and I'm wondering if you could help me by directing me in the skills, courses, methods or even voluntary opportunities in the field of translation? It's a huge passion of mine but it feels horrible that despite the professors' praise, they would never help you out in any manner.	1642639498.0	hte7v3i	t3_s7ixyb	t1_htajibh	/r/arabs/comments/s7ixyb/translating_games_into_arabic/hte7v3i/

I am not saying France doesn’t have issues (far rights candidates have been gaining in popularity over the last 30 years) and there is a real debate on whether laïcité (+/- secularism on steroids) is the right approach or if those laws are in line with the concept of laïcité.

If Muslims ever became ~10% of the population in the United States and were perceived to be a political threat of some kind, you bet you that they would find some ways of passing laws that target Muslims. I’m not sure legislating the hijab would be the first law to come out, but the law is a matter of interpretation, and all it takes is 5 people (majority in the Supreme Court) who don’t think the First Amendment applies to allow laws like these to be passed.	1642674020.0	htfxa8q	t3_s86zfa	t1_htf4hms	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htfxa8q/

f6avfqpv	The text of the First Amendment coupled with multiple centuries of precedent plus the fact that the Supreme Court does not need to make voters happy would present a much greater obstacle than you're making it out to be. Muslims are in fact not the first religious minority in American history. In fact, if they ever become more than 10%  of the population (they're half a percent of *Congress* right now), they wouldn't be the first religious minority to become  that big of a share of the population.	1642682101.0	htg8qmj	t3_s86zfa	t1_htfxa8q	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htg8qmj/

Both in Algeria and in France, on people it considered its own citizens. And that’s without mentioning that the way we mistreated a lot of our colonies, nor the inherent racism of colonialism in the first place.   My point was not to say that France was not racist nor that it doesn’t have a trouble past (some it still hasn’t acknowledged to this day), but that calling it the most racist or arrogant country in the Western world is factually incorrect, especially coming from an American.   Also, the further I went back with my examples were segregation and Jim Crow which were still a thing 60 years ago.	1642683508.0	htgb7eh	t3_s86zfa	t1_htg2qrs	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgb7eh/

The fact that Egypt accepted a ceasefire with Israel is in itself very disappointing. Egypt had all the factors that could lead to much favorable goals. They have the military capabilities, the population, the Syrians, the Soviets, the element of surprise, and the strategic depth. However, they only took back the Suez with 80% of Sinai in Israeli hands. Worst of all, Egypt ended up recognizing Israel in exchange for Sinai. Which in itself, a much more favorable diplomatic win for Israel.	1642684620.0	htgd9zs	t3_ruah5z	t1_hqz9b98	/r/arabs/comments/ruah5z/why_do_arabs_keep_calling_1973_a_victory/htgd9zs/

Because they have belittled him by saying he's not worth the praises by Allah.	1642685913.0	htgfv82	t3_s86zfa	t1_htf4hms	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgfv82/
f6avfqpv	In my view, anti-clerical sentiments in France have always been a tool by the bourgeoise elite to extract their own form of power in French culture/politics and destroy opposition to it.   You are correct that anti-Judaism has deeper roots in France than the French realize. Napoleon permitted the Jewish community to practice their religion in France only under the supervision of a state religious body oversaw the Jewish community's religious practices, and French Jews were often suspected of disloyalty to France because of their religion. The Dreyfuss Affair, of course, caused many Jews to believe that the idea that they could ever have a place in a "secular" France was impossible, and that they would always be suspected of disloyalty in Western Europe.   There is much to admire about France and there are chill French people for sure, but there are many dark, horrible undercurrents to traditional French culture as well.	1642686646.0	htghe51	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgfv82	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htghe51/
f6avfqpv	>I am not sure what you mean by oversimplified media narrative. Everything I listed above are well documented historical facts.   It's that you presented them in an stark and oversimplified, sensationalistic manner that the media tends to present (hence they're "well documented" by sensationalists) and implied that they are part of a fundamentally nefarious American national character -- kind of the same way that someone could say that it is a "well documented fact" that Arab society is patriarchal, encourages terrorism, and so forth. If it is wrong to do it in one instance, it is wrong to do it in the other.   >And at no point did I make any judgment on the US or the Middle East.  Don't play coy about this, it is the conclusion that any reader of what you wrote would draw. We can go through the misleading, incomplete, and exaggerated portions of what you said point by point, but do not pretend like you didn't know how the position you articulated would be interpreted.   >My point is that it’s silly to call France the most racist, arrogant or embarrassing, let alone the most, when your very own country has also taken very controversial actions not so long ago.  I'm talking about the present; I am not talking about the past. And I'm not even detailing all the efforts that France took over the centuries to chase out non-French minorities so that it didn't have to address the problems that diverse countries all inherently face.   If you want to know whether or not French attitudes towards foreigners are the most prejudiced in Western society today, invoking Jim Crow in the Old South isn't going to help your argument. This story is about the French legislature taking a prejudiced measure that would never fly in the United States *this week*; the American legislature outlawed Jim Crow in 1965 and an anti-Hijab law would never pass at the federal level in the US (and would immediately be struck down in the Courts of the United States at the local level.) And I am sure the Muslim delegation of the United States Congress would applaud these measures; they wouldn't in France because they have no Muslim elected officals at the national level.	1642687228.0	htgimo4	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgehq0	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgimo4/
obxaun0	It comes down to the french view of secularism.   English secularism is a church, mosque, synagogue, temple &c on every street corner, worship whatever you want, show it with pride just don't force me to follow it.  French secularism is religion is a private affair that has no place in a public space.     this is where they're coming from, that being said it's a bit hypocritical because the french have a softer/more tolerant spot for Christianity due to it's cultural/historical significance.      Just wanted to share this to help make sense of why the french keep doing this (quebec and france)	1642690440.0	htgpxtp	t3_s86zfa	t1_htero7z	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htgpxtp/

15yztx	Thanks for the reply.   I understand that the examples I listed are oversimplified, but are any of them wrong?  >> implied that they are part of a fundamentally nefarious America national character  It’s not really what I meant to imply, but I’ll go in bit more details later. With that being said, there is a bit of truth there, although I don’t believe it is intentional as much as it is because of the consequences of fucking up reconstruction.   >> Don’t play coy about this, it is the conclusion that any reader of what wrote would draw.   You may have heard it. I may have thought it. But I didn’t say it. But yeah fair enough, although my point was that you were in no position to call France racist or arrogant because of your recent history.   >>I’m not even detailing all the efforts that France rook over the centuries to chase out non-French minorities   This, I am legitimately curious about, because unless you are taking about the treatment of the Jews in the 12th or 13th century, the Hughenots (who were French) in the 16th, or the collaboration with the Nazis, I don’t know what you are talking about but would love to know more.   >>This story is about the French legislature taking a prejudiced measure that would never fly in the US this week  Just like the Muslim ban was promptly overturned by Congress and not upheld by the Supreme Court, right?  >>they wouldn’t in France because they have no Muslim elected officials at the national level  That’s just straight up false. We have about 15 members of Parliament who are muslim. Now that’s only 2,5% of the assembly, when French muslims are about 8% of the population, and while it’s not great, the number is increasing with each election and our Parliament is becoming more representative. But on the plus side, we don’t have anyone like MTG or Boebert calling them terrorist or the number one TV network trying to convince half of the country that they are unFrench.   I get why you are being defensive. I reacted the same way when you wrote that France was the most arrogant, racist, etc. My point is not to say that the US is the most racist country. If I were to name a country, Austria, Switzerland, Italy or Australia would be better candidates in my opinion. But I don’t think you have any lesson to give to France, nor the right to call it the most racist country.   Feel free to criticize this law. It is unnecessary, targets muslim and, more cynically is a blatant strategy that has been several times by various governments to mobilize their conservative electorate. Just get down from your high horse when you do it.	1642702130.0	hthl8du	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgimo4	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/hthl8du/

The Arab world has a high GDP thanks to oil producing countries. In fact over half of the Arab league's GDP comes from the GCC countries. The issue is we also are going to have a lot of people meaning the GDP per capita is going to be very significantly low relative to the rest of the world.

3fv6juvz	The point isn't just about the GDP itself,  but that it allows you to leverage your market power to influence or force other nations and foreign companies  into making deals with better terms for the United Arab states.   Want to sell cars/electronics/ hi-tech across the entire nation? well you need to  build manufacturing plants inside the country and employ X percentage from the local population. Or you have to hire developers from the country if you want to sell your software/subscription services.  Countries and companies will want to make any deal happen because there's so much revenue to be generated that would make it worth it to comply.  ( Assuming there's no corruption involved,  unfortunately right now Arab leaders say you can win this contract or sell this product as long as you give me my cut ---  and this happens in the oil-rich gulf countries as well, just as  frequently)	1642730396.0	htjinuh	t3_s8rcl3	t1_htjf0a4	/r/arabs/comments/s8rcl3/what_happens_is_the_arab_united_shocking_facts/htjinuh/

82sdnzop	 دراما تحدث حالياً بين الجزائريين والمغاربة على التويتر..    * بنت مغربية نشرت صور وفيديو لرسائل خاصة بينها وبين حساب المعلِّق الجزائري المعروف حفيظ الدراجي. [الرابط للفيديو](https://twitter.com/LightoMA19/status/1484252358901125122).    * المغردون المغاربة بدأوا يهاجمون الدراجي بشدة وشراسة على التويتر    * الدراجي غرّد ودافع عن نفسه قائلاً أن الفيديو والصور كلها مفبركة. [تغريدته](https://twitter.com/derradjihafid/status/1484274458953228296)     * الكثير من الجزائريين والآخرين شككوا في مصداقية الصور والفيديو    * في تقديري أرى أنها فبركة واضحة لسببيَن: أولاً، البنت بعثت رسالة الساعة 19:10 وردّ عليها حساب الدراجي في نفس الدقيقة 19:10 بفقرة كاملة. لا أحد يستطيع أن يرد بتلك السرعة إلا إذا جُهِّزت الرسالة في وقت مُسبَق. ثانياً، توجد فروق شاسعة بين الرسالة المنسوبة للدراجي وتغريداته المعتادة. الرسالة الخاصة معبأة بالأخطاء الإملائية، وإذا دخلت في صفحة الدراجي لن تجد أي أخطاء إملائية في تغريداته نهائياً. وليس متوقع من رجل بفصاحة الدراجي أن يرتكب أخطاء إملائية كتلك الموجودة في الرسالة.    مع ذلك يبدو أن الأغلبية لم يكترث للتدقيق في هذه التفاصيل وقرروا أن يهاجموا الدراجي من دون أي رحمة. يعني بالعقل هل تتوقع من رجل بعمر وخبرة ورزانة الدراجي أن ينزل لهذا المستوى ويرسل رسائل مثل هذه إلى حسابات غريبة؟   أرى أنها محاولة دنيئة لإشعال نار الفتنة بين الشعوب.. شيء مؤسف أن كمية الحقد والكراهية عند بعض الناس دعتهم للتصرف بهذه الطريقة الواطية. ما رأيكم؟	1642755665.0	htksl7o	t3_s84ku4	t3_s84ku4	/r/arabs/comments/s84ku4/درر_المخارج_في_العامي_والدارج_نقاش_حر_بالعربي/htksl7o/

It makes some sense when you think about it. Nowadays Andalusia is (economically/culturally) one of Spain's more irrelevant communities whereas during Arab Islamic times it was the center of the entire world.

l84e04d	You're getting more downvotes than you deserve, but besides the "official explantation" (that you yourself described as hypocritical). There is absolutely no doubt that French Islamophobia is based on racism and prejudice towards Maghrebi Arabs and Sub-Saharan Africans.  I am French, I have many friends that are White French, I debate this a lot: of course justifications about secularism and freedom of religion are thrown around all the time, but from the history of these "secularism measures"  and of the relationship between France and its colonial subjects in general, and from the examination of the sociopolitic profile of the people who promote these measures, you can see the discrimination pattern behind the justification.  The fact that the measures against Muslims are becoming tougher and tougher through time is also explained by the actual empowerment of French Muslims (culturally but mainly economically): when the hijabis were the cleaning ladies who lived in the "Banlieue dortoir" \[poor and densely populated suburbs\] and could barely speak French, nobody bothered. But now, some hijabis are actually French born, they speak perfect French, they are capable of defending both their national (French) and their religious identities, they are doctors, engineers, consultants, accountants, and maybe executives in the futur. Now the presence of non-whites in such an obvious fashion in the economic elite is problematic.	1642765623.0	htl5f8w	t3_s86zfa	t1_htgpxtp	/r/arabs/comments/s86zfa/french_senators_vote_to_ban_hijab_in_sports/htl5f8w/

8g2fp9gl	Being a nationalist can mean many things. At its simplest level it means being a person who strongly identifies with the interests of his/het nation. When the interests of your nation are in stronger integration with the rest of the Arab world, nationalism and pan-Arabism (or whatever  you want to call it) are not really mutually exclusiv. I know that's not a very widespread view in many Arab countries but it is in places like Jordan for instance. And I frankly find it very odd that someone would think that 100 years after borders were drawn you would need to be "brainwashed" to strongly identify with your country and its borders. History moves on.   The best chance pan-Arabism has today is in stronger integration between the existing countries. The pan-Arabism of yesterday where you get to erase everything that happened in the last 100 years and start over is a bit like "world peace"; something naive beauty pageants say they want, but which nobody has the slightest clue how to achieve.	1642768581.0	htla2rn	t3_s8rcl3	t1_htjysm1	/r/arabs/comments/s8rcl3/what_happens_is_the_arab_united_shocking_facts/htla2rn/

People on r/lebanon claim that they just don't want to help Palestine anymore. Which is fine. But it's weird how many people are getting angry on the pipe line ON BEHALF of israel. And keep insisting that everyone else must normalize. OP is adamant that we should all normalize. A guy is saying he would rather the pipeline not be build so the government can fail. Ignoring the negative affects it would have on his own country.  Those people don't talk like lebanese people. They talk like israelis. Wishing the worst for lebanon. Getting angry when good things happen to lebanon because it's not happening to israel. It's seriously madness.  Those people are seriously brainwashed minority. Or a true representive of lebanon. If it's the latter then lebanon has a much bigger then hezballah. It's own people who seem to care more about the well-being of israel then their own country.	1642801991.0	htnnmot	t3_s8cm1j	t1_htk1svx	/r/arabs/comments/s8cm1j/map_of_the_arab_gas_pipeline_egyptian_gas_deal/htnnmot/

357k12ya	Herod case is nowhere near a stretch. What every modern scholar 100% agree upon is that he was half-Nabataean (which is half-Arab) from his mother side. (ex. [Rome and the Arabs](https://books.google.com.om/books?id=W4H97SA6pMAC&q=Idumaeans&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=herod&f=false) describing him at least as a semi-Arab) So, this alone is enough to not make it a stretch. On the other hand, his father Antipater is Idumean. Now while not every modern scholar describe them as Arabs, there are many reliable works who do so, ex. [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herod-king-of-Judaea) and [The Myth of a Gentile Galilee](https://books.google.com.om/books?id=YrrRaeP5po0C&pg=PA44).  The OP did make a stretch though in the case of Amir al-Din (or Yeheidie'erding), who is only described as a Muslim and no indications of his ethnicity. Or maybe OP can provide a source  that I'm not aware of, supporting his point of view.	1642822912.0	htp37qq	t3_s9be8t	t1_htmwnt3	/r/arabs/comments/s9be8t/العرب_والعمارة/htp37qq/

I would be fine with a Palestinian state on the 67 (or even better, 49) borders. But I'm not comfortable speaking for the millions of Palestinians who want to return to their particular village and currently live in camps. I think they will be the deciding factor.

Iran, for example, an Islamic country, would rather ally with Christian Armenia over its Muslim Shia neighbor Azerbaijan, some countries in the GCC also would rather ally with Israel if it meant they can guarantee protection from their neighbors.

9sfh0	Fascinating lecture, thank you for sharing. I think the most interesting thing to come out of this is his hypothesis for why the Nabateans’ adapted Aramaic script eventually won out to later evolve to Arabic script— basically he argues that the other scripts which were used to write Arabic were used mainly by nomads and almost exclusively for religious purposes, which fell out of favor with the spread of Christianity in the region. Meanwhile, the Nabateans used their script not only for religious purposes—but since they were non-nomadic, they used it for business and administration. This kept it relevant even after Christianity spread, since it had other uses.   This is so fascinating to me because it almost seems to be a fluke that the abjad we have today and the cursive won out. If the Nabateans just happened to be using Greek at the time, or any other alphabet that had vowels, we would see an Arabic alphabet. Or maybe the most powerful kingdom at the time used a Chinese-like character-based language— in which case, Arabic might be represented in that way.  Do you think that the Arabic script/abjad is well adapted to the language itself? At the end of the day, every alphabet can be used more or less to represent sounds, but personally I don’t believe that the Latin alphabet represents Arabic well—there are too many changes you have to make to get it to work. But perhaps this is just a matter of getting used to it and the historical development. After all, the Nabatean script eventually had to be heavily modified, with dots and tashkeel to ensure correct pronunciation.

22m5u362	My shiddo lived in Tiberias a little town on the westside of the Sea of Galilee. It was pretty peaceful for all faiths, Muslims, Christians (which is what he was) and Jews. Then 1948 when the Arab and Israeli war started the Zionist settlers new to the area tried breaking into my shiddo’s home. Him and his parents, uncles, relatives had to barricade the doors. Soon they knew the IDF was going to come and ransack every Palestinians home (which they did) because they had already killed some distant relatives in south of them. So my great grandparents left everything, their home, their hotel, their other family members who dispersed to Jordan. This all happened to my shiddo at 14 and he had to move to Damascus with nothing. Meanwhile my Teta 4 years old at the time had already seen her neighbors bodies mutilated on the street near her house, probably done by the settlers or idf I’m not sure. I’m not too sure what city she was from, but I think she mentioned wasn’t too far from shiddo. She moved to Beirut Lebanon with her family then several years later my shiddo at a camera shop. It’s really a small world.   They had to move to the UK when my dad was a kid though because the civil war going on in 1975. There were missiles going off all the time in their town, my dad told me once he was knocked off his bed by just the missile that hit their next door neighbors apartment building. They had to hide in bunkers, at this point my grandparents didn’t care about Palestine becoming independent they just wanted to be safe and didn’t pick sides. So again, they left which is super lucky because according to their neighbors a missile went straight through my dads room two weeks after they left. It was fired by the westside side of Beirut Muslim group who were supporting the Palestinian cause… which is ironic because they were also killing fellow Palestinians as well, but didn’t realize it. As my baba describes the situation, they were mad at Pierre Gemayel a real bad Christian Phalangist who’s party killed innocent Muslim Palestinians in retaliation of fighting Israel or supporting the PLO. It was a shit show which my family were very lucky to survive/get out when they could. My dad, uncles, and Teta almost got murked too though when going to the airport. They were stopped by a Muslim checkpoint basically interrogating our family friend (who thank god was Muslim) covered for them saying everyone in the car was Muslim, while my uncles are trying to keep calm seeing a guy holding a big machine gun in the back of their truck.   So… yeah that’s my family’s story. Even after the Nakba they had to flee. I mention this because it’s very important to know where you com from; this is how people lose their identity, their culture, and an entire ethnic group. I’m first generation and I barely speak the language so clearly I’m a product of that. It’s not a good feelingPeople say (that’s a fair price for safety), but I beg to differ. You’d never say that about any other group of people especially Israelis. There’s an interview with Ghassan Kanafani (one of the head leaders of PFLP and famous author) who says “maybe to you, but for us it’s not. To liberate our country, our people, to have dignity, to have respect, to have our mere human rights… is something as essential as life itself.” And I keep that in mind because to me it boggles my mind that our existence is still controversial today. So here I am trying to learn Arabic in my dumb American accent, but that’s alright. I think my shiddo would be happy I’m learning.	1642899772.0	httgg8e	t3_omvfcd	t3_omvfcd	/r/arabs/comments/omvfcd/looking_for_descendants_of_nakbanaksa_survivors/httgg8e/

Your personal inability to focus on more than one enemy a time is your problem.  I literally cannot comprehend the idiocy in your line of the thinking. We’re literally talking about Iran. It’s not like we started with enemies and Iran was the first one mentioned spontaneously. Iran is the whole subject. And it has perpetrated heinous crimes in Arab countries.

h4q6j721	Stop using moralism, ffs.   I don't care about Iran. It's not the main problem, not even close. You're using Iran to excuse your sectrian bias, that's all. Iran has zero power in our region and how do you imagine them taking Arabs under control? By using magic?   Everything what Iran does can be explained by western attempts to instal their loyal regime there. And unlike in Arab lands, Iranian regime is mostly popular in Iran itself, so they have legitimacy.   If Iran won't stop playing in the region after fall of Arab regimes and the end of presence of non-Arab forces in the region, we will talk. For now it's just nonsense. Iran's role in Arab problems is so small that you have to be, like I said, delusional to put your focus on them.   Also, you tried to blaime Palestinians for supporting Yemen. What's the point here? Hoothies get closer to Iran only after Salman and Zayeds attacked them. They are literally defending themselves. And you want us to do what? To support position of these Arab sellouts like Salman, Zayed and the rest of these rats? Are you fucking serious? 😂  If Iran is going to help us to kick out western militaries and all their pigs from our lands, I'll support them. I don't care about "Shias\\Sunnies" or any of these r\*tarded terms and groups. And if Iran will help us to destroy gulf regimes, I'll support it as well, I have zero respect for these parasites and don't care what people who support them feel or think, they would sell their own mother to get some easy and free money.	1642980737.0	hty39uh	t3_sacony	t1_hty1ol0	/r/arabs/comments/sacony/مسيرة_وسط_غزه_يتظاهرون_دعما_لإيران_والحوثي_وحزب/hty39uh/

14u9g8	I disagree,although I am here for arabic culture more than a political stance I personally dont believe in anything past a trade and infrastructure union.  As an Egyptian who is socially active and constantly gather people's opinions and see how they perceive things in my community,and lived 10 years in saudi arabia with a group of arab speaking migrants from sudan syria south Egypt yemen etc, can see that the nature of the area really cant be maintained by one huge empire or union or identity   You think since we all have the same language and share similar religions we will be very close but thats not true,historically the maghreb,Egypt,the levant and arabia have always broken back to independence from whatever empire was in control,or have an empire based on one of these areas,and even now you can see how the major dialects,countries,populations,culture generally revolve around those centers. A united federation in the region on any strong cultural basis will simply break again,its better to maintain our independence and national identity and shared identity for stability,also an Arab union would delete and persecute minorities such as copts and berbers and I simply cant stand by that.	1643031498.0	hu0memf	t3_s8rcl3	t1_htjysm1	/r/arabs/comments/s8rcl3/what_happens_is_the_arab_united_shocking_facts/hu0memf/

In every literal sense of the word, Jordan is a made up country that was supposed to be a buffering zone between Arabia and Israel. What about Lebanon? Lebanon is literally a failing French project.   If doesn’t matter what the average person think. People are so easily brain washed. And it’s hard to blame them. I mean, imagine you’re from Arab country X. You go to school, where you see the flag of your “very real” country. You learn in history class -that was approved by the government- that your country is a very real country, look here’s a national hero [insert name of person who did something semi-great].   All in all, the average person is a lot dumped than you think. Look at what happened to the UK after they left the EU. Why did they voted to leave? Because the leave campaign worked a lot harder. Meanwhile, the stay campaign didn’t think that people would be so stupid to vote for something that will hurt them.

jdcjbgw	لو لاحظتو كيف انهم بشكل عفوي يقولون انه عرب، وكيف ان العروبة تعبر عن الوحدة... البعض ايضا يعتبر ان الجزائريين مغاربة. اصلا في المهجر المغرب والجزائر اكثر شعبين يختلطو مع بعضهم.  اعلام الفتنة على العكس من ذاك شغال بقوة هاته الايام...	1643049575.0	hu1vmij	t3_sbryk9	t3_sbryk9	/r/arabs/comments/sbryk9/_/hu1vmij/

If I don’t blame everything on Zionists, then I’m a Zionist.	1643050269.0	hu1xi79	t3_sbkmii	t1_hu1udwe	/r/arabs/comments/sbkmii/assad_regime_tortured_over_653_palestinian/hu1xi79/
