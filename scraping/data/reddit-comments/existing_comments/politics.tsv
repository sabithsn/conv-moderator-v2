2kofc0jp	Read the article, maybe?   At the time of the $2,000 statement you're trying to support, the Democrats were trying to AMEND the $600 in the stimulus to $2,000, and for the math challenged, that's $1,400 new dollars and therefore $2,000 would be going out the door.   By the time Biden was in office, however, the $600 was already out the door, so the additional $1,400 previously proposed and promised was passed to make it $2,000.  Crazy how passage of time changing facts between the time of the promise and when he was in power can influence things. The campaign was always, $600 is not enough, it should be $2,000 (an extra $1,400) and using an out of context quote about the total demonstrates that you're spouting misinformation.	1642705963.0	hthvq3k	t3_s8j84w	t1_hthfect	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/hthvq3k/
dz6gijxc	Pro-life is funny for a lot of reasons.  The issue was only created so that evangelicals would vote against evangelical Jimmy Carter. And, they wanted to do that so that they could keep their charitable tax status in their schools while denying African Americans admission. Prior to the 1980 election evangelicals didn't care about abortion and some even praised Roe v. Wade. So it's this wedge issue that has grown legs over the years to become it's own thing.  Then the reason people are so passionate about it is because it makes themselves feel better. Like at the heart the movement is incredibly selfish. They want to volunteer some time so that they can protect this perfect victim of the unborn and then go home at the end of the day thinking they made the world a better place. They could be out there fixing problems that exist today like hunger, or addiction, or homelessness but no those people have baggage and made their own bad decisions to get them to where they are. The unborn however, they are perfect.	1642705964.0	hthvq7o	t3_s8ofbp	t1_hthjtkz	/r/politics/comments/s8ofbp/15week_abortion_ban_passes_first_test_in_florida/hthvq7o/
faqxi9ly	The fact that articles like this need to be written prove that Biden has failed in messaging by hiding out most of the year.  💯 his fault and totally preventable.  For example he did exactly the right thing in Afghanistan but let the media and the republicans set the narrative and drive home the message.

qnv7y	What she's saying *is* how it works in a representative democracy, what you're expecting is more of a direct democracy.    In a representative democracy we are supposed to elect people we feel are qualified to make these kinds of decisions for us, and who align with our general political views and values.  And that sometimes means making decisions that are unpopular, because they have to look at the big picture.  For example, climate change - in a direct democracy we'd never do anything about it, because the costs are all up front and the benefits are decades in the future.  A representative who just follows polls isn't really doing his job.	1642706009.0	hthvudr	t3_s8ov89	t1_hthn2ql	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/hthvudr/

1cmfl3ts	So comments like this really irritate me - not because there isn't some truth in the statement (there is), but because of how profoundly pointless making the statement is.   Sure, our country was built on the bedrock of racism and prejudice. A comment like this, though, implies that there has been no progress. That under the surface, nothing has changed.   And again, it's not that there isn't a kernel of truth to it, it's that this view presents that kernel as the totality of the truth.   "*American has never been anything other than a racist hellscape*." Way to shit on *centuries* of fighting, centuries of hard work by people trying change that course and succeeding.  People saying "I don't like where we're headed" isn't some flagrant admission that they're asleep at the wheel, unaware of the course we've always been on.   It's an acknowledgement that we're swerving back toward the swampland we worked so hard to get our tires unstuck from.	1642706021.0	hthvvln	t3_s8ji6u	t1_htgtlyc	/r/politics/comments/s8ji6u/mcconnell_comparing_african_americans_and/hthvvln/

dp09o	This article is comparing her positions to when she was part of the Green Party, which she left in 2004.

By the time he was in office, the $600 had been sent out and therefore couldn't be amended to $2,000, so the bill adding $1400 was passed.  Yes, Biden promised $2,000 but it was INSTEAD OF and not IN ADDITION TO $600.

7adxo	I think his point is that it can only charitably be called "representative democracy".    The Senate is not "representative" of the electorate.  We haven't been a loose collection of mostly-independent governments united by a shared disdain of the British for a long time; not accounting for population in the most powerful legislative body makes no sense.  Allowing 41% of senators (who could potentially represent something stupid like less than 20% of the population) to block all legislative business is objectively undemocratic and only serves to further divide the nation.    The Electoral College is not "representative" of the electorate.  Again, giving often arbitrarily and politically-created small states more power means a minority can outweigh the majority for a position that could and *should* be a simple popular vote.  The House of Representatives is not "representative" of the electorate.  Gerrymandering is a massive problem when data on voters is so accurate and granular you can reliably turn 51% of a state's votes for House candidates of one party into 33% representation of the state's House seats for that same party.  On top of that, the century-old cap on the number of House seats means the distribution of seats across states is less and less representative while exacerbating both gerrymandering and the unrepresentative nature of the Electoral College (since it's based on House + Senate seats).    As a bonus, many citizens can't even vote.  700,000+ ~~people~~ Americans have literally **no** say in federal governance.  Even worse, their own local laws are subject to approval by people that don't even live there.  In practice, they're not citizens - they're *subjects*.	1642706292.0	hthwld9	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hthnb76	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/hthwld9/

6mhjx	He might be flawed, but I'll take his stance that we need more than two parties, over the Dems stance on the matter of "I got mine".  That's obviously not the only issue on the ballot, but the Dems have had decades to change election law in the states that they govern, to implement ranked-choice voting, and give 3rd parties an equal chance, and have thus far refused to do so.  The Dems aren't nearly as bad as the GOP on voting right, but they're also not the paragons they'd make themselves out to be. They do the exact same thing the GOP does -- create/enforce laws that keep them in power. Their plight seems more noble though, because the majority would vote for the Dems over the GOP, so they rightfully fight for greater voting access, but the Dems also gatekeep elections, heavily discouraging 3rd party participation.  They're not equally flawed, but they're still flawed.	1642706393.0	hthwuza	t3_s8o7tp	t1_hthmyrr	/r/politics/comments/s8o7tp/ralph_nader_bidens_first_year_proves_he_is_still/hthwuza/

Maybe they can work on something that really counts, instead of ignoring it, like immigration reform. Tax reform. Crime rates. Recidivism in criminal behavior, mental health issues.  Those are an “All side” issue. Division is rampant. “Domestic Enemies “  Creating issues (like President Biden did yesterday), and then fumbled attempts to solve the problems of our own creation, has to stop. Now he’s setting up the Country for failure. Saying (circle back Psaki-the pee is silent-agreed) that the next election May be illigit if things don’t go his way. “Minor incursions” are acceptable.

It's not even a criminal act, and its tied to questions of autonomy and freedom in ways murder has never been.  Plus, there's no question that it's possible to have sky-high suicide rates with virtually no firearms.  Northern Canada, Russia, Scandinavia, and Alaska all have high suicide rates while having radically different gun laws.

1wnj	- Make it illegal to charge tuition for college - For every quarter you attend an accredited college, you pay an extra 0.3% on your taxes (0.5% for every semester). - The average graduate would then be taxed about 4% a year. - Take the money from that tax, and give 1/2 of it to every accredited college in proportion to how many students they graduate. - Take the other 1/2 and distribute it directly back to the college that person attended. - Make sure accreditation checks for colleges that just graduate anyone to boost their numbers.  Now, 18 year olds don't have to get loans, schools are still encouraged to take students who want to study non-lucrative things since they will get their part of the 2% no matter what, but they are also rewarded for helping their students get high paying jobs, since they get about 2% of their graduate's income.  You'd have to figure out a way to give extra funds to new colleges until they start getting income from their graduates as well as a way to transition to this system.	1642706468.0	hthx25o	t3_s81gzq	t1_hth1kq6	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/hthx25o/

348kxbij	Study by "Everytown for Gun Safety"?  And labels like "National Failures"?  It seems like common sense and I definitely would believe it, but it's a bit like a "Nuts Are Good For You" study by the American Nut Association.  Their methodology seems a little suspect, too, with some gun laws given what seem like arbitrary values - there's no given justification why any law is any given level.  They also say they give more points for "stronger" versions of the law, but that seems like it could be subjective.  EDIT: To be clear, I support stronger gun laws.

I think it's Mississippi but not positive. Other states allow passengers to drink in the car. Many states have max speed limits set at 65 while other states have much higher limits.

e9m9k	Sadly, it's not.  A very large portion of the population- maybe even a plurality- simply don't pay attention to politics at all and simplistically write things off as "just politics".  I'd bet they skew heavily towards voting Republican, but they're not actually ideologically conservative or Republican (granted, I don't know what "Republican" means these days ideologically).  For a large variety of reasons, Republican propaganda and messaging filters through to them.	1642706488.0	hthx45q	t3_s8ji6u	t1_hth6o9s	/r/politics/comments/s8ji6u/mcconnell_comparing_african_americans_and/hthx45q/

He puts a D by his name because it makes him more money  The idea that Semina or Manchin or the other 50 Republicans in the Senate have another goal in mind is politically naive. Money for their personal. Hurt for Americans. That's why Semina was celebrating with the GOP today. This is their victory against the American way of life.

2dnzvf	Bush the younger received 50.7% of the popular vote against Kerry. Bush the elder won 53.4% of the vote in 1988. So Reagan is not the answer for last Rep to win a majority. Your second point about Dems receiving the most popular votes in 7 out of the last 8 elections is correct. Also worth noting that none of the 3 Clinton elections or the Gore election involved the Dem receiving >50% of the vote. They did all win the popular vote, but it was also not a majority for any of them just a plurality. Yes, the electoral college has favored the Republicans and that's not right, but let's not pretend that all of these Dems are getting voted for by a majority of the country when that isn't what has happened.	1642706508.0	hthx65h	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hthgd2m	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/hthx65h/

I definitely don’t affiliate with the Republican Party, nor do I think my arguments are in bad faith.   The reality is that we got more stimulus money under trump than Biden, the military offense budget is higher under democrats than ever before, democrats gave Capitol Hill police a multibillion dollar raise, the most expensive provision of the primary democratic agenda item is a tax cut to millionaires, and the Democratic president said he would veto Medicare for all.

ajmp4bf3	The language people use on this issue is problematic, and confuses things.    Supporting the right to vote can mean:  - Supporting the legal right for every citizen (with few exceptions like felons) to vote and not passing laws to remove that right.  The vast majority of Republican voters would support this in my view.      - Supporting the various Federal voter rights bills which increase Federal and reduce State oversize of voting.  Most Republican voters would not support this as they favor states rights in my view.  - Supporting increased availability to vote like mail-in and extended voting hours.  Many or even most Republicans would not support these measures as philosophically they don't want everyone voting, especially lesser informed, involved, stake in the economy potential voters.  The higher number of voters the more the votes skew to Democrats..  This is the key point around Republics vs Democracies, and we are a Federal Republic with elements of Democracy.  For people to wine that we are a Democracy, why wouldn't everyone just want everyone to vote all the time is childish and I'll informed   - Elimination of any and all possible obstacles to vote period, or which disproportionately effect marginalized communities. Most Republicans wouldn't support this statement in my view, per the ola I've bullet point.  However closing polling stations in predominantly black areas or other illegal manipulations of the voting system would only be supported by very view Republican voters, but maybe larger amounts in some locales in my view.  Unfortunately, some Republicans mask their illegal intent with budget or other elements more online with bullet three, and it is hard to know what is going on.  And unfortunately, some Democrats label all Republicans as racist for not wanting everyone to vote (even, and obviously in this context, for non-racial reasons).

Every single time Congress has been a fucking disappointment — untold missed opportunities that have damned us for years at this point because clueless olds can’t be bothered to do the most basic research to ask informed questions to steer the direction of technology in this country and abroad.   One of the major shortcomings we have in this country is that Americans and their data are relentlessly exploited by these firms, meanwhile most other countries bar these practices. Why can’t our politicians ensure Americans have control of their own data? Unbelievable.

Good things have been done, and sure there are other good things that could be done, but more attention to what has been done, good politicians, and importantly for this year, good candidates to ensure Dems grow their majorities in Congress is needed.

6ucns	Rep. Lauren Boebert left a group of Jewish visitors to the Capitol bewildered Thursday morning when she asked them if they were doing "reconnaissance" after seeing them at an elevator at the Capitol.  Members of the group, which was meeting with Rep. Tom Suozzi, were wearing yarmulkes, and the person coordinating the group is Orthodox, with a traditional beard.  One witness said the group, along with other members of Congress, was waiting for an elevator. When the doors opened, Boebert stepped out of the elevator and looked the group of visitors “from head to toe,” the witness said. Boebert then asked if they were there to conduct “reconnaissance.”  “When I heard that, I actually turned to the person standing next to me and asked, ‘Did you just hear that?’” a rabbi who was with the group told BuzzFeed News.  “You know, I’m not sure to be offended or not,” the rabbi said. “I was very confused.” The rabbi added that “people are very sensitive” now especially after what happened in Texas this past weekend, when an armed man held four people hostage at a synagogue.	1642706632.0	hthxi3x	t3_s8qq0w	t3_s8qq0w	/r/politics/comments/s8qq0w/rep_lauren_boebert_asked_a_group_of_jewish/hthxi3x/

71vef2df	No you wouldn’t. You specifically create the criteria that qualifies for the experimental group and the criteria of the control. For example, why would you compare recreational drug users to also recreational drug users if you are measuring the impact of drug use?   You can randomize a population sample if you are doing exploratory analyses, but not if you are comparing an experimental group to a control group.  In the Mitch example, you’d compare black populations to other population (could be white, or anything else). By nature of your design setup, you would bin black participants in the experimental group and then compare to a control group (matched by other demographics like income, education, etc) but specifically exclude black participants from the control (because an exclusionary criteria for your control group should be the inclusionary criteria for experimental).	1642706651.0	hthxjz7	t3_s8mrq8	t1_hthwmh2	/r/politics/comments/s8mrq8/mitch_mcconnell_sparks_anger_by_saying_black/hthxjz7/

bbgv9	Double jeopardy only applies to criminal trials.       >"prohibits anyone from being prosecuted twice for substantially the same crime."      If you are being prosecuted for a crime by the state, it's a criminal trial.        impeachment is a political process, not a criminal trial.    You can be impeached for nearly anything, some of which aren't crimes. Things such as:   >   - improperly exceeding or abusing the powers of the office;   - behavior incompatible with the function and purpose of the office; and - misusing the office for an improper purpose or for personal gain.      When Nixon was impeached, he also had a separate criminal trial that followed, which resulted in a conviction.	1642706655.0	hthxkbp	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hth8e78	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/hthxkbp/

6qtup	It should also be noted that there are other Federal Institutions that are probably better equipped to study gun violence.  The National Institute of Justice is the research wing of the Department of Justice.  They actually employ criminologists.    The reason why the Dickey Amendment was passed in the first place was not because the CDC was studying gun violence, its because the CDC was openly advocating for gun control and had funded several junk studies in that pursuit.  Most notably was the Kellerman study which on two seperate occasions published studies suggesting that a gun used in the home is 3X times more likely to be used on a family member then on an intruder.   Kellerman's work was highly flawed, and yet the CDC continued to fund his studies because they produced results that fit their narrative.   The biggest flaw being that Kellerman would only count a gun as being used for self defense if the intruder was actually killed.   Intruders who were shot but survived wasn't counted.  Intruders who had a gun pointed at them and immediately left the scene were not counted either..      You can read more about many of the flaws of Kellermans studies here:  [https://fee.org/articles/the-tainted-public-health-model-of-gun-control/](https://fee.org/articles/the-tainted-public-health-model-of-gun-control/)  [https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/editorial-deconstructing-kellermann/](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/editorial-deconstructing-kellermann/)	1642706675.0	hthxm8z	t3_s8mqre	t1_hthkbvq	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/hthxm8z/

10y8uy	I'm not reading a 700 page bill of course but I have looked at it and wanted to see what you believed was "pork" thus the question. Similar programs already exist on the state level and are available to eligible candidates running for the presidency. It's meant to combat PACs and big money to candidates. I get where you are coming from but it already happens at state levels and for Presidential candidates so not like it's unheard of.  I just feel there needs to be federal minimums for voting consistency. Voting isn't supposed to be "hard". It seems like R's feel you need to go through some great effort in order to vote because it's this sacred right. It should be the other way though. Voting should be extremely easy to do and everyone who has a right to vote should be able to without having to go through unnecessary steps. It's a constitutional right and should be federally protected with minimums on how the registration/voting happens. I don't think we need same day registration but it doesn't hurt anything and voting early. Make it a minimum of 14 days including 2 weekends so people who are working 3 jobs to make ends meet because pay hasn't kept up with inflation have a chance. Mail in voting should be available to anyone who needs it. Stuff like that needs be federally assured so states can't take steps. Gerrymandering as well needs to stop on both sides. So if that is what you feel is "pork" and that is all that R's have a problem with then I don't think there is a leg to stand on.  With regards to Georgia and the food, it clearly states you can't give food or water within certain limits. They point to NY's law that is similar but not the same since NY allows food/water valued under $1 to be handed out so long as it's "anonymous". GA doesn't allow it under any circumstance from anyone other than poll workers.	1642706716.0	hthxq9p	t3_s895em	t1_hthv5kk	/r/politics/comments/s895em/manchin_sinema_join_gop_to_sink_filibuster_change/hthxq9p/

5qjraarv	The vice president of Obama has the same name recognition as the senator from Vermont? That’s just not true. Also it is not accurate to say voters are good when there are 87 millions uninsured or underinsured, 43 million with student debt, 80 percent of families who can’t afford quality child care, among so many other struggle Americans continue to face daily.  Democrats relying on republican obstruction to justify their failure has never been an effective strategy. There are more aggressive ways to persuade and pressure manchin and sinema. The carrot or stick approach has been used successfully by presidents before, and even if it didn’t work this time, going on a long smear campaign against them is a better way of encouraging voters to go out and elect better democrats than just seeing their president bend over and do nothing to hold them accountable. All Biden doing nothing does is create more voter disillusionment, especially among the millions of non voters who turned out for them in 2020.   There are also a multitude of things Biden could do through executive order, all derived from authority in specific statutes like canceling some student debt, force divestment from fossil fuel projects and mandate reduction of greenhouse emissions, close a slew of tax loopholes, allow the effective decriminalization of marijuana, and make it easier for workers to join unions. I assume the reason he won’t do these is because of the divisive nature of executive orders and his commitment to unity and bipartisanship.	1642706736.0	hthxs5w	t3_s82a53	t1_hthdayv	/r/politics/comments/s82a53/biden_says_trump_is_intimidating_an_entire_party/hthxs5w/

63jb4ymm	 We don’t vote them in to see who can exploit us the best and degrade everything for profit. So the question remains, what are they for and why should we keep voting for them?   So they can gaslight and create problems domestically and internationally, so we can vote for them to fix it in order for them to just reap the benefits, line their pockets and their investor interests, and order people to kill each other for the problems they fomented and created? Then leave office and give it to democracts to fix while creating more problems so that voters vote against them after 4 years for “incompetence” that they created?   The whole point of politics is to take care of the economy and create progressive relations domestically and internationally in order to sustain the economy and civilization.   People have been gaslit so much, they can’t even understand why politics is around and what the purpose is.

2e6eubvu	I don’t disagree with anything you said. I just also don’t see another path forward. I don’t see our democracy surviving regardless of who is in power if we stay at the status quo. I vote local, I always have. I have seen what appear to be great candidates who have a platform I support change substantially once they are working in the system. By the time the city Council person gets into a state or federal office they are generally in lockstep with the party. If the Democrats are not scared enough to push their own agenda through, we are never going to see the change we need to get rank choice voting. They don’t have enough pressure to do anything that will change the system if we are all tied to the current lesser of the two evils. If enough of us don’t say fuck it and send a message how do you see the necessary changes happening? If somebody has a valid path forward where it works and gives voters a choice other than status quo or regression I would take it. But for everyone saying we can’t split the vote even though the system doesn’t work,  how is it ever going to change? At some point the people voting have to alter their behavior to affect change. I really only see a few possibilities for our future, stalled (as I see it today) which is a slow death for democracy, regressive which will eventually lead to civil war, or radical change which would require the voters to make their displeasure known. I totally understand where people are coming from I am just really sick of supporting a shitty system that fails us at every turn “because it could be worse”. It could also be better if we were brave enough to make it so.	1642706746.0	hthxt5e	t3_s82a53	t1_htharkc	/r/politics/comments/s82a53/biden_says_trump_is_intimidating_an_entire_party/hthxt5e/

Also, the reason that the pandemic is at a point that businesses can reopen is due to the herculean action by the administration that got 63% of people fully vaccinated and 75% of people partially vaccinated, combined with all the treatments distributed that can reduce the lethality of covid and all the other steps he's taken.  Also, during the Obama administration people blamed Obama for not taking more action to get the economy recovered faster.

q3xgy	While I do agree that the media has become gun-shy about calling out Republicans, I think people just stopped being shocked by Republicans. That numbness has corresponded to a decline of rage-clicks with headlines involving Republicans. The media stopped holding Republicans accountable because the public stopped holding Republicans accountable.  Democrats are the only ones that attempt to accomplish anything beyond tax cuts and increased military spending. It's easy for Republicans to elude blame because obstructionism is their default state, it's _expected_ of them. Since Democrats are the only ones trying, they are portrayed as the only ones failing and all blame rests squarely on their shoulders. This has been the status quo for the last 40 years.	1642706899.0	hthy7r6	t3_s8pkeu	t1_hths0on	/r/politics/comments/s8pkeu/media_messes_up_coverage_of_voting_rights_blames/hthy7r6/

gl4hq	Ah, conservative values!  I remember a discussion about that subject a year ago.  Not one single conservative ever even attempted to define what their cult's supposed values were, they just spewed incredibly stupid lies and fled in terror from the very idea of evidence.    I can see what conservatives value based on what conservatives say and do, what they support in the real world.  Conservatives value bigotry. Conservatives value racism, sexism, homophobia, and mocking the disabled.  Conservatives value conformity. They think the mere fact of being different makes someone less than human.  Conservatives value hypocrisy. They prescribe rules for others but ignore those rules themselves. They scream "***FUCK YOUR FEELINGS***" until someone dares tell them to fuck their OWN feelings.  Conservatives value hierarchy, when they can put themselves at the top.  Conservatives PRETEND to value monogamy, until they get the chance to cheat on their wives.  Conservatives value greed, ignorance, and arrogance.  But more important than what conservatives value is what they DON'T value.  Conservatives do not value honesty, consistency, or clarity. Conservatives do not value compassion, kindness, or empathy. Conservatives do not value learning, evidence, or understanding. Conservatives do not value consent. Conservatives do not value freedom.  Conservatives care infinitely more about policing "vulgar" language than about actual harm to real living breathing human beings. Unless the vulgar language is coming from one of their own, then they have no objection to it.  Conservatives value their own money and power above all else, and basic human decency not at all.	1642706901.0	hthy7xt	t3_s81gzq	t3_s81gzq	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/hthy7xt/

No matter how many /r/politics threads come up showing some new crime he's been proven to have done, with the users salivating about how it's "finally happening!"  And to be clear, I'm not saying this is right. Right and wrong don't even factor into power. I'm saying two things: 1) /r/politics, and Democrats in general, are *extremely* naive about this, and only have themselves to blame since they've been given countless examples in the past, and 2) if Americans want to see powerful people subjected to the rule of law, they're going to need to totally dismantle their established systems and rebuild them from the ground up.

For example, if 70% of Americans as a whole are voting, the comment was that 70% of African Americans (a subset thereof) are voting.

They've voted for some pretty non charismatic people before who supported the same policies, and still do tbh.  The propoganda was much heavier on Bernie than anyone else I've ever seen. Warren still had big money donations and super PACs. She also revealed that her m4a plan wasn't really Medicare for all. She did that to herself. They didn't ignore her half as much as they did Bernie tbh.  As for Manchin and Sinema, they aren't even democrats at this point tbh. Name one democratic policy they are for.. it's non existent. Manchin is a coal Barron, and he gets to make legislation for our green energy. In my eyes it's a 48-52  Also I'm not saying it's easy for a woman to run. But no woman will ever win if they keep repeating elect the first woman president, and all that BS.

He says that research and anecdotal evidence appear to bear this out.

So the pontificating over who is worse is a useless waste of time because, for all the reasons I mentioned that you and other apologists for our corrupt one party system continue to fail to address, is a conversation with no substance. You might call it a rant but feel to free to debate any of those points I raised and have a conversation about issues on their merits, rather than descend into tribalist attacks and political virtue signaling.

11sc4c	What's this about freedom? Nobody is suggesting we bar him from running again. The fact is that everybody experiences cognitive decline as they age. His experience and knowledge would be better put to use advising someone younger. I want a president making decisions about extremely complex things to not be at the tail end of their decline.  > When the candidate he would theoretically be running against is not meaningfully younger, age becomes pretty moot imo.  Between the two, I'd bet on Trump being in worse shape than Biden. That doesn't mean we run an old guy since they run an old guy. Only 4 other presidents were over 65 when elected. This is *exceptionally old* for a president. It shows by how out of touch he is with many of the issues younger progressives face. We need someone from a younger generation.	1642707151.0	hthyvni	t3_s8j9u2	t1_hthv8ce	/r/politics/comments/s8j9u2/biden_commits_to_harris_as_his_running_mate_for/hthyvni/

But the party has collected all the offensive, regressive, toxic and just factually wrong beliefs from the fringes of society and linked them together and mainstreamed them, so it is more likely now than in the past that anyone who is part of the conservative media reality-bubble is likely to hold -all- those beliefs instead of just the one or two they would have come to organically.	1642707153.0	hthyvw5	t3_s80lw1	t1_htge1cr	/r/politics/comments/s80lw1/trump_revealed_his_new_electoral_strategy_in/hthyvw5/

bgtoe	Yeah, in my experience, the problem is that they completely follow that line of reasoning, they just don't believe (based on nothing) that covid is a big deal.  To them, they think "Yeah, of course you slow down in a neighborhood, you could kill a kid. But covid isn't real so this is bullshit."  To them it sounds like us panicking because they won't wear garlic around their necks to defend from vampires. We're speaking different languages because we can't agree on the basic fact that covid is as big of a deal that it is, and until then, arguing is kind of pointless because the arguments hinge on that agreement.  It reminds me of in Don't Look Up when DiCaprio says "If we all can't agree that a comet the size of mount everest hitting the planet is a bad thing, then what the hell happened to us?"	1642707170.0	hthyxge	t3_s86wxp	t1_hthc7zn	/r/politics/comments/s86wxp/glenn_youngkin_maskmandate_lifter_sends_his_child/hthyxge/

7pi75imi	That does not explain the same or higher suicide rates in countries with few available firearms.  But even if it's true, is stopping those deaths a public policy worth pursuing through more stringent gun control?  Suicide is not a criminal act, but it is treated as one by responding police and institutions who enforce de facto jail (or actual jail in this state) as punishment for attempts.  The costs and benefits to more stringent controls are wildly different when we're talking about homicide vs. suicide.  Put bluntly--if I opt to kill myself over a dementia diagnosis, it's not your f'ing business how I do it.  Suicide is intensely personal and there's a good argument that we already have too much governmental intervention into a non-criminal act.	1642707208.0	hthz10a	t3_s8mqre	t1_hthyik4	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/hthz10a/

Again post DWS emails you really can’t convince me that moderates are my friends when they’ve black and white pretty much outright stated their intentions to tell poor people to suck it and fuck anyone trying to bring a progressive admin to the executive branch.

And these legal scholars see a very strong case for a racketeering/conspiracy case under the Georgia RICO law (which is extremely friendly for the prosecutor).  It should also be noted that the Georgia Governor has **zero** power to pre-emptively pardon Trump or any of his co-conspirators.

amcwo16t	You guys need to get outside of your bubble.  So, low polls when Trump is president, we believe them, but low polls on Biden, we don’t believe.  The ‘messaging’ on Covid is a complete disaster and science was thrown out the window.   I have many moderate friends who are incensed over this mandate and threatening their jobs (not a good way to make friends).  There is e en piling about Democrats wanting to put anti-shot people in camps, aka, Nazi-style.  So, each team is calling the others Nazi’s and fascists.   Dem’s are just hoping your accusations will stick (and how often have dem’s been good at messaging).   I voted for Biden, I have always voted dem, due to their defense of civil rights and wealth disparity, but I’m considering voting Republican, as much as I despised Trump, over this Covid mandate issue.  Biden needs to clean up his house, and what is he going to do with the people he’s firing.  He’s making enemies, and a mere 2% voting difference last time could have put Trump back in power.   Biden’s tactic is almost insane, given the numbers.	1642707306.0	hthzafp	t3_s8llck	t3_s8llck	/r/politics/comments/s8llck/bidens_approval_has_declined_across_the_board/hthzafp/

Course correction can't come from those that lose, and those that win have little interest in changing rules that currently favor them. The problem is exposed and those that lead do nothing to change them. That's not his fault.  >We’re about to slide into fascism  This fucking doomer bullshit. We're not about to slide into fascism, but our nation is becoming ever polarized because neither party is willing to soften the conversation by including more voices.  There is the Republican party, the Democratic party, and that's it. When you have 2 teams, everyone sees one team as the good guys and one team as the bad guys and that just gets echoed over and over within their world. This warps people's perspectives and literally turns complex politics into simple tribalism. This would not be the same problem if new parties were able to join, and both parties are equally guilty of preventing 3rd party participation, and so both parties are responsible for our current polarized environment.	1642707310.0	hthzatw	t3_s8o7tp	t1_hthxxkm	/r/politics/comments/s8o7tp/ralph_nader_bidens_first_year_proves_he_is_still/hthzatw/

48dak	Bernie dropped out before Georgia even voted in the primaries, so it was a default win for Biden.  States won by Biden in the primaries, before Bernie dropped out, that went for Trump:  * Alabama * Arkansas * Floria * Idaho * Iowa * Mississippi * Missouri * North Carolina * Oklahoma * South Carolina  * Tennessee * Texas  12 states out of 21 states Biden won in the primary over Sanders (prior to Sanders dropping out) that Tump later won in the general.  More than 50% of those states went for Trump.  Yet many of them gave Biden significant delegate leads in the primary (+225 delegate votes in Trump states for Biden).  States like Washington (46-43), Minnesota (38-27-10), Massachusetts (45-30-16), Maine (11-9-4) are states that were either neck-and-neck between Biden and Sanders, or Sanders likely would have won without Warren votes.  So those could be presumed to vote Sanders in the general  States that Biden carried heavily in the primary over Sanders that he won in the general (4):  Virginia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan  States that Sanders won that still went for Biden in the general: New Hampshire, Nevada, California, Colorado, Vermont  States that Sanders won that went for Trump: Utah, North Dakota  Basically, the _only_ States that "mattered" between Biden & Sanders were Arizona & Virginia.  Virginia has voted Dem nationally since 2008, but could still be considered a swing state.  Arizona was Republican since Clinton and was an upset in Biden vs Trump, so that's certainly an unknown for Sanders in the general.  Arizona was also one of the last primaries before Sanders dropped-out and the narrative was that Biden had lots of "momentum".   So if we assume the states that went for Trump still went to Trump instead of Sanders, and the primary ties also went to Sanders in the general, the primary looks like this:  Biden won primary states:  * Arizona * Michigan * Virginia * Wisconsin  Sanders won primary states:  * New Hampshire * Nevada * California * Colorado * Vermont	1642707345.0	hthze8q	t3_s8llck	t1_hthp9m3	/r/politics/comments/s8llck/bidens_approval_has_declined_across_the_board/hthze8q/

But the short version is that nobody really wants war in Ukraine besides Putin. And even Putin only wants it if it can be short and casualty light (on the Russian side).   So what Biden is doing is ensuring Putin has a way to back down without looking weak. At the same time the United States is giving Ukraine a lot of assistance (including training) to ensure they make any Russian invasion a painful one.   And of course, if the US were to somehow end up in a war with Russia it could quickly spiral into a total conventional war and from there the risk of a nuclear engagement is way too high for anyone to be comfortable with.	1642707345.0	hthze92	t3_s8l88m	t1_hthfled	/r/politics/comments/s8l88m/discussion_thread_secretary_of_state_antony/hthze92/

[Five years ago](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/democrats-defend-flip-flopping-2017-225148657.html) was a starkly different time in American politics, and the GOP has catapulted their autocratic ideologies beyond the pale (specifically in terms of a full-court-press on voter suppression).  >> "That letter was written before one of the largest efforts in the history of this country to disenfranchise voters," Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Tuesday. "It wasn't just an attack on Jan. 6. It was for a particular purpose to disenfranchise 80 million people. This Senate hardly is worth the name Senate if it's unwilling to respond to something like that."  >> Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., also said much is different since she signed the letter in 2017, including the GOP's "tyranny" of continually using the filibuster, the "violent attempt" to overthrow the 2020 election and efforts in places like Michigan and elsewhere to "literally take away people's freedom to vote."  >> "We were not where we are today," Stabenow said of 2017.	1642707368.0	hthzgiq	t3_s895em	t1_hthx006	/r/politics/comments/s895em/manchin_sinema_join_gop_to_sink_filibuster_change/hthzgiq/

chjxw8ql	Right, do you realize that there are published, respected, peer reviewed studies that say just about anything you would possibly imagine? That's one thing I've learned after years on the internet. There are countless people doing countless studies and getting them peer reviewed. Many of them are contrasted by published peer reviewed studies saying the exact opposite. Getting a study peer reviewed doesn't make it right. Particularly when we're talking about things like psychology.  What I'm talking about is actual experience with people I know. Not some politically charged study created with an outcome in mind. And that's what a ton of them are.

fhoiu29	I think you must be right about the etymology. It appears murky, but the original greek seems to be closer to the sense of asking for something.   >The phrase begging the question originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin petitio principii, which in turn was a mistranslation of the Greek for "assuming the conclusion".[4]  I guess people have been arguing about the usage of this phrase more or less since time immemorial. My point, which I think is still valid, was mainly that as I usually see it used, the fallacy "begging the question" does not have to involve a literal question being asked.	1642707392.0	hthzirs	t3_s8j84w	t1_htha8a6	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/hthzirs/

nyjvn	The political compass is a very bad metric for judging politics. Hitler was obviously very far right, but “left vs right” is a poorly defined scale. Government size? Nope. Far left has anarchism and communism with government, while center-left has high government interference. The government was large in Nazi germany, but corporations could still (for the most part) operate “freely”  Or guns? Most leftists don’t want people to have guns, but what about the revolutions? What about the individual rights? Same with the right.   There’s a great video “debunking” political charts and graphs that can summarize this much better than I can.   https://youtu.be/9nPVkpWMH9k  tl;dr applying an abstract model to a material world won’t work as the abstractions do not follow the rules of a material landscape  Went on a bit of a rant here, focusing more on the political placements, but nevertheless I hope this is somewhat informative.

One study I read last semester showed that too many competing governmental units can unnecessarily waste resources while another theory suggest more competition would reduce the Leviathan problem.

axz6v	Ohio will come down to who's on the ticket.  I mean, this is the same state the re-elects Portman AND Brown every time they're up for re-election.  Republicans have to figure out that balance of finding a primary candidate who'll appeal to the MAGAs without being too bat-shit insane to turn off the moderates in the general. Right now, the GOP candidates are tripping over themselves competing to see who can be the state's shittiest person.  It'll be interesting to say the least.	1642707443.0	hthznui	t3_s895em	t1_htf44zx	/r/politics/comments/s895em/manchin_sinema_join_gop_to_sink_filibuster_change/hthznui/

yntib	Why can't we do that? Because under the current climate, there is no acceptable ID card that is free.  Even if it was free, there's no way to get a photo ID card without showing up to a specific location within certain hours. There's no guarantee that people will be allowed to leave their jobs for long enough to handle that one crucial step.  Voter ID sounds okay in theory, but when you really look into it, there's so much legislation that has to happen around it to not make it a massive burden to people of lesser means.  Then you get states where the officials absolutely ratfuck the process of getting the ID by closing DMVs (or similar offices).  It just ends up not being a very great idea in this country.	1642707450.0	hthzohx	t3_s8hzd8	t1_htgop4i	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/hthzohx/

uxk4s	The other path forward is supporting and pushing for ranked choice voting and proportional representative allotment rather than districts and other policies that foster a more diverse political landscape that then holds elected officials more accountable to their constituents.  If enough of us “say fuck it and send the necessary message” the way you describe, all hope of the necessary changes goes out the window with GOP gerrymandering and voter suppression taking over and keeping them in power for decades.  I know the push for ranked choice and proportional allotment is slow, difficult, and frustrating but giving into that frustration and handing the GOP near-permanent control is clearly worse than doing nothing. Hoping things get so bad that a revolution occurs is insane! The GOP’s propaganda machine will only get stronger if they take control. There won’t be enough will to start a revolution, let alone the power for it to succeed. And all the suffering between now and the revolution that may never come? We just ignore that and hope for the best?  We have to do this fight the hard way because the easy way of just saying “fuck it” bears too high a cost in human suffering.	1642707457.0	hthzp95	t3_s82a53	t1_hthxt5e	/r/politics/comments/s82a53/biden_says_trump_is_intimidating_an_entire_party/hthzp95/

j57s9	Not to mention, the presidency isn't a part of the legislative branch. It's not within the president's powers to pass laws (obv EOs are a whole different conversation). The president has a bully pulpit, from which he can apply pressure and, legally, that's about it.  IMO, Biden knows, like Obama did, he gets to pick *ONE* issue to get behind and run with it. That's all the influence he has. Again, EOs change this, but the president still can't dictate to Congress.	1642707548.0	hthzyd0	t3_s8hzd8	t1_hthdch5	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/hthzyd0/
5gd71	Again, don't use words you don't know the meanings to. Biden being unable to do everything he wants because of pushback from centrists in the Senate does not mean he is insincere. That would be like refusing to believe Trump wanted to build a wall just because Democrats in Congress obstructed it as much as possible.

e69127ew	Buddy, my family has been in this country since before it was a country. We've had relatives and ancestors serve in every level from cabinet on down. My godfather is a professor at Georgetown who teaches media and politics classes and consults in DC.  Everything you said is proving my point, it's ignorant reactionary nonsense. The 2nd amendment has not once in the history of this country been exercised to defend the first amendment. What are you on about? When have private citizens used their right to bear arms to force the government to honor its obligation not to censor private speech? You know what's enforced that? The courts and civilized people settling issues without reaching for guns.  I've traveled fairly widely and I am CONTINUOUSLY embarrassed by the bullshit I hear from people like you. It's the kind of jingoistic, ignorant, nonsense that someone with no real sense of history would state. Our laws and constitution are not *unique in that all power is derived from the people*. This isnt 1622, democracies exist all over the place. Hell we weren't even the *first*, the founding fathers drew inspiration from nations, states, and thinkers thay lived well before their Era.  The level of nationalistic (not patriotic, to be clear) idiocy that comes out of the mouths of my country men is down right shameful.	1642707549.0	hthzyhp	t3_s8mqre	t1_hthybi4	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/hthzyhp/

klf8v	My understanding (limited) is that when gas prices tanked, Putin had to shore up the Russian economy with his own money. The Magnitsky Act supposedly tied up something like $80bn of his money. This caused a lot of strife with the Russian oligarchs, since his money and power was what got him respect amongst that group. Also why Trump, when in power, wanted to do away with the Magnitsky Act and reduce sanctions, and why they met early on to "talk about adoptions" (Magnitsky was originally put into place due to some story about adoption, it's a whole thing).        Anyhow, Putin has gotta be running dangerously low on money at this point, and without money, he's going to lose whatever influence he has left with the oligarchs. Starting a war with Ukraine, or pissing off the west fiercely, will shore up his support in Russia. It would also secure him some much needed funds that would be drained from whatever resources there are in Ukraine.        Finally, this ties back to Belarus (basically a Russian vassal state) also trying to blackmail the EU with the immigrant crisis that they themselves created. That money would then get funneled back to Russia/Putin.	1642711170.0	hti8jxz	t3_s8l88m	t1_hth0q2i	/r/politics/comments/s8l88m/discussion_thread_secretary_of_state_antony/hti8jxz/

6yt7cf7m	>If members want to do that, I'm okay with that.  Now, obviously banning insider stock market trades is good, and I suppose this is better than Pelosi doubling down on her corruption, but think about that phrase there. "If **members want** to do that, **I'm** okay with that." She's literally saying that she's caving to the whims of the rest of Congress (i.e., if they wanted to do something *bad*, she might just go along with it for the same reasons). She didn't change her mind based on any moral or ethical arguments, she's just going with the flow!  It reminds me of when John Boehner said something like, "a leader who doesn't have any followers is just a guy going out for a walk" as a vague excuse for why he went along with the Republican government shutdown over Obamacare back in circa 2013. I recall he was (rightly) lambasted for being a weak leader back then, and here we see the same kind of weak leadership from Pelosi again!   It appears there's a theme of political leaders trying to have it both ways, absolving themselves of responsibility when they fail to whip votes their fellow party members on their agenda (basically what we've seen time and time again from this Administration and Dem leadership already), but then getting all the credit for when something does get passed (remember all the "Big Win for Biden!" headlines back when the "bipartisan" infrastructure bill passed through Congress?).	1642711178.0	hti8koa	t3_s8ov89	t3_s8ov89	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/hti8koa/

1uu2m3lk	Which is a pity, because a different generation had some rather stringent responses to [saying the quiet part out loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLqT_ZoJPQ). The reason why McConnell has his job is because his predessor as the Republican leader in the Senate, Trent Lott, resigned after he commented at Strom Thurmond's funeral on how much better things would have been if we had followed Thurmond's advice all those years ago.  Strom Thurmond, it should be noted, as an ardent segregationist back in the 1950s, and Lott had no good answer for what other years "all those years ago" meant. Hence the resignation.	1642711206.0	hti8nj6	t3_s8ji6u	t1_htgnqah	/r/politics/comments/s8ji6u/mcconnell_comparing_african_americans_and/hti8nj6/
9xyno	The two democrats got elected *despite* decisions like these, all the Republicans got elected *because* of decisions like these. That's the difference. The Republicans' electorate actually wanted this, and they have zero incentive to stop making decisions like these.  Your response is about as significant as saying "we could cut taxes and build the wall if it weren't for all those Democrats." Which is to say, utterly irrelevant posturing.  It would be best to eject Manchin and Sinema from the party at this point. It's easier to retake Congress than it is to explain two years of inaction. And yes, we need to work to flip more red Senate seats blue. That's so basic a political goal it is obvious. We need at least half a dozen more Senators before real change happens, using the earlier minimum wage vote as a barometer for who the remaining stealth obstructionists among the Dems are.	1642711207.0	hti8nk1	t3_s8j4zm	t1_htgp67v	/r/politics/comments/s8j4zm/fury_over_voting_rights_fight_turns_personal_on/hti8nk1/

13fdc6	Archive at https://archive.is/AkxTK  > Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Wednesday shredded the “never before changed the filibuster” argument. Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.) gave one of the most stirring speeches, making clear that while John Lewis gave blood on the Edmund Pettus bridge, this Senate couldn’t bring itself to “bridge” a procedural rule. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who bent over backward to accommodate Manchin’s concerns on voting reforms, blasted the gamesmanship: “I think by voting this down, by not allowing us even to debate this, to get to the conclusion of a vote, that is silencing the people of America, all in the name of an archaic Senate rule that isn’t even in the Constitution. That’s just wrong.”  > When Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) insisted it was unfair to equate voting restrictions to Jim Crow, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) let him have it. “Don’t lecture me about Jim Crow,” Booker declared angrily. “I know this is not 1965. And that’s what makes me so outraged. It is 2022, and they are blatantly removing more polling places from the counties where Blacks and Latinos are overrepresented.”  > Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who lost two legs and partial use of an arm in battle, excoriated the GOP’s cowardice. “I’m not asking Republicans to do anything near as difficult as what John Lewis went through for our democracy. All I’m asking for is the bare minimum,” she said. “All I’m begging them to do is to not sit in silence in the face of grave injustice.”	1642711278.0	hti8ugu	t3_s8sdj6	t3_s8sdj6	/r/politics/comments/s8sdj6/opinion_finally_some_moral_clarity_in_the_voting/hti8ugu/

But hey, dont vote, that will really show them!  Keep in mind democrats are losing popularity from the center for being too progressive.  I tihnk Romney is right, democrats took a narrow win a rebuke of Trump as a mandate and the public just isnt behind it.  So we are damned if wedo and damned if we dont.  Like Ive said, if you want change it starts with convincing citizens.  You dont have the support of enough of the country.   Dotn whine about some nebulous strawman of "the establishment" or whatever.      The problem is numbers.

kwkfa2	Totally disagree. CNN, AP News, Reuters and others have covered the Sanders campaigns with a lot of intellectual dishonesty, while repeatedly publishing stories on either Clinton or Biden that kept their names top of mind for most voters. California is usually one of the last states in the primaries, so we rarely have much influence over whom the Democrats pick. In the 2016 primary, though, Clinton and Bernie were neck and neck, and there was every possibility California could have pushed Sanders across the line. But the day before the AP News published a story that every major news outlet syndicated that called it for Hillary, not based on polling or anything other than that's really what they wanted.   Name a single major media outlet that remains independent from any other corporate entity. They're all owned by the moneyed, corporate class. It;s all still Hearst's yellow journalism, it's just expanded.	1642711365.0	hti92ps	t3_s8ril5	t1_hti3k78	/r/politics/comments/s8ril5/im_not_bernie_sanders_im_a_mainstream_democrat/hti92ps/

1ixnwyrc	Certainly!   There's a pretty big difference in the conclusions drawn by studies that look at gun control cross-sectionally versus studies that look at effects of gun control legislation on trends.   Studies that look at the effects of gun control policies on trends tend to show that these policies only affect suicide, not homicide (gun-related or otherwise). This is true whether the study takes place in the [US](https://www.law.virginia.edu/news/2003_spr/cook.htm), [Australia](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1736501,00.html), [Canada](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234457), or other countries.   Studies that compare country X with country Y (or state X with state Y), tend to find lots of associations. Generally, these analyses fuel arguments as to whether the difference is explained by gun legislation, healthcare availability, social support networks, or some other factor.	1642711473.0	hti9d4t	t3_s8mqre	t1_hti4o8b	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/hti9d4t/

The Senate in and of itself is an anti democratic body meant to allow less populous states to put a stranglehold on legislation, with or without the filibuster.

The only time this wasn’t true was a brief moment in the 1950s through early 1970s.

Did you know that those who are the most vocal about personal freedom are the ones who most want to restrict other human beings' personal freedom?  > Maybe people should invest in good decision making.  Ok, so what I'm reading is that, contrary to you who wants zero restrictions in order to do whatever the fuck you want, if people don't make the "good" decisions *that you want them to make*, then those people need to be restricted.

az1gd	Because they’re fascists themselves.  People still don’t realize what happened starting in late 90’s and ramped up after Obama won.  The Koch brothers, who come from a family of fascist supporters themselves, started hijacking the Republican Party finances and organizations, after 2010 citizens United ruling they used the tea party to challenge and force out *every* republican that wouldn’t get behind them without question.  Basically they’d have their bought republicans try to crash the Us economy by blocking raising the debt ceiling, and any Republican that didn’t get behind the idea and engaged in bipartisanship with democrats to not crash the economy were targeted for a primary challenge.   All the republicans that aren’t just sycophants to this cabal of donors have been forced out.  The republicans in congress that were the biggest tea party sycophants that led charges to oust their GOP colleagues are now working to force out those tea party republicans that aren’t getting behind the idea of single party rule and pure blind loyalty to this notion.  As you noticed under trump, there weren’t many left they needed to work to force out, and many are retiring now voluntarily rather then be made further targets for violence.	1642711673.0	hti9wse	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htherpd	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/hti9wse/

92wjc	The current incentive structure for the two political parties in this country is completely fucked.    Democratic candidates are constantly pulled towards the middle because of a supposed fear of being labeled a Socialist/Marxist/Communist and a supposed need to win over the "moderate" Democratic voters.  The result is a incredibly watered down party that is just barely left of center.  They struggle to get even the most basic things done when they have power.  On the other hand, Republican candidates are predominantly from hyper-red districts/states where a Democrat has literally no chance of winning.  Their only real concern when it comes to job-security (let's face it, that's their primary goal) is doing whatever they can to avoid a primary challenger.  This pushes the GOP further and further to the right, to the point of batshit insanity.  So if I were to come up with a simple scale of partisanship where 1 is super liberal and 100 is super conservative, most elected Democrats currently live in the 35-50 range while most Republicans are in the 85-100 range.  This means the middle ground of compromise is around 70 or significant right of center.  However, the vast majority of Republicans are in the MAGA camp these days and don't even want to have the blemish of having compromised with evil Democrats on their record.  The end result is that Democrats when they are in power are barely able to accomplish anything.  They're just basically playing defense.  However, when Republicans take power, they are able to undo whatever progress was made by Democrats almost immediately and then move on to quickly pushing policy even further to the right.	1642711745.0	htia41d	t3_s8nbh3	t3_s8nbh3	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htia41d/

bneac	It literally doesn't matter what any of those people are politically. It's the central party officials that have been playing the Clintonian greatest hits on repeat since the 90s that I take issue with, and they are, indeed, neoliberals. Forget the faces. Look at the policy prescriptions. Universal post-secondary education or even community college? No. Increased access to student loans through extended bankruptcy protections to private lenders? Yes. Universal healthcare or public option? No. Increased block grants to healthcare providers and universal requirement to purchase medical insurance through private providers? Yes. To protect workers, we bailed out automakers with no requirement to maintain labor. To protect homeowners, we bailed out banks with no requirement to work with borrowers.   Hey, maybe I'm wrong. But in 30 years of watching Democrats act like Republicans, I haven't been disappointed once by their actions. Spoiler alert: if you think student loan forgiveness is coming in 2022, prepare to be disappointed.	1642711802.0	htia9um	t3_s8j84w	t1_hthxyts	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htia9um/

Even when you do start looking you gotta take into account the work conditions and the pay. Most of these places got shitty work conditions and overtime with tiny ass pay. Who the hell is going to accept a way lower pay than they previously had been receiving?   tldr:Forcing people to take a vaccine that neither protects you from covid, or stops you from giving it out sounds like bullshit.

1uu2m3lk	You're not wrong, but you have to understand the hubris with which these people operate. To be a sitting Senator in the United States, you have to have what, in any other circumstance, would be certifiably delusional levels of self-confidence and a correspondingly great lack of self-reflection. Anyone with less confidence and greater levels of self-reflection gets weeded out along the way.  Which gets to the heart of the problem right now: if you're the kind of person who thinks "Gosh, riding a tiger is crazy! I could fall off, and then it would turn and eat me!", then you don't get on a tiger in the first place. The current Republican crop of politicians are where they are because they are absolutely positive that while everyone else will get bucked off and eaten, they will stick it out and be the last survivor.	1642711830.0	htiacnj	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hti3coi	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiacnj/

But if I was in the house or Senate, I would actively have a difficult time not being an asshole to some of these people because from my perspective, our morals do not align and I think a lot of these people are bad people and a friendly wave or smile isn't going to change that opinion. If I think you, to your core are shit person, I'm not gonna hide that in the office, especially given the seriousness of the job. We're talking about really important issues here. This isn't simply a disagreement about gun control for example, which is a serious issue, but I can stomach the argument against it. This is "should we allow our democracy to function correctly, or try and rig it a little." These people took a fucking oath. These people are literally responsible for helping run this democracy and they're actively fighting against it. As someone who has served in the military, studied politics, and has deep love and interest in the future of this country, these people are reprehensible, disgusting leeches and I have problem with democrats treating them that way.	1642711857.0	htiafa9	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hti26eb	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiafa9/

82wxt	I have read the article. The Atlantic wrote an article with a statistic I need to see so I will acknowledge it.   Let me get this straight:  “Sanders’s agenda—dismantling broken systems and replacing them with ones that benefit working-class people, regardless of race—is intimately bound up with the nation’s civil-rights legacy. But, some argue, Sanders has struggled to clearly articulate that connection in a way that earns black voters’ support.”  So I guess forget his legacy, his clear stance on racial equality throughout his political history and his desire to see working people’s voices heard including largely disadvantaged PoC, it wasn’t even his platform that was a problem it was essentially *the way he said it*  Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t that the main issue all the obtuse people (who claimed to be for racial equality) had with the BLM movement?  “His speeches were frequently interrupted by members of Black Lives Matter, who sought to push candidates to be more aggressive on racial issues. They attempted similar protests of Clinton but were stymied. (At least on one occasion, they were blocked at the door by Secret Service agents.) Clinton’s events were stage-managed to the finest detail; Sanders’s were more DIY and raucous.”  “Older black voters knew Clinton.”  So then in this line of logic should Sanders have been:  a) more inclusive of black voices and prioritize urgency of reform specific to PoC?  b) literally shut their protest out of the assembly Clinton style  The article seems to argue both at once. And if older black voters simply knew the name Clinton, not eager to believe that’s what locked their vote in specifically, because her policies and silencing clearly weren’t in the interests of the advancement of black people. It’s an incredibly narrow point of view to say *people literally voted for the name they knew because they weren’t specifically mentioned by Sanders enough in light of his history of position and action*.  And then in 2020 the answer to the Black Lives Matter movement and all the problems behind it was corporate joe and the tough-on-crime Kamala Harris? It was an incredibly tone-deaf decision made by people who weren’t keen on the support gained by the BLM movement.  Here’s a statistic for you:  In 2021 both New York and Los Angeles bolstered their police budget to higher than it had been before it was cut to appease the BLM movement.  That was at lot of the government’s response to the voices of the PoC.  I understand this is a digression. But I hardly think it is as simple as Sanders didn’t mention them enough so black people preferred Hilary.  And I also don’t believe it was that simple in the Biden-Sanders discussion either.	1642711885.0	htiai6m	t3_s89qqu	t1_hti3hf7	/r/politics/comments/s89qqu/biden_who_was_obamas_vp_says_i_did_not_anticipate/htiai6m/

Stupid and Pointless or B. Taking a swipe at them for (presumably) not voting dem.   People aren’t dumb. We know what is meant by it.   Unfortunately, just like “vote blue no matter who” it won’t actually convince anyone to vote that wasn’t already inclined to. It just pissed people off and makes them more resentful of the people saying it and the party they represent.   If Dems want people to show up and vote dem, they need to give them a tangible benefit to fight for. Not empty promises.

8821eteg	The global left-right scale is pretty well fixed after the past several hundred years of political debate. Things aren't left or right in relative terms *in comparison to other things*, they are left or right based on the underlying ideology itself in absolute terms.   Does the thing promote hierarchy and concentration of power among the few? Then it is at least right-of-center. If it promotes egalitarianism and decentralization of power, then it is at least left-of-center. Regardless of what Europe or Africa or Asia is doing.	1642711955.0	htiap5v	t3_s8j84w	t1_hti2f30	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htiap5v/

That sounds neat. But, sadly, they never turned this into legislation, and, even if they had, the national emergency is still underway.  In any event, what we have here is a pledge to support a plan from congress which has not landed on his desk. We _also_ have a plan to support HBCUs which he has already started to do on his own.	1642711960.0	htiaplo	t3_s8n9mp	t1_hthpibh	/r/politics/comments/s8n9mp/biden_ignores_question_on_whether_he_will_cancel/htiaplo/

If you set it 2 inches from the group Im sure he will stride right over. Set up a ribbon and cheer section- he did it!  I appreciate you are a Biden-Stan. That's great. We agree that Democrats are better than Republicans. I know you are upset I won't see the the same light as you and become an enlightened centrist and be happy with basic noninsane technocratic government. I'm much happier under that government than I am under fascists. I just see things differently from you.

94zxw	The Republican Party seems capable of enacting their agenda and robbed Merrick Garland of his Supreme Court position despite being in the minority; they seem plenty strong to me. Unless you meant we need an *honorable* Republican Party like they were thought of in the past, but the Republican Party has been following the same tactics they have been using for decades, because it has been the same leadership for decades. What strong Republican model are we going back to that was beneficial to our country? The one that supported stop and frisk, or the one that lied about the Iraq war? Or the one that lied the war in Afghanistan, or Vietnam? Was it when they were openly shaking hands with the KKK, or are you thinking before the southern switch in which case, why did we need Democrats that were trying to secede from the Union? Besides, if we want to go back to our founding fathers, they fought to secede from Britain because they wanted to keep their slaves (including George Washington). Is that the strength our country needs?  Our two party system is a one-party system that lies to us in two ways, and there’s always going to be a “1-party system” because there’s only 1 America that these fucking hacks are serving.	1642711970.0	htiaqn9	t3_s81gzq	t1_htgxyb2	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/htiaqn9/
8e4bv	It's not about intelligence, nor is it about race.  Before I begin, let me start by saying I am not really against presenting ID to vote, if we make that ID readily available. In my eyes, readily available means it's something you can acquire with, at most, 2 trips to somewhere within walking distance of your home, which has wide after-hours accessibility.  I can't speak for the whole country, but I think for my locale saying "anywhere you can buy a lottery ticket" would be reasonable.  The first thing to consider is who doesn't drive. The most common form of government ID is a driver's license. The least likely to drive fall into a few categories, mostly the elderly, the young (just turned 18, eligible, but didn't get a license yet, the poor, and in particular those who live in dense urban areas.  Even for someone who has had a valid ID at some point, it might be a challenge to keep it current. When you're working an hourly job that doesn't give time off, and especially if you don't drive, getting to the DMV for a renewed ID can be a challenge. You're talking about taking time off work, taking a bus or train to the DMV, waiting for hours, then maybe getting back to work. If they even allow the time off.  There are a whole lot of people out there who have expired IDs that would not be valid for voting, but who are otherwise eligible for voting. There was a time I was one of them, when my ID was expired and I didn't act to fix it, because I was already employed and didn't urgently need it.  I question the motives of anyone who thinks they should not be able to vote.	1642711970.0	htiaqle	t3_s8kua2	t1_hti1gzs	/r/politics/comments/s8kua2/mcconnell_waves_off_voting_concerns_since_black/htiaqle/

17ju0y	Yeah, I am old enough to remember that election. In fact, I cast my first ballot in that election. I really don't know why I forgot Bush hit the 50% mark.   And it should also be noted that if Kerry had received 120,000 more votes in Ohio he would have been President and Bush still would have received a majority of the popular vote. Alternatively, an additional 6,000 votes in New Mexico, 100,000 votes in Colorado and 22,000 votes in Nevada would have swung the election to Kerry. Or, if Kerry earned 6000 more votes in New Mexico, 22,000 more in Nevada, 10,100 more in Iowa, 55,200 in Nebraska's 2nd district, and we presume the faithless Kerry elector in Minnesota would not have been faithless if his vote influenced the election, then Kerry would have won the election.   Over 120 million people voted in the 2004 election. President Bush won the popular vote by a bit more than 3 million. And yet, there are three different scenarios in which the addition of less than 130,000 voters would swing the election to John Kerry. That is indefensible and goes to show that the Electoral College should not be defended on the basis of transient partisan advantage.	1642712191.0	htibclj	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hti3yj9	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/htibclj/

2usj0pc	>“If I were to go through the social media history of any young Texan I would find something I disagree with,” Huffines said in an emailed statement.  Well on the surface that kinda sounds reasonable enough. Maybe what the staffer said isn't so bad?  ...  >Republican gubernatorial candidate Don Huffines said Wednesday he will not fire a campaign staffer who said on his YouTube channel in 2020 that he wants to “restore historical American culture” by “maintaining a supermajority of the original stock of the United States, and maintaining a homogeneity,” referring to white people.   ...   On his YouTube channel, Colglazier warned that “we’re nearing the demographic cliff,” a reference to an increase of people of color gaining more political and economic power. On another livestream platform, he mocked a woman who appears to be Asian, saying she needed to be in China “getting the shit beat out of her by her husband.” In another post, he said, “I spit on George Floyd.”   ...   Colglazier, 24, a self-proclaimed “American nationalist,” previously worked for the far-right conspiracy site Infowars, owned by Alex Jones. While at InfoWars, he interviewed white supremacists such as Vincent James Foxx, who founded the now-banned alt-right Red Elephants site, and Faith Goldy, a conspiracy theorist who was fired from a conservative Canadian website for talking on a podcast hosted by the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer.   ...   Political Research Associates, a social justice think tank, first reported evidence of Colglazier’s connections to the “America First/Groyper” movement on Friday. So-called Groypers make up an alt-right network of people who advocate for a majority white, Christian nation and identify as American nationalists. They coalesce around their support of Nick Fuentes, a white supremist podcaster who has been banned from Twitter, YouTube and the streaming platform DLive for violating hate speech policies.  ...Ho-lee Jeezus.  Republicans are openly, and brazenly, hiring and shielding white supremacists.	1642712192.0	htibcro	t3_s8sd68	t3_s8sd68	/r/politics/comments/s8sd68/texas_gop_gubernatorial_candidate_says_he_wont/htibcro/

449244el	I literally said he lost so im now questioning your literacy but there is some proof outlined by Crowder in one of his shows. However, what he outlined was nowhere near enough to change the results.  Yes. I'm against murder so that's a restriction and something I won't do. You ignore most of what I said to nitpick single lines without their original context. I said I was against murder and it somehow turned into you saying I'm restricting others from murder? That seems reasonable.  The left wants to control everything you do or say. They censor, cancel and destroy anyone that speaks out against them. They burn and murder their way to their goal.  Personal freedom is the antithesis of leftism now. You have to tow the line, believe what they do or you're an outcast and deserve the gulag as some TV hosts have suggested.   I believe in freedom to choose not freedom from consequence. You want to shoot up heroin? Go ahead. But you deal with the consequences of that, not everyone else.   I believe the 1/6 rioters who committed violence belong in prison. I also believe the Antifa rioters and murderers who killed 30+ innocent people over a year of terror also belong in prison.

qdhpo	Really excellent comment. The insidious thing about the GOP, which often pretends that its individual actors are outside of the rigged corrupt system, is that they will then use the mechanisms of that rigged system to punish their political enemies. You can almost guarantee that if they win the House and/or Senate that they will launch a counter panel to investigate the "false flag" January 6 operation and will not hesitate to subpoena anyone they're going to pretend was involved. They will probably also impeach Biden for some stupid reason.   They love to pretend they're anti-government but have no problem using any and all of its powers to get what they want. The added bonus for them is that after the GOP uses those mechanisms of power they cheapen them for anyone following. What kind of weight will impeachment have if they do it to Biden for no real reason? None, it'll just be another means for them to smear those they don't want to share power with.	1642712270.0	htibk9s	t3_s8kerl	t1_htgud01	/r/politics/comments/s8kerl/congress_receives_jan_6_documents_trump_fought_to/htibk9s/

The problem is that the framers got their inspiration for a democratic republic from indigenous American societies, particularly those in the Eastern Woodlands. There is no similar inspiration, or more specifically example of how to live in a different way - in a just and free society - because we exterminated any people that were not living like Europeans.   We need a system that provides real freedoms - the freedom to say no to authority, the freedom to move about without impediment, and the freedom to create and transform social relationships. Democracy has merely provided promised freedoms that are never truly enacted for the broad mass of people.	1642713941.0	htig7li	t3_s8jxsk	t1_hti9h7r	/r/politics/comments/s8jxsk/americas_coming_age_of_instability_why/htig7li/

That will provide the kind of solid evidence needed to take the unprecedented step of prosecuting sitting Congressmen and a former President for sedition. The major complication to this plan is that federal convictions can be federally pardoned, so many will think the threats of decades in prison are empty, as they see their possible sentence as only lasting until the next time a Republican President is voted in (or simply declared the winner by enough GOP legislatures that have passed laws giving themselves the power to overturn the popular vote).	1642713994.0	htigcy5	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hti0ock	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htigcy5/

However, literally every reason that was touted as why Biden should have been the nominee has been proven false. He doesn’t get things done in Congress. Republicans won’t work with him. He hasn’t united anyone. The country is still broken. Covid is still rampaging.   I also completely acknowledge that he’s not a dictator and without a fully united Dem senate caucus, his agenda is dead and the party is going to get boatraced in the fall. Just really really unfortunate that most of the Dem senate candidates in 2020 turned out to be so awful.

31var3l8	In college I did a presentation and another time an essay on gun violence and I encountered the study by the NRA and MANY critiquing it. The NRA claims that guns are used all the time in self-defense. Other studies point out that the NRA data is literally self-reported. And upon further investigation found that most cases of "self-defense" were actually illegal and unjustified acts of aggression involving a firearm.

Democrats not only stand for something, are actively trying to push legislation through, and HAVE pushed legislation through, but it looks very stark in comparison to no accomplishments and no agenda.   it begs the questions of why anyone should elect republicans? if they dont stand for anything what are they doing in washington? thats a great way to unsettle republicans AND have a practical conversation about what people actually want the government to do  1) the GOP literally does not have an agenda on their website, and   2) there was JUST a story about a [governor turning down a senate seat because the GOP told him they dont do anything.](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/chris-sununu-governor-new-hampshire-turned-down-senate-bid-gop-senators-do-nothing)  imo its hard to win any kind of argument right now considering everyone is pissed about covid. their gripe isnt necessarily with the government as much as its with our situation as a whole.	1642714225.0	htih00g	t3_s8o98i	t1_hthgu4u	/r/politics/comments/s8o98i/dnc_hits_gop_for_having_no_agenda_echoing_biden/htih00g/

11aacj	You are reading what you want into what I say. I didn't use examples because I didn't call the court explicitly political. I simply said ruling in ways that make both parties unhappy at times doesn't necessarily mean they aren't political. This thread is about the Trump case, and you talked about it, too, so thats why I said specifically, if they had ruled in favor of Trump in this case, it wouldn't have been a *political* ruling. It would have been far worse than that and a ruling made in loyalty to Trump himself. Not doing that just means they are committed to not doing what one person wants, not that they are apolitical. If what I'm saying seems "purely political" to you, it's because you can't handle the fact that people who *were* appointed to rule on a specific political agenda are being judged, since I very purposely did not say they were being political, since I know your game.  If you want to pretend the justices are all 9 people who have absolutely no personal opinion and make no judgements based on that opinion, I don't know what to tell you. The constitution is obviously up for interpretation in many ways, which is the whole point of the SCOTUS. If there was no personal interpretation involved, we would not need a SCOTUS in the first place.	1642714260.0	htih3hg	t3_s84jxv	t1_htf65q3	/r/politics/comments/s84jxv/megathread_supreme_court_rejects_trumps_request/htih3hg/

1kjg83fl	One of the reasons I was disappointed in the House's rush to impeach after January 6th was that there was a lot of conjecture, but little evidence as to Trump's role in the Capitol attack.  (I will admit there was more than just a small part of me that wanted Trump to resign, largely because I wanted to know whether Disney would build a Mike Pence animatronic for his two week Presidency).    But I digress.  The impeachment seemed rushed and more of a political stunt than a serious attempt to restrict his ability to run for office again.  I had hoped an investigation into Trump's actions would have been conducted first to prove he incited the attack, which may* have taken some of the politics out of the proceedings.  *To be fair, with the number of people still defending him, I am not sure what evidence would be enough to convince them of Trump's culpability.	1642714276.0	htih54r	t3_s8hjgf	t3_s8hjgf	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/htih54r/

Veterans had to use guns for reasons most of us are fortunate enough to avoid. It’s something I imagine many would like to forget.

They say they do Cannabis, not marijuana, and if you say how it's the same thing just a different name, they counter that they don't want to argue about it but they were raised not to use marijuana but cannabis is fine.    They're looking for a loophole and I'm just glad that they've moved at least that far from the conservative opinions about it that I don't press the issue.

vk79v	I mean, the outcome of existing rules is that congressmen spend most of their time fundraising. They just also decide to not show up to vote sometimes.  Freeing up more congressional time while also making it easier to represent constituents *should* result in the outcome of a higher percentage of votes cast, and less tax dollars wasted on travel.  I’m trying to highlight to you that the outcome of existing rules is inefficiency, and any potential selfish action could be posited anywhere as a counterpoint.

I wouldn't call myself a socialist, but I also wouldn't describe socialism as a religion  or as 'leftist bourgeoisie'.

If she moved first without consensus, it could either discredited or embarrassed other members (like if she had proposed something that later looks like it was watered down). But if they pressure her, she won’t stand in the way.

From the article;  "Airing a graphic that featured AT&T's customer support number and a picture of AT&T chairman William Kennard, Ball noted that Kennard had "connections to the Obamas and Clintons for decades."...  "If you have any dirt on Mr. Kennard, I'd love to see it and put it on this program," the Real America host exclaimed.  "You bring me concrete evidence of whatever it may be: cheating on his taxes, cheating on his wife, saying racial slurs against white people," Ball added, unsubtly referencing the fact that Kennard is Black. "Whatever it may be. Find it for me. Bring it, and we will air it."  He wrapped his plea by saying, "Everybody's got dirty little sins and secrets they're hiding" and that Kennard "deserves to have his exposed" over DirecTV deciding to cut ties with One America News."	1642714494.0	htihrjk	t3_s8tk81	t3_s8tk81	/r/politics/comments/s8tk81/oan_panics_as_directv_drops_network_asks_viewers/htihrjk/

The scale of gerrymanderring that republicans are up to, the voter suppression, the restrictions on voting carried out by their state legislatures, they don’t need to ditch the constitution. They will just run elections in such a way that it’s impossible to beat them. Once they get back control of the senate and Congress, they can install who they want in the White House.   They may even keep the election cycles and pageantry associated with it, but they will never let the Dems or any other pro-democracy party get a foothold.	1642714495.0	htihrnr	t3_s8lthr	t1_hthj8bv	/r/politics/comments/s8lthr/why_manchin_and_sinema_will_be_the_last/htihrnr/

7dltm	I don't understand how this isn't an attempted coup.  They had a plot to overthrow the results of a legitimate election and even started carrying out that plot by selecting illegitimate electors.  Presumably, if Mike Pence had gone along with it, the illegitimate electors would been seated, voted and he would have supported the illegitimate results.  After that, everything is completely FUBAR.  The courts would get involved and, if it's not sorted out, who knows what happens on January 20th.  Maybe things eventually get sorted out and Biden becomes president anyway, but not before our democracy's legitimacy is shredded.  But, I guess we're just going to let this go because I guess it would be too "divisive" to punish politicians who plot to overthrow the US government.  So, now the next ambitious fellow (or the same ones) can plot their overthrow knowing if he succeeds, he wins, and if he fails, nothing much happens.	1642714639.0	htii66d	t3_s8t3bw	t3_s8t3bw	/r/politics/comments/s8t3bw/trump_campaign_officials_led_by_rudy_giuliani/htii66d/

5r1dh	Most of the slowdowns, reworks, and working with Republicans have been as a result of Joe Manchin publicly stepping forward to say things like he won't support the original bills because Republicans won't agree.  Biden, for whatever its worth, has been trying to pass his agenda but has to get Manchin and Sinema on board with everything.

This isn't something she's going to necessarily support, certainly not in private, when trying to get the Caucus on board with voting for bills.  I'll believe she's actually on board and not trying to just kick the can and blame to the rest of Congress when a stock trading ban actually passes.

3bbmh	Technically speaking, Trump was deliberately planting the seeds of doubt regarding our Democracy as far back as 2015 (attacking Obama notwithstanding). From all outward indicators, his goal seemed to destabilize America as much as possible, and he seemed just as shocked as the rest of us with an IQ over 78 when he won, which kind of shot his destabilization efforts furtherance in the foot. When it became evident that he would unlikely win a second term, and eventually lose the next election, that's when he put his original plan of doubt and destabilization back on track. I'm not saying he is working for the Russians to gain financial favors or to avoid blackmail. I'm just saying he is attacking American Democracy for reasons that seem to be in direct alignment with the former Soviet Union, and now Putin's Russia.

110zfm	Terrible source, but something to take note of:  “Georgia has been recognized number one for election integrity,” noted Raffensperger, referring to a recent report from the Heritage Foundation. “We’re recognized for our accessibility, but we’re also recognized that we have appropriate guardrails, so everyone knows that we have safe and secure elections — we have struck the proper balance,” he continued.  Biden has made it clear that voting in all states are both safe and secure.  There’s no issue or complaint here. The issue that Biden has brought up is the legitimacy of our elections due to VOTER SUPPRESSION.  This meaning, if all eligible voters are not able to vote equal as easy as others, there is a problem.  If rules have been put into place for the explicit purpose of making voting vastly more difficult for specifically targeted groups or demographics, that casts a doubt on the true will of the people, which is the foundation of our democracy.  This is a fair and valid criticism of the roadblocks that the state of Georgia has put into place in order to win or be more competitive in statewide races.  Per the Heritage Foundation, whom the article cited and which is a conservative think tank, the state has struck a balance between election security and election accessibility.  They have only made efforts to make elections less accessible and done nothing to support security.  Ensuring paper ballot backups as well as email ballot confirmations would do wonders for security….if that was actually the goal.	1642714767.0	htiiiu0	t3_s8svsc	t3_s8svsc	/r/politics/comments/s8svsc/georgia_secretary_of_state_takes_biden_to_task/htiiiu0/

Both sides may not be the same, but the folks who keep vocally supporting corporatists like Hillary and Biden are every bit to blame for the current state of bullshit as the ones who voted for Trump.

y25cy	I'd be more disturbed. However, you can look back to the media landscape that lead to World War II. Also, I believe just a little bit farther back in European history is the media landscape before the French Revolution (Jean-Paul Marat is the example I'm most familiar with). In the US, we're talking decades of right wing propaganda accelerated by social media in an unprecedented fashion.  Our sources of shared truth have been both starved and polluted. I see it every time I'm able to peel back the cover on who people I debate with listen to. You can't even argue facts because that's not what's motivating people: it's who they identify with and social cognition.  Going back to the historical aspect, I'm less disturbed and more worried.	1642714950.0	htij19j	t3_s8llck	t1_htig5lc	/r/politics/comments/s8llck/bidens_approval_has_declined_across_the_board/htij19j/

You have to put personnel and equipment beforehand in the potential combat zone or you're going to get taken completely flat-footed when the conflict starts. A surprise, fast offensive using guided weapons would wipe out most of the Ukrainian military before the U.S and allies could scramble a sizeable force to go against them.   We need NATO military forces in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, if not in country in order to counteract any offensives by Russia. It's not "Sabre-rattling", it's being proactive about not letting the Russians have the ability to steamroll Ukraine before Western military forces have time to react.	1642714975.0	htij3tk	t3_s8l88m	t1_htihi06	/r/politics/comments/s8l88m/discussion_thread_secretary_of_state_antony/htij3tk/

Which is sorta sheds light on it. She voted in favor of voting rights.  'The vote on the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act was 49-51. It broke evenly along party lines, but Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., switched his vote to "no" in the end for procedural reasons. It fell short of the 60 votes needed to defeat a filibuster under Senate rules.'  But she voted against making changes to filibuster. Which is stated here.  'The Senate then voted down a motion by Democrats to [change the rules] and impose a "talking filibuster" aimed at passing the legislation without Republican support once debate ends. The result was 48-52, falling short of the 50 votes needed to succeed, with Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona voting with Republicans to reject the rule change.'   She didn't actually vote against voting rights. She voted against the way to achieve that through passing other legislation. Which changes the context of this story.	1642715009.0	htij7a9	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htiicde	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htij7a9/

3ta39	It seems quite plausible to me that the rotating villain theory is true. Time and again, it seems on every fight, that Dems are consistently losing. They lose so frequently, so embarrassingly, that this seems more like a scripted WWE fight that the Dem is determined ahead of time to lose. What’s more plausible: the Dems have not one single person smart enough to strategize and scheme to come up with plans as well as McConnell that makes them lose just about every political battle in the past 20 years…. or that they’re scripted to lose?  I hope I’m wrong but the consistent ineptness of the Dem Party is hard to explain any other way. Yes, I know the Dem party isn’t just one party and harder to stand unified against the one-minded GOP but that still doesn’t explain it. Battle after battle lost to McConnell’s evil fuckery for almost the entirety of the 21st century so far. Much of it not due to certain factions within the Dem party disagreeing on the issue.	1642715127.0	htijj4l	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htiakt8	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htijj4l/

They both served and protected the same corporate interests that entire time.   Just because the Democrats are just-now trying to seem progressive in a post-Obama political sphere means nothing when they keep getting it wrong and tripping over their own clown shoes. The sooner the party purges the neo-liberal old guard and adopts a genuinely progressive platform, they’re going to continue to defeat themselves at every possible turn.	1642715151.0	htijlk6	t3_s8ov89	t1_htifpfh	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/htijlk6/

12bnj6	Guess who has spread this "perception"? This is a "perception" that has been entirely manufactured by people like Trump, specifically to limit the amount of people that can vote and keep their minority rule going.  If bad agents - perhaps sellers of "alternative medicine", say - spread lies about how, I dunno, hospitals are carcinogenic, and embark on a campaign to ban hospitals, then the argument you're making here would be transposed in that situation as: since *some people (baselessly) perceive that hospitals are dangerous, means we need to ban hospitals.* It would not be based on reality, it would be based on dangerous lies.  Your logic is circular. Your only argument for this is that "some people said" there was election fraud. Guess who benefits from saying these things? That's right, the minority party who can be voted out if the majority can vote unhindered.  If you want to add more laws that restrict people's rights, *you need to justify those laws.* This is especially important in the case of laws that affect the very core of a functioning democracy, such as voting. Saying "people like me believe cheating is going on", without proof, based on obvious opportunism, is not going to cut it.	1642715227.0	htijt5g	t3_s8kt4k	t1_hti8vfr	/r/politics/comments/s8kt4k/gop_states_are_shredding_voting_rights_and_joe/htijt5g/

evjtj	The problem is you don't have proportional representation like you do in Europe. You have a system that forces a binary.  Second, Senators CANNOT be recalled by, get this, FEDERAL law - [https://www.cga.ct.gov/PS98/rpt%5Colr%5Chtm/98-R-1540.htm](https://www.cga.ct.gov/PS98/rpt%5Colr%5Chtm/98-R-1540.htm)  >You want to know whether voters in a state can recall a member of the United States Congress.        No, they cannot. Any attempt by a state to recall a member of Congress is prohibited by the Federal Constitution. A vacancy in the office of U.S. senator or representative can be created only by the incumbent's death or resignation, the expiration of his term, or some direct action of the body (the Senate or the House of Representatives) which is empowered to expel members (Burton v. U.S. 202 US 344, at 369). There is no constitutional authority to hold a special election that would be required to fill a seat in the event a member was recalled. Article I, section 4 of the Federal Constitution relating to the time for holding a regular election and Article XVII of the Amendments on holding a special election only when a vacancy exists combine to preclude an election to replace a member of Congress who had been recalled. Federal constitutional provisions supersede any state recall procedures for these offices.        The details of the argument are included in the attached Brief on the Constitutionality of the Recall of United States Senators and Representatives In Congress, prepared by Hon. Walter F. George, Chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections, United States Senate, on May 18, 1935.  Each body (Congress and the Senate) CAN expel their own members, but guess how often that happens, under what circumstances and how many votes are needed?	1642715322.0	htik2bx	t3_s8hzd8	t1_hth6z93	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/htik2bx/

The civil rights act was around 58 years ago before that slavery was legal for 240+ years…this country ended slavery and allowed Government sanctioned racism on the black community all the way until 1964. So why the fuck would a country with two century’s worth of hate just stop being racist? So over 58 years we supposedly overcame 200+ years of hate? Hard to believe.

He could have thrown a perfect game, scored 70 points, and still many would blame him for the loss when the defense gives up 71.

ehzlknsc	ok so when you have to compete with people that have actual skill, but you instead spent the last 60+ years being a complete moron and, you damn well know you can't compete against the smarties?  You lie as fast as humanly possible, doesn't matter if it's small or huge. Consistency is the thing. Creating an environment, is the thing. Creating an enemy from nothing, is the thing. Scapegoating, is the thing....  there's a reason the smart people in this nation voted for who they did. There's a reason they (me included) should feel good about some things in life. One of them being that we kicked that shit bag to the curb AND he had to cheat + break TONS of laws + gets others to break TONS of laws......for what?  They lost all branches. The current problem is whether we can keep it that way. Hell I still get a huge kick out of asking a Republican-voter friend of mine "Wait a sec....I forgot, who is the current President? You have a government job, **so you have to write that type of stuff down a lot. I'm a bit lost, so...who is the current President?**"  Sends him into pre-heart attack rage and I just laugh at him.

They can't trust even the blacks --after all, the majority of blacks WANT voter-ID to vote. They're rushing things because at some point, blacks will realize that crumbs of favoritism are insults of the tokenism they rejected in the 1960s. Latins are already majority fed-up.

It can be hard.  To get fired, you have to do something egregiously bad, like be caught lying about something serious, falsifying records, or violating some sort of clear cut company ethics or safety policy.

bqvdx	>It seems quite plausible to me that the rotating villain theory is true. Time and again, it seems on every fight, that Dems are consistently losing. They lose so frequently, so embarrassingly, that this seems more like a scripted WWE fight that the Dem is determined ahead of time to lose. What’s more plausible: the Dems have not one single person smart enough to strategize and scheme to come up with plans as well as McConnell that makes them lose just about every political battle in the past 20 years…. or that they’re scripted to lose?  You're forgetting that congressional majorities - and the size and length of those majorities - matters. This is the closest-split congress of our lifetimes, and Biden is pushing a *relatively* progressive agenda that zero Republicans will support. Republicans have never passed strong conservative legislation without strong majorities in congress, so why would you expect that democrats could pass big legislation without a big majority?  Democrats didn't lose legislative battles when they had a supermajority in 2009. They passed tons of stuff including Obomacare, and it backfired because the GOP ran on the Tea Party message of "this is radical socialism" and won a huge house majority that then allowed them to keep democrats from doing anything for the next 6 years, then they won an even bigger majority in 2016.   Funny how winning more seats is correlated with being able to do more things, eh?  >I hope I’m wrong but the consistent ineptness of the Dem Party is hard to explain any other way.  How come you ignore how good the democrats were at playing defense under Trump? They were able to block basically all GOP legislation other than the tax breaks. And how come you ignore how bad McConnel was at playing offense and getting anything passed?  This is because it's far easier to obstruct in congress than to pass things (filibuster!), so McConnell looks like a genius because all he has to do is say he's filibustering something and then whoops, he "wins." Democrats did exactly the same thing and got no credit for it.	1642715577.0	htikrl6	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htijj4l	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htikrl6/

We must address the disease itself, to protect our democracy, and it cannot be done by one party alone."  Her reason is that she believes making not exceptions for the filibuster is more important than protecting voting rights, despite the fact that she's already approved exceptions for the debt ceiling and Republicans who eagerly made exceptions for Supreme Court picks. Her position boils down to, "**If Republicans don't want something, it cannot be done**"; **"allowing Dems to make exceptions to the filibuster rule like we have done 160 times already is a greater threat to democracy than allowing states to literally restrict democracy."**  I am eagerly looking forward to hearing what you think her justified reasoning is for this, while recognizing that it is very responsible of you to withhold your important judgement on this matter which has been settled since the first time Sinema came out against her party's elected agenda.	1642715591.0	htiksz6	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htij7a9	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiksz6/

I reiterate: if you want to limit people's essential rights, you need to *prove* that there is good reason for it. There has been no proof that voter fraud is a widespread problem. Therefore, laws against voter fraud are useless, fear-mongering, and in this case fundamentally undemocratic, laws. They solve a problem that *does not exist*.

It is true that she fought for universal healthcare back in the 90's, but failed to get it to pass. So did Pelosi, at one time. Now they both think it's a pipe dream and shit on people who try to pass it or any other moderately left policy. They are Neoliberal to their core.  Glad your feels are above the reals. Perhaps Clinton and Pelosi call it a pipedream because they both have first hand experience trying to get it passed.

If a Republican prevents 100,000 Americans from voting on election day, he gets to do it over and over until he decides to retire.  And if the courts decide that the action the Republican took was "voter suppression" and strikes down the law, he still gets to say in office and will just reword the law slightly and pass it again.

The oligarchs aren't a homogenous blob, they're individuals who occasionally have disputes between each other, Putin is no different. Individuals being imprisoned or killed doesn't change the fact that Putin needs the overall support of the  people who hold the majority of the power in the country in order to stay in power.

92z2w8bz	Maybe youre in the boomer generation or out-of-touch if you think goofy is an insult.  [Here's the slang definition of goofy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=goofy)  Elizabeth Warren seems like the few politicians who you can have a conversation and not be bored and actually entertained and maybe laugh WITH her regardless of her ideology. Basically she acts like a human being compared to most politicians of all ideologies, genders and race, who act like robots that just spew the same old words theyve been made to say via media training. She's basically the cool aunt. Very few hate the cool aunt unless you got the amicability of Kamala or..you.

if5mu1su	This is a great example of confirmation bias. People on the left love to call out people on the right for this, so this is a good opportunity for people on the left to be wary of their own thoughts and biases as well. When Mich McConnell said "African Americans vs Americans" did he mean:  1. "African Americans vs All Americans" (A common statistical comparison)  2. "African Americans vs True Americans" (A very public offensive statement)  A right-biased or an unbiased person would assume the most likely interpretation: Option 1.  A person who is biased against McConnell would assume the worst possible interpretation: Option 2.  If you are a democrat, there are plenty of legitimate things to be upset with McConnell about, but this is just an example of confirmation bias in action. Something we can all overcome with a little critical thinking.	1642715727.0	htil67k	t3_s8ji6u	t3_s8ji6u	/r/politics/comments/s8ji6u/mcconnell_comparing_african_americans_and/htil67k/

We do need to focus on lgbtq+ because their rights are being trampled, but what if forcing them to answer that question makes their terrible attempt to control bodies of people more obvious to their iffy constituents?

675cyubt	Let me tell you about Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana.  The single worst moment of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings was when Kennedy was asking Kavanaugh to disavow Blasey Ford’s allegations:  > Kennedy: None of these allegations are true?  > Kavanaugh: Correct.  > Kennedy: No doubt in your mind -  > Kavanaugh: Zero. I’m 100% certain.  > Kennedy: - that even a, a scintilla? Do you.. (pause for dramatic effect) SWEAR TO GOD?  > Kavanaugh: I swear to God.  > Kennedy: That is all I have, judge.  Now, meanwhile, what questions did Kennedy ask Blasey Ford? Nothing. *Zero.* Not *one goddamn question.* He didn’t give her an opportunity to ***SWEAR TO GOD?*** that her testimony was true. Because he didn’t give even the smallest fuck.   It is extremely difficult to imagine any more brazen, deliberate mockery of a fact-finding process than *taking one side at their word* and dismissing the other side’s testimony without asking a single goddamn question.  Mortifying. Appalling. Outrageous. Overtly and obviously biased toward the accused. The people of Louisiana should be deeply, permanently ashamed that this person ever represented them in the United States Senate.	1642715795.0	htilcqp	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hth91q2	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htilcqp/

Kudos to you for properly parsing out that the complaint should not be that we are not a democracy (we are), its that the process has been corrupted to allow for unequal representation in government.   That makes the process undemocratic, but does not stop our form of government from being a democracy.  Hell, even Russia is widely seen as a democracy, it is just a sham autocratic democracy.

gs3em	I think you're misunderstanding. It's not stupidity or incompetence, even though at times, I agree, it does look like that, because of just how little they're doing things, how little effort they're putting into things, or what they're saying or how they're saying it. The fact that they look stupid or incompetent is also, in part, because the politicians they have speaking to us, are just terrible at selling bullshit. We have a lot of them, they just suck at that aspect of their job, which is to sell it to the public. But they definitely do know what they're doing in general, and they're making very conscious choices. Do you think they don't have strategists who can come up with some decent or even excellent messaging to counter the CRT crap? Of course they do. If they wanted to create a strategic message about CRT, they absolutely could do that, but they haven't, because they don't care enough to bother with it.   They are providing us with literally the absolute bare minimum of performance politics so they can pretend that they're doing their job for us. And when I say they don't care, I mean it very literally. They're fine with looking or sounding stupid or incompetent because they really do not care what we think about them. A lot of what would sell better, and cost them and their donor/masters nothing, would take more effort than they care to put into it, they have to run it by their masters for permission, too much work and they're busy doing stuff for their real masters, big business, corporations, and oligarchs.  These politicians, all of their personal futures will be just fine, win or lose, they end up doing the job their corporate masters told them to do while in office, and they get paid for that like it is an actual job.  So they don't even care that what they're selling is coming across as garbage, they've done their job which is protect the corporate masters interest, and progress their master's agendas, and their last and least important responsibility blabber something to the public to keep up a crappy façade. It is so poorly presented, that it really signifies a shift in how little they care about what we think. It's symbolic of how much power corporations and big business really has now, so powerful they don't even need us to like the puppets they let us elect.   These politicians are all incredibly rich. They are making themselves tons of money every day doing this shitty little show for us. While they're making money hand over fist in office, they're also playing the stock market, often with some nice insider tips. Their kids are getting rich too, because they can have whatever job they want whether or not they're qualified, because those are the benefits their masters offer to them for the jobs give them. When they leave office, they have formal jobs waiting for them if they want. They continue increasing their wealth with the stock market, and get offered favor gigs like speeches or stupid appearance, etc, paid for you by X corporation donor who is one of the masters who told them what to do when they were in office. This is the swamp... That's why they call it the swamp, it's scuzzy and gross. And this is also part of the revolving door, because there's always a door to walk through for another job, and more money at this level of politics.   And when it comes to not caring about winning, I mean that as well. Their corporate masters tell them what they're allowed to do, what they can focus on, how engage the public on which issues. They dictate most of the priorities and what is important and what they want these politicians working on at any given time, and these politicians know full well that refusing to addresss issues their constituents care about will hurt them, maybe even lose them their office. But it doesn't matter, they don't want to lose necessarily, but they're also ok if it does happen, because everything is all lined up nice and tidy for them if they go. It's part of their job benefits, and they will be taken care of if they and when they leave. So every speech is all about what the corporate assholes don't want discussed, or made policy, not whether or not they will win or lose an election, those are guidelines set in what our politicians present to us. Of course, their masters do let them dangle some tasty looking fruit once in a while, give us a glimpse of something they could get us that would help us, but most of the time, they throw the fruit away and say "sorry, i tried." That's why when they poll the top ten issues americans are concerned with, they don't address most of them, because the masters said NO, that's my profit in that privatized healthcare people want to change, that my profit in anything they want. So the issues they did agree politicians could use as a prop for them to use to convince us they're trying to help gets shelved. and all is good in corporate world, it didn't pass, but hey, that politician tried really hard huh.  They definitely give them a lot more leeway during some of the actual campaigning, this is when they can finally talk about stuff we care about, because their masters say sure, you can fake sell that for the campaign and then refuse to address it if you win. You see that in every single presidential election. It's the bait and switch. It's standard. Why else would they do it? Campaign on it and then never talk about it again? We all know this right? That the issues we care about disappear because of their donors...  That is our system. This is how it works now. It took a while to get as bad as it is right now, this poorly presented, this frickin obvious, but we're here.  It doesn't help that Biden is a terrible speaker and has zero energy or charisma about him, but they don't care, it doesn't matter to them, only what they want matters, and he was the only option for getting what they want.  So Biden blah blah's through what he's allowed or told to say, it's usually a bunch of meaningless rhetoric, but he sucks at selling it so it comes off even worse than typical empty political rhetoric. Biden is probably one of the worst presidents in term of selling bullshit to the public I've ever seen, but his masters don't care, and the dems don't care because their donor/masters don't care, the bullshit performance just needs to get done, it seems merely perfunctory at this point. Which in terms of the overall state of our government and the power big business has over it, is not a good sign at all.  It's not incompetence and stupidity, it's systemic corruption and greed, combined with an all new level of not giving a shit about what we think at all. They are even going through the motions, like the pretending to be a politician working for the people has just gotten too burdensome and unnecessary, and while most politicking at this level was always pretending, it was just done better than now, they tried harder, and they definitely cared more if people were unhappy. But now, it seems like they don't care how awful they appear as they peddle their political wares to us, or how disapproving we are of their performance, because they don't change a thing about what they're doing, or how they're selling, or even just pick another issue to sell a message about for mere distraction's sake. They don't care if  we react really badly to all their crappiness and failures. They don't even care if their poorly executed drivel may lead to losing an election, because the end goal is not winning an election or getting our approval or passing policy we care about... the end goal is that their donor/masters keep their power and money and get more power and money and more of whatever they want, and more and more and more...	1642715965.0	htilta1	t3_s8hzd8	t1_htgu3au	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/htilta1/

5r4vxvvo	You have a basic misunderstanding of what the plan is.   The United States is not planning on fighting a war for Ukraine. They are planning to offer materiel and support to the Ukrainian forces and to conduct cyber warfare operations against Russia and to enact global sanctioned against Russian leadership.   There would be no purpose in deploying more American or NATO forces to Ukraine. It would be sabre rattling, just saying "Oh don't mess with me, I'm ready for a fight, too!" It also is an escalation of the situation. Russia is under no threat (whether Russians know that is another question), so Putin can order forces withdrawn without appearing to have backed down. But once NATO or American forces are there he's trapped.	1642715988.0	htilvi8	t3_s8l88m	t1_htij3tk	/r/politics/comments/s8l88m/discussion_thread_secretary_of_state_antony/htilvi8/

If it’s a tool of the true Democratic Practice IE Democracy what’s changed that it needs to be removed??? This republic was founded on debate. This push for a One Voice Government is the Tyranny the Founding Fathers warned us about. Read about it and for the record for a Filibuster was D Sen Robert Byrd and it lasted 73 days.

However, I believe that he has a lot of valuable experience and knowledge that could be very helpful in the White House. I also think that he has shown himself to be a pretty bold thinker at times - for example, his focus on infrastructure development as a way to create jobs and improve the economy. I would like to see him be a bit bolder in his foreign policy as well - for example, by being more open to working with Russia and China.	1642716103.0	htim6qu	t3_s8ttsa	t3_s8ttsa	/r/politics/comments/s8ttsa/america_needs_a_bolder_biden_a_year_in_his/htim6qu/

Foreign Policy, Heading the Agencies and Selecting New Judges. Then came COVID and I was also looking for someone to handle the virus with the best possible outcome.  It's not any Presidents job to magically make or force Congress into doing something.  There's not much "appeal" to reaching across the aisle. There's no aisle to reach across. It's the Presidency. The only aisle to work against is how best to use the FBI, CIA, IRS, the armed services and so forth.  Also, the democrats did get a couple of bigger ticket items done with bipartisanship. But I don't exect the President to reach across the aisle on anything.

It sucks that the other party has abandoned those values right now, but I'm not sure everyone abandoning them is the best path to actually preserving the country and prevent it "coming apart at the seams."  I really don't know how to get everyone back to thinking like we're a United country (this has been festering for decades after all), but I don't feel like throwing up our hands and saying "fine, we'll be as bad as you are" is likely to be the shortest path to success.	1642716134.0	htim9o1	t3_s8ril5	t1_hti818w	/r/politics/comments/s8ril5/im_not_bernie_sanders_im_a_mainstream_democrat/htim9o1/

my767	Never said you were a flat earther. What I said was that, according to your logic that schools need to listen to the parents with firmly held beliefs that masks don’t work and end mask mandates, it’s only fair that schools also listen to the parents with firmly held beliefs that the earth is flat and want flat earth theories taught in class. Not that those parents should instill those ideas in their own free time. But that public schools, paid for by public funds, should teach that the earth is flat. That is the end result of your argument. Because it’s all about listening to the parents, right?  But never mind that part. Never mind that you’re demanding numbers from me without providing any proof of your own argument. Let’s skip to the end. I’ve seen a lot of absolutely crazy arguments on Reddit.

rqlxi	> The US Democratic Party is a liberal party that pays lip service to some social democratic ideas to appease those non-liberal members of their party, but generally implements liberal policies when it holds power that other liberal parties in peer democracies, universally recognized as centrist within their own systems, would feel quite comfortable endorsing.  I think this is a function of the structure of federal policymaking than the ideology of the party. Our system makes it hard for the party in power to make policy changes without broad support, particularly when those changes involve increases in government spending.   I would argue that many democrats ideologically agree with more progressive positions but recognize that their preferred policies are not politically viable. I think they make a value-driven choice to devote their limited political capital to more moderate policies that address their areas of ideological concern as much as possible while still having a chance of actually becoming law.	1642716225.0	htimifg	t3_s8j84w	t1_hthkwa4	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htimifg/

if5mu1su	It's a very common statistical comparison. You take the data on a subset of the population (African Americans in this case) and you compare it to the data on the broader population to look for trends (voting rates in this case) in order to gain insight into that demographic or identify potential problems with society.  It could have as easily been blue-eyed men vs all men or people with cavities vs all people. But in this case, a politician was countering an argument on voting rights legislation about how minority voting rights were negatively impacted. He said they were not negatively impacted using a comparison of minorities vs the overall population to show rates were similar. His comparison was 100% relevant to the legislation and arguments being put forth. I can't speak to whether his data was accurate, but there was nothing wrong with discussing the statistic.	1642716266.0	htimmdn	t3_s8ji6u	t1_htgzo39	/r/politics/comments/s8ji6u/mcconnell_comparing_african_americans_and/htimmdn/

cu6ff4x1	My loyalty is to justice and truth. Republicans are as corrupt as Democrats in DC. I am fed up with the narrative that "whites" were slave owners, etc.. Skin color attached to bad behavior is silly and wrong. Democrats owned ALL the slaves. THAT is a historical fact. They preferred a civil war over losing their economic power via slavery. George SR and George JR were corrupt. Your assumption tells me you are partial to Democrats.

geqbc	I honestly think the administration's weakest bit today was refusing to stand behind and clarify his comments on the upcoming elections potentially not being legitimate. If you're going to say that and the news is going to wring their hands over it you just need to bust out a list of facts about all the ways in which Republicans are attempting to cheat or overturn elections if they don't go their way.   Trump would literally still be "president" had Pence and some Republicans gone along with what he wanted, and the democracy would be dead, there's no reason to pretend like acknowledging that very important fact is irresponsible. It would be irresponsible to intentionally ignore it.	1642716273.0	htimn26	t3_s8tvky	t3_s8tvky	/r/politics/comments/s8tvky/this_is_the_worst_answer_joe_biden_gave_at_his/htimn26/

130hjt	So you think Democratic-run cities are better to live in than Republican-majority suburbs?  New York, LA, and Chicago are the 3 biggest cities and are all Democrat-run, and they have turned into absolute shit holes fraught with crime and corruption. You could not pay me to live in any of those places.   The suburb I live in that is majority Republican-based is family-oriented, safe (virtually zero crime), and has one of the top school districts in the entire state of Texas. Development is soaring and ppl are moving here in droves from places like Cali to build their dream home. They say moving here is a breath of fresh air, and they act like refugees escaping the insane mandates and draconian policies that have stripped its citizens of any sort of freedom or sense of safety.   So this narrative you’re attempting to share that Democrats do all these wonderful things for our country just doesn’t match up to reality.   And off the top of my head, Rep. John Conyers and Sen. Al Franken are both democrats who were involved in sexual harassment so no, the Democrats aren’t any more morally superior.	1642716323.0	htimrr1	t3_s81gzq	t1_htglow4	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/htimrr1/

Whether BBB, the voter rights act, combating Covid through increased vaccinations, masks, and free testing, or simply reestablishing the trust and status of America in our international standing, I will continue to pursue efforts that are supported by the vast majority of the American people."

Your answer is "People should pay attention and vote" which is all well and good, but is completely meaningless. Like, "you know what would help the Democrats? If people voted Democrat." Wow.    We need to think more structurally and systemically. HOW do we get people to vote Democratic? Why is the U.S. political sphere the way that it is?    Let me tell you what's run me out of patience - American political delusion. "Vote blue no matter who :D" isn't f-ing working, and you're running out of sunlight.

12bnj6	So are you advocating for their basic right to live to be taken away then? Because by your logic, they don't seem to *have* any rights at all, since there's absolutely no difference between the right to movement and the right to vote, and apparently they don't "deserve" any given right.  I like how y'all will complain all day long that "Biden and the left are fascists" for regulating basic things, but then come out and say things like this. I thought these were supposed to be "God-given rights", bestowed equally upon every citizen?  Do you *grasp* that there's a reason for these prisoners' movement being restricted, but not their access to, say, oxygen?

cpm8cp2w	But he didn't mean "other" Americans. He meant "all" Americans.  And his phrasing absolutely doesn't mean that African Americans are not Americans. To compare: "Gobert is shooting .682 this year, while NBA players average .463." (Numbers made up.) This doesn't entail that Gobert isn't an NBA player. It might suggest it, and there are better ways to phrase it, but it's overly sensitive to try to read that into it.  To be clear, again, Mitch is gross. He has done plenty to further racism, benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor, and prop up all sorts of other nasty things. But that doesn't mean that everything he says is racist. And making this phrase out to be more racist than it is only hurts the cause. Conservatives will look at this complaint, note the overreactions, and conclude that all claims of racism are similarly fabricated.

3spti	> They deserve way more derision than both sinema and manchin.  Don't know about "way more". Don't even know about "more". Feels like "same amount of derision" type situation.  I get your argument, but I feel it's compensated for with at least having to consider the distinction in "internal party fallout", particularly in this specific constellation of votes. The amount of shit the Reps helping that get through particularly when the story is "2 rouge democrats completely disable democrat party" would be so beyond what Manchkin and Sinema are going to face after this shit.  I agree with things like Collins objections being completely kabuki theatre to just "get to vote bipartisan" if it would already pass without it, or acting like objecting to Republican measures if they pass without her...

It's not like he's President or anything, or like your spray-tan icon of worship didn't do far worse, ON CAMERA, and pay people to outright make shit up about the guy to pull a Clinton on the brain-dead glue-huffers of Y'all Qaeda.  You know, for people who believe without merit that every non-Republican is an evil satanist criminal, Republicans sure have a lot of criminals doing exactly what you delude yourselves into thinking Democrats do.	1642716511.0	htin9t7	t3_s8p989	t1_htikvk5	/r/politics/comments/s8p989/atlanta_da_requests_special_grand_jury_in_trump/htin9t7/

9t1en	This is the piece that everyone forgets. Between the 80s/90s sitcom jokes and the 2016 election, Trump found the only job he was halfway good at, being a reality tv show host. We cannot underestimate how that rehabilitated his reputation and allowed a national audience to come to believe in him as a savvy, tough-love dad figure, an image which no amount of churlishness could shake.   It’s similar to the way being the public face of the Texas Rangers ownership rehabbed W’s reputation. He was nothing but a failure and a fuckup before owning a baseball team made him into a semi-likable public figure, hanging out with Nolan Ryan and shit, as well as introduced him to top-level TX power brokers.	1642716515.0	htina75	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hthnj97	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/htina75/

hlk6l	Yes it would be. Which I think goes to explain why that's the straw man your brain settled on. Because that's not the argument anyone is genuinely making. It's not that they as a race have an inability. It's just that they are specifically targeted by what is allowed to be used to obtain it or not. And how to get there. Keep in mind there's never been a need proven for such voter IDs as are being pushed. But even regardless of that. Anytime someone has suggested one that doesn't have all the design disadvantages of the ones being pushed. (Federal ID for instance) The very same people that often push for voter IDs scream bloody murder against it. Because it's not about the ID or any security they can bring. It's about who they can help exclude.	1642716528.0	htinbdj	t3_s8kua2	t1_hti1gzs	/r/politics/comments/s8kua2/mcconnell_waves_off_voting_concerns_since_black/htinbdj/

5v93w	Ah I've been the camera man on the other side of this (with shitty Journalists) who think it's the height of journalism to ask misleading 'gotcha' questions typically with politicians on subjects they *know* the person has been expressly instructed not to talk on...then crow that the politician in questions can't answer a 'simple, straightforward question'.  One familiar example is always asked to Bernie Sanders "Yes or No, universal healthcare will cause peoples taxes to go up?"  (Of course it would, but the journalist isn't interested in the truth about it overall saving monkey per person compared to the current system.  They just want him to either say 'yes'-then berate him for taking money away from people, or 'no' and berate him for being a liar.  either result gives the journalist a fame boost for a minute, or they get to be smug when the loaded 'yes or no' question isn't answered.  For the GOP see them waffle when asked about how they think funding cuts will affect children or the vulnerable, and flat out end any interview when they get asked a leading 'yes or no only' question on the efficacy of gun control.	1642716553.0	htindts	t3_s8j84w	t1_hth0ahj	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htindts/

The rest are their for many reasons that have nothing to do with benefitting this country or the working class. It's in our hands, not theirs. At least that's what we should know. What is defeatist is sitting there hoping that this will be the time the democrats actually do what they say and bring some justice, no matter hoe ugly it gets.

If SCOTUS lets the law stand, swathes of people lose faith in the court (something they've been trying to spread since desegregation and the Civil rights era). If they strike it down they get to go on a rant about judges legislating from the bench, which causes swathes of people on the other side to lose faith in the legitimacy of the court. Either way a large percentage of the population will see the court in a poor light - which plays right into their hands.	1642716667.0	htinoj8	t3_s8tcab	t3_s8tcab	/r/politics/comments/s8tcab/supreme_court_rejects_another_attempt_to_block/htinoj8/

4dnir	Boy is she in for a shock.  Her and Manchin both.  If the Democrats lose the senate this cycle, they'll both be relegated to anonymity.  They won't get committee assignments they want, they won't be trusted by the GOP (today's GOP only trusts defectors as long as they matter, and if the GOP has a majority those two votes won't matter), no one will bother courting their votes, and no one will give a single shit what their votes are.  Their time in the sun as kingmakers will last two years, and then that's it.  In Manchin's case he's probably ok with that -- from what I understand Democrats had to beg for him to not retire anyway.  In Sinema's case... well, she'll be the TikTok Senator -- important for about 10 minutes before no one remembers or cares who she was.  And those who do remember won't piss on her if she's on fire.  I don't think she's stupid, really.  But I do think that she's in it for the attention in exactly the same way Trump is, only without the money she can throw around to buy sycophants.	1642716682.0	htinpxq	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htho73k	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htinpxq/

a2ucrcyw	Comparing operations might be incorrect. But if you turn on just a few more brain cells you would see that it is not about comparing operations, but about quality. Biden failed at delivering a long planned mission without casualties. Did you expect someone else to do it for him with better quality? Maybe Trump was supposed to come back to office and complete it? Either way, it is Biden's failure. Note that Trump lead multiple operations against ISIL in Syria and Iraq. ISIL was way more sophisticated and coordinated than ISIS-K. But Trump didn't fail that operation. Yet Biden failed his own. All that you hear is the bullshit you wanna hear from him pretending this was a marvelous tremendous miraculous operation. But he doesn't want to acknowledge that it could have been operated by him waaaay better, regardless of him reverting his orders and sending back troops to Afghanistan for help. It was a disaster and Joe Biden is the only responsible person. You can't blame the Trump administration for planning it incorrectly. That is not an argument. If they didn't like the plan, they could've re-negotiated it. They didn't and they failed miserably. Is that sufficient to compare foreign policies of 2 American presidents or do you still wanna go back at comparing operations?	1642716754.0	htinws3	t3_s7zoym	t1_htim9cy	/r/politics/comments/s7zoym/discussion_thread_president_biden_holds_a_press/htinws3/

These people are trying as hard as they can to erase POC from the historical perspective even passing laws again to bolster their ignorance. Laws against teaching about race (they lie and call it CRT, too stupid to know the difference). Laws to not hurt their feelings (really to absolve them from guilt).

sad4r	I'd just like to share these links,  as it's sad but even our founding fathers warned of such happening if we did not restrict and regulate corporations (and their owners)  from going the scales of politics with their wealth.  So here is a snip-it of their sentiments (linked appropriately)  [ I hope we shall take warning from the example and crush in it’s birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and to bid defiance to the laws of their country.](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-10-02-0390)  And this from Adams...  [You very justly indulge a little merriment upon this Solemn Subject of Aristocracy. I often laugh at it too, for there is nothing in this laughable world more ridiculous than the management of it by almost all the nations of the Earth. But while We Smile, Mankind have reason to Say to Us, as the froggs Said to the Boys, What is Sport to you, is Wounds and death to Us. When I consider the weakness, the folly, the Pride, the Vanity, the Selfishness, the Artifice, the low craft and mean Cunning the want of Principle, the Avarice the unbounded Ambition, the unfeeling Cruelty of a majority of those (in all Nations) who are allowed an Aristocratical influence; and on the other hand, the Stupidity with which the more numerous multitude, not only become their Dupes, but even love to be taken in by their Tricks: I feel a Stronger disposition to weep at their destiny, than to laugh at their Folly.](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-6198)  It's going to be an interesting next few elections.

8p8nq	We’re basically in agreement then and I don’t want to argue just to argue. There is always room for improvement in messaging and outreach. It’s also the fault of sensationalist media, which elevates stories of division rather than stories of policy-making.  “Why” are things like they are? It’s too complicated a question. It’s a rightwing subversion of media and institutions, it’s poor educational standards, it’s the fractured digital landscape that’s full of tribalism and misinformation.  All I’m saying is *encouraging people to vote* is the most concrete solution we have. And it has every possibility of working, we just need to overcome the threshold of a rigged system long enough to un-rig it.	1642716859.0	htio6rj	t3_s8hzd8	t1_htimwcu	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/htio6rj/

hiythrnt	IMO, It's like saying your going to vote for someone and then voting for someone else on the ballot. It matters less what people say, and matters what they do. In politics, you always have people saying all sorts of things, but not doing any of them. This vote is an undeniable attestation of that decision. Is it valuable? Depends on how you measure value and how it all plays out, but having a vote on record is different than stating a decision at a presser.	1642716889.0	htio9om	t3_s8tg7n	t1_htijyqi	/r/politics/comments/s8tg7n/schumer_insists_failed_votes_on_elections_and/htio9om/

Now, I have to be clear: storming a Wendy’s or even the Capitol or whatever place is reprehensible. Any individual that took part on any of those should be brought to the law. My other problem is that the media and some government officials are very on board for the Capitol stormers to be tried—but are not that keen to do the same with the rioters.	1642716923.0	htiocze	t3_s81gzq	t1_hti3cd1	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/htiocze/

I'm not saying suicide is great, I'm saying the policy debate over suicide is very different from any debate over murder.  The numbers should not be conflated.  For example, the illegal use of firearms in crimes including murder almost always coincides with small, often stolen handguns.  Stolen handguns are only very rarely used for suicides performed with firearms.  So you've got two distinct pools of firearms linked to the distinct issues.	1642716998.0	htioklo	t3_s8mqre	t1_htinwrp	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htioklo/

Thats literally all anybody can do without conducting a scientific experiement or at least a generalized poll. You using your “diverse” family as an counter point is using the same strategy just on the opposite side. By “everybody” you mean your extended family. Lol  3rd - its not making assumptions its just the simple fact that you meet too many people in your lifetime to track everyones specific heritage so sometimes making general groups is a little simpler.

3ta39	It’s far more than that. I’m talking about strategies that the GOP has pulled that screw traditions and expected norms. Such as disallowing a Supreme Court nomination because it’s an election year and then turning around to do just that under Trump. Such as allowing the Senate Majority Leader to be the sole decider if legislation is allowed to go to a vote. There’s been many examples like this. Do I really have to bring them up?  You’re quite up on politics, obviously, so I doubt I need to.   It’s been apparent for many years that the GOP doesn’t give a shit about precedence, decorum, tradition, or good faith.  They’ve demonstrated this behavior again and again and Dems continue to take the high road and play by the rules that the opponent has already thrown out the window. This goes beyond majorities and cannot be simply explained away because “filibuster”. Dems keep thinking “go high” will play out well for them in the long run but it hasn’t. And they keep doing it. At some point, you start wondering why they keep repeating the same mistakes.   Granted, I’m no PolSci major and don’t know all the ins and outs of the 3 branches, but come on, this smells of BS to even a layman. Really does seem like Corp Dems and Corp GOP are on the same side. Seems like QUITE a nice deal (for both sides) to have two scapegoats to keep you from having to vote on something you don’t want to vote on because your constituents won’t like the way you’ll vote. Bah w/e I doubt either of us will change our outlooks on this so it’s probably pointless to continue.	1642717954.0	htiprnq	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htikrl6	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiprnq/

With Manchin and Sinema "on the team," there's only so much Schumer and the senate leadership can do. I would much rather they do what they can do, even if it's doomed to fail than saying they don't have the votes so they aren't going to bring it to the floor.   Politics is, to a large extent, a performance. Instead of playing the part of a coward, the senate democratic leadership played the part of the underdog.	1642718171.0	htiq38u	t3_s8tg7n	t1_htijyqi	/r/politics/comments/s8tg7n/schumer_insists_failed_votes_on_elections_and/htiq38u/

ly37k	> She votes to confirm judges. That's incredibly important.   If the Ds lose congress because they are seen as holding power but doing nothing with it, it won't matter how many federal judges Biden got  to appoint.  Once the Rs have congress and the whitehouse again, they will expand the courts in order to dilute the effect of Biden's judges.   Also, they will end the filibuster in order to pass a national abortion ban just as soon as the court defangs Roe.   Too many Ds do not understand that losing congress in 2022 means we lose the republic to fascism.  There is no coming back from a 2022 loss, at least not in our life times.   The Rs will leverage control of congress to make the next 2 years of the Biden presidency a shitshow - they will run multiple impeachments, and even though they can't convict, the headlines will be enough to paralyze everything.  And then the rigging at the state level will let them take the 2024 presidential election and and R-controlled congress will rubberstamp it.	1642718226.0	htiq63d	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hti0a2k	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiq63d/

dcl76d79	But time and again we see that when workers “own” the means of production, they end up worse off. That is my point about this being more ideological than data based. You say that workers are better off just from the fact that they “own” the means of production - but that is meaningless to their actual quality of life. What matters are things like education, healthcare, entertainment, food costs etc. I fully agree that the THEORY of socialism sounds nice. It sounds great that by giving workers the means of production that all of those things listed above inevitably improve… but alas they don’t. The only way that the means of production can be taken over by the working class is through force. It’s not really socialism if voters return the means of production to private entities when they realize the change 4 years before didn’t work. And so the only real way you achieve socialism that can’t be removed through every electoral shift is through an authoritarian single party state ala the dictatorship of the proletariat that Marx speaks of as the first stage of socialism. The problem is once you give state that control it never gives it up… economic power has been centralized and with it the authoritarian state bureaucracy that we see result from every single “successful” socialist movement forms.   You say socialist theory is always trying to use evidence and improve but that just isn’t true. Fundamental to socialist theory is a baseline ideology formed from Marx’s original religious-like prophecies of an inevitable rise of the working class and transition to a more egalitarian system where labor exploitation is eliminated. No new research is going to eliminate that central idea and no new research is going to eliminate the fundamental flaw that the only way to remove all labor exploitation through private ownership is via centralization of economic authority that will inevitably lead to a single party, authoritarian rule where all labor exploitation is monopolized by the state.  And that gets to my central point - if the central idea of having the workers own the means of production makes the lives of the workers worse, then is it reality leftist? Is it really progressive? All it really is is sticking to an old and outdated view point because you BELIEVE - aka religious like conservatism.	1642718226.0	htiq64c	t3_s8j84w	t1_htihq4i	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htiq64c/

11untm	I don't care who is in power I believe that having an id in not asking too much to prove who you are to vote. How is it asking too much to prove who you are to take part in the most important part of our democratic elections?   So I will respond quickly to the point of popular vote vs electoral. The electorial college is/was great forethought by the founding of fathers, it allows for the smaller states to have a voice and not be ruled by the more populated ones. Having all federal elections controlled by 2or 3 larger states goes against all the ideals behind this great republic. The "fly over states" hold different values and deserve to have their voices heard as well.   The other roadblocks you mentioned, sound like a bit of hyperbole, but if you got proof for your claims then they need to be addressed. There should not be any foul play on either side. But there are plenty of blue states that have far more restricted voting access than the new Jim Crow 2.0 nonsense. And btw over 70% of people agree that voter id laws are fine. Blue states with no early voting, and red states like Georgia with over 2 weeks of early voting, including weekends.	1642718248.0	htiq771	t3_s8966k	t1_hti4jz3	/r/politics/comments/s8966k/senate_republicans_block_voting_rights_bill/htiq771/

The Republican-majority suburb in which I reside has virtually zero crime, development is moving at warp speed, our school district is one of the top in the state, ppl are moving here in droves from places like Cali, our property values have been steadily increasing (my house has gone up $200k in the past 4 years), we have no mask or vaccine mandates and our Covid rates/deaths have been low. It’s just an amazing place to live. We’re open, we’re free, life is pretty normal and has been this whole time. Our kids have been in-person at school since the beginning of all this and have been participating in extracurricular activities. We’re happy and healthy. Life is good here.   Democrat-run cities and states on the other hand…fraught with crime and corruption, everything is either shut down or you can’t go in to get a cup of coffee without a forced vaccine (what booster are y’all on now? 6-7? And you can STILL get and spread it and die from it? Lol) New York, LA, Chicago, San Fran, Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis…all shit holes and are unsafe places to live. So continue to live in some alternate fake reality where you think the Democrats are some beacons of morality and superiority and enjoy those draconian mandates and policies.

duuhb	> The logic is “pulling the US to the far left” only applies to things that have actually happened or at least stand a credible chance of happening.  Bernie pulled the Democratic Party left just by campaigning, AOC continues to pull it left just with her Twitter account. Putting ideas into peoples’ heads is a very effective way to steer the conversation. This is likely why Biden’s platform was as progressive as it was in the first place.  > They’re fighting about the voting rights bill, but everyone has just quietly let BBB die. The impact of the bill on public discourse shifting even a few months later is zero.  You don’t know what the politicians are talking about being closed doors, hell I just read yesterday that Biden thinks BBB will need to be broken into smaller pieces so clearly they’re still working on it. The reason you think nobody’s talking about it is just that the media has moved on, because what is there to say at this point? It’s never going to pass with the current Senate so I think makes sense to work on other things rather just spin our wheels on something that isn’t going to pass in its current form. Meanwhile voting Rights is an important piece of the agenda since the GOP has made it their personal mission to undermine the fundamentals of our democracy every chance they get. Without more Democrats in office we’ll never see anything like BBB passed and Republicans are setting themselves up to, for instance, be able to overturn an election whenever they don’t like the result.	1642718270.0	htiq886	t3_s8j84w	t1_htif02k	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htiq886/

Compare how she used to speak against her actions of the last year and the difference is *striking*. I understand why Manchin is the way he is, he is a product of his environment. But Sinema isn't, and I think her backstory about living in a gas station toilet or whatever the fuck it was made her a prime target for bribes.  It's either that or she's genuinely one of the most gullible people in modern political history. But that doesn't explain why she doesn't hold town halls. If she genuinely believed the words she shits out, she'd be making more of an effort to convince her constituents.	1642718344.0	htiqbwd	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htinl23	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiqbwd/
33y6o8og	Sorry to break this to you, but you don’t have the authority to judge that, and by passing judgment like you are, you make yourself no better than she is.  According to the Bible, one person exists that has the authority to judge whether someone is a Christian or not, and..to put it bluntly.. it ain’t you, or anyone else who comes out with “they’re not a true Christian”.  Fact is that she’s as much of a Christian as anyone else is. She’s just a brand of Christian that you don’t like and that makes Christianity look bad. Unfortunately, Christianity looks bad enough all on its own. So just leave the judging to Jesus	1642718344.0	htiqbwu	t3_s8qq0w	t1_htilg1i	/r/politics/comments/s8qq0w/rep_lauren_boebert_asked_a_group_of_jewish/htiqbwu/

12bnj6	You refuse to answer the simple query of "This just makes it hard for either side to cheat" being a nonsensical argument given that "cheating" has never been proved to happen this way, *by either side*, on a meaningful scale.  If I decide that we need to pass laws against certain parts of the population that make it harder for them to do certain things, based on lies I've invented, I'm "solving" a potential problem that I have invented.  And in this case, the problem is clear, because the following is absolutely false:   > No one is restricting anyone’s right to vote.  Really? Because silly me, I thought that adding a higher amount of barriers, and lowering the availability of ways to practice something, meant that that something was being restricted. Or are you telling me that preventing, say, people of a certain age from drinking alcohol, is not a *restriction* upon the consumption of alcohol? Gee, what *is* a restriction in your book, I have to wonder?  Aren't Republicans always whining about how the flow of their air is being restricted by having to wear masks? And you seriously can't grasp why making it more difficult to vote, via increased regulations, restricts the right to vote?  It's a wonder that you can have the self-respect to argue about this, really.  > Democrats love solving problems that don't exist.  Even if that were true (it is much less true than the Republicans) - is your suggestion that "just because people do bad things, means everyone should?"  Also, come back to me about "imaginary problems" when you guys have stopped whining about CRT. Just to be sure, though, you *are* perfectly okay with Democrats putting barriers on stuff like your free speech, yeah?

qf7m9	The Democratic Party likes to muddy the distinction of what a "progressive" is, in order to be able to claim to be progressives. It's a lot like the way the tobacco and then oil companies have deliberately blurred the public perception of smoking and global warming. Nancy Pelosi claims to be a progressive, but her positions do not align with someone who's actually viewed as much more progressive, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They can't both be progressives, and AOC is identified much more so than Pelosi, who's a long-term centrist "establishment" Democrat.

8s45ij	Closing polling places in democrat areas sounds like a terrible choice, they are the high density areas, which would service the most amount of people, the opposite to what polling should do, do US have an independent organization that does the polling or is up to republicans to decide who gets polled? In Mexico we have a federal polling institution that is in charge of gathering the volunteers and assigning places for voting that would handle the polling places, your house/business can be selected as a voting place in a certain year and you must enable it for accepting people to come and vote, you have many polling places through a city and people don’t have to walk/drive far to get to their polling place, it is your duty as citizen to always update where you live to the polling institution so they can allocate your voting place, I think it is a cool mechanism since it it is not run by a party	1642718553.0	htiqpjl	t3_s8kt4k	t1_htimpfv	/r/politics/comments/s8kt4k/gop_states_are_shredding_voting_rights_and_joe/htiqpjl/
orn1a	As the article points out we have the lowest gun crime in the country, and very strict gun laws.  While that is not proof, there is certainly a strong correlation.    The article in question shows there is a strong relation to gun violence and strict gun laws.  Also look at Australia, they had a marked decrease in gun violence after they made them illegal.  Also did you even read your link?  Yes, there is "limited" evidence that CCWs increase gun violence.  But that means A) there is some evidence B) Maybe enough research hasn't been done.  Large scale studies like this are hard to do since you can't really do A/B testing with cities. C) That is talking about CCWs specifically, not gun ownership or open carry or anything else.	1642718555.0	htiqpnh	t3_s8mqre	t1_htio2sz	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htiqpnh/

If they were able to do that they would bring out the base in the primary and win.  The fact that they lose the primary shows that they actually don't have a greater ability of bringing out the base.  If, in your scenario, they can't bring out enough voters to beat non-base voters who may vote in the primary, how could they possibly bring them out to vote in the general?	1642718575.0	htiqr6z	t3_s8b9ek	t1_htikkl9	/r/politics/comments/s8b9ek/mayor_kenney_endorses_conor_lamb_for_senate_i/htiqr6z/

rs7uf	Right?  Conservative complaints are always like “Those progressives want a world where nobody pays for college and health care for out of taxes and everyone just has sex with whoever they want!”  The only real argument to policies that actually just sound downright utopian is that we couldn’t afford to do it.  I’ll take that argument.  Otherwise like are they saying if they could snap my fingers and everyone had access to healthcare or housing that they WOULDNT do that?  How can you possibly morally justify that position?  And if their argument is it’s too expensive I usually respond that neither of us is an expert in economics, and even experts disagree as to whether it would be possible or beneficial overall to implement some form of socialized healthcare or similar social policies.  I mean I’ve certainly seen plenty that indicates it would be way cheaper to provide universal healthcare than the current system but I’m sure they have “experts” that say the opposite.  Post truth age and all.  But then the question is just, should we never try then?  We’ll never really know until we try, and we can always go back to private healthcare if it totally fails.  So with the rewards so vast, why not at least try.  Then at the very least if it fails you can say for the rest of your life that you were right all along and socialized healthcare will “never work in America”. That conversation never goes well.	1642718674.0	htiqyxf	t3_s8m77j	t1_htin2s3	/r/politics/comments/s8m77j/hi_reddit_im_tom_nelson_and_im_running_for_the_us/htiqyxf/

9whiwagg	>Biden has scored highly with researchers by elevating his science adviser, geneticist Eric Lander, to the White House’s inner circle — the cabinet — and by quickly moving to reverse many of the most stringent anti-science policies implemented by Trump. But frustrations are also mounting about how much the administration has been able to accomplish: its pandemic response has been hindered by vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and widespread mistrust of government. And its ambitious climate agenda has stalled because of political opposition in Congress.  So, the answer  to the question asked by the headline is *yes,* but they are unhappy with Congress and the anti-vaxxers, I can relate.	1642718676.0	htiqz3b	t3_s8uumi	t3_s8uumi	/r/politics/comments/s8uumi/has_biden_followed_the_science_what_researchers/htiqz3b/

We should be encouraging fewer people to vigilante themselves out to save people who didn’t ask for help.

No way Congress wanted to be on the hook for “voting for more war.” Obama had so many options - intervene without asking for authorization (which he said he could do) or intervene anyway even if authorization fails and point out they were in favor of heavier intervention before voting.  If Obama knew the GOP would oppose everything he did, then why did he ask them for their permission to do something? Why count on something that even an idiot would see as a waste of time.	1642719009.0	htirq8c	t3_s8l88m	t1_htihlk6	/r/politics/comments/s8l88m/discussion_thread_secretary_of_state_antony/htirq8c/

iutdh	I see where you are coming from, but I think it's just another case of saying the quiet part out loud.  I would agree with you if most of the GOP base didn't actually feel this way.   How many white nationalist members of Congress do we need to understand that the GOP doesn't want non-white people in the US.  See: Stephen Miller, Stephen King, Steve Bannon, etc.  Edit: He will use your exact reasoning though, to sweep it under the rug and say it was misunderstood.	1642719067.0	htirv3h	t3_s8kua2	t1_htgyw5l	/r/politics/comments/s8kua2/mcconnell_waves_off_voting_concerns_since_black/htirv3h/

If you’re so close minded to government that you can confidently call every single politician a crook, not in a hyperbolic way, then our current government has no hope, only revolution would lead to redemption in that mindset.

bqvdx	>Such as disallowing a Supreme Court nomination because it’s an election year and then turning around to do just that under Trump. Such as allowing the Senate Majority Leader to be the sole decider if legislation is allowed to go to a vote. There’s been many examples like this. Do I really have to bring them up?  You’re quite up on politics, obviously, so I doubt I need to.  I don't see what those GOP actions have to do with the "revolving villain" conspiracy theory on the Dem side.   >They’ve demonstrated this behavior again and again and Dems continue to take the high road and play by the rules that the opponent has already thrown out the window. This goes beyond majorities and cannot be simply explained away because “filibuster”. Dems keep thinking “go high” will play out well for them in the long run but it hasn’t. And they keep doing it. At some point, you start wondering why they keep repeating the same mistakes.  People say this and never follow up with an example of the kind of thing that they'd like to see the democrats do similarly.   Why didn't they block Trump supreme court nominations from having a senate hearing? They didn't have a majority in the senate like the GOP did. Oops, majorities matter.  Why isn't Schumer the decided on what gets voted on in the senate? Uh... he is, now that he's the majority leader. Oops, majorities matter.   I don't know what an example of the Dems "going high" is here. Is the 1/6 committee them "Going High"? Is constantly telling people that democracy is in danger because of Republicans "going high"? Is refusing to engage in any further bi-partisan negotiations with the GOP on legislation after they got the infrastructure bill done "going high"? Like what are you actually talking about? Because it sounds like you are just repeating outdated meme talking points.  >smells of BS  Get back to me when you have facts instead of feelings or sniffs.   >Seems like QUITE a nice deal (for both sides) to have two scapegoats to keep you from having to vote on something you don’t want to vote on because your constituents won’t like the way you’ll vote.  Do you have any evidence - one single solitary piece of evidence - that the democrats actually wanted HR1 to fail and thus put them in a terrible position for the midterms?	1642719185.0	htis598	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htiprnq	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htis598/

Also, even though it has NOTHING to do with this issue, allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections is practically an American tradition dating back to the founding of the country. In fact, it wasn't even illegal at the federal level until 1996.

The wording seems intentionally broad as to cover literally any educational, professional, or occupational settings. And considering it's being touted by Republicans as an anti-crt bill it makes sense that they're including schools as that's what people are up in arms about over CRT in school.	1642719219.0	htis86n	t3_s8h6ar	t1_htiqjmn	/r/politics/comments/s8h6ar/florida_bill_to_shield_people_from_feeling/htis86n/

f8gwx	If you think that economics and gay rights are not fiercely argued topics in other countries then I question if you have an understanding of other countries politics because it sounds like you have rose colored goggles and no actual experience.  Keynesian economics itself was named after a gay man in Britain at a time where homosexual acts were illegal by federal law and he was forced to officially marry a woman as a result.  Every European country right now has a rightwing movement that emphasizes anti immigration and market deregulation and those parties are currently getting elected all across Europe.  Britain right now is dealing with going extreme anti immigration to the point where they broke ties with Europe itself and are seeing far deeper economic suffering with less of a recovery because of it.  &#x200B;  Also Europe is having these debates while being on the liberal end.  Go to Turkey and ask what they think about homosexuality, and realize their radical views are likely to the left of Kenya.	1642719243.0	htisa7l	t3_s8j84w	t1_htilsn9	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htisa7l/

4q0q2c58	So basically you want the left to vote for centrists, but you don't want us to have any input on policy? That sounds like a sustainable coalition to you?  You want to know why leftists "attack" Democrats more than Republicans? It's because we voted for Democrats and they're not doing any of the things they campaigned on.  The things you wave away as "narrow ideological lanes" are things that are very real and very important to people in Democrats' coalition. Minimizing or ignoring those issues is not a great way to build unity.  Centrists have had their chance. They've given us a DNC that can't rule even when it has a majority. If you're not going to oppose Republicans you need to get out of the way so someone else can.	1642719254.0	htisb4d	t3_s8hzd8	t1_htgu0wp	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/htisb4d/

uq51k	>The state with the most mass shootings is California.  Just like the pro-gun argument about shootings in Chicago, the logic is so flawed, as shown by the number of out-of-city guns that are used in crimes.  If anything, bringing it up just demonstrates that the only solution is consistent nationwide regulation.  But besides that, California is the most populous state.  It's going to have the most of many things.  Florida (the runner-up for quantity of mass shootings) has more mass shootings per capita and *significantly* more gun murders per capita than California.  Wisconsin has had 50% *more* mass shootings per capita than California with 40% the population density.	1642719309.0	htisfxs	t3_s8mqre	t1_htijzop	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htisfxs/

ehzlknsc	yes we all know they don't care. You're arguing the part everyone agrees one.  We're past that part. We all know what you say is correct. Keep it up, but do note that most anyone who already agrees with what you said have long since moved on from that overall topic and onto the specifics, the oddities, the things that stem out from the thing you mentioned.  We also moved onto specifics defined within the jurisdiction of law. Law doesn't care whether the criminals don't care about what it makes them look like. They actually take pride and show much glee when going against the law because. considering their way of "debating" things in the past 5 years (at least), they painted themselves into a corner.  THEY don't care because the voters keep voting for them. They WOULD care if the voters did not. Ergo; their marketing is effective on only their target audience.

2wjlguw	Well, I don't "choose" to believe it.  No one has yet shown me a single example of an eligible voter who tried to vote, but was denied because of some law, so, absent any evidence to the contrary, I came to the educated, logical, factually-based conclusion that there are no such laws currently on the books, anywhere.  If you have actual evidence, and not some anecdotal hypotheticals, then feel free to provide them to me, but so far I haven't come across any.  So no, I don't "choose" to believe it, any more than I choose to believe that the sun rises in the east.

cbosn	Yes my statement is factual and not a "brazen lie" as you claimed. From the transcript:  >Kyle Rittenhouse: (29:02) I continue walking in a southernly direction, down Sheridan Road, and then as I’m walking, I believe you guys have been referring to him as yellow pants. He said something to me. I believe it was, “You were the one that pointed your rifle at me with the laser pointed at me.” I believe that’s what I heard. I didn’t. That’s the first time I saw him that night, so I was confused, so I said, “I did,” and then I continued to walk away.  Testimony is evidence. Rittenhouse testified that somebody "yellow pants" identified him as pointing his rifle at him. Rittenhouse testified that he said in response "I did". There is also video of the encounter.

Could care less does literally state there is amount even less they could care that they currently do but the implication is there that it's such a small amount that it might as well be nothing.  Hence in effect "could care less" effectively equals "couldn't care less".

af3nqn85	Sources for what? Saying criminals won’t go through background checks to get illegal guns or that poor people don’t have as much money to buy guns? I’d say those are pretty safe generalizations.   [This study](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/usrv98.pdf) is pretty old but it gives a base idea of crime rates in urban areas vs rural ones. [This one](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/06/22/the-demographics-of-gun-ownership/) gives a rough breakdown of gun ownership by region, with the highest rate of ownership being in rural areas. While I wouldn’t assume this numbers to be perfectly accurate today, it clearly isn’t safe to make the assumption that “more guns = more crime.”  I’m not saying we don’t have a problem, I’m saying it’s a violent crime problem, not a gun problem. We need to put a greater emphasis on fighting poverty than fighting law abiding gun owners. The most violent places in the US are also some of the most impoverished, and are almost all urban areas. I would love to see more investment into small businesses and employment centers in impoverished areas rather than just direct government handouts, which have proven ineffective at tackling poverty.	1642719521.0	htisybd	t3_s8mqre	t1_htiqyzs	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htisybd/

12htgh	> According to the Bible, one person exists that has the authority to judge whether someone is a Christian or not  The line you're probably referring to is Christ saying "there is no entry to heaven except through me," which has nothing to do with whether a person is Christian or not, or even if Christianity is a prerequisite for entry into heaven.  See, also: Simon's story referring to a series of dreams where he refuses unclean food and the realization that even a righteous man can be made holy by god.  > Fact is that she's as much of a Christian as anyone else is.  Sure, if you consider that only maybe 1 in 6 people worldwide claim to be ostensibly Christian.  Again, simply making a claim does not make it so.  Christ also said people should be known by their deeds, not their words.  Boebert's *deeds* show she's no Christian.  > She's just a brand of Christian that you don't like  No.  She's not a Christian at all.  Any issue I have with Christian sects other than my own stems almost entirely from the *style* in which they worship, not the content of the faith they adhere to.  > So just leave the judging to Jesus  Why?  Jesus never said anything about leaving any judgement to him alone.  The closest you could get would be comments like "judge not, lest ye be judged" and "cast the beam from your own eye before attempting to remove the speck from another's," but both of *those* are about not being a hypocrite.  A hypocrite, like, say, a person who claims to be Christian yet actively rejects any attempt to have society care for the poor.	1642719561.0	htit1rn	t3_s8qq0w	t1_htiqbwu	/r/politics/comments/s8qq0w/rep_lauren_boebert_asked_a_group_of_jewish/htit1rn/

I don’t think I need to point to a peer reviewed article to say that the socialist movements of the past century have been a complete failure - its pretty obvious. It may sound counter intuitive why ownership of the means of production makes the lives of the workers worse but an understanding of market economies makes it seem pretty obvious - markets benefit from decentralized economic activity while guaranteeing workers own the means of production relies on centralizing economic activity. And decentralized economic activity is more robust to a changing world, more able to evolve, more likely to produce innovative solutions to the worlds problems, less prone to complete collapse, less prone to authoritarian rule - all of which improves workers lives. And It’s not just economic theory it’s basic physics and biology and engineering and computer science - decentralized systems are less prone to failure.	1642719589.0	htit45r	t3_s8j84w	t1_htirej4	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htit45r/

What we see publicly is only a small part of what's going on. Direct threats will be made tomorrow. And have been made. They may shift Putin's thinking.

Talk about Manchin's ties to coal and ask if they think he's fighting for them or billionaires.  Instead Biden compliments Manchin and Sinema.  Manchin's wife gets a nice government appointed job, no strings or leverage applied.  She sounds like a mini Betsy Devos.  Manchin gets appointed to of all things the Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee (LOL).  No leverage applied to him for that reward.  There's so much Biden could have tried.    He could use his Megaphone to oppose splitting Infrastructure from BBB in the first place.  We would be in much better shape.

You have to show intent to defraud; rather than merely neglect or ignorance.   But as an officer of the Trump Organization, she's ineligible for remuneration in the form of Consulting Fees which are then deducted by the Trump Org's tax filings as a business expense.   As an officer she has fiduciary responsibilities, and this type of pay as a consultant, write-off on your business taxes scheme, is something she has a responsibility to know is blatantly illegal.

As a result, Republicans will be responsible when middle class families see their tax increases on January 1.”  Also maybe not having revenue from taxes isnt so great.  https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-florida-budget-taxes-legislature-20201201-kmvgtpk4q5ahfjca66zbn2vi2a-story.html?outputType=amp  “Facing a $2.7 billion budget shortfall, legislative leaders are searching for ways to raise new revenue, although not through tax hikes, along with cuts to education and health care to fill the gap when they return to the Capitol in March.”  I guess just not having a functioning govt is preferable to not paying as much in state taxes.  Meanwhile in texas  https://taxease.com/texas-property-taxes-compared-to-other-states/  “Business owners and high-wage earners are the ones who benefit most by having no income tax and higher sales and property taxes. More of the burden is placed on the poor, especially those living in low-income housing.”  So the sale tax and property tax are actually quite high but it’s obscured by the lack of income tax, which basically just means they fucked over poor people for rich people.

My sister told me that this person she’s known for *years* had left a comment calling black people monkeys on a video. She unfriended and blocked him.  I asked her if he had ever made it seem like he might be racist before (IRL or online), she said no. I found it interesting that once Trump was president, that he all of a sudden got real comfortable with be openly racist.	1642720025.0	htiu6ct	t3_s8qq0w	t1_hthy7rc	/r/politics/comments/s8qq0w/rep_lauren_boebert_asked_a_group_of_jewish/htiu6ct/

You seem to be either forgetting or willfully ignoring the racist history of this country and its denial of certain forms of ID to older Black Americans, especially in the south.  &#x200B;  The racist are the southern states who denied older Blacks ID for being black as part of jim crow policy to block them from voting.	1642720028.0	htiu6ms	t3_s89qqu	t1_htgt4c6	/r/politics/comments/s89qqu/biden_who_was_obamas_vp_says_i_did_not_anticipate/htiu6ms/

5astomsi	It's hard to disagree with the article's conclusion tho the headline is prime example of clickbait.  Praise is given for the decision to leave Afghanistan and the renewed START in particular.  > This delay, aimed at assuaging congressional hawks, squandered a valuable early negotiation window prior to elections in Iran that brought hard-liners to power. Any deal struck now is likely to be far worse than it could have been, and there is a serious risk of a “no deal” result.   That's damn wishful thinking.  Donnie's withdrawal from JCPA was what empowered hardliners.  Those same hardliners saw how differently North Korea was treated.  The idea of any window is preposterous.  Biden's not going to be president forever and the next republican will likely rip up any new agreement.  The United States cannot be trusted to fulfill it's treaty obligation.  FULL STOP.  Any new agreement will be negotiated by Iranians with that thought front and center.	1642720040.0	htiu7ow	t3_s8ttsa	t3_s8ttsa	/r/politics/comments/s8ttsa/america_needs_a_bolder_biden_a_year_in_his/htiu7ow/

In that case, a 20 minute drive to somewhere they don't usually go is an impediment to voting.  Look at this [little community](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lincoln+County,+GA/@33.9207403,-82.5571744,1237m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88f7917559abcccd:0x39521ad4731d553c!8m2!3d33.7875101!4d-82.4319405) in the northern part of the county.   The best way to approach something like this would be to set some rules. Like if there is an area with a certain density of voters, they should get a polling station within X number of miles. I think 20 minutes is too far (it turns voting into at least a 40 minute activity), though I do appreciate that people in this area may be used to everything taking an hour or longer. Still, I think that there should be **zero** barriers to voting. I am not in the camp that many are in, that they think that only those who are most committed to voting should vote.	1642720136.0	htiug99	t3_s7qayx	t1_hthwu8h	/r/politics/comments/s7qayx/plans_to_close_all_but_one_polling_place_in_a/htiug99/

Say they find evidence that Trump knew his supporters were planning on ransacking the Capitol building and stopping the certification of the election? Suppose they find evidence he knew there was a mob of people who wanted to kill his VP. Suppose he not only knew this but encouraged it. That it was his plan all along. What then? His supporters will just say it's fake news and a political witch hunt. Or worse, they'll say "good for him" and support his premeditated coup attempt. The other half of the country who already hates the guy will just hate him more, but it won't change anything.

Why do they not get to have a say over whether the next government will now introduce the death penalty for petty thieves, or whatever?  You aren't even trying to hide that your true goal here is to control how people vote, and who they vote for.  Also, you're being quite harsh on convicts here, some of which have not done anything as serious as "killing other people". Why is a petty thief deprived of the right to vote, but a Republican AG can kill a man in his car and still have the right to *work in government?*	1642720287.0	htiutdz	t3_s8kt4k	t1_htitzb7	/r/politics/comments/s8kt4k/gop_states_are_shredding_voting_rights_and_joe/htiutdz/

8iwjjps8	This idea that dems would have done something if it wasnt for conservative dems is skewed. Dems for over a decade now have created obstructionists in their own party. Before there was Manchin or Sinema, there was Joe Lieberman. Now if one wants to give these politicians the benefit of the doubt, its up to you. But imho, it would be naive to assume dems “stand for anything”. A better way to put it is Dems have “preferences”. Also what good is the Democratic platform, if the Dem President is going to do absolutely nothing to actually fight for it? Its called posing. When a party cares more about order and moderation rather than justice and change, they procure neither.	1642720313.0	htiuvot	t3_s81gzq	t1_htewsal	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/htiuvot/

lofqyy0	Assuming Sinema is essentially a GOP operative sitting in a Dem seat - it probably helps the GOP in the long term to keep a GOP voting 'Democrat' (Sinema) in the seat while Biden is president.      I'm not including Manchin in this because he never advertised himself as a progressive or anything left of center whereas Sinema campaigned on a more left leaning ticket in comparison before her hard turn once in the seat.     It will help the GOP during their respective senate races/long term if they can point to a slow ineffective Democrat majority - rather than having Sinema switch early to the GOP and switching control, basically putting their obstructing tendencies in a more obvious light and potentially igniting Democrat voters during voting season. This way GOP senators can essentially fund raise and meander while Sinema (and Manchin) does their work for them.	1642720345.0	htiuyi5	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hthwugv	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htiuyi5/

30oo0hzb	>Just like the pro-gun argument about shootings in Chicago  The person I replied to wrote:  &#x200B;  "Yeah, but states with more lax gun laws have more freedom, like for instance, the freedom to get shot randomly at the mall, or the freedom for my child to find my not-well-hidden gun and ammo and do a school shooting."          That simply isn't true as you look at the number of mass shootings and where they are. If you have an issue with logically inconsistency you should complain about their baseless statement.  &#x200B;  >But besides that, California is the most populous state. It's going to have the most of many things.  Yes all the most populous states, regardless of gun laws, have way more mass shootings than every other state in the nation, which both have much more lax or similar laws to California. So it doesn't seem like the laws at all matter if there are more mass shooting in higher populated states no matter how restrictive owning a gun is.  &#x200B;  >Florida (the runner-up for quantity of mass shootings) has more mass shootings per capita and significantly more gun murders per capita than California. Wisconsin has had 50% more mass shootings per capita than California with 40% the population density.  And a majority of US states with very lax laws have little to no mass shootings also.	1642720471.0	htiv9p2	t3_s8mqre	t1_htisfxs	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htiv9p2/

hrkph3xc	> Washington (CNN)Trump campaign officials, led by Rudy Giuliani, oversaw efforts in December 2020 to put forward illegitimate electors from seven states that Trump lost, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the scheme.  > The sources said members of former President Donald Trump's campaign team were far more involved than previously known in the plan, a core tenet of the broader plot to overturn President Joe Biden's victory when Congress counted the electoral votes on January 6.  > Giuliani and his allies coordinated the nuts-and-bolts of the process on a state-by-state level, the sources told CNN. One source said there were multiple planning calls between Trump campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call. The source also said the Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, secured meeting rooms in statehouses for the fake electors to meet on December 14, 2020, and circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.   https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/trump-campaign-officials-rudy-giuliani-fake-electors/index.html	1642720514.0	htivdo4	t3_s8v8ef	t3_s8v8ef	/r/politics/comments/s8v8ef/trump_campaign_officials_including_giuliani/htivdo4/

9zd1optn	Haha!  I am not saying anything about voter restrictions.  You are.  And to be quite honest, I don’t really care that much because I’m not really sure who it actually effects.  Other than left leaning media, I haven’t heard of anyone coming forward saying “it’s difficult to vote if…”. Other than people with severe health issues who can’t physically get to the polling place, you’re telling me they can’t cast their mail in ballot in a reasonable time and manner?  Is it that difficult seriously to do things with a time limit?   And if I am talking about curbing voter fraud, and it only happens “maybe a few dozen times” an election, isn’t that a few dozen times too many?  Why not just make it across the board the same way nation wide and now no one will ever have to worry about that particular issue.   If you’re worried about certain folks not being able to make it to polls or can’t afford an ID, make it a state law that everyone over the age of XX gets a free ID card.  Maybe make it a law that anyone over the age of XX gets a free ride to the polls and back.

5hqn7py2	We can argue details, but the truth is as of June 2009 and for a while after Democrats had a majority of 60 votes in the Senate after the addition of Al Franken. Then popular legislation was obstructed by moderate democrats. This is where the notion people repeat today that even though we only see two people taking the heat right now, if Democrats had more of a majority then more moderates would step up to defeat any real progress.   It was thanks to efforts by Joe Liebermann and the No Label group of which Manchin is part that ObamaCare was stripped of the public option back in 2009 and yet the heavily unpopular tax penalty was left in place. The original idea with the ObamaCare bill was to release it as a public option with the subsidized private option available and instead we had the tax penalty which was later removed during Trump's administration(I cannot remember if it was by SCOTUS decision, Executive Order, or legislation.)	1642720533.0	htivfcl	t3_s899jc	t1_hthnvyw	/r/politics/comments/s899jc/democrats_voting_rights_plan_dead_after_they_fail/htivfcl/

Why can they keep any right at all, if you can take away any one of them, for any reason? Your logic is simply that their rights are *loaned*, not inherent to them as human beings. Therefore, your logic leads to them simply not having any rights at all.  There is no rhyme or reason to taking away their right to vote. None at all.

No shit I want to be right about this, thats why I talk in terms of evidence when I can.  >rather than address the overall point of a post.

They're not illegally trying to overthrow elections if that's what you mean. But obstruction? Yes, they're doing it, they did it all throughout Trump's tenure. Ignoring the interests of the other party and eschewing bipartisanship? Yes, they're doing it, there have not been bipartisan negotiations since the infrastructure bill since dems knew that was the only thing they could get to go with bipartisanship (which they were correct on).  >You think I’m a conspiracy nut  You tell me what I should call someone who believes in the existence of a literal conspiracy without a shred of evidence beyond their generalized feelings on the matter.  >I think you’re an apologist  I don't think the dems are doing the right things. I just think they are doing the things you think they're not doing, and not doing the thing (rotating villain) that you think they are doing.

6p3sx	I used to agree with that thought, but to be honest, there *are* serious disadvantages to these kinds of show votes everyone knows are doomed to failure from the start. And it seems like a lot of progressives, and even Democratic leadership, aren't giving those disadvantages much weight in their calculus.  Does Sinema voting no really create more exposure for her compared to all of her statements promising that she won't vote for the bill? If it does, it's limited at best. You can put together an attack ad with her sound bites on the subject just as easily as you can with her actual vote.  These repeated failures reinforce a sense of powerlessness and incompetence. And that'll hurt us come the midterms. Democrats frame themselves as the party that's willing to govern. These failures undermine that framing, demoralize the base, and frustrate swing voters.  Meanwhile, Republicans couldn't care less. They love this crap, because they don't even try to pretend that they want to govern and pass policies.  After the votes, have Manchin or Sinema moved even a millimeter? Of course not. Hell, Manchin benefits from it: he gets to go back to an absurdly red West Virginia and say "look how I punched those Washington liberals in the face." A podcast I was listening to a few weeks back likened it to giving Manchin the opportunity to engage in some good 'ol fashioned hippie punching. He won't turn that down.	1642720607.0	htivlum	t3_s8tg7n	t1_htihx77	/r/politics/comments/s8tg7n/schumer_insists_failed_votes_on_elections_and/htivlum/

8vljv	The right wing is concentrated on that 1 channel which is why they're so popular. everyone else in the country is split between 4 or 5 other channels so of course they'll have less viewers. It's really as simple as that.      It's like you have 10 people choosing a place for dinner and 5 are vegetarians and 5 are omnivores. You offer 1 vegetarian place and then you off a bbq, steak place, burger place (which for some reason has no veggie options), fried chicken place, and sushi (also no veggie options lets say). All 5 vegetarians will of course vote for the veggie place while each of the 5 omnivores would have 1 vote for each restaurant. So it would appear vegetarianism is slaughtering meat eaters 5 to 1. but it's not. It's evenly split, just that there are lots more options for omnivores.	1642720629.0	htivnp5	t3_s8j84w	t1_htht09b	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htivnp5/

gs3em	Amen. One whole night, right!! I can't believe a night on the senate floor wasn't the only thing they needed to do in this political environment.   It was a great performance, and that is all it was, performance. If they want to get real and try some stuff that works, get off that senate floor, because senate floor debate and discussion is not how stuff gets done in this country anymore. I feel like people just feel the need to lie to themselves, like they don't have a clue how McConnell whips a vote. No backrooms around the democrats? Suddenly the dems don't understand how to twist an arm, or maybe twist something harder. Seriously, LJB worked smarter than these guys to get civil rights through. I don't think it was an issue of smarts though, they know there were other options that had a better chance of working, they opted not to use them for a reason, and it isn't one that they should be proud of.   Sorry, not ranting at you, the commenter who apparently is the only one who follows the government closely on all of reddit is super annoying, and just so typical of the rabid cheerleaders that pop up for any Democratic president, no matter what they do.	1642720656.0	htivq1m	t3_s8hzd8	t1_hthezfz	/r/politics/comments/s8hzd8/amid_slowmotion_coup_manchin_and_sinema_help_gop/htivq1m/

7adxo	I wasn't arguing in favor of true democracy.  I was arguing in favor of *actually representative* democracy.  Each of the factors I listed makes it easier for elitist interests to dictate our politics by enabling literal minority rule.    Regarding the Senate, 1) if you agree the senate should be "oligarchical" then it should not have far greater power than the House.  And 2) the Senate was poor design from the start, but at least that consolation to slave states made modicum of sense with only 13 states, whereas it could never scale democratically when the politics of the day would undoubtedly determine whether and how new states were admitted.    [Regarding the introduction of new states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states):    >Admission of new western states was a party political battleground with each party looking at how the proposed new states were likely to vote. At the beginning of 1888, the Democrats under president Grover Cleveland proposed that the four territories of Montana, New Mexico, Dakota and Washington should be admitted together. The first two were expected to vote Democratic and the latter two were expected to vote Republican so this was seen as a compromise acceptable to both parties. However, the Republicans won majorities in both the House and the Senate later that year. To head off the possibility that Congress might only admit Republican territories to statehood, the Democrats agreed to a less favorable deal in which Dakota was divided in two and New Mexico was left out altogether. Cleveland signed it into law on February 22, 1889, and the territories could become states nine months after that.  That's no freakin' way to grow as a nation.  It's undemocratic.  It's lunacy.    The Senate is a pestilent anachronism.	1642720731.0	htivwpj	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htiol2q	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htivwpj/

zcesz	To be fair, she's not entirely wrong. They could have taken action against the members of congress that bought stock in ppe companies after their first covid briefing but chose not to. The part where she is wrong is that having the tools to fix the problem doesn't matter if there isn't the political will to use them. If any attempt to use the tools they have will only be cast as partisan attacks, then banning the practice entirely is the best way to stop it from being done without having to worry about the politics of it.

6jffc	SoS approval rating means nothing for approval rating as a presidential candidate.  And the Right vilified her entirely, often for misogynistic reasons which is terrible.  Plenty of the Left and independents didn't like her either a wide variety of reasons.  And the emails are actually an issue. It reeks of political elitism and entitlement in the vein of "rules for thee, none for me". NO ONE is any administration should be using a private email address or a private email server to do state business. The government literally has whole departments to run those things for very specific reasons. Trump's people who immediately did the same thing (and Colin Powell before Clinton) should all be scrutinized equally for the same issue -- a national security one.

33cs1	> You've not refuted anything. You've provided your opinion. That is an important piece of information here. Just because we believe something, that doesn't make it fact.  You said they can't be neoliberals because they aren't fiscally conservative.  I provided evidence that they've been passing and championing far right fiscal conservative policy goals, even going into executive orders when the will in congress didn't exist to work with him.  I've given first party sources backing up that claim.  You've done nothing to refute that other than choose not to believe that.  > Obama implemented far more regulatory rules than he reduced, and it's not really that close.  [citation needed]  I'm getting the sense you don't actually know what a neoliberal is and simply don't like the term.

Discovery, once a case has started can delay court dates nearly indefinitely without rebuttals.  You can literally protest every single call for every single step until the case is 15 years old. Easily.  Again, this is only at the discovery stage. They haven't taken a single Trump family member's deposition.  While I feel many are taking solace from the fact this high of a court has turned his appeal away, I think they only did so because it will effectively still play no part in slowing them down until the clock has run out, so they don't have to step out and embarrass themselves by standing by their guy.	1642720801.0	htiw2t2	t3_s84jxv	t1_htfqz46	/r/politics/comments/s84jxv/megathread_supreme_court_rejects_trumps_request/htiw2t2/

Being able to point to an actual vote gives marginal benefits at best when you're cutting campaign ads. Yes, the framing of "Manchin *voted against* X" can be slightly beneficial over "Manchin is against X," but is it worth the political disadvantages of doomed show votes? That's the question that gets too little consideration when this subject comes up.  Plus, those benefits--to the extent that they exist--apply only to the senators in question. Neither of whom are up for reelection this cycle. The disadvantages, however, apply nationally and more immediately.	1642720883.0	htiwa1z	t3_s8tg7n	t1_htishqd	/r/politics/comments/s8tg7n/schumer_insists_failed_votes_on_elections_and/htiwa1z/

Voting rights, climate change, public-option healthcare, legalizing weed, free college, taxing the rich, enacting justice against seditionists? I’ve got some news for you… those evil “centrist Dems” already have policies for all of it. *They are not getting passed because of fucking obstruction.* To remedy this they have tried everything that is legally possible to do, including trying to change senate rules.  > Centrists have had their chance. They've given us a DNC that can't rule  > If you're not going to oppose Republicans  This is now purely nonsensical.

fk020	I never said anything about business owners and I never said they're all rich. I simply stated that trickle down economics doesn't work. It's never worked, it didn't work in Kansas and it won't work now.     I never shit talked your industry or anything regarding restaurants. I'm simply stating that if you really want to help people then we should be giving everyone in need money and that will also help support restaurants. The best way to help restaurants survive isn't to subsidize them directly, but to increase demand by making demand for eating out go up by giving people more discretionary income. You say you want to help people and interact with them, but that's not going to happen if people don't have much money to spend there and you're living off the government subsidizing restaurants instead.	1642720907.0	htiwc81	t3_s7vcpi	t1_hte0k3d	/r/politics/comments/s7vcpi/biden_administration_unveils_plan_to_combat/htiwc81/

Because you can't change government if all you do is vote in the general election. Money wins races so "corporate Democrats" have a real leg up on liberals in the primary. If you want to elect liberals, it's not enough to show up and vote Democrat in the general election, you have to make sure they win the primaries.

Not in a safe, just openly in a shelf, while total strangers entered the house and looked around. He also had a ( minor) daughter who sometimes stayed with him.

Sure, these traits will be something to celebrate in the WH one day but the individual matters and nobody likes Kamala.  Even less so than Biden.  She’s polling at the worst a VP ever has so early in the presidency.  That’s a bad sign for a person with baggage and donations showing they’re a puppet for LE and corporations.

c5yrjr04	Integral to the Jan 6 plan The scheme was integral to Trump's plan to get then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw out Biden's electors and replace them with the GOP electors on January 6 when Congress counted the electoral votes. It has also come under renewed scrutiny by the January 6 select committee and state attorneys general, raising questions about the involvement of Trump's campaign and whether any laws were broken. Committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi told reporters Thursday the panel is looking into whether there was a broader conspiracy or involvement from the Trump White House in the creation or submission of these fake electors. "That's a concern" Thompson said. In its subpoena letter sent to Giuliani on Tuesday, the House committee specifically references his efforts to convince state legislatures to overturn election results. The document cites Giuliani's comments from December 2020 in which he publicly urged lawmakers in Michigan to award the state's electoral votes to Trump. One of the pro-Trump electors from Pennsylvania, Sam DeMarco, told CNN there was a last-minute dispute, where the state's GOP electors pushed Trump campaign officials to add legal caveats to the fake certificate to say they were only electors-in-waiting, if Trump's legal challenges prevailed. The fake documents from Pennsylvania and New Mexico ultimately contained these caveats, but the documents from the other five states explicitly claimed, falsely, that the pro-Trump electors were the rightful electors. It's not clear that any of the fake electors themselves participated in strategy sessions with top Trump campaign brass. But both Maddock from Michigan and DeMarco from Pennsylvania have said they were in direct contact with members of the Trump campaign. Many of the players involved in the scheme, including Maddock, stand by their actions and are still pushing the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Giuliani, a Trump spokesperson and a representative from Stand Up Michigan did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.	1642722791.0	htj0wca	t3_s8t3bw	t1_htig7ll	/r/politics/comments/s8t3bw/trump_campaign_officials_led_by_rudy_giuliani/htj0wca/

ast4sejo	The government certainly facilitated the problem but the universities were the beneficiaries and should be held accountable for knowingly bilking students.  They allow students to pursue degrees that make zero economic sense while letting costs continue to spiral.  How is it even possible that with all the technological advancements, universities claim poverty raising tuition?  The first step in resolving the issue should start with each university being responsible for the outstanding debt they created.  Perhaps they'd be a little less likely to funnel students into nonsense majors or implement a radical concept that universities should base tuition the field of study; acknowledging that computer engineering has a different cost structure than art history.	1642722877.0	htj13sb	t3_s8rf99	t3_s8rf99	/r/politics/comments/s8rf99/why_the_student_debt_catastrophe_was_avoidable/htj13sb/

Not to be a defeatist, but we've all but already lost the midterms, whether it's the Dems fault or not, unless they somehow find a way to give out free COVID-safe handjobs in exchange for votes.  Is that what we're settling for? 11 more months of democracy before it's guaranteed to fail?

9nutq	You are building up quite a few strawmen there.     Means of production can apply to services and not just goods.     \>where will Bernie put the factories to manufacture this healthcare equipment?     Bernie doesn't want to socialize all of healthcare. Only the insurance side of it. This would still allow for private companies to still produce equipment and provide care. It would centralize payment and funding like has been done in literally every single other first world country in a way that has been proven to produce the same or better outcomes for people at a fraction of the cost.     As a great example, in 2021 alone the single health insurance company UnitedHealth Group reported $4.37bn in profit. In a socialized profitless scenario the people paying them would have paid a combined 4.37 Billion less and been able to spend that money elsewhere in the economy. Or 4.37B more care would have been provided (or a mix). What is more important in healthcare? Making sure people get well or siphoning billions of dollars out of peoples pockets to the CEO and shareholders of these companies?     Socialism does not need to apply to every single facet of an industry to socialize part of it.     Socialism is not an all or nothing for a society. You can have specific industries be socialized and not others, infact that is the best way to do it. Socialism works well for areas of the economy where outcome is more important than profits, or profit motive gets in the way of the public good.     Schools are a perfect example. They produce the service of educating children and also child care. Educating children is an industry where the outcome of educating children is more important then someone making money off of the children's education. A private education system would price out poor children which is detrimental to societ as a whole so we as a society said "we will pay for it through our tax money as a social program."     Another great one is Firefighting. Fire Fighters in the USA used to be private companies but it worked like shit because their main purpose was to make money, not to fight fires. Some great examples of it here:     [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/early-19-century-firefighters-fought-fires-each-other-180960391/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/early-19-century-firefighters-fought-fires-each-other-180960391/)     \>have you forgotten why Socialism is bad? did Russia and (old) China buy from private companies, or did they own all the companies?     Socialism isn't bad in itself, it is just an economic system. Socializing every single aspect of a economy is not a good idea for various reasons, but privatizing all of them is equally a bad idea. Most people wouldn't want to privatize the police, the courts, and libraries, public education, road ownership, national defense or a large number of other government services.     The problems with Russia and China were that it was fascist governments, not democratic governments, that took over so the mean of production weren't owned by the people, they were owned by the dictators and their small in groups. But here in the USA we have a people "by the people for the people". And if our elected officials aren't living up that ideal and working in our interest we should vote them out.     Countries like Norway and Sweden and Denmark practice Democratic Socialism in many but not all industries and it works wonderfully. And that is what Bernie is according to his own words, a Democratic Socialist. He doesn't want every single company and industry privatized, only the ones where the social good of ensuring good outcomes is more important than profits. Specifically Healthcare and Higher Education.	1642723016.0	htj1fp5	t3_s8ril5	t1_htihh15	/r/politics/comments/s8ril5/im_not_bernie_sanders_im_a_mainstream_democrat/htj1fp5/

mqbri	If democratic socialists were socialists, they would just be called socialists. There would be no need for the second word. And yet, it’s always used. Because it’s a different thing.  Words can have different meanings when adjectives are placed between them. For example, if I told you that I was going to give you a facetious compliment, you wouldn’t go around telling everyone that you are about to be complimented because the word compliment is in the phrase I said. The adjective changes the meaning to something different. It’s the same case here. The word democratic changes the meaning of the noun socialist. Just as a facetious compliment is not a compliment, a democratic socialist is not a socialist.   And this happens because the belief system of democratic socialists are different in application from socialists. That’s why we add the word; to differentiate between the two.	1642723024.0	htj1gb3	t3_s8ril5	t1_htiq5kk	/r/politics/comments/s8ril5/im_not_bernie_sanders_im_a_mainstream_democrat/htj1gb3/

And actually multiple high-command generals (which are better experts than you are) testified against Joe Biden and specified that they suggested a better approach. Oh, and Trump actually wrote that if it was him there would be no casualties. Now it's up to you to choose who to believe: Trump who led even more complicated military operations in his term (Syria, killing Solemeini, etc.), or Biden who failed in foreign policy both now and during his vice-presidency. (Russia literally invaded Crimea and Donbass regions of Ukraine under his and Obama's watch).

orn1a	Again, I'm not talking about CCWs specifically.  More strict gun laws leads to fewer gun related deaths, Australia proves this.  I don't care if CCWs are better/worse than open carry or whatever.  What is your source?   Per the CDC Vermont has 9.3 deaths per 100k which is well higher than NJ, NY, MA, HI, CT, and CA which all have more strict laws.  That is a coincidence?   AK, AL, MS, WY, MO, AR, LA, GA, MT, SC and many other states all have MUCH high gun violence rates, and more relaxed gun laws.  Also a coincidence?  [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm\_mortality/firearm.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm)     That is your hypothesis, do you have any proof?  Because a strong correlation between gun laws and gun crimes is demonstrated in Australia and the article posted.  It also goes with common sense.  Again, your article was about CCWs, I don't care about CCWs.  But just because there hasn't been a study that proves it, that doesn't mean it is true.  Gun violence is a hugely complicated issue that can be affected by many things.	1642723161.0	htj1s80	t3_s8mqre	t1_htiud0m	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htj1s80/

Yet the legislature can really never be undone away from GOP rule and we're probably about to elect one of the more notable Trump sympathizers in the state in Mastriano.  Meaning in 2024, Pennsylvania will be a state that will send separate electors even if Biden wins.

33cs1	The ACA was literally written by the Heritage Foundation as the 1993's HEART Act to be the small government approach to healthcare, as I stated originally.  It was literally written by a far right think tank as the fiscally conservative option to healthcare reform.  If we're gatekeeping the literal heritage foundation from fiscal conservatism, then I guess words just don't have meaning anymore.  And your citation is specious at best.  It for some reason conflates .gov internal spending and internal regulation requirements with private market regulation, and that's the only way it ends up with greater regulation overhead than reduced.  That's about what I expect out of a blog from a right wing think tank.  An you still haven't answered which policies have they passed that aren't in line with neoliberalism, unless you're trying to make the incredibly vacuous claim that the ACA counts.	1642723207.0	htj1w70	t3_s8j84w	t1_htixz3y	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htj1w70/
1ecg9mcp	To your first point- the mental health item might have worse ramifications. Preventing people with mental health from doing things (holding certain jobs like pilots, driving, owning guns etc) can lead to people just ignoring problems and not getting the help they need. Just a side note on that.   Do I think that was a responsible gun owner? No I do not. Do I think everyone should take gun safety courses, and practice firing their firearms? Yes I do. But there are plenty of safety items we don’t mandate in the US. We don’t require people understand how to maintain their vehicles which are rolling explosions-saw someone driving with a smoking engine down the highway for 15 miles, ignore it, then catch on fire. Could’ve injured tons of people. Just an example.   If gun safety courses were offered for free, regularly, without nonsense hoops to jump through, I think gun safety would go up. But instead most proposed “common sense” gun legislation I see adds absurd costs and fees, and admin burden that just tries to prevent law abiding citizens from purchasing guns.	1642723211.0	htj1wjh	t3_s8mqre	t1_htj0t6a	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htj1wjh/

31nm3	Ruy was responsible for a lot of decisions that made 9/11 worse.  He was the one who decreed that the NYC Emergency Management Office would be in the World Trade Center, even though [a site in the Bronx was determined to be more secure](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/us/politics/26emergency.html) and [less likely to be a target of an attack](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2007/05/guiliani_blames_aide_for_poor_emergency_planning.html).  He was the one who oversaw a no-bid contract to replace first responders' radios. These radios were deemed to be faulty early in 2001, forcing first responders to use decades old analog radios with incompatible frequencies and shorter ranges. The 9/11 Commission determined that these radios were the reason many first responders never got an evacuation call and were killed in the WTC collapse. Replacing those radios was a low priority for Guiliani, because not only were they not replaced the same year, [they weren't replaced for several years after the the 9/11 Commission released their report](http://nyassembly.gov/comm/GovOps/20040426/).  Instead of allowing FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, or OSHA to manage recovery efforts he put the relatively unknown NYC Department of Design and Construction in charge and made the feds go through there.  When it was discovered that toxic chemicals from the WTC (like asbestos) [were spread over a much larger area than initially estimated](https://web.archive.org/web/20100611191219/http://www.sierraclub.org/groundzero/), instead of sending in the EPA to affect cleanup Guiliani instead left it up to individual building managers to handle it.  When the EPA tried to make sure everyone at Ground Zero was wearing respirators [Guiliani interfered with those efforts](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/christie-blasts-rudy-wtc-air-article-1.224008). This lead to [many workers developing lung diseases](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html).  [Members of FDNY believe Guiliani prioritized the recovery of precious metals from the World Trade Center site](https://web.archive.org/web/20070404003924/http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/09/giuliani.firefighters.ap/index.html), over the recovery of bodies, leaving victims and first responders to either be buried forever or dug up and disposed of as refuse during construction.

109lnwrs	Yep. If either Manchin or Sinema were in contested primaries, they’d flip in a heartbeat. They’ve shown us who they are, and who they are isn’t what people wanted when they voted for them. Wolves in sheep’s clothing couldn’t be more appropriate. And they’re consistent about it. Not like they broke ranks once or twice, they’re committed to the Republican agenda while disguising themselves as democrats. Not like they found some fortitude or grace after 4 years of nightmare trump. They’re trying to continue his abhorrent legacy.

6bccb	Even if that had anything to do with voting rights..  That's a very odd interpretation of the role of a U.S. Senator. Yes, your state's constituency is important, but at the end of the day you are enacting legislation for the country at large and working with your caucus.  If someone strictly followed that philosophy to no end, important legislation would needlessly fail and you would only hurt your party's political chances.

6fo2q	100% and it's why a lot of places that SHOULD be given state-hood will never be. The party that those new Senators would likely belong to is given 1000:1 priority when it comes to consideration, and the actual good of the people and striving to properly give them representation is given 0 priority.  That's why you'll see a lot of Republicans for example who love the idea of splitting California into three states, with two of those states potentially given borders such that the Senate gains 4 more GOP seats...but yet for these same people, hell would have to freeze over before they'd consider granting statehood to Puerto Rico, D.C., etc because those would be (D) seats.	1642723353.0	htj290z	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htivwpj	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htj290z/

They're terrorists that tried to overthrow democracy because they didn't like the results of the election.  We punish kids that steal candy and we punish people who murder, doesn't mean they deserve the same punishment.  You can rebuild a building and or fine them or jail them if they're random riotors and looters, but this is on a whole other level, like comparing apples to oranges. Seriously, when's the last time you remember some Americans trying to overthrow the US and storming the capitol?

Note that these reforms would be overwhelmingly more likely to cause substantial reductions in violent crime than the ability to shut down gun stores during  COVID lol.	1642723392.0	htj2cdb	t3_s8v3cx	t1_htiyhyi	/r/politics/comments/s8v3cx/californias_covid_gun_store_shutdowns_ruled/htj2cdb/

Now your upset the the new Governor is using an Executive Order to grant the people who felt forced to wear a mask the freedom to choose if they would like to wear one. It does not force you NOT to wear a mask. Shit if you like to you could wear 7 masks at the same time. All that has happened is the citizens of Virginia received there freedom of choice back. I will ask you this question too… what percentage of protection does a mask offer? Is that percentage worth the damage that masking kids does to their social development?

baaj7pzj	You sound clueless. Getting rid of the stock market would fuck over the middle class and really screw the chances of people growing their wealth. Investing via stocks is one of the best way to grow wealth, and one of the best ways to level up. "Getting rid of the market" means you no longer think that anybody should be allowed to buy or sell shares, so then all companies would be PRIVATE and then the wealth would be even MORE concentrated and exclusive to only the rich.   Why should the right to buy/sell stocks be eliminated from the American people in your situation, and ACTUALLY exclusive to only the mega wealthy? Also, the number of Americans actually invested in the market is NOT small - at all - majority of Americans retirement funds are in the market. (Which is why getting rid of the market is a horrific idea).    Saying the market is only useful for a select few is the most ignorant comment ever. You clearly don't understand markets or valuations, but don't go and take that away from the millions of retail investors who do. And most people don't have to pay a company to manage their money. Target Date Funds have been around for 10+ years.

By controlling the language they already got out ahead of this.  The regs need to be unavoidable. Ie:  You get audited by the IRS as a requirement to take office, the records are made public, and the assets you have beyond certain allowances go into management by the TSP. The TSP is the thrift savings plan, the 401(k) program that federal employees have access to.  If you are found to have hidden any assets,  double their value is seized and you face mandatory minimum prison time.

Its not ageism to point out that he is old as fuck and seems to be having difficulty keeping up with questions. It's completely understandable to want the leader of our country to be mentally sound. So many promises on Bidens 2020 website that is still up, by the way. All of them broken. This presidency is over. I voted for him and I'm beyond disgusted. I won't be supporting him again. Don't cry and label things "ageism" because you can't admit that he just fuckin sucks. Its a weak pathetic way to argue your point. Here is a list of things Biden could have done this year with executive authority: [https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/using-presidential-power-executive-authority/](https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/using-presidential-power-executive-authority/)  He has done none of them.

i0j4n	We can use your citation.   Here's [another](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/final-presidential-job-approval-ratings).  And [another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating).  For the sake of this conversation we'll stick to yours.  Here's OPs claim:  >better than Trump but worse than every other President.  I asked how OP measured that.  Op said "Check Biden’s approval rating"  That doesn't really say much does it?  So, I pressed and OP stated:    >**Biden has the 2nd lowest approval rating of any president except Trump.** And it’s steadily going down. He entered with 61% approval rating and its down to 42% and going down. Which means most Americans think Biden is doing a shitty job as President. So I’m using that metric plus common sense and there you go.  That is factually false.  GW was in the 20's, Clinton 30's, G Bush 30's, Reagan 30's, Truman 20's, and several more.  And, unless I'm mistaken, you're suggesting Op is correct based on "day 366" data?  Which OP didn't specify but ok.  Based on your citation, Biden has not hit the second lowest rating of all time, Bidens approval rating average is not the second lowest, Bidens approval rating decline is not the second sharpest, Bidens approval rating is not estimated to drop below 40%, and trump and GW are the only two POTUS' who started their presidency below 50%.  Using data from "day 366" is misrepresenting data and ignoring any context during each presidents tenure that created different ratings at certain times.  Which is why I tried to be fair and used averages.  Bill Clinton was lower than Biden from Day 106 to 235, Gerald Ford was shitty pretty much most of the time.   Wonder how did GW Bush's approval rating take such a steep jump on 237?   In several days Carter and Truman is about to go below Biden.  Reagan and Johnson too.  So yea, sure.  *On Day 366*, he's "better than Trump but worse than every other President" that came **after WW2** if we ignore plenty of context, and all the other presidents before.  And on Day 269, GW Bush was the best President ever since WW2.  Maybe tomorrow Biden will jump up past Gerald Ford and Op will be a big fat phony?    We can make the numbers fit whatever narrative we want.   Op wanted to be coy with any sources or specifics to back up their claim which was presented in a dishonest way.	1642723511.0	htj2mkl	t3_s8n4ot	t1_htica77	/r/politics/comments/s8n4ot/one_year_into_his_presidency_bidens/htj2mkl/

You can vote for what your constituents need (even the poor ones, even the deluded ones, even the ones that don’t believe in climate change but will be affected by it) and tell them why. Or, if you don’t think that’s your role, you can vote for what your constituents want, while still advocating for what you think is right.

ci5kw934	I live in a deep blue state. We have no issues here with getting to vote on Election Day. Everyone shows their ID and are checked against the legal voter rolls. If it matches we get our ballot to vote. If someone requests an absentee ballot, and are on the voter roll and still a resident, they get their ballot. I don’t trust either side to do any ballot harvesting and I completely disagree with mass mailing of ballots. I do think anyone who wants to register to vote, should present their legal proof of citizenship and photo ID in advance (not on Election Day) and get on the voter roll. We should offer folks who can’t pay for a photo ID the ability to get one for free, if they are legal citizens. Both sides in D.C. suck! And both sides utilize precision gerrymandering to try and get or keep control.

Trying to save face would mean she was giving a statement that was contrary to what she actually supports, possibly because she knows it won't pass or because she will make sure it doesn't. That would mean her statement is just fluff meant to improve her public image.	1642723647.0	htj2ydv	t3_s8ov89	t1_htiqqyz	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/htj2ydv/

qrjfbn	Really?  This is so confusing to me. I live in Northeast PA with family ties to NYC and Atlantic City. So all my life, growing up in the 80s, I heard the Trump name cursed as he was a bad businessman who was a known racist, who stiffed contractors, and was always embroiled in lawsuits.  I was raised by Republicans growing up, and Trump was hated by both the Republicans and the Democrats in my family.   When he ran for office he was able to pull the wool over a lot of people's eyes, but not most of my family members, they knew what he was from way back.	1642723653.0	htj2yx6	t3_s8t3bw	t1_htimlc3	/r/politics/comments/s8t3bw/trump_campaign_officials_led_by_rudy_giuliani/htj2yx6/

All this law will do is stop them from specifying, openly and obviously creating a conflict of interest.   It would still be hard to prove how relatives and friends continue to get juicy stock tips, and as such leaves them with the same potential to be manipulated.     Such a law would need to broaden insider trading laws to everyone they know, or they can still corruptly gain from decisions, therefor have decisions steered based on personal finance.	1642723781.0	htj39ug	t3_s8ov89	t3_s8ov89	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/htj39ug/

bkout	You're mostly correct. It's just that good people demanding accountability does nothing, because accountability isn't in any way found through moral or ethical demands.  The entire system moves on capital. You can demand racial equality in the justice system for instance, but as long as wealth (power) is easily expended by one class, they will not be held accountable at the same level as those without.  Connected people with money can simply hire attorneys who are themselves connected to the justice system. These people literally hang out at the same bars after work.  You just gotta pay, and you can pretty much do what you want. One of the exceptions is stealing from others with connections and large amounts of money.	1642723867.0	htj3h3v	t3_s8vekk	t1_htj1hle	/r/politics/comments/s8vekk/lauren_boebert_asked_jews_visiting_us_capitol_if/htj3h3v/

All next steps would be a huge social chaos, but let's assume both sides accept to follow old-and-outdated procedures.    1) No Vice-President = No certified results on Jan 6 (a first for the country since Washington's reelection)   2) No certified results? No legal election (there's no special case written in law, that's the chaos civil war part)   3) In a US without an elected president, the next one is decided by House and Senate   4) Because of how votes are counted, in early 2021 both votes are under GOP "majority"    Guess what candidate would be favored by the GOP?

11aacj	The point of the 1/6 committee is just to find the truth, including about others besides Trump. They can refer things they find to the DOJ, so there is a possibility of criminal prosecution because of it, but who knows about that. The truth still matters whether it will result in criminal convictions or not or whether it changes any Trump supporters mind or not (I agree it won't do that).   Do you really think the better alternative is just to do nothing and move on like nothing happened? At least finding the truth puts it out there for history and reality.   Also Fani Willis and Tish James definitely don't think Trump is untouchable.	1642723934.0	htj3mv3	t3_s84jxv	t1_htiujgr	/r/politics/comments/s84jxv/megathread_supreme_court_rejects_trumps_request/htj3mv3/

I did point a gun at you when you were sitting on a car." [Note your own quotation marks]  , I think we can get somewhere with this.  ----   > So you accept the video and audio evidence that that "yellow pants" identified Rittenhouse as pointing his rifle at him. Correct?  If you can transcribe the conversation between yellow pants and Rittenhouse and can show me where he says that. I transcribed their conversation and nowhere can I see him saying anything close to that.   The only information yellow pants exchanges with Rittenhouse regarding the gun is the the visual of holding the rifle down towards the ground.	1642723957.0	htj3otr	t3_s7wq7m	t1_htj22sq	/r/politics/comments/s7wq7m/the_kyle_rittenhouse_case_revealed_a_gap_in_gun/htj3otr/

Ranked-choice voting has been implemented statewide by the Democratic legislature of Maine, as well as the Republican-leaning voters of Alaska (kudos to them).  At the local level, it has been adopted by dozens of US cities, almost all of which happen to be Democratic strongholds. It seems the appetite for this reform is not the same for both parties.	1642723965.0	htj3pk1	t3_s8nbh3	t1_htisndz	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htj3pk1/

numebnp	I'm not arguing that those effects aren't there. I'm arguing it's not the primary motivation, no matter how many articles and news sources make that connection and imply that it's the primary reasoning.  I'm utilizing Occams razor here. It doesn't stand to reason that Republican politicians would choose to pass harmful laws in general just because they want to hurt POC or even just people in general. That would require multiple layers of ulterior motives, complete likemindedness from every politician contributing (they are in the thousands and all in positions of governmental power), and implies that they have an interest in hiding their motives when that view requires that they must have plainly shown that it doesn't matter to them. There are too many layers of intent and circumstance required for it to make sense.  The Republican party could be rebranded The Racist Illuminati if it were true. It's too ridiculous. It's the same general fallacy as Republicans claiming every Democrat is actually a communist, or that there's a war on Christmas because your local business put up a sign saying "Happy Holidays".  To reiterate; I'm not arguing that the effects aren't there. They very much are. However unintended consequences exist, and a far more reasonable general explanation for their actions is a desire to gain or retain power and money.  Are there racists in the US and in government? Absolutely. Is everyone who works for the Republican party or who leans conservative a racist? Very unlikely in theory, and proven blatantly false if one actually speaks to conservative minded people.  TL;DR: Stereotypes are never fully correct, and the simplest answer is usually the correct one.	1642723995.0	htj3s13	t3_s8hjgf	t1_hti1yi9	/r/politics/comments/s8hjgf/trump_held_secret_meetings_in_days_before_capitol/htj3s13/

30oo0hzb	>There it is. The classic "criminals don't follow the law so we shouldn't have any laws about guns, specifically" defense.  So why is it that in a majority of the country states with lax gun laws don't have significantly more mass shootings than other states with far more gun laws and similar levels of population? Do you agree with that baseless statement I was refuting with statistics or not?  I never argued that there should be no gun laws, there needs to be gun laws (and some that statistically don't reduce gun violence), are you running out of things to argue back with lol?	1642724068.0	htj3y8l	t3_s8mqre	t1_htj3jgu	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htj3y8l/

Maybe, require the industry to offer gun safety courses to keep PLCAA would be a step?

In theory, she’s a douche bag; in reality she is a dangerous douchebag. In the end - we have to be understanding of the former so as not to fallaciously apply guilt to all Christians by their umbrella association to the specific crazy ones; but, with that we also have to be cognizant of the latter because of the damage they do and can do.   So, might try less denying they are part of your group and more acknowledgment of the fact that all groups have outliers and look at what can be done within your group to hold the crazy accountable.

6fyd5rd9	>Society has always had riotors and looters and arsonists, you trying to equate that with insurrectionists is laughable.    And society has also had a lot of murders… not because something occurs repeatedly, means it is alright.   >They're terrorists that tried to overthrow democracy…  The democratic system of the United States does not lie within one building nor within one person. The fact that you even presume that they had the power to do so is more laughable. Are they shitheads and criminals? Absolutely, yes. Are they insurrections with the power to overthrow a whole government? No.   >We punish kids that steal candy and we punish people who murder, doesn't mean they deserve the same punishment.    No, they don’t deserve the same punishment, but they deserve punishment. I never mentioned that they should. Only that both need to answer to justice and be tried—probably sentenced too—according to law. As I said, my problem is with the media and government officials that do not want to punish the rioters.  >You can rebuild a building…  You can. However, it costs money. Who pays for it? Do the people paying have the means to rebuild it at all? Are they gonna get their jobs back? What else is at risk? It is the consequences that are more straining to the people than the action itself.   >Seriously, when's the last time you remember some Americans trying to overthrow the US and storming the capitol?    Never seen it. It is messed up that they tried to storm the Capitol. I’m not justifying them or making their crime seem less severe. And I’ll mention it again: there is no way a bunch of idiots could even topple a whole ass government.   >even the 9/11 guys didn't get that far.  Okay, it is certainly a tragedy what happened in the Capitol. But enough to compare it with 9/11? I don’t think so. Not only did the 9/11 had more deaths, but it also had more property damage. That was not a threat to democracy, but rather a threat to safety. Again, that people suggest that the US was about to be overthrown that day is ridiculous.	1642724316.0	htj4jme	t3_s81gzq	t1_htj2bba	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/htj4jme/

Newsmax, bannons podcast, turning point (ran troll farms, still probably does), OANN, infowars, etc. if the evangelicals and nationalists only watch this then they don’t ever see any of the evidence anyway.   How do we get them to see all the bad things?  Because a game of statistics….some will say no more trump, some will say he belongs in jail, some will say well time to get another candidate, a lot won’t care, a lot won’t believe if, right?     But if enough do change their attitude toward him it will be enough.   So again, how the heck do we get 30-40%ish of the population to see all this?     Do we just say screw it and just start posting all the evidence right on their Facebook pages.  I’ll lose a lot of “friends” and family.  (I live in a trump county).

ws3e6	Not the one who posted this, but I can inject my PoV as a socialist here.  Capitalism is an entrenchment of unequal conditions on people based on race and class. To be fiscally conservative is to support that hierarchical structure. What this means is that a fiscal conservative is inherently alright with the suffering of minorities as long as it's systemic suffering. In addition to this fiscal conservatives usually support the slashing of the welfare state which leaves these poor groups in an even worse condition.  It's kinda hard to actually claim to be socially progressive when the financial side of your ideology is fine with supporting the entrenchment of wealth created by colonialism and slavery.	1642724413.0	htj4rxh	t3_s8j84w	t1_hti7qyz	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htj4rxh/

i5bbasec	Strategically he should have started playing this game sometime between May-July 2022 for increasing midterm turnout. These bills are written in extremely partisan manner with very little wiggle room for negotiation and would likely get crushed in a court challenge if enacted.  Traditionally such bills are purely election optic/narrative fodder designed and spun to elicit strong emotions from our base and some swing voters but never meant to be passed.   If Chuck had wanted these bills passed then he would have gutted everything that states could challenge in court as a violation of 'states rights'.	1642724471.0	htj4wug	t3_s8pkeu	t1_hthrwou	/r/politics/comments/s8pkeu/media_messes_up_coverage_of_voting_rights_blames/htj4wug/

53o9y	It's a total non-answer. Becasue who is not for letting American people live their lives? No one except bonafide terrorists and serial killers are for **not** letting people live their lives.  Even if you interpret it literally, his answer stands in defiance of most positions he and his republican friends take. Like letting American people live their lives by making their own decisions about pregnancy, choosing to use a relatively benign drug (compared to ALCOHOL), choosing to marry whatever other human they want to marry, actually literally having guarantees about their healthcare so they can, ya know, **live**, etc...  Republican policies are mostly about *imposing* their way of life onto everyone else and dragging them down to live in their own miserable lives. Without weed, trapped in a pregnancy they cannot support with no other options, only being able to marry the opposite sex and apparently having the constant risk of a bankruptcy triggering health event.  Even a hardcore libertarian would have problems with all of that, and hardcore libertarians are crazy.

4zrhxk9a	2020 is an anomaly, especially considering a large portion of the stimulus wasn't taxed. The number before was in the 40s and dropping. And half of those not paying fed tax are retirees living off of social security, where as the majority of people asking for these things are younger and still in the work force. Additionally most of the rest who didn't pay fed tax was because they simply didn't make enough money and they start paying again 1-3 years.  You're heavily misrepresenting this statistic with classic GOP talking points.	1642724589.0	htj56uy	t3_s8pkeu	t1_hthzm1r	/r/politics/comments/s8pkeu/media_messes_up_coverage_of_voting_rights_blames/htj56uy/

And that in all likelihood if we were to force full training on 100% of things that have some chance of harm, our lives would be negatively affected by the never ending safety courses and features.   Second of all, restricting gun purchases to wealthy is classist and racist, just like voter ID laws, poll taxes and other similar things.

30oo0hzb	yes its clear certain laws didn't matter in reducing the number and frequency of mass shooting seeing as how, looking at the data, there isn't significantly more mass shootings among states with similar population levels because one state doesn't for example ban AR15s or have some other restrictions in place on carrying guns.  I never argued there should be no gun laws, once. I will argue, statistically, certain gun restrictions don't impact gun crime. its clear that a lot of gun laws don't impact mass shootings or we would see it overall and we don't.	1642724728.0	htj5is6	t3_s8mqre	t1_htj4xth	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htj5is6/

When you can't afford a day off of work and something like bus fare is a major expense, then just getting to a place that's miles away and is only open when you're working is a major hurdle.  I don't think that a person's income should ever effect their ability to vote.     I would actually be in favor of voter ID laws if the IDs were free and the facilities you got them from where both everywhere and open long enough that any person working any shift can go there without missing work.

I mean seriously man… is this really suppressing anyone or is this just another fuck-you-agenda for the democrats?  Throw the race word out there and now all of a sudden anyone who disagrees with you is automatically a racist bigoted asshole.  This is the democrats new way to assert dominance in any topic.  It’s getting old real fast.  If you can’t find a valid argument for shit without making it about race or sexuality, I’d love to hear it.

None of these laws restrict trading *per se*, they just enact harsh punishments should someone be found to be supplying inside information to others.

[Here is the future we are likely going to have](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stakeholder-capitalism-new-metrics-by-klaus-schwab-2019-11)   A quote from the 2019 article:  “Stakeholder capitalism,” a model I first proposed a half-century ago, positions private corporations as trustees of society, and is clearly the best response to today’s social and environmental challenges....  And  "To uphold the principles of stakeholder capitalism, companies need new metrics. For starters, a new measure of 'shared value creation' should include 'environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals as a complement to standard financial metrics"   And you can see, [we are well on the way](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/). That's from 2020 and look at the economic situation now early 2022. It's coming together.   This may sound okay, but do we really expect corporations to act fair and according to these priciples? Or are they going to do what every corporation does and pass the buck to the customer (the public). I am extremely sceptical we are being sold snake oil with a promise of a better future, when really it will be corporate enslavement of humanity.   We will likely have a corprocracy going forward with social credit scores/digital IDs/Wallets all rolled into one unique identifier. A few private corporations will control everything and everyone, which is a fucking terrifying thought.	1642724941.0	htj60u2	t3_s8ov89	t1_htio1kb	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/htj60u2/

I’m a strong supporter of democratic processes like voting, but the problem is that the powers that be have been it exponentially harder for this actual process to work the way it’s supposed to. This issue is far too complicated to address in a Reddit conversation, but I’m sure you can look into it if you choose to do so.

I don’t believe in restricting any kind of access to what type of gun I want. I am a owner of A.R. 15. I have it because I like it and it’s fun to shoot and if someone were to come in my house I would destroy them with it safely. Because I train myself on how to handle a weapon. The numbers will show you the stronger the gun Control laws the higher the crime rate goes up because the criminals know the citizens aren’t armed.	1642724973.0	htj63ip	t3_s728h3	t1_htj4stx	/r/politics/comments/s728h3/hundreds_of_virginia_schools_rebel_against_glenn/htj63ip/

It isn't their fault for centuries of colonialism and racism leading to the American South to support Jim crow. Are you seriously going to blame every single problem on the democrats, many of which have root causes that stem way back before the Democratic party even existed?  2.

1l2y6r7p	>We can make the numbers fit whatever narrative we want. Op wanted to be coy with any sources or specifics to back up their claim which was presented in a dishonest way.  Your rebuttal is markedly shallow and partisan.  The original claim was correct. President Biden has the second worst approval rating at the end of his first year since at least Truman according to aggregate 538 polling.. Your attempt to cherry pick data points outside of the 366 days Biden has been in office is dishonest.  An honest answer would correctly interpret data points with like data points; polling in the 366 days of each president's first (or only) term.   >That is factually false. GW was in the 20's, Clinton 30's, G Bush 30's, Reagan 30's, Truman 20's, and several more.  At no point in the first year was W Bush in the 20s (it's not possessive don't use an apostrophe), Clinton never in the 30s, HW Bush in the 30s, or Truman in the 20s. To reiterate: you cannot compare polling beyond 366 days in office.  >Biden has not hit the second lowest rating of all time So, tell me what president hit the second lowest at day 366?   >of all time  The poster never said, "of all time." That's your partisan attempt to sow disinformation and change the narrative.  >Bidens approval rating is not estimated to drop below 40%,  Those aren't facts.  Don't substitute your hope with the data points up to day 366.  >Maybe tomorrow Biden will jump up past Gerald Ford and Op will be a big fat phony?  If it happens the polling will show it. You're still operating on partisan hope.  >We can make the numbers fit whatever narrative we want.  No, it isn't "we".  You attempted to reorientate the narrative away from the current situation at day 366.	1642725033.0	htj68o8	t3_s8n4ot	t1_htj2mkl	/r/politics/comments/s8n4ot/one_year_into_his_presidency_bidens/htj68o8/

3d90s	If you were approaching this in good-faith, you might recognize that nobody is "ignoring crime," they just have different and data-based ideas on what prevents crime and what police actually do.   The vast majority of the defund movement was saying the same things that police unions were: That social services have had their budgets cut and given to police, saying "here, you do it." Mental health workers have been cut and their budget given to police, saying "you do it now." Animal control, domestic counseling, and so much else has been cut, funding funneled to police, and officers on the job now spend a lot of their time doing things which shouldn't be their responsibility. Police spend 2-4% of their time dealing with violent crime, and the vast majority of their time dealing with issues in society which don't require or benefit from the presence of an armed agent of the state.   It's less about taking money away from the police as it is returning the money to the places it used to go before we went crazy with making them into the one-size-fits-all solution to society's ills.	1642725047.0	htj69s6	t3_s8j84w	t1_hth2bt7	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htj69s6/

4xg2f3bh	Honey, that quote is the essence of racism. Yes, racism has always been used to kill class solidarity. It was used pre-emancipation, it was used during the labor era, and even to this day when people complain about affirmative action and admission quotas.  Even if the people concocting the plan themselves “aren’t racist“ (c’mon man…), their strategy is to foster and exploit the racism of the masses by encouraging/fueling white grievance.  I don’t believe that anyone who is willing to exploit racism for personal gain can be categorized as a non-racist.  I mean, do you really think that any slaveholders were more capitalist than racist? Those very Richmond pretending that it was about making a better way of life for themselves through commerce was the thin veneer that allowed them to get to sleep at night.  Maybe it’s different in other parts of the world, but this is America.

11sgj1	Apologies, I'm not contesting the stated content of their platform, just expressing my doubts that any fringe party would maintain that consistency in the event they actually had the power to change things.    It's not so much a political issue in my eyes as it seems as though drone warfare has substantial backing amongst the non-elected elements of the government - there are objective upsides to their use. With advocates advising elected officials, it's no wonder many in politics defer to the expertise of those who generally do have a better base of knowledge on the matter.    That being said, the implications of drone warefare are terrifying for observers and it's effects are horrifically traumatizing for survivors. This is to some degree inherent in the weapon system itself (being remotely operated) as well as in their utilization. The former some may argue is the inevitable result of military technology advancing. The later however, is the crux of the issue. Ethically, civilian deaths are unacceptable and any circumstance such as this needs to invite thorough reanalysis of the process.   Anyways, that's what I was getting at. There's a lot of empty talking in politics, and as the two aforementioned parties havent had the chance to act on their talking points to date, I have my doubts they would maintain said position when tasked with the full burden of government.	1642725360.0	htj70ep	t3_s8rx7q	t1_htj2fc8	/r/politics/comments/s8rx7q/newly_declassified_video_shows_us_killing_of_10/htj70ep/

109lnwrs	There’s more to it than the courts. They can claim to ‘caucus’ with the Dems, but eye-test proves otherwise. Republicans go hardcore full batshit to the right, democrats go moderate center. In this day and age, especially after everything that’s happened over the past 4 years, moderate or centrist dems need to just flip so they can be gotten rid of. Sinema and Manchin are prime examples. It’s not what most democrats want, at all. Republicans play hardball, it’s their only strategy to maintain a grip. And because of people like those two, they will always win. Even though they’re in the minority	1642725579.0	htj7is1	t3_s8nbh3	t1_hthz2bq	/r/politics/comments/s8nbh3/video_of_kyrsten_sinema_shaking_hands_with_gop/htj7is1/

Allow anyone to vote  without ID. Why not have a bill to make it free? Not sure but the former is a threat to our elections.   Put massive taxes and restrictions on unvaccinated. Based on a recent poll about 50% of dems would agree will locking up unvaccinated people and taking their kids away. How is that freedom?

And why a senator from West Virginia — a state that ranks 49th in personal income, fourth in the percentage of residents in poverty, third in people 65 and older, first in residents under 65 with disabilities, 47th in healthcare and 45th in education — would oppose a government hand-up that would help his small state of 1.8 million more than it would most states.   >the United Mine Workers union issued a sharp rebuke of Manchin, the purported champion of mine workers, urging him “to revisit his opposition to this legislation” given its provisions, which its members and their communities desperately need.   >There’s more to Manchin’s opposition. He has told Senate colleagues privately that too many of his constituents are looking for “free stuff” from Washington, and much of the money from the child payments would just buy more drugs in towns ravaged by opioids.

Manchin and Sinema could be cut loose at any time, but the Dems need them to take one for the team so the rest can cast a meaningless "yay" vote and say "well shucks, we tried."

67kees40	So… raising wages on the bottom end won’t translate to rising wages all up the wage ladder? Not sure a semi-skilled worker making $20 an hour will accept an arbitrary rise in unskilled wages to near parody and not demand a subsequent raise as well. So then semi skilled gets a raise and skilled will be near parody… and will demand an increase as well.   Correct… labor is a subset of multiple factors in COGS. Materials, utilities and other variable costs are another subset. I guess neither the materials or delivery of utilities is beholden to any wage dynamics? Of course that’s not true. Material costs rise with the wages as will utilities. So… the only subset not necessarily impacted are the fixed costs (depreciation, taxes, rent/land) which is, in the grand scheme, typically dwarfed by variable costs.   It’s far more proportional then you’d like to believe.	1642725805.0	htj8202	t3_s8j84w	t1_htj5kxi	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htj8202/

a88gqgbh	So ask the Chicago families how well their public education is working.  Same goes for LA and NY and all large inner cities.  There is zero accountability to the schools for the UAL it’s if education that is provided - Zero.  Private schools are accountable to the families who pay the required tuition.  You get what you pay for.  Then go back and re-read your economics 101 text books.  The US money system is a closed loop system.  That is, money is not created it just moves from one to another.  (With the exception of applying labor to an earth resource).  So Cutting taxes means the Government has less $$$ to redistribute and businesses have more money to distribute via added jobs, increased pay etc.  Do you really trust the Government more than your local small business owner (think yard service, local bakery, hair salon, local hardware store).  The more local businesses pay in taxes to the government the less money that stays locally.  Do you want to send 10% of your wages to the City of Portland to cover the repair costs because that local city couldn’t keep their crime under control?  I don’t!	1642725809.0	htj82b3	t3_s81gzq	t1_htfw56o	/r/politics/comments/s81gzq/biden_criticizes_gop_resistance_to_his_agenda/htj82b3/

4nj0i	I don't think your link shows the whole story, because it doesn't show what percentage of all eligible Americans voted (and there are no absolute numbers to calculate it yourself).  It's apparently [66%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/28/turnout-soared-in-2020-as-nearly-two-thirds-of-eligible-u-s-voters-cast-ballots-for-president/) of eligible voters that participated in 2020.  So yeah, it's a 3% spread -- significant but not overwhelming. However I think the real trickery here is that he answered a question about people of color (i.e. non-whites) in general, but answered with the statistics about the highest voting minority specifically (and fudged it too).

Every document,  every testimony,  every tax return probably holds some piece of the story.   Even the ones that don't make for good distractions.     Trump will be probably be dead within 10 years and almost certainly within 20.  They've been chasing some of this shit for 3 or 4 years now.   His legal team is simply dragging out every document request and subpoena as long as humanly possible so by the time they gather enough evidence to prove his definitely illegal shit,  he won't face any consequences.	1642725880.0	htj88gq	t3_s8kerl	t1_htgoiek	/r/politics/comments/s8kerl/congress_receives_jan_6_documents_trump_fought_to/htj88gq/

And I’m sure majority of people who are making minimum wage would happily taken the increase even tho the same problem would have had to be addressed later on.

jhi1y	There's a lot of delusion around Sinema--by her but also from those who know her. There are countless articles quoting people saying "She's the smartest woman in the room."  I don't doubt you have to possess SOME kind of intelligence to make it to the Senate. But the Sinema the public knows can't think on the spot, doesn't seem to have an intellectual grasp on most issues, doesn't stand for anything, and is wretched at relationship building or really any other aspect of politics. Even if her whole persona is a cynical ploy and she really is "smart," she's just missing something. She's vacuous and frankly cruel.  That said, I don't believe she's eying a Fox News gig or whatever. I think she seriously believes she's playing smart politics. I doubt she sees another term, but then, Trump happened, so who the hell knows.

Yes, some will have more debt than this, but some will also have less   The federal student loan borrowing rate, REGARDLESS OF LOAN ORIGINATION DATE is 3.75% for undergrade, and something like 5.5% for graduate student loans.    The only exception is the Perkins loan which is fixed at 5% regardless of graduation status.  Currently, of course, interest is at 0% and has been for over 2 years now due to covid.  This is on top of the fact that both interest and payments are deferred until up to 2 years post graduation.  No one...and I mean NO ONE else gets these kinds of sweetheart deals on unsecured debt.

No matter what government, society, culture, there's always some people who want power, and take advantage of others.  The problem with *how* our Representative democracy is set up right now allows for these things to happen, partially by modern design, partially due to creating a country kinda not being easy.  Could we stop this from happening by reforming or changing how it's set up? I honestly don't know.

We're on the edge of a coup or another civil war purely because of lack of education for generations causing 40% of americans to have the brain of an ape 1 million years ago trying to fight another person with different skin color.	1642726033.0	htj8l7a	t3_s8j84w	t3_s8j84w	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htj8l7a/
ipqi1	>**Manchin shot off a familiar litany of concerns ranging from the growing national debt to the ongoing pandemic he argued needed to be addressed before he could get onboard Biden's big bill.** "The main thing we need to do is take care of the inflation," Manchin told reporters. "Get your financial house in order, get a tax code that works. Take care of the pharmaceuticals, you're gouging the people with high prices, we can fix that."  We need to just accept the fact that nothing is getting passed.  He's saying that even if an acceptable bill was presented to him, he wouldn't even entertain it until "the growing national debt" and "the pandemic" are solved. In a video I saw, he even mentioned the Russia-Ukraine situation as an unknown that needs to be dealt with first.  There is no way to appease him because he does not want to be appeased.	1642726036.0	htj8lfc	t3_s8xk7y	t3_s8xk7y	/r/politics/comments/s8xk7y/joe_manchin_says_negotiations_on_bidens_big_bill/htj8lfc/

gt8qk	Do you know what annoys me about people like you? How short-sighted you are.   Let me ask you a question:  Do you want America to be a success and be powerful?  If you answered yes, then I have a few follow up questions;  Having universal access to higher education will mean having a more intelligent population. How is ensuring that we have the best-educated citizens not beneficial to everyone?  Providing universal healthcare ensures that our population is strong and healthy. How is ensuring that we have the fittest and strongest not beneficial to America?  I’m also going to assume you’re a capitalist. Why would you not support welfare programs like universal healthcare, free college, guaranteed housing, and having a robust social safety net are vital to have a genuinely free market? If the market is overwhelmingly filled with options only because their creator had the money needed, the market isn’t truly free.   Free college/trade school means more educated people and more chances for innovation. Better for consumers.   Universal healthcare guarantees that people aren’t bankrupted by medical expenses and aren’t forced to stay at jobs they’d prefer to leave. This means more people free to try and start their businesses.   The same goes for housing and a robust social safety net.  All of them give people more FREEDOM to pursue their goals and dreams.   How many innovations have we missed out on because someone was born poor? Or couldn’t afford college? Or couldn’t risk quitting?  If someone truly loves America and wants a free market that benefits the consumer over the corporation, they would want these types of programs.   The only reason they don’t is that corporations have spent millions to convince them they don’t. This is because not having these programs helps reduce their competition.	1642726211.0	htj90aa	t3_s8nqp6	t1_htii1rq	/r/politics/comments/s8nqp6/biden_asks_the_best_question_what_are_republicans/htj90aa/

te381	>People are greedy and will find a way to break the rules anyway.  This sounds like nihilism - "someone's going to try and break the rules so we shouldn't even bother to try and prevent it".  But the fact of the matter is that there are some societies where you can interact with government representatives and expect the interaction to be smooth and governed by rules, and some societies where you can interact with government representatives and expect nothing to really get done until you've greased the wheels, be that slipping whatever the equivalent of a $20 into their palm or a fat manila envelope under the table. The amount of corruption in a society is not a universal constant - there is more corruption when it is more profitable to be corrupt than to follow ethical rules and not much risk of consequences.  Now I'm not saying that every rep needs exactly a million a year - there is room to negotiate. But that negotiation must not be based on a moralistic argument of what is proper for a person in general - it needs to be based on the kind of skim the representative will be offered through their position as a form of corruption. Government is good when government reps know they make good money staying in good standing.	1642726236.0	htj92b5	t3_s8ikdt	t1_htgs2ze	/r/politics/comments/s8ikdt/trump_says_nancy_pelosi_shouldnt_be_allowed_to/htj92b5/

4lk6wlk7	I cannot believe all the people in this thread thinking Putin is doing this because he is in 'trouble'. IMO this is part of a plan to invade and loot western Europe that he has been putting together for at least 10 years and maybe more. He's already taken back part of Ukraine, this is the next step in probably a whole series of steps to come.  Yes, Russia is a catastrophic mess, but here's the thing about the Russian people, they are so deeply cynical and negative , they EXPECT their leaders to be ruthless, abusive POS's and Putin meets those expectations and they ADMIRE it because they are masochists as well.  IMO Biden is making a possibly tragic error in not sending in more US troops to reinforce NATO bases YESTERDAY.  I am in no respects calling for war, but shoring up defenses to PREVENT WAR - and IMO shows of power are all that gets through to Putin's thick bald skull.  I think emphasizing economic sanctions is a mistake because IMO they won't hurt PUtin and his inner circle at all. They will  hurt the Russian people somewhat but because they expect shit from their leaders anyway, they will just blame the US for their plight and Putin will probably become even more popular.  I would add, IF the congress goes GOP soon, expect those Russian-loving traitors to throw roadblocks against anything Biden does to do that could effect Putin.	1642726247.0	htj93c6	t3_s8l88m	t3_s8l88m	/r/politics/comments/s8l88m/discussion_thread_secretary_of_state_antony/htj93c6/

69eb6e2m	Is it because states have the capability to put check and balances on federal government by overseeing the federal government elections? Everyone already has the right to vote, how does anyone not have the right to vote now so another voting bill has to be passed?   Doesn't everyone want elections to be locked down as much as possible to prevent the other side from cheating or do those who wants the voting bill to pass only want one party to cheat to win and stay in power. Also why do the same people rely on criminals? Only one party pushes hard to reinstate criminals rights to vote, but never the right to own a gun? Why is that?  I also feel that this voting bill, the way I understand it, give oversight to the voting process and allows one party or the other to cheat.  To me, this bill would put the US in the same catagory as Venezuela, Cuba, and other Banana Republics.  I already think it's cheap that the Dems pander to the black Americans who are here. Apparently white liberals think black Americans are idiots, can't get ID or don't know where the DMV is, or just doesn't have the ability to do their civic duty. Don't believe me check this video out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW2LpFkVfYk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW2LpFkVfYk).  I personally want the voting system to be locked down as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the voting system and to alleviate any possible doubt regardless of the outcome.  With this stuff the Dems want to pass seems to me that they want to keep voting results always questionable creating doubt and distrust of the anyone who wins. I think it's bad for the country as a whole. If you want to look at and read the text of the bill go to [www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov).  If you're not a felon you should have the right to vote. I don't care who you are and as long as you're a citizen.

36uessih	In America I think age has become a bit like urban/rural divide, red/state blue state, etc., as something that people see as a proxy for political views -- and that makes them feel more OK with bashing whole demographic groups, because they're the ones "on the wrong side".  People tend to overlook that these are just averages.  I mean, my grandma is an 89-year-old white lady who lives on a farm in Alabama.  Based on that, people would assume she's a conservative Republican and probably a Trump supporter, but they'd be wrong: She's a liberal Democrat.  (They'd be right to assume some pretty terrible stuff about that branch of our family tree if you go a little further back, though.🤷‍♂️)	1642726314.0	htj98zt	t3_s71g4f	t1_ht9zux5	/r/politics/comments/s71g4f/supreme_courts_gorsuch_refused_to_wear_mask/htj98zt/

Until Progressives expand their voter base to offset moderate losses they will remain a minority voter bloc with the least power.

Saying there's no mainstream left wing in America is correct. There's not a viable socialist, communist or even socialist aligned labour party that could form the left. There's no elected figures at the federal level who argue these positions and the last major political figure who did was Eugene Debs.	1642726328.0	htj9a87	t3_s8j84w	t1_htggulm	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htj9a87/

4lk6wlk7	Following anonymous comment on another website is one of the best things I've seen in a long time:  >Kyrsten Sinema is a highly paid circus animal, doing tricks and stunts that her corporate and private far-right donors pay her to do.  >**Sinema and Manchin are no mystery when you understand that, in their hearts, they have come to embrace the white supremacist's ideology**. This has become abundantly clear given their current alliances in Congress and elsewhere. This ideology has become the overriding "to-the-death" goal of today's Republican party. Trump is viewed as the GOP's most efficient conduit to achieve this goal, but white supremacists (this term includes teachers, doctors, actors, police officers, politicians, grocery clerks, grandmothers, etc) have figured out the means of getting it done without Trump if/when it becomes necessary. The ideology is, of course, built on fear: fear of the groups of people that "whites" have marginalized and oppressed for centuries, fear of retaliation, fear of vengeance, fear of reprisal. Ridiculously unfounded fears. There is no national movement of a single minority group to hasten this change of balance, which has been developing naturally since the country's formation. What is certain, however, is that these attempts to destabilize our government will, in the end, have catastrophic consequences for all levels of society. I also believe that it's too late to stop this chain of events. The movement has grown far beyond the control of its architects.

6exndcyp	Sure, that’s why “From 1970 to 2003, union density in the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, while in Canada the loss was much smaller, going from 31.6 percent in 1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003.”  Or maybe it has more to do with the fact that “By the mid-1980s, Congress had investigated, but failed to regulate, abuses by labor relations consulting firms. Meanwhile, while some anti-union employers continued to rely upon the tactics of persuasion and manipulation, other besieged firms launched blatantly aggressive anti-union campaigns. At the dawn of the 21st Century, methods of union busting have recalled similar tactics from the dawn of the 20th Century.[44] The political environment has included the National Labor Relations Board and the U.S. Department of Labor failing to enforce the labor law against companies that repeatedly violate it.”  These are just basic facts. Unions were actively targeted by conservative politicians to break up the power of organized working class people and make them play the two-party-system pick-a-team game we are stuck with now. Wages and the standard of living were at their highest in the US when we had our highest number of unionized workers in the 1940’s and early 1950’s. Unfortunately a 70 year political and economic war in the name of Capitalism saw a lot of countries roll back labor protections for the benefit of wealthy capitalists.	1642726641.0	htja09e	t3_s8tffs	t1_htj6ofj	/r/politics/comments/s8tffs/fetterman_calls_fall_of_union_membership_a/htja09e/
ei4p0	Sometimes American media should look how they compare on a world scale. For a democratic nation, America is probably the most right wing country in the west. On a global scale, China is probably the most right wing country in the world.   It is because it is just the nature of the country. From economic policy, to social programs to government departments are designed in a right wing ideology.   Of course it doesn't mean America = bad. America = different. Looking at places like Canada or UK or France is like looking at more centralist policy that may lean slightly right or left.   Bringing America closer to center won't happen overnight. Even by nature the Democratic party would be considered more right wing than most left wing european or even Canadian parties.	1642726642.0	htja0cd	t3_s8j84w	t3_s8j84w	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htja0cd/

Either way, if you have a problem with the Democrats representing your state, vote for different ones in the primary or run yourself.  All not voting or voting for a republican will do is prove that yes, things can get worse, which is not all that helpful.	1642726711.0	htja61w	t3_s8kt4k	t1_hthn1jr	/r/politics/comments/s8kt4k/gop_states_are_shredding_voting_rights_and_joe/htja61w/

4lk6wlk7	Following anonymous comment on another website is one of the best things I've seen in a long time:  >Kyrsten Sinema is a highly paid circus animal, doing tricks and stunts that her corporate and private far-right donors pay her to do.  >**Sinema and Manchin are no mystery when you understand that, in their hearts, they have come to embrace the white supremacist's ideology**. This has become abundantly clear given their current alliances in Congress and elsewhere. This ideology has become the overriding "to-the-death" goal of today's Republican party. Trump is viewed as the GOP's most efficient conduit to achieve this goal, but white supremacists (this term includes teachers, doctors, actors, police officers, politicians, grocery clerks, grandmothers, etc) have figured out the means of getting it done without Trump if/when it becomes necessary. The ideology is, of course, built on fear: fear of the groups of people that "whites" have marginalized and oppressed for centuries, fear of retaliation, fear of vengeance, fear of reprisal. Ridiculously unfounded fears. There is no national movement of a single minority group to hasten this change of balance, which has been developing naturally since the country's formation. What is certain, however, is that these attempts to destabilize our government will, in the end, have catastrophic consequences for all levels of society. I also believe that it's too late to stop this chain of events. The movement has grown far beyond the control of its architects.

Homicide is heavily skewed towards young men. Suicide rates tend to be higher for older people; gun suicides for older men.  While many suicides are preventable and should be prevented, a different kind of suicide does exist, especially in the older population. People with untreatable conditions who face a short life full of pain and deterioration may rationally decide to take their own life. Ideally, we would separate these from the preventable suicides in analyses, but this is not always easy.	1642726781.0	htjabuh	t3_s8mqre	t1_htj6g13	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htjabuh/

It sucks she said no the first time, I was livid, but she backed off when we made our opinions heard.  *Obviously* she said no the first time because she's getting rich off it. *Obviously* she wants to protect her own interests. And that all sucks.  But credit where it's due, she opened up to it once we all made it clear that this idea was wildly popular.

Conservatives were throwing up obstacles to vote before black people or women could even vote in the first place, but people worked, for decades, to make sure they go that right to vote, and now it's on all of us to keep working to make sure we all keep it and can progressively make it more equatable.

The winner is the one who has the MOST votes, not a few.  Why do people feel that if they support one party over another , their party must only be the ones in office all of the time?   Over time, peoples' mindsets change or they move to a new location.  I don't want the Dems to hold power for a century, but if the majority of the people voted for it, then that's what we get.

hip4h08x	Sure. Input you can have. Control you cannot. Input does not mean anyone has to negotiate with you or concede anything at all. But as far as I know you're welcome to speak at the appropriate time.  Schools pushing kids to be good and productive is not new. Those value judgements are made everyday by thousands of independent school districts and teachers in accordance with the taxpayers and parents of each community.   Ultimately though each state mandates the curriculum. So on the actual content of the courses the local school board meetings are going to be a waste of time more often than not.  There is data on drug decriminalization. Whether it is "good" ultimately is decided by the end results and whether or not it achieved any progress toward its intention. Because any moral judgement is subjective and should be excluded. Until now, it's been taught to be a source of shame in schools and thats frankly unhelpful on the issue of addiction.  In TX, learning a foreign language is a requirement for high school graduation. They do not decide the language for you although my tiny school only had Spanish on offer. Right to bear arms should be taught by including the full content of the second amendment, including the beginning about maintaining militias. Have the kids write reports using resources making both arguments. Point them towards past Supreme Court decisions and dissents.  Prostitution, once you remove the moral judgements, also becomes a matter of data and follows the same logic as drug decriminalization although considering almost every single public school student is a minor, I don't see why this would be necessary at any point for a public school to address.  Protesting isn't up for debate. It's enshrined in the first amendment. Don't be silly.	1642726965.0	htjara7	t3_s89fti	t1_htgzjwk	/r/politics/comments/s89fti/michigan_democratic_party_deletes_post/htjara7/

a88gqgbh	The question was “What do the Republicans stand for?”  Sadly what is practiced is not always that.  Sometimes due to outside influences and circumstances.  Bush Sr raised taxes and he became a 1 term president.  The second Bush had 9/11 thrust upon him and spent $$ replenishing defense supplies. But what they didn’t do was spend $$$ to enslave Americans further to social programs that are broke.  As for power, since Regan they have been granted power 4 yrs (2 yrs twice - Bush and Trump) over the past 9 presidential terms (or 33yrs) and their house leadership squandered that.

4lk6wlk7	This is what they are for:    >(the white supremecist) ideology has become the overriding "to-the-death" goal of today's Republican party. Trump is viewed as the GOP's most efficient conduit to achieve this goal, but white supremacists (this term includes teachers, doctors, actors, police officers, politicians, grocery clerks, grandmothers, etc) have figured out the means of getting it done without Trump if/when it becomes necessary. The ideology is, of course, built on fear: fear of the groups of people that "whites" have marginalized and oppressed for centuries, fear of retaliation, fear of vengeance, fear of reprisal. Ridiculously unfounded fears. There is no national movement of a single minority group to hasten this change of balance, which has been developing naturally since the country's formation. What is certain, however, is that these attempts to destabilize our government will, in the end, have catastrophic consequences for all levels of society. I also believe that it's too late to stop this chain of events. The movement has grown far beyond the control of its architects.

e9nz9gom	I think voting against voting rights (Yes I consider voting against the rule change to be voting against voting rights.) is pretty much the same as declaring you are not a Democrat.  It would probably be better to call those two independents that caucus with the Democrats.  Manchin's new we should start over with BBB is also bull crap.  He and Sinema should just write the damn bill then see if there is any chance the democrats can agree.  I suspect there isn't.  Frankly the we should start over just sounds like kicking the can down the road while pretending to do something.  I'm not honestly convinced there is any point in even trying to work with them.

45tsy	I definitely realize you're not going to change, because you changed the nature of my question before deigning to answer it.  The *correct* answer is, no, it's always worth trying even if you're certain of failure when you're trying to accomplish something worthy. Manchin is unlikely to shift, yes, but that doesn't mean the effort should not be made.   Other efforts are also being made. Alternatives are actively being sought out. The simplest path, though, happens to be this one, so people are going to keep chipping away at the roadblock until it either gives way, or an alternate path is secured.  You fight for what is right, always, by any means available. Otherwise you settle for something awful and convince yourself "it's better this way," while your soul slowly rots.

bs7gjvm2	I actually agree with *everything you are saying.*  I would add that maybe they are crap right now because they know that they have no real chance while the 2-party system rules (in peoples' minds). So, the only silly people willing to waste their time are those who are left to try.  Further, if *enough* people *did* vote for a 3rd party, I think that others (moderates) would take notice and maybe make a serious attempt at a run themsleves.  To me, it comes down to this; either we deal with our problems *now*, while the middle-class still has some resources left, or we continue down the 2-party only path, and it comes to a head *later*, once we've been thoroughly gutted.  If you *knew* in advance, that the Capitol was going to be invaded like it was, would you fly/drive/walk there to assist in it's defence? You just might if you had an income and other resources that would allow it.  But, you *aren't going anywhere* if your attendance ranking at Amazon/Walmart/ drops as a result. Hell, you likely don't have any money to get there if you wanted to anyway.  The frog in the water is a great analogy. Turn the heat up quickly and we just might have a chance to "jump out of the water" before it boils. The attack on the Capitol is the "water" getting *pretty damn hot* if you ask me.	1642727280.0	htjbhmy	t3_s739ob	t1_ht9mnje	/r/politics/comments/s739ob/67_of_americans_support_bill_to_ban_stock_trading/htjbhmy/

67kees40	I’m not sure what “works” means and I am not sure what “hungry wages” mean. At least in the US, the government benefits given to those at certain wage strata more than over comes what people want to claim as “hunger wages”. Given the obesity rates of Americans and most western nations… I think “hunger wages” is pretty hyperbolic.   The world is a pretty big place, but one thing is for certain… the American model, while not perfect - nothing is - is far superior. If you don’t believe me… why does everyone want to come here? If the model is so broken, why is it the largest economy in the world and the largest per capita economy?  The problem is, people don’t understand incentives. Giving wages, not tied to actual production actually increases the wealth gap. Like labor is a small subset of cost, wage value is not as simple as… things cost x, therefore wages must be y. As you arbitrarily raise wages, untethered to productivity… all you do is price people out of the market place and set their minimum wage to $0. Increasing the wage gap. If a person doesn’t produce $15 an hour, they will not have a job. It’s really that simple. If you tell people, they deserve to be paid some arbitrarily derived “living wage” regardless of what they do… you disincentivize people to develop skills and abilities that command hire wages.	1642727341.0	htjbmkh	t3_s8j84w	t1_htj8w8m	/r/politics/comments/s8j84w/biden_chuckles_as_fox_news_reporter_peter_doocy/htjbmkh/

The government and private lenders (in collusion) have figured out how to bring back indentured servitude on the lower and middle class the second they are legally responsible for debt.   The student loan industry has been designed to keep anyone attempting to enrich their lives with education, or improve their options in the workforce, in crushing and perpetual debt that is impossible to escape from. There isn’t a single industry, *including* the IRS, that has accomplished this. Even the IRS often provides reduced repayment options. That simply does not happen in student loans.

51n5qtt	The simple solution is the white house is controlled by the Democrats, so any bill that was presented to Biden that was really out of line, would be vetoed.  It's called checks and balances.   The long answer is, what can done can be undone.    The filibuster is just there to prevent bills from ever getting to the floor, it doesn't guarantee that they would pass.  But if the GOP is in the majority, they should be able to bring bills to the floor and vote them up or down.	1642727437.0	htjbuh3	t3_s895em	t1_htj0lgt	/r/politics/comments/s895em/manchin_sinema_join_gop_to_sink_filibuster_change/htjbuh3/

wqsa0	Jews are both a religion *and* an associated ethnic group. Judah was an ancient kingdom and people, after all. The word is used both ways, and the duality and nuances between these two are an extremely well-worn subject and a fundamental aspect of Judaism and Jewishness.   A huge proportion of Jews are atheists, and Christian [ethnic] Jews include, eg, all the Twelve Apostles and St Paul.   A soft introduction with sources [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F).  It’s almost like if we called followers of Greek paganism ‘Greeks’ (if we imagine most still followed it), as well the ethnic group. Or used ‘Indian’ for ‘Hindu’ (which have the same root word, after all). Sometimes people feel the need specify what form their Jewishness takes.	1642727470.0	htjbx30	t3_s89vi1	t1_htj9ds7	/r/politics/comments/s89vi1/tennesseebased_adoption_agency_refuses_to_help/htjbx30/

They vote for the people they feel represent them.  If young people voted more reliably then they would have representation in government. It's that simple.

fbbhradi	So when someone with a penis identifies as a woman, they’re a woman; but when someone claims to be Christian other people can decide if they really are one or not? I think what religion someone is, especially if they are baptized/confirmed/ordained within that religion is their call. I’ve had this same debate with my Muslim family members who claim terrorists, some of whom are recognized Imams and cite the Koran and attend mosques are not “real” Muslims. My question to you is who are you to decide? P.S. I’m atheist and slightly left leaning so for me this is aa matter of principle, not personal liking.	1642727599.0	htjc7qr	t3_s8qq0w	t1_htig29f	/r/politics/comments/s8qq0w/rep_lauren_boebert_asked_a_group_of_jewish/htjc7qr/

The underpinnings of the industrial union model are gone.  Knowledge and skills matter more than seniority.  No one is retiring from where they started.  The defined contribution pension is here to stay.  When unions start to modernize and make themselves relevant in the modern job environment, and add value, perhaps things will get better for them.  To take this back upthread...what possible value could unionization add to someone in the IT field?	1642727743.0	htjcjrp	t3_s8tffs	t1_htja09e	/r/politics/comments/s8tffs/fetterman_calls_fall_of_union_membership_a/htjcjrp/

That said, you're the only person on reddit besides me I've ever seen appear to give the slightest shit that most (as in more than half, specifically 60% in 2019) intentional gun deaths in the US are suicides. I think we need universal health care and to get people the help they need. When I was in the Air Force I lost a buddy to suicide by gun. But as a kid I also lost an uncle to suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning (car/garage). **Reddit, collectively, doesn't care**.   But you know what I'd like to see? The US constitution changed, instead of all these bullshit piecemeal eroding of our rights. Just ban guns outright. The shit they do in my state is ridiculous when really, they just don't want us to have guns at all.  Speaking of having guns at all, I hope you paid really close attention to how the protesters were treated in 2020. If you google hard enough you can find where armed groups of protesters happened, and suddenly - a miracle - they were afforded all of their first amendment rights.

9rx954nb	The GOP is going to win big in this year's mid-term elections.  Revelations like this really hurt Democrats with their base, but they don't harm Republicans the same way, because the Republican base believes that a certain amount of criminality and corruption is just one of the perks of being rich.  That's why they just yawned whenever people pointed out how corrupt Trump is/was.  So the fact that Republicans and Democrats both do this will hurt Democrats much more than it does Republicans, and I think this story will have the legs to keep going until the end of the year.	1642727931.0	htjczev	t3_s8wff6	t3_s8wff6	/r/politics/comments/s8wff6/energy_secretary_jennifer_granholm_violated_a/htjczev/

Because of said fragile ego, couldn't accept defeat and dug himself a huge hole. 5. I hope - will end up as a guest of Club Fed in The Crobar Hotel.

DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED IN 2000?  Gore lost to Bush (not really but thats a separate and pointless topic).  The only reason Gore lost Florida is because *Ralph Nader* ran **TO THE LEFT OF GORE!!**  He pulled enough voters from Gore that Bush won. When they polled Florida voters who selected Nader and asked if they preferred Bush or Gore, they preferred Gore 98%.  It's called the spoiler effect. The same thing happened in 1992 with Ross Perot.  Conservatives literally financially support the Green party because they know it hurts Democrats.

b7r9g	Not really. There's a degree of what you said, I don't disagree with that, but when the majority of your constituency tells you to do something, you do it. They are who you are representing, it's your job to represent their interests, which includes things they directly tell you to do *even if you think it will not be as beneficial as believed*.  If the constituency tells you what they want, they've made their interests clear and it's your job to facilitate that request.  What you talk about applies more to things that are not specifically asked for by the constituency. At that point it's their job to represent the interests of the constituency even though they don't know enough about it to make a decision or even possibly they don't even know that there's a problem in the first place.  All of this is a moot discussion because there's a huge portion of our elected representatives that clearly *aren't* looking out for their constituency in any way, let alone either of the ones we're talking about. So it doesn't matter, the problem is far deeper than this.	1642728147.0	htjdhky	t3_s8ov89	t1_htj2nd7	/r/politics/comments/s8ov89/nancy_pelosi_changes_course_says_shes_open_to/htjdhky/

clk4ew7q	Instead of me posting links to articles you won’t read, can you do this instead? Why won’t republicans pass a simple voting rights act? Among other things, they would make Election Day a federal holiday, set minimum national standards for voting by mail and restore requirements that states seek federal approval for changes to their electoral practices that could harm minority voters.  Why? if they are not actively suppressing the vote?    The chief goal, supporters say: Make it easier for all Americans -- regardless of which states they live in -- to vote.	1642728255.0	htjdqft	t3_s8kua2	t1_htjbtoz	/r/politics/comments/s8kua2/mcconnell_waves_off_voting_concerns_since_black/htjdqft/

ekrdft1t	That right there is why we need to totally reconstruct our political system. Both parties have failed and no matter who wins, we the people, lose. I know some people are going to disagree with me, but the United States should be renamed the United States of America incorporated. The politicians have always been under the thumb of the wealthy in this country. It used to be the oil men, and now as we have thrown ourselves head first into the Information Age, the number of really wealthy people has decreased even more to a very small group of people. The wealth gap has been pushed so far, the middle class has disappeared, and most people are now unable to own anything. No assets, no homes, no cars. And the number of people that are falling into this class is increasing exponentially. No politician is fighting to keep this from happening, and if they are they are being silenced on both sides of the aisle, sorry Bernie.  Congress has basically openly admitted to taking “bribes” from these corporations to manipulate legislation. How much are we going to let them stick our face in the shit before we do something? That’s the question.	1642728357.0	htjdywg	t3_s82a53	t1_htep190	/r/politics/comments/s82a53/biden_says_trump_is_intimidating_an_entire_party/htjdywg/

bs7gjvm2	>they're a wasted vote  The funny thing is, that if enough people *simply decided* not to buy into that dynamic, then it would be *easy* for a 3rd party candidate to win. There is absolutely nothing stopping you from entering a persons name onto the ballot. That's all it would take. A *simple decision* to do it. It's not the system, it's we, the people, who are failing, so we deserve what we get.  I would rather have it all come to a head now while I/we still have some resources to fight with, rather than have to wait until the downward spiral that we're in now, hits bottom.   Our taxes, *our money*, now goes to beef up the local police with military equipment so they can repress dissent *at scale*. Think about that. *Your* money is being used against *you*.

In fact, in real terms average hourly earnings peaked more than 45 years ago: The $4.03-an-hour rate recorded in January 1973 had the same purchasing power that $23.68 would today.  https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/?amp=1	1642728625.0	htjektc	t3_s8w3c6	t1_htj8sb6	/r/politics/comments/s8w3c6/bidens_boast_about_rising_wages_ignores_effect_of/htjektc/

14bqha	Ease of use is important. A person is more likely and more able to murder if their desire coincides with an easy and effective way to do so. This is how difficulty functions, and in a broader sense informs the way laws are made and enforced.  Violent deaths (specifically homicides are what we're really after in this instance) are not an inevitable, immovable data point. Humans are not bound to murder a set number of individuals per year, nor are those that do murder all equally committed to the task. Some will be more easily discouraged than others. The pursuit is to increase the difficulty in one of homicides more easily accessible avenues (firearms) to discourage those who may be discouraged, because were are concerned with the loss of human life.	1642728659.0	htjennb	t3_s8mqre	t1_hti3pgz	/r/politics/comments/s8mqre/states_with_weaker_gun_laws_have_higher_rates_of/htjennb/

cu3lv	Talk more and show you understand. Like the other day in his press conference Biden said he thought things were going pretty well overall for him and the country, but for a lot of people that's just not true. Instead he should acknowledge things are not going well economically, that he's trying to address it as you say, and he has more in store to deal with it. If people don't see Biden's efforts in their day to day lives, and they still see high prices and struggle to pay their bills, they're not going to be satisfied and are going to turn to the other party. That's always what happens in economic downturns.	1642728804.0	htjezva	t3_s8o98i	t1_htjdzcw	/r/politics/comments/s8o98i/dnc_hits_gop_for_having_no_agenda_echoing_biden/htjezva/

8mx2f	> It’s just sheer entitled laziness  It's more than laziness. It's "white privilege." People who are most upset by the term, "white privilege," are often its biggest beneficiaries.  They will say things such as the following.  1. Nobody ever gave me a damn thing!  1. I work for a living!  1. I can't help what my grand daddy did to yours!  1. I ain't rich!   For nearly 100 years after slavery ended, the best jobs available to black people in the USA were as doormen, bus boys, line-cooks (who wouldn't be seen by white customers), shoe-shiners, maids, janitors, etc.   Until the 1964 Civil Rights Act, most black people wouldn't have even bothered trying to apply for a job in a factory, as a car salesman, a manager of a grocery store, or even for a government position that wasn't one of the aforementioned positions. So, their earning potential was very limited compared to their white counterparts.  Well, for most people in the USA, their single most valuable asset is their home. Getting the money to buy a first home has always been tough. As an aside, with current market trends, that situation is likely to get worse.  Even if black Americans somehow managed to save enough money for a down-payment on a home—which was usually enabled by an extended family pooling their resources—and could show proof of income to cover the mortgage, no traditional bank would loan them money.  Many lower income white people often inherited a home when their parents passed away. Even if it was a very "modest" home that they did not want to live in, it still had value. If they didn't want to live in it, they could still sell it and use the proceeds as a down-payment on a different home.  Many of these white people do not understand what red-lining means, or if they do, they don't care, because it doesn't affect them adversely. Even when black people managed to overcome all of the aforementioned challenges, they still could not live in any neighborhood of their choosing.  I remember when the very first black family moved into my neighborhood in the late 1970s, and a lot of my neighbors were very upset. Most black people never purchased homes, and of the ones who did, they purchased them in neighborhoods there the real estate values would never appreciate as quickly as those in white neighborhoods.  Most white people do not experience extreme feelings of panic when being pulled over for a routine traffic stop. I don't mean the usual anxiety that many people feel because they are afraid of being given a ticket. I am referring to the primal fear that arises when you literally believe that your life is in mortal danger.  White people who get enraged by the term "white privilege" may not be rich or even lower middle class. however, most likely, they would be much poorer if their ancestors had not been white. They may not be descended from slave owners, but they sure do love having another group to be able to look down upon for being less well-off financially than themselves.	1642728929.0	htjfagh	t3_s8h6ar	t1_htigy6g	/r/politics/comments/s8h6ar/florida_bill_to_shield_people_from_feeling/htjfagh/
f4mto0nk	I remember the Kennedy Center and a couple hundred  Dems pet projects got millions. Nancy was Speaker and she wouldn’t bring it to a vote. It was a Win for Trump. 10 months later we got $600.00. I remember it like it was yesterday.  Democracy isn’t one sided. Plato’s original experiment called for every voice to be heard and then voted on. This isn’t how THEY want to work. Simple Majority is against the rules of procedure. 60 votes needed to pass anything regardless of whose in charge. This is leading as to a One Voice Government. Gaslighting and Banning opposite opinions isn’t Democracy. This is the New and Improved Democracy they want to protect. People are tired of the Monkey Shines and bullshit. Is everything costing you up to 50% more. Inflation out pacing your earnings??? It’s trying to Ram things through with 2700 pages and burying all types of none sense that have nothing to do with the original reason for the bill. You really need to take a look at what’s happening dare I say before it’s too late.	1642728935.0	htjfayi	t3_s895em	t1_htjbtmn	/r/politics/comments/s895em/manchin_sinema_join_gop_to_sink_filibuster_change/htjfayi/

ic49ouk3	I don't think people voted for Biden as much as it was against Trump and everything that the modern GOP base is hawking around being anti-reality.  Actually I'd wager that's the main reason to vote right now - to prevent an authoritarian USA which will most likely be the end of the Democracy, if not the world - the USA still has the largest arsenal of nukes and weaponry and if we get a thin skinned tin pot dictator in power, that literally could mean war and then the end of modern life.  I think the main issue is that people are still treating voting like it's an elective action and not something that is vital to continuing modern life now. And that's how Biden sees politics probably because he's old and out of touch. I mean I can't explain how he could come out against voting rights (at first) when quite literally there are people working in states to overturn votes.	1642728976.0	htjfefq	t3_s8llck	t3_s8llck	/r/politics/comments/s8llck/bidens_approval_has_declined_across_the_board/htjfefq/

hosknm8w	He gave a horrible answer. He shouldve listed the populist items in his agenda that hes "fighting" for individually and asked if they were "too far to the left." Is lowered prescription drug prices too far to the left? Is cutting child poverty in half too far to the left? Is free community college too far to the left? Is free childcare too far to the left? etc etc.  The problem is that hes not only not truly fighting for any of that stuff, but hes pretty far to the right on a ton of his policies. Hes easily deporting at twice the rate of Trump at the US/Mexico border and is continuing to use title 42 to deport migrants without granting due process and an asylum hearing. Hes continuing the wars and illegal airstrikes. Not to mention he INCREASED our already bloated defense budget.

cbosn	During opening statements the [defense brings up](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-defense-opening-statement-transcript) "yellow pants"  >Kyle, an individual by the name of Ryan Bulch, followed by Richard McGinness go down there Sheridan Road. And at 11:40, they have a conversation yelling, “Medic.” And you’ll see the videotape of this event. Kyle’s got his medical bag, his gun, and he comes upon these three individuals. And the individual in the yellow pants accuses Kyle Rittenhouse of pointing a laser sight from a gun at him. Kyle shrugs it off, does not want confrontation with these individuals, does not point his firearm at them, and he leaves.  So it is clear the defense introduces the "yellow pants" evidence as I stated.   The video pretty clearly has video and audio of yellow pants interacting with Rittenhouse and describing in detail how Rittenhouse pointed his gun at him to the videographer. It is what the defense submitted. You denying it happening is just weird at this point.

i0j4n	>President Biden has the second worst approval rating at the end of his first year since at least Truman  Op didn't say that.  You changed the claim and you moved the goal posts for data to support a claim OP never made.     >The poster never said, "of all time." That's your partisan attempt to sow disinformation and change the narrative.  Another false claim from you.   But fuck it, I'll still bite, which president were excluded between "all time" and "any president"?  Then you cherry picked post ww2 ones.  >Biden has not hit the second lowest rating of all time So, tell me what president hit the second lowest at day 366?  >of all time  Prove me wrong then, and also you added words I didn't say.  I think you're messed up your quote and then moved the goal posts to try and say my actual quote was incorrect and it's not.  You misread or you lied?   >No, it isn't "we". You attempted to reorientate the narrative away from the current situation at day 366.  You're assuming something that I couldn't get OP to specify.    Good job being Ops hero though but I was asking them specific questions before you interjected with your assumptions and misrepresentations.	1642729322.0	htjg791	t3_s8n4ot	t1_htj68o8	/r/politics/comments/s8n4ot/one_year_into_his_presidency_bidens/htjg791/

cpm8cp2w	Incompetent Reddit logicians telling me what is entailed by a sentence is rich. There might be a conversational implicature, but that's squishy at best. Any propositional logic would say that "while" is just a truth functional "and". There's no twisting here. Mitch isn't just going to seriously state that African Americans aren't Americans. He's going to compare statistics and do it in a way that might trigger liberals to make over the top charges of racism. OR doesn't really get you anywhere here. Politicians are careful with their words all the time, and it's unclear to me what the simplest explanation/theory is anyway.  To reiterate: Mitch is a black spot on this country, and it saddens me that he's been able to thrive so long in power. I'm not defending his character or anything. But you don't have to squint very hard to see what Mitch probably meant by this quote, and it's not that he's explicitly stating that black people can't be Americans.	1642729394.0	htjgd7l	t3_s8kua2	t1_htj6xne	/r/politics/comments/s8kua2/mcconnell_waves_off_voting_concerns_since_black/htjgd7l/

cbkl1	I also work in tech as an SE. Upper class folks should still be represented, but not at the expense of an ever-widening class gap. People like you and I are much closer to the common man than the political elite unless you’re already a C-level executive  (Also, I’m not sure what you’re referring to by the “rich districts” shouldn’t be allowed more freedom than “poor districts” comment)  We definitely disagree on how restricted they should be on this. FWIW, if you pop over to  r/politics and r/Conservative, you’ll see a rare bipartisan consensus that mostly agrees with a strategy I have outlined (only index funds… not individual stocks unless there’s an annual limit)  Finally, I’ll say that the 538 members of congress is not a random sample by any means. There’s way more than 5 members that are part of the 1%. The median net worth of congress is approximately $1 million, with the top 50 being well into the $10/100 million threshold. They could certainly have a managed account like a mutual fund, but absolutely shouldn’t touch individual stocks.

Then complained about gaslighting and played a bunch of clips of people saying “President Biden was very clear”. Fox host never actually played a clip of Biden rambling and I don’t keep up with the news on purpose, but wouldn’t you think if Biden were this invalid Fox is claiming he is they’d play a clip of it?

Crime rising, borders open, inflation higher than in 4 decades , grocery store shelves empty, unemployment still higher than prepandemic, kids out of schools, and all the media can do is talk about Trump?  What about Hunter’s laptop from hell, Pelosi’s husband making millions from inside-trading, and Waters’ husband making millions from banking rules set into motion by his wife’s position on finance committee.

qsqwfcs	Imagine how you'll feel when it happens? You'll realize that the idea "if its too good to be true it probably is" will of robbed you of a substantial amount of profits. Your bred to think good things cannot happen to you, securing the fact that they won't. Take a leap and you may fly. If you never leap, you may never know.  Edit: When gme went from 480 to 125 i sold being terrified and my first roller coaster. If I didn't buy back in at 40 I would've pretty much lost it all. Luckily I had faith and bought back in after we all thought it was over because it wasn't over. Now at this point I'm not even flinching. I know the game and I know the psychology behind stealing impatient retail traders money.
