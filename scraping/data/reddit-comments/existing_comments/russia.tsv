4fz4vx9f	Small clarification, but Greece gained independence in 1832 in part due to the other Russo-Turkish war (although the French and British also deserve some credit for Greek independence). The 1876-1878 war did not involve Greece.	1641529573.0	hrlekad	t3_rxc1hj	t1_hri02m7	/r/russia/comments/rxc1hj/tsar_alexander_02_the_liberator/hrlekad/
4fz4vx9f	To be fair, the United States just freed the slaves and left them without any real assistance, forcing many to just continue working for their former masters for very low wages, essentially making them little more than "wage slaves." Russia forced the "free" serfs to pay their former masters back for shitty land that often wasn't worth remotely what they were required to pay. In both cases the former slaves/serfs were essentially still indentured to their "former" masters and I don't think a whole lot of "freedom" was gained in either.	1641530428.0	hrlgd3c	t3_rxc1hj	t1_hrhai2x	/r/russia/comments/rxc1hj/tsar_alexander_02_the_liberator/hrlgd3c/

4rgna	We regulars are mostly pretty conservative and anti-postmodernist. However, we get brigaded a lot. They have bots monitoring this sub for keywords like ‚Äúgay‚Äù and then show up en masse (from gay and postmodernist subs; aka: most of Reddit) in order to troll us, hate on Russia and push their agenda.

4rgna	The cost to benefits analysis says that Russia really, really doesn‚Äôt. Unlike Crimea, Ukraine as a whole has very little of what Russia wants and (also unlike Crimea) the population will largely be hostile and expensive to feed and police. However, if Ukraine tries to grossly violate the Minks Accords and launch an ‚ÄúOperation Storm‚Äù (US supported Croatian offensive which ethnically cleansed all Serbs out of the country)  type of massive offensive against DNR/LNR, hoping to quickly defeat the separatist forces and cleanse the region of ‚Äúundesirables‚Äù (e.g.: ethnic Russians), Russia will have no choice but to intervene, in order to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and a territorial checkmate by NATO, and will likely end up annexing those territories. Russia really doesn‚Äôt want to have to do that though and will not strike without a massive provocation from Ukraine. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian establishment and oligarch press have been salivating over the prospect of repeating ‚ÄúOperation Storm‚Äù  for years and actively preparing for it. Russia is just letting them know that it‚Äôs also prepared and unlike weakened Serbia back in the 90s, won‚Äôt stand by and watch, and be flooded by millions of escaping refugees.	1641533334.0	hrlm3lb	t3_rj50s2	t1_hrlewuk	/r/russia/comments/rj50s2/world_war_iii_in_the_minds_of_journalists/hrlm3lb/

Therefore, it is not surprising that the West will be blamed.

Despite the fact that the Western music was prohibited in 70s, someone actually managed to get the JCS vinyl records literally from under the coat. And yeah, ABBA, Boney M were also loved in USSR alongside to Modern Talking.	1641570878.0	hrnegnr	t3_ry5zla	t3_ry5zla	/r/russia/comments/ry5zla/what_70s80s_western_musicians_were_popular_in_the/hrnegnr/

7s28j8e5	\- I went to visit my beloved mother-in-law in Lobnya. We decided to go with my friend, parishioner Pavel, by train. There weren't very many people on the platform. We already hear the train humming, approaching. And then there was such a noise, as if something had collapsed. I turned around sharply, I saw someone lying on the rails, - Nikolai Luzanov recalls.   In a conversation, the priest said that he did not know exactly what forces were leading him then. Something inexplicable was happening, he could not control his actions in any way.   \- Even psychologists say that at such moments half of people will have a stupor, and half will have some kind of action. At that moment, I also had to ask the question: what to do, I have four children? I say for sure that I would not have done anything: I would have been cowardly, I would have just prayed, maybe shouted. The train was just approaching. If we talk about adequacy, then it was definitely impossible to jump, - says the priest.  But Nikolai took a risk. He jumped onto the rails and, a moment before the approaching train, asked the man if he was alive, threw his hands on the platform and quickly pushed him onto the platform. There, a friend Pavel helped to drag the man to a safe place. The rescued person began to come to his senses, and the priest and his friend Pavel got into their train and drove to Lobnya.  https://www.kp.ru/daily/27348.3/4528618/	1641571023.0	hrnev91	t3_ryajww	t3_ryajww	/r/russia/comments/ryajww/in_the_city_of_dolgoprudny_priest_nikolai_luzanov/hrnev91/

9419yri4	Update: The U.S. changes its entry requirement to 24 hours, not 48! Luckily Moscow has rapid testing centers in train stations. Getting to Russia, I was fine. It was just some guy at a folding table after passport control that collected the tests. He didn't really even look at it. Coming back was chaos. Though I was aware of the new requirement and had my test, hundreds of people at the airport did not and the lines were insane. I was in Sheremetyevo for 4 hours before I boarded the flight, and barely made it.	1641571621.0	hrngi4w	t3_r64mnr	t3_r64mnr	/r/russia/comments/r64mnr/russia_entry_pcr_testing/hrngi4w/

9419yri4	This is a little late, but I just returned from Moscow and can fill you in. You won't find a free place for a test. There are testing locations at all train stations, which is where I got mine, but the prices ranged from 2,000-3,700 rubles, depending on how fast you needed the results. Places for which we needed tickets, like the circus, or museums, asked for them. You didn't need one to just walk around Red Square, but there is a 50% chance the guard in GUM will ask for it.  Just check ahead of time online for the places you want to go. No restaurants asked us for the code, but that's not to say that some won't.	1641571897.0	hrnh9it	t3_r6i892	t3_r6i892	/r/russia/comments/r6i892/any_tourist_to_russia_lately_have_experiences/hrnh9it/

hw3dl5q8	>Oh, please! Paedophilia has long been associated with the homosexual subculture and historically, a lot of the ‚Äúgay rights‚Äù ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù were known paedophiles, who fought for lowering the age of consent. I mean, American ‚Äúgay‚Äù groups still organize seasonal cruises to third world countries where sex with young boys is not outlawed. Lots of old ‚Äúgays‚Äù even retire to live in such countries. Back in the 90s, when Russia was impoverished and lawless, it also became a ‚Äúhot destination‚Äù for them. I personally know victims. It‚Äôs just that the postmodern neoliberal establishment has been hiding all of this from public view for a long time and all the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù on the matter has been conducted by the deviants themselves or their postmodernist allies. Homosexuality is a mental illness (and was officially defined as such, until the psychiatrist establishment was infiltrated and subverted to support their causes) and has a high rate of co-morbidity with other mental illnesses and defects.   >   >Russia is not ‚Äúhomophobic country‚Äù. ‚ÄúHomophobia‚Äù is a fake and nonsensical term designed to deflect and slander people who don‚Äôt support the postmodernist agenda.  I would leave it to the scientists/doctors to decide if homosexuality is a mental illness (FYI, they have decided, and it is not).  I wouldn't be so sure about cruises from America to Russia, because if you open a map you will see, that it is very hard to get to Russia by water and also because it‚Äôs forbidden to enter Russia via sea borders.      And I never said that gay people cannot be pedophiles, I said that sexuality does not affect that, and there is a 50/50 chance that some pedophile could be gay or straight.      The point is, that in this situation you're paying attention on "gay" and not "pedophile".	1641582203.0	hroa2a1	t3_rxh42x	t1_hrl8ca2	/r/russia/comments/rxh42x/two_days_ago_in_kostroma_two_men_an_old_gay_and/hroa2a1/

As for "bad guys" - it is quite common to portray Russians or especially Russian government as natureborn cruel bastards. Hollywood does it all the time. So the same do some Russian writers, filmmakers and so on. It is sold well, especially in the West.

1la55hn2	Muslims too you can openly lie about us and be racist and people still love the shows and movies lmao üòÇ  In my home country Russia and Putin are viewed as more reliable and of stable mind than many other Western countries who keep blackmailing us through IMF, and other agencies.  I don't believe the portrayal of Russian/Chinese and Putin in modern Western media.   Hope for more friendly relationship between my country Pakistan and Russia.	1641609337.0	hrq6fjn	t3_rynbpc	t1_hrq5ipa	/r/russia/comments/rynbpc/what_russians_think_of_to_the_lake/hrq6fjn/
nlfofey	You clearly do not understand what you are talking about. Lukashenko was a pain in the ass for Russia for many years (for about 10 years), he was alternately friends with Russia, then with Europe, then again with Russia, and each time he begged for money from us, then from the EU, and every time he switched , he began to treat the other side more harshly. At the moment he was just stuck on our side and nothing more, EU completely refused to deal with him and therefore he portrays "one of Putin's best friends", although he still does nothing of what it promises. Putin is not his boss, Putin does not order him anything, most likely he does not even listen to Putin's advices and that is why he is in this situation. The idea that Putin is his "master" is a propaganda narrative of the Western press, because according to the logic of modern EU (which is mostly dictated from across the ocean), Putin is one of the main threats to "humanity" or at least "democracy", therefore any problem affecting America or Europe should be tied to Russia or personally to Putin, in whole or in part, in order to further demonize this artificially created image.	1641609522.0	hrq6umb	t3_r76s97	t1_hrq2msh	/r/russia/comments/r76s97/what_is_your_view_on_the_current_crisis_on_the/hrq6umb/
fmq5vim6	Thank you for the websites they are very useful.  For question 2, you say it‚Äôs possible but there is very little information online about this sort of thing. I have found out the process of buying a vehicle and it seems I would need an address in Russia to register it? Otherwise I would not be able to drive the car.  If I can register the car in Russia, then I assume I will be able to drive around the EU no problem so long as I have correct documents for the car as any Russian citizen would need to drive their car there, and correct visas as a Brit.  Do you know any Russian website that might have more information that I can translate?

e69eizmw	The fact is that the series from Netflix "The Witcher" is impossible to watch if you read the book. Netflix has ruined everything that can be ruined for the sake of tolerance. After I watched The Witcher, I will never watch Netflix again. I'm sick of so much tolerance. Netflix is shit. The Witcher books have a huge number of fans here and Netflix gave a shit to all of them.	1641625204.0	hrr0m9x	t3_rynbpc	t1_hrqxujm	/r/russia/comments/rynbpc/what_russians_think_of_to_the_lake/hrr0m9x/

3fq1je3w	'Western democracy' is an outdate concept that has clearly failed in the current world order there is nothing to gain from implementing it in Russia while there is alot to lose(Even western countries admit it)  'Sovereign Democracy' adopted by Putin offers a nice mix between democracy and authoriterianism and allows for a good ammount of protectionism while still having a global economy.  Its a style I feel suits russia more being a large state with alot of natural resources that demmands some internal control to prevent foriegn forces from overexploiting the people(There is still a benifit with some expertise and and tech sharing that is involved with the process so its not a good thing to close the door completly to international companies)  There is no reason to censor legitimit complaints unless they are clearly fakes or taken out of context by Foreign Agents like the Yale Educated Navalny and his foreign backed organization(they now openly recive money from western organizations)  Look at what happened in Iran when Democracy was 'attempted' the west is not pro 'democracy' they just use the claim to destroy countries that resist their influence and when democracy turns against them they use their power to overthrow said democracy.  By all accounts the russian goverment is much more resistent to corruption then others mostly by not having a large focus on lobbying and the practice being very looked down upon especially if it inolves mutli nationals...  Compare that to the EU and US where lobbying and Insider trading is basicly as common as drinking water...In Russia lobbying can ruin careers and usually done behind close doors in secret.	1641625936.0	hrr1omv	t3_r6b4l8	t1_hrq28xs	/r/russia/comments/r6b4l8/as_it_ever_been_considered_that_russia_could_join/hrr1omv/

hwp3hyyb	Luckily my British-Russian child is a girl. Russia doesn't have dual citizenship with UK. You have two citizenships. In UK you are considered only British, in Russia you are considered only Russian. So all your rights and obligations are same as for people with only one passport.   To be taken to Russian Army you have to have a permanent address or place of work or to study in University, these are places where people from military service can come and hand over you an invitation to come to military commission. They have to do it personally or through director of your company where you work, or through a head of faculty where you study. Nobody will grab you in airport at border crossing, unless you are a criminal. You can become a student, or wait until age 27, or get married and have a child and then another, or work in village school as a teacher, or say you are pacifist and work in a hospital for three years instead, or go for just 1 year to the army. But nowadays it is enough people going voluntarily and militaries don't run after you. Also if you have some serious health issues you will not pass medical check. My son is 24, never went to the army, he is avoiding it by legal means.	1641628398.0	hrr52w3	t3_rys9q6	t3_rys9q6	/r/russia/comments/rys9q6/conscription_for_dual_citizen/hrr52w3/

Basically it's a shitshow. Might as well give the life sentence in Siberia. If he's truly guilty, he will suffer for the rest of his life. If not, he can still live a normal life.   Thing is.

4dlbu	When I moved to Russia from the States, I had one large carry-on and checked four luggage items and just paid the fees because it was cheaper and more convenient than having it all shipped.  I'm a musician though and so the majority of my baggage were oversized Pelican and ATA flight cases with analog synthesizers and studio equipment.  It's all sensitive and valuable electronics and everything arrived safely.  I would never have anything valuable mailed.  It's a real hassle to arrange the pick-up and yeah, I had to pay customs fees for receiving even the smallest of items. I've been living here for 3 years and have been back to the States twice, where each time I pick up more of my gear to bring back on a flight and pay the extra baggage fees.  I travel with my wife though and through Delta we each get one checked luggage item for free. Not sure how it is with your sporting gear, but it's difficult and expensive to find the same make and brands of outdoor equipment here.  I'd recommend leaving whatever clothing behind to make room for your other items that you want to have with you.  It's easy and cheap to get your wardrobe outfitted again here.	1641634930.0	hrrdivh	t3_rykstt	t3_rykstt	/r/russia/comments/rykstt/moving_to_russia_from_us/hrrdivh/

There is no significant push for reforming child abuse justice and healthcare. Saying "lawl let's put them in siberia" isn't a solution. Recognizing that some people need help to deal with these impulses, and that just having them doesn't make you a bad person, is important. I want to live in a world where these people will go to the doctor and get help before they hurt someone. Those that DO hurt people or are likely to hurt people SHOULD be separated from society for the safety of children. Whether that means prison (people that have hurt others) or something else (other people, such as those that are mentally ill and cannot control themselves). Sending people to labor camps AFTER the fact won't solve the problem. It doesn't make the survivors better off.

1k18revr	Soviet-Polish war of 1919-21 was an agression by Poland against Soviet territory, in an attempt to induct former territories of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth into the Second Polish Republic, without even asking citizens of those areas for consent. Of course we promptly got our ass beaten, and Soviet forces were on the outskirts of Warsaw, and only a single tactical maneuver by Polish forces (along with a large dose of luck) stopped the Soviet Russia from liquidating Poland and its bourgeoise government (Which, to be honest, would be a better outcome for all of Poland, and potentially for Russia as well - there would be no "socialism in one country", Stalinism would not be a thing, and the Great Patriotic War wouldn't bring such horrendous destruction).	1641990294.0	hsc92iq	t3_s21g4t	t1_hsc7yn1	/r/russia/comments/s21g4t/whats_all_this_about/hsc92iq/

Then you got news article sites like the New York Times.

hn4dd	It‚Äôs not invasion that they are worried about. It‚Äôs shifting the balance of strategic power from parity to US by enabling US to hypothetically strike Moscow with missiles in less than 5 minutes, virtually holding a gun to Russia‚Äôs head and thus having huge political and military/strategic advantage. It may be surprising for some western observers but right now strategically US and Russia have parity - both in nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and nuclear triad - submarines, land based systems and strategic bombers. Thus ensuring mutual assured destruction. Furthermore, Ukraine can be used as a launchpad to incite separatism movement inside Russia and thus destabilise Russia. All of this makes Russia to perceive NATO as existential threat to it. Not forgetting that NATO was conceived as a military alliance against Moscow.	1642189646.0	hso47js	t3_s3h9ht	t1_hso1kut	/r/russia/comments/s3h9ht/ukraine_stealing_crimea_from_russia_a_caricature/hso47js/

Taking more of Ukraine doesn‚Äôt actually really benefit them in any way other than taking over the entire Country and selling their natural resources, but I doubt Russia is that crazy, and I *highly* doubt any other countries would allow Russia to do that.	1642191288.0	hso8hmi	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsn9xn7	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hso8hmi/

At the same time Russia has no other means to coerce NATO from expanding eastwards, so this is why it becomes likely for Putin to invade.	1642191624.0	hso9d3t	t3_s3uez1	t1_hso8hmi	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hso9d3t/

hwyus3zz	Well, count yourself. Russia and Finland are separated by a border with a length of 1271.8 kilometers. A soldier for every 100 meters - a total of 12,000 soldiers who must be on duty for 12 hours out of 48. That is, already 48 thousand soldiers, plus armored vehicles, aviation, vehicles, equipment, infrastructure, barracks. Can you imagine how much it costs? It is more profitable for us to sell iron ore to the Finns at a 50% discount, in fact - at a loss, this is more than offset by savings on border protection. With Sweden, almost the same story. 200 years with them - peace, and I hope there will be another 200 years. Well, about Norway, everything is simple. There is oil and gas there. The gas is now being pumped out at such a rate that "proven deposits" will last for about 8 years. In 8 years, Norwegians will earn money by fishing, and at sea they will be under sail. NATO is engaged in the robbery of the countries included in it, in Norway they provide security for campaigns that plunder the country's natural wealth. No offense, but that's the Norwegians' problem, not ours.	1642192550.0	hsobrse	t3_s2y809	t3_s2y809	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsobrse/

I have literally nothing against Russia, and I don't believe a word that the media says. Sadly the majority of the population are idiots (probably rings true to all countries), and that's why there is a hype about it. Brainless people don't have their own mind, they let media decide their opinion. I can't remember ever having a bad interaction with a Russian. During my gaming years, my closest friends and kindest ones were Russians, always.  There was this guy, Oleg, who played L2 on my server. He was an absolute beast, killed everything and everyone. I was so scared of him that I befriended him. Turns out to be the greatest personality ever. We seriously used google translate to communicate, and after 6 months, I could almost form simple sentences in Russian. üòÅ Then he killed people for me whenever I needed him ü§£.

4zkra	I think the discourse on "both sides" can be pretty wild nowadays. I know Finnish media isn't as fearmongering as Sweden for example, given the examples written of the Russian ships in Baltic Sea, but yes, we still live in Western hemisphere mediawise, and sometimes Russia is instantly blamed for a plethora of reasons. EU in particular likes to blame on Russia for everything and the US likes to poke around here, thinking we're their "frontline". Then again, I know Russian media has its own ways of telling the stories. The gap can be pretty wide, but we the people are pretty much still the same. We aren't our governments, we aren't the allies our leaders have chosen for us. If we just remember to understand we are constantly being influenced by all the news sources, and that the normal person still lives their lives the same no matter the country, we are born, we love, we die. All the rest is just politics.	1642196706.0	hsomjmz	t3_s436k4	t3_s436k4	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hsomjmz/

aeb7t	It was forced upon them.   Objectively: USSR military had 4-5 million in the army now it's just 1 million.   USSR or RF had never built infrastructure to cross the oceans to invade someone.    Military had defensive doctrine which was reflected in spending and the types of hardware for 25 years.   There was never any need build bases, command centers, guidance systems, outsource killing to extremists.    But now we live in world where minuteman missles regularly fail to launch so the stupid generals recommend to move the frontline to the RF border.   Alternative to Armageddon is 3rd generation wmd. Massive emps that simply collapse energy grids and all modern weapons in nato with minimal casualties. Its about 500k volt per square mile. We would have no GPS, internet, digital money or digital fake economy, hardly any electronics for 5-10 years, but our planet would still be here and civilization would live. Plus, we would finally be able to successfully make an arrangement that keeps military away from borders, wmd under complete control and ballistic bullshit under cap.   WTH am I on about.

gtkjb	If you believe you will never know the truth, then you won't, because you will give up looking (and corrupt politicians like this).   If you believe you will find the truth, then you will find the one you like, and stop there, because you're happy with it. But it might not be truth. Corrupt politicians can work with this.   If you keep digging for the real truth, no matter what it costs you, you will die as a martyr. Because the politicians will hate you. All of them. Because all of them are corrupt. It's what they do.  Power corrupts, absolute power is kinda neat. And to become a politician one must enjoy power.  Ultimately, they don't want you to be curious.   But if everyone is curious, then there are too many martyrs for them to kill or put behind bars.   They don't like that, because we outnumber them, and that forces them to steal less and do more. They don't like that at all. It smells like a guillotine and gives them nightmares.  As to debates, they are rarely pleasant. They might not be good for you, but they might be good for all of us, as a class. They help the truth come out. Political debates help herd immunity against bullshit.	1642197828.0	hsopee6	t3_s3ncv7	t3_s3ncv7	/r/russia/comments/s3ncv7/my_wise_way_how_to_deal_with_different_political/hsopee6/

945p2	Freedom of the press is about barring the government from interfering with what‚Äôs reported. This was why it was such a big deal when Trump tried to revoke White House press passes of publications that spoke badly of him.   It‚Äôs also what led to some important moments in American history, like when Woodward and Bernstein uncovered Watergate. Their investigation led to Nixon‚Äôs resignation prior to impeachment.   It does not, however, negate government influence over what is published - though, in my opinion, the bigger issue is that the people who own the newspapers also own the politicians.	1642199873.0	hsougdl	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsotdba	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hsougdl/

12pok7	We could also look at how South Korea developed with the help of the USA due to the cold war, or Japan, or Hongkong with the help of the British. Russia was also present in many areas within the middle east and Asia and later withdrew because it wasn't working out and the people fought them off. It's something else if the people comply and work together. There was also infrastructure built in Afghanistan etc. by many countries, not just the US, but it was mostly torn down and destroyed again.  We can cherry pick the good and the bad cases for "both sides" ... Neither side is the pure bad, not the pure good guy. Both sides made mistakes, both sides accomplished both good and bad.	1642201353.0	hsoy0xy	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hsmpc67	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsoy0xy/

The Baltic countries regained their independence in the 90's after the USSR dissolved. maybe I missed something but Russia never tried to invade them again.  The people of Crimea preferred to be part of Russia, in the last seven years the world hasn't seen any Crimean fugitives have we? or any protests by Crimean people?  I don't know much about what happened in Georgia so I can't say anything about that.  Luhansk and Donetsk is mostly populated by ethnic Russians I think.

i442qb9j	The average American is frankly sick of this and wars. So don't listen to the saber rattlers out there. Personal advice is don't developed geopolitical opinions based on movies and tv, you're just agreeing with the often shitty opinion of artists caricatures if you do.  Your average American and average Russian are closer in lifestyle than previously heralded, it just costs more to live in the US. But pay scales to meet that cost.  I'm sure nationalist from both sides will dunk on this comment.

Meanwhile, all the Russian people I meet are cool people.  If the Americans portrayed the Russians as being nice and cool, how could they make you believe that "Russia will attack"? A lie must be monstrous in order to be believed in - this is what Goebbels said and the Americans became his diligent students.	1642204295.0	hsp4znj	t3_s2y809	t1_hsi6hws	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsp4znj/

Cuba had been controlled by american oligarchs of sugar and rum, tobacco and gambling. all of it entwined with mafia and every form of smuggling and corruption. there was no cuban govenment other than that of private american business interests.  the impoverished class was ripe for the Marxism of that era. the guerillas invited and were encouraged by communists. this scenariocwas at play throughout latin america (monroe doctrine applies).   its not hard at all to see similarity w our modern situation. hpwever, the front has changed..  it might be interesting to compare the nature, and intent of the Soviets in latin america with nature and intent of nato of today.	1642204762.0	hsp62gn	t3_s3h9ht	t1_hsmxjlj	/r/russia/comments/s3h9ht/ukraine_stealing_crimea_from_russia_a_caricature/hsp62gn/

hwp3hyyb	Important as any other big project where huge money and efforts were invested. But not vital. Also looks like Gazprom had a good profit of all this madness with gas prices, so Gazprom covered the exspences for NS2 construction already.   As for Ukraine, they declared independance, but want to be independant at Russia's expense. It is a long story of blackmailing, begging for low tariffs, stealing gaz from pipeline, so basically, NS was build to avoid territories of Ukraine and Poland, so yes tranzit via them may be stopped. But also the pipeline in Ukraine was not modernized for years. If EU will supply gaz to these countries, we would be happy. Deal with them, dear EU, yourself at your expense.  We have another huge pipeline being build to China "Power of Siberia", so we will sell our gaz to other countries who is just doing business, nothing personal.	1642207096.0	hspbb8n	t3_s430yt	t3_s430yt	/r/russia/comments/s430yt/is_nord_stream_2_important_for_russia_or_not/hspbb8n/
58oaoi2z	Clearly, you've misunderstood me an I have no idea what you've just said. If you need a translator, deepl is quite good.        I'll say this: you're either free or you're not. There's no in-between.  Get. Across. Then decide what you're going to do: practise Buddhism, make pancakes or wage wars.  I'l leave you with this:  Imagine a dirty and filthy latrine. Is there anything clean in it? There is. It's a hole in the centre of it. Nothing can stain it. Everything just falls down through it. The hole has no edges, no boundaries, no shape - only the stool has all that. And yet the whole temple of uncleanness exists solely because of this hole. This hole is the most important thing in the latrine, and at the same time something that has nothing to do with it at all. Moreover, it is not its own nature that makes the hole a hole, but what people have arranged around it: a latrine. The hole has no nature of its own, at least not until the llama, who sat down on the stool, begins to divide it into three kayas        To understand one's own nature by carrying out Lamaist practices is like studying the hole in the latrine, making a daily visualization of a traditional Tibetan stool covered with mantras and portraits of llamas in yellow and red Tibetan robes. One could spend a lifetime collecting such stools - which is what all these Tibetan embroidery groupies are doing, constantly arguing with each other over who has the real Tibetan stool and who has the disgraceful self-made one. But it has nothing to do with the hole itself.	1642207299.0	hspbrg8	t3_s305qp	t1_hsmfake	/r/russia/comments/s305qp/is_hinduism_allowed_in_russia/hspbrg8/

8sb03s1	As as a older somewhat conservative American, I agree with you in regards to the American government. At the federal level it's completely corrupt both Democrats and Republicans. No election is going to fix this. The politicians are in this for themselves, not the betterment of the country or its people. War after war after war...trillions of dollars spent. Over the years trillions of dollars spent in the US and it has not done a thing...because the system is not set to help people. It's a pyramid scheme.   The sad thing about most Americans is that they still beleave in the stereotype about Russian people still being communists. They have been fed this so long they don't know the truth. They know nothing of their culture or the country at all. They have failed to take the time to find things out for themselves . Instead they let beleave the media.   As a ham radio operator and a shortwave radio lister prior to the fall of the Iron curtain, I was lucky enough to  meet and talk to people in Eastern Europe and Russia, along with listening to radio broadcasts as well. It helped me understand others opinions of Americans and the American government. I knew long before Donald Trump was saying " fake media " what fake media was and is,and I can tell you, most the people have been up to their necks in it ,without realizing it.  As individuals we can only reach out to each other and continue to learn about each other and appreciate our differences.   To all the hard working, fine people of Russia I wish you all the best , and just remember not all Americans dislike you.

58oaoi2z	I have doubts that you've actually read my post. I mean, you've asked, I provided the answer and now you've become passive-aggressive all of a sudden. What gives? Is this who you truly are that shines through?   Anyway! You don't like rabbits? Fine. Have you ever seen a magic eye? You either see what's hidden in the picture or you don't. Sophistry doesn't exist at this level of cognition.   The mere idea that an *internal logical argument* could provide anything ‚Äî anything at all ‚Äî about the world, the idea that an *argument* can prove anything at all about the real world is *absurd*.    It is only with a reference to what is actually real we can see if an idea has any merit.   Einstein, right? Albert Einstein predicted black holes back in 1910-s. Nobody said "Oooh, Great Albert said so, so it must be true", but people started looking. They kept at it and the first black hole was confirmed in 1970-s. First picture was taken 2 years ago.   I'll reiterate: an idea can possibly have merit only when it has a reference in reality.   Does the idea of "you" have a reference in reality?   Me looking or not looking for treasures is irrelevant. You forgot what I've said right at the beginning: don't take my word for any of it. The burden of proof is on you. I can't show it to you, I can't force it upon you (I would if I could) and I sure as hell would not recommend you believing that there's no you (like I said, It's a whole another level of insanity).    All I can do is provide some guidance.	1642209651.0	hspgy23	t3_s305qp	t1_hsmdqes	/r/russia/comments/s305qp/is_hinduism_allowed_in_russia/hspgy23/

ehsqhqic	Well the logistical problems of invading Russia are in part the freezing temperatures, which doesn't go for Western Europe. Obviously invading GB is a different beast entirely.  The really unrealistic thing about Russia invading the EU is imo that Russia isn't even that strong. If you go by military budget they aren't that much stronger than any one of the big 3 of Europe and even if you assume that they are better trained and can produce their equipment more cheaply Russia is by no means the military superpower it used to be during the cold war. Assuming so would just ignore that the Western countries continued to grow economically at a much faster pace.  An invasion of Ukraine is something that's remotely imaginable. Finland+Sweden? Highly unlikely and the reaction of NATO would be devastating, so this would be suicide. Western Europe? No chance.	1642212539.0	hspn9wp	t3_s2y809	t1_hsipglj	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hspn9wp/

And this is extremely crucial to keep up the na-na-na-na noise levels and deflect from real American weaknesses i.e. their ever growing economic inequalities and a very divided population festering with disillusionment of the failed "American dream" and anger. This will continue until it becomes economically confident, perhaps they are hoping in a few years? Then they will start their old game of destroying countries and bringing down regimes - they will want a double whammy starting with China and this will be sufficient to rattle an old Putin is what they are hoping. The Russians must again rise up with or without Putin.	1642214073.0	hspqluw	t3_s3uez1	t1_hsnrh3k	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hspqluw/

The demi-seasonal one is drooping all the time - I honestly haven't seen a single person whose uniform fit them perfectly.

I myself am an American (I want it to be clear I‚Äôm an outsider in this sub) who has very negative opinions about my government as well as the sensibilities of many of my fellow citizens.    The government of Putin has been a strong one and has seen the country develop quite a bit since the 90s (from what I understand) but they‚Äôve also engaged in many hostile actions abroad as well as crushing dissent against their rule at home.  The Upper Class, whether they be Russian or American, cares little for those in the working class and often have corrupt ambitions of power and riches.	1642215680.0	hsptzw9	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hsmledi	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsptzw9/

To say it would be casting stones from a glass house for the US to accuse another country of planning a false flag to create pretext for military adventurism would be the understatement of the century.

I am not (and many, many of us)  personally responsible for the crimes our government, who has failed us way too many times, has committed. The average American and the average Russian are more alike than they are dissimilar so I'd say it's unfair to say that we are twiddling our thumbs doing nothing. There are many Americans who are trying their best to organize, rally, and fight for injustices against their governors, senators, etc. who do nothing but spew propaganda about Russia (and others) back at them. Nevermind the other injustices we have to deal with that regard our own country.   I don't blame Russian citizens for things their government has done. It's disingenuous to say that every American isn't doing their part to organize their best. And at the end of the day, there is only so much we can do. I, for one, have absolutely no idea what we could do, even united, to stop the government and their military hard on.

1f10pre9	Personally, I believe Russia might have to stop transiting gas through Ukraine whether they want it or not, mainly because of how old and poorly maintained the pipeline is, but also because of the unreliability of Ukraine.  There's little to no hope of Ukraine doing any kind of repairing or maintaining of the pipelines either considering its almost non-existent economy.  I would also love to see some new pipelines going further into Asian countries, perhaps India and SEA countries. I think it's time for Russia to focus more on Asia.	1642217580.0	hspxx8x	t3_s430yt	t1_hspbb8n	/r/russia/comments/s430yt/is_nord_stream_2_important_for_russia_or_not/hspxx8x/

Personally I supported the annexation, what I didn't support is lying about it. If we just said "hey it's our troops over there, we are returning Crimea home" that would be fine, but first saying that there were no troops and then saying there actually were our troops is not fine.   Even if it was a private military group I'm sure it was allowed to operate in crimea by the Russian government, otherwise nobody would let them in.	1642217762.0	hspyasm	t3_s3uez1	t1_hspvz8w	/r/russia/comments/s3uez1/ah_yes_the_same_intelligence_that_gave_the_world/hspyasm/

cj3el3ke	There is a lot that can be agreed and disagreed, but by the end of the day, one thing is certain. Everyone needs to back up and reevaluate before jumping face first into someone else‚Äôs basket. The US accuses anyone of ‚Äúaggression‚Äù or ‚Äúhostile acts‚Äù when it doesn‚Äôt play to their rules. The EU is a mess of its own, bounding each other to a inevitable chaos one day to come by their own doing. Russia, though not perfect, is trying to make themselves establish and strong. The Soviet collapse still hurts in some areas for Russia, though it is easy to say progress and growth from the collapse has been impressive.  We are in a situation where politicians are trying to divide the people. They use events, whether they impact us or not, to drive us apart and cause discord. Easier to get control and distract us from the real issues in the world. Every year, around the same time, Russia is ‚Äúabout to invade‚Äù (insert border nation) and the US has to deploy troops at its border for ‚Äúx y and z‚Äù reasons. It‚Äôs a distraction from what the real issues are. COVID, climate and economical issues are on people minds but the politics don‚Äôt want to go about handling them the right way so they throw dust in our eyes and pretend all is well.

9ixw7buo	For the past 500 years we have been slowly but surely globalizing. This trend is not a direct result of government & corporate exploitation as much as the people's restless propensity to innovate & explore. The last 100 years the trend of concentrated one world government exploitation proliferates while hiding behind national rivalries. And now today - these ancient rivalries are again being exploited by the NWO to create mass chaos as a catalyst for change - but the final result is not what they have planned - your post proves to me that the people are finally waking up - a trend that the governments  have been trying to guide, moderate and control - unsuccessfully. This trend is not theirs to control - it is divine.	1642220859.0	hsq4ghe	t3_s436k4	t3_s436k4	/r/russia/comments/s436k4/propagandas_leaves_no_room_for_real_talk_my/hsq4ghe/

Just like In America, you also have some (often louder than the majority) radicals that feel like because they were born in a certain geographical location, they are better than people born somewhere else. Shit, both countries are riddled with past atrocities. It would be nice if we could view people as part of the same human team and stop with this stupid nonsense. Patriotism is great! You should be proud of the country you live in. That doesn‚Äôt mean someone in another country is better or worse. If your identity is tied to a specific leader or political party, you‚Äôre setting yourself up to be let down.	1642220910.0	hsq4k3h	t3_s49wxk	t3_s49wxk	/r/russia/comments/s49wxk/mods_of_rrussia_arresting_a_bunch_of_western/hsq4k3h/

They've got to run their own race. I probably wouldn't go down the path of calling them what you called them. I think that's remarkably unfair to them. Anyway.. If you see issues with things that you can change in your own country, then you can do your best there. I'm not sure how voting works in Russia but it's the start of change. Look for representation who fits your ideals and slowly move the country towards that direction.

He never saw any real combat, but went through dozens of BDUs, especially the pants. The Army wouldn‚Äôt replace them often enough for him and so he had his mom buy and mail him surplus multicam pants from the States. She also mailed him stuff like Magpul anti-tilt followers for M4 mags, because the issued aluminum 30 round mags were terribly unreliable with their tilting followers.

a69hz	Yeah, so once again. Not an advocate, just wise enough not to be biased blindly against systems and functions.   Yeah, I agree that its a waste. But at the current human evolutionary position, not having a military, a defence force, with active offensive capabilities leaves nations and people at the behest of more powerful entities for exploitation. Russia capitalised in the 90s, meaning they are now trying to establish their own governance outside of the western run institutions. Meaning outside the nato partnerships....brics vs transpacific, nato vs russia on that border.   So from what ever angle you think its russia thats the bad guy it isnt. Russian didnt plunge ukrain unto a civil war because it didnt get its way. The whole world knows thats what US does. They dont even hide it, outright in media, politics, news, organisations are pro distabalising nationa and installing their puppets to work for their economic system.   I dont know what info bubble you are from. But you just sound like a western consumer. Zero ideolouge towards rational politics that understands positions and sides and viable options.   Its easy to say:right no war guys. But as we still see today no peoples are safe from the oligarchies of the elite of each system. Russian, US, chineese, german, british, etc protesters were beaten and detained regardless of the agena of protests, or how peaceful they are. Its just clear that this is the world and we have to take sides, and neither side is wholly rightious, or fair.	1642228634.0	hsqi26o	t3_s1cfvb	t1_hsqer9f	/r/russia/comments/s1cfvb/russian_troops_in_their_own_territory_is_bad_but/hsqi26o/

12pok7	So, your point is ...? I don't have to look it up.  This is exactly what I mean. It is a huge difference when people comply and actually take and use the support they get. In that case the aid does wonders, no matter from which side it is coming from. One side kept getting support from the USA and developed further into an economic powerhouse, the other lost support and broke down because they lost support due to the development of the cold war. It literally didn't matter where the support came from, because the country wanted the aid and used it. Unlike Afghanistan for example. The USA actually gave them billions purely for development, they supported and built infrastructure for watery food and education. But it didn't stick ... the infighting tore it down as soon as it was built.   And that was only one of my examples. What with the others? I saw the different development and support in Germany, both from the US / British side and the Soviet one.  The original comment I replied to tried to made it look like the US support always just ends up badly, while soviet / Russian support ends up so much better and is always doing great. It isn't just black and white. As I said, neither side is the pure good guy or the pure bad guy.	1642231587.0	hsqmetr	t3_s3p7pe	t1_hspub70	/r/russia/comments/s3p7pe/difference/hsqmetr/

Russia claims Crimeans want to be Russian majority. Ukrainians and western sources state Crimeans want to be Ukranian majority. Referendum under Russia cannot have been trusted.  So the only social justification here is Crimea belongs to where it already belonged, Ukraine.   It still belongs to Ukraine, as a justification ignoring power over the black sea.

zoa9d	Greetings. Sorry for my poor English. The logic here is simple: 1. Russia is not interested in the seizure of foreign territories. By foreign territories we mean those territories in which Russian culture is not widespread, or is widespread, but is not accepted by society in a positive overwhelming majority. 2. If there is a state next to Russia to which Russian culture is related, where it is treated mostly positively, then its "capture" (accession) is possible only when a referendum is held. An attempt to annex something without a referendum can provoke strong discontent within Russia itself, and for almost all territories potentially possible for annexation, it is necessary to hold a referendum not only in the annexed territory, but also in Russia itself, for reasons that Russian society does not seek to absorb anyone - "Russian annexation must be deserved", since it implies the social and economic development of the "annexed" territories on an equal basis with all other regions of Russia. 3. The territories bordering Russia should not be anyone's proxy, otherwise, regardless of Russia's desire, it will have to eliminate this proxy sooner or later. This is a matter of national security. For this reason, Russian diplomats explained that it was time for NATO to leave. If NATO does not leave by itself, it will be forced to do so, while no one will occupy anyone. 4. The vast majority of countries where the media and the political elite spread fear about the Russian invasion, Russia as a territory is not interested not only for cultural, but also for economic reasons. Strictly speaking, even Belarus and Ukraine, which are closely related to Russia, are extremely unprofitable for occupation in economic terms for the Russian Federation.	1642234923.0	hsqr147	t3_s2y809	t3_s2y809	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsqr147/

d4y2o	In Soviet times Russia was investing a lot of money and resources into supporting other territories, both inside the USSR and outside. According to the statistics, if I remember correctly there were only 2 republics in the USSR which earned more money than they spent, and that surplus was going to the rest of the country. One of these two republics is RSFSR (current Russia); unfortunately I don't remember the other one. It might be Belarus but I may be mistaken.  For example, Soviet Union built a lot of manufacturing facilities and if I remember correctly some shipyards in the Baltic republics; these facilities were mainly destroyed after the secession of the Baltic states, so the people who worked there lost their jobs and had to leave these countries to look for jobs in the UK and European countries. In my opinion this is one of the many reasons for the current depopulation of the Baltic states. The Ignalina nuclear power plant was destroyed in Lithuania, and now they have energy deficit and have to spend a lot on importing LNG which is a separate funny story: they were planning to lower their dependency on Russian natural gas and ended up buying the LNG from another Russian company (Novatek); only this LNG is being sold to them as an American one while Americans buy it from Russia :))  I often visit Germany, and my German friends too confirm that there's still an economic gap between Eastern and Western part of Germany. If understand correctly, the industrial plants which were built in the Eastern part before the reunification were destroyed, but nothing significant was built there in their place - and of course it's another reason for the before-mentioned gap. In my opinion it resembles the situation in the Baltic states: everything from the past times was destroyed and not a lot had been built, here's the problems with economy and depopulation.	1642235683.0	hsqs1ck	t3_s2y809	t1_hsoznfe	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/hsqs1ck/

The federal goverment is mostly responsible for the Army,Police,healthcare,border control,foriegn policy and doesnt get involve much in regional governence.  The goverment offers money in a few ways direct investment and loans(typicly if the local goverment has a budget deficite or is struggling or if they need money for a project)  The better a region preforms the more Loans they can take while the goverment subsidizes stuggeling regions more to get them up to standerd.  TLDR: There is a reward scheme for more prospourous regions in the form of loand while the less fortunete have a life line in the form of more direct investment.	1642235928.0	hsqscx3	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsqscx3/

1nxg52ul	You're assuming that Ukrainians and Russians are two different people. Reality is, for many Ukrainians these are not two exclusive things. Just as one can be Bavarian and German at the same time, you can be Ukrainian and Russian at the same time. After all, historical name of Ukraine is "Little Russia" and word "Ukrainian" in ethnic sense does not appear in sources until end of 19th and beginning of 20th ct.  Now that's not to say that Ukrainians that think that Ukrainians and Russians are two separate people does not exist too, but my impression was, that in the east of Ukraine, most people feel like part of larger Russian ethnos, along with White Russians and Great Russians.	1642237650.0	hsqulp1	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsqulp1/

1nxg52ul	With Taiwan it's even more complicated. There are two major groups of Taiwanese today. One is composed of "original" inhabitants of island and another are exiles from mainland that arrived with Chiang Kai-shek after lost civil war.  The first group are not "Han Chinese" as I understand it, and as much as I can tell, they feel much less connection to mainland China then the later group. There was also apparently always political division along these two groups in Taiwan.  But I ques it comes down to how you define "Chinese". Both Russia and China were and still are essentially imperial civilizations that include many ethnic groups. However Russians are distinct ethnicity and in Russian language there is even difference made between "Russians" -Ruskye and "citizens of Russia" -Rossiane. Later of course can be of any ethnicity and not necessarily ethnic Russians.  In case of Chinese to me it seems that word is more equivalent to "Rossiane", that is all citizens/inhabitants of China, while equivalent to "Ruskye" would probably be "Han": [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han\_Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese)  But I am no expert in China so take what I said with grain of salt.	1642238960.0	hsqwafr	t3_s4g8cx	t1_hsqv62o	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsqwafr/

The world has so far chosen to act without violence, but Russia has already invaded a democracy and if they do it again, they're forcing everyone's hand.  Having said that, there are plenty of politicians I want to see behind bars, US, Russian, Chinese, so on.

6f9s6	That really makes sense. So you have a loyalty to the stability he brought. That might be something unique to the Russian people... Probably because of the disaster you did go though.   Aussies have short memories. Which in politics I think is arguably a good thing. I don't think anyone deserves my loyalty politically.   You might be able to help me with this. From what I understand -following the fall of the USSR - all the state owned operations were given to all the Russian people. You know what's funny. This actually sounds amazing.

p7h2ze	In the West, they do not understand the terms, what is Russian. Comparison with the Germans is a good example. Imagine that Germany was divided into 3 parts: Swabia, Bavaria and the rest of Germany. And the peoples were called Schwabs, Bavarians and Germans. The Swabian and Bavarian dialects began to be filled with Anglicisms and Frenchisms, for example, so that they were more different from the common German language. After 100 years, a revolution takes place in Munich. Where crowds of American puppets in the squares shout anti-German slogans, call for a ban on the German literary language and demand that all schools and everything else be translated into Bavarian. And in northern Bavaria in Nuremberg, people do not support these slogans. They are holding referendums in northern Bavaria to join Germany (the capital is Berlin).    This roughly describes the situation of the division of the single Russian people into three different peoples: Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians. Even 100 years ago, it was a single Russian people, which was regionally divided into 3 groups:    \- Great Russians (now called Russians)    \- Little Russians (now called Ukrainians)    \- Belorussians    But in fact, all these groups still consider themselves Russians and speak the same literary Russian language. Majority.    Here, for example, is a map of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof Belarus, Little Russia and New Russia. (Kiev University, 2009).  [Map](https://ibb.co/ZB4Zchk)   You can see that in Little Russia and New Russia languages ‚Äã‚Äãand dialects by popularity:    1. Russian literary language.    2. Surzhik (a rural dialect of the Russian language with Polonisms).    3. Galician dialect or Western Ukrainian (this is essentially a mixture of Russian and Polish languages)    4. Poltava dialect or Ukrainian language (this is some Surzhik, on the basis of which the Ukrainian language was invented in Soviet times).    Until now, the majority speaks the Russian literary language, although it has been banned in various ways for 30 years. And the dialects appeared during the occupation of these lands by the Poles. The more the territory was under occupation (Galicia was not in Russia for 800 years), the more distant the dialect from the single Russian language. And the Surzhik of the central regions is about 80% Russian and 20% Polish. Only Kiev officials and TV presenters speak Ukrainian.	1642242814.0	hsr1d2r	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsr1d2r/

dw6kjdmn	Let's turn to the figures, exports from Russia in 2021, more than $ 470 billion, Gazprom exports more than $ 47 billion. Gazprom has sold about 200 billion rubles abroad. cubes of gas. Nord Stream 2 is capable of pumping 55 billion cubic meters maximum, but it will not be additional gas, but gas that will not go in other directions (Ukraine, Poland). If Gazprom supplies a lot more gas, the price will fall and Gazprom's profit will fall too. Nord Stream is needed first of all in order not to monopolistically depend on transit countries, and to agree with them on a favorable price. Then it has already been built, this is a positive fact, and already helps to negotiate transit more easily. The fact that it has not been launched yet allows us to keep gas prices high. The situation is similar to what if in Russia it was forbidden to buy new German Mercedes trucks, under far-fetched requirements, but it would become more and more expensive to buy passenger cars.. Not very pleasant, but not fatal..	1642246633.0	hsr6hma	t3_s430yt	t3_s430yt	/r/russia/comments/s430yt/is_nord_stream_2_important_for_russia_or_not/hsr6hma/

i9i8v7he	Government corruption and lack of economic reforms. It is well documented that one of the reasons Russia lags behind EU in economic growth is its arbitrary raiding of businesses ("Reiderstvo") which dis-incentivizes foreign and domestic investment and leads to brain drain and capital flight. Something like 70% of Russians fear doing business in Russia. That's not a good sign.  I neither like nor dislike Putin, I think he's done well especially on foreign policy but there is much more he can do to tackle the issue of corruption and perhaps a softer stance with Europe to encourage FDI and trade.  What Russia needs right now is a strongman nationalist (like Putin) on an anti-corruption rampage advocating for a balanced relationship with Europe (neither pro nor rabidly against, basically emphasizing economic integration over political squabbles much like what China is doing). Only a nationalist has any chance of winning the Russian populace and anti-corruption is the number 1 pressing issue at the moment.	1642247418.0	hsr7kn7	t3_s4ia0b	t3_s4ia0b	/r/russia/comments/s4ia0b/russians_what_do_you_think_is_the_biggest_problem/hsr7kn7/

Everyone else is a burden for those, who produce material goods, and must either service emotional needs or just be simply subsidized through some mechanism.  It is called "service economy", it is a symptom of excessive industrial efficiency (which is good) and is a source of unemployment (which is bad).  In Russia unemployment is countered through creating a huge number of inefficient and low-paid (naturally) jobs by government. It is a sort of "redistributive justice" which is unnatural and hindering for the capitalist economy.	1642247581.0	hsr7t00	t3_s4ia0b	t3_s4ia0b	/r/russia/comments/s4ia0b/russians_what_do_you_think_is_the_biggest_problem/hsr7t00/

6cg4g	>can anyone explain to me how wealth is distributed (so taxes predominantly) back into the country?  Simple enough: most taxes (but not all) are gathered into the federal coffers. Several federal subjects are self-sufficient (Moscow, Khanty-Mansiysk, Yamal; also often St. Petersburg and Tatarstan); the rest are subsidized from the federal budget. If there is fighting for the amount of subsidies (and there obviously should be), it's pretty much never made public. The system in which taxation from all regions is taken by the feds and then redistributed is aimed both at equalizing the wealth somewhat, particularly redistributing the wealth from resource extraction, and the federal center maintaining control over the regions.  >I'm curious about why there is a protective culture around him. Is it just because realistically you can't change anything?  No, silly, it's because his rule saw a vast improvement in quality of life for the vast majority of citizens. In late 1999/early 2000, when he came to power, not only was Russian economy still reeling after the default of 1998, with massive poverty and American humanitarian aid requested to prevent hunger, there was an ongoing civil war (with islamic terrorists holding maternity hospitals hostage), and regional currencies started to appear.   Pretty much every social well-being indicator, from GDP per capita (PPP) to average longevity, from average wage to morbidity from principal diseases (other than AIDS and tuberculosis), from average fertility to average ethanol consumed per capita, saw massive improvement under Putin. This is what maintains his lasting popularity.  Of course, moving from an absolute wreck in late 90ies to one of the great powers in the international arena, which was enabled by the resurgent economy, has also done little to diminish his standing with the general populace.	1642248271.0	hsr8rch	t3_s4d5o4	t3_s4d5o4	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsr8rch/

There‚Äôs a big issue with Russophobia in a lot of subs, and it can often go completely unchallenged. People have soaked up to decades and decades of propaganda about the ‚ÄúRussian Bear‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Menace‚Äù while also not being able to separate normal Russians from the worse actions of the government, as if you‚Äôre all personally directing policy...   Eastern Europeans also get a lot of hate, as can smaller communities like itinerant (or travelling) groups such as the Roma and Irish Travellers.  I‚Äôm a mod in one sub and make a point of shutting down that type of behaviour, as well as trying to foster a bit of solidarity.

6cg4g	Okay, there are a few things to unpack here.  First, Ukrainians and Russians are close enough culturally and genetically, plus have a significant share of intermarriage. This means that being "Russian" or "Ukrainian" is often a question of self-perception when answering population polls, so a child of two ethnically Ukrainian Russian citizens can easily have themselves listed as Russian in a Russian poll, and a child of two ethnically Russian Ukrainian citizens can easily have themselves listed as Ukrainian in an Ukrainian poll.  Second, the last data point available for [Donetsk](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8) and [Lugansk](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%9B%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%97_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%96#%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4) oblasts comes from 2001, but then ethnic Russians made up some 38% population of the former (to 56% Ukrainians) and 39% of the latter (to 58% Ukrainians). This means that the populations of the People's Republics are Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian and Russian ethnic descent.  Third, what the population of the Republics wants is quite a bit more nuanced than "joining Russia". Their original demands, when they followed the Western Ukraine's lead in capturing city administration, were essentially increased local autonomy: federalization of the country, veto right for their regions in the Parliament. Obviously, after these demands were answered not with appeasement, as was the case in the West, but with artillery fire on living quarters and ground attack plane runs on the captured administrative buildings, the share of those willing to live inside the Ukraine lowered, and the share of these who wanted to join Russia or become an independent nation grew. The following war, with the Ukraine using Nazi paramilitaries such as battalion Azov or battalion Tornado as punitive forces against civilians, did little to endear it to the locals further.	1642249670.0	hsras1e	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsras1e/

p7h2ze	No, the example of Germany fits perfectly. Not Switzerland and Austria. The Russians were in a single state, like Germany is now. But about 100 years ago they were artificially divided into 3 different peoples. At first it was within the USSR. And 30 years ago it became 3 different states.	1642250173.0	hsrbj5p	t3_s4g8cx	t1_hsr89h9	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsrbj5p/

6cg4g	> I asked a question to another bloke about the dissolution of the USSR and the splitting of the assets - and where did these oligarchs come from?  This was precisely where the superrich came from, yes (they aren't oligarchs, by definition, given Putin's autocratic rule). The transition to capitalism saw Russia call on Western aid for expertise, and that expertise was given in the form of Chicago school hucksters, whose mantra was "state ownership is to blame". So state-owned assets (and that was pretty much everything at the time) were sold for a trifle to the men who became oligarchs in Yeltzin's Russia, obviously, through barely legal means such as the loans for shares scheme.  >Also there was a video posted by a fella enlightening me on Putin's day to day involvement in issues which gets the backing of the people.  I don't think anyone who's superrich has been bankrupt because of corruption charges and that. Even those who did not get Putin's hint to remain out of politics, like Khodorkovsky, remain very wealthy people.   Putin's antics are mostly for show, I believe: to show that the czar is good even if the boyars are bad. As long as the rules set for the elites aren't broken, nothing serious happens to them.	1642250248.0	hsrbney	t3_s4d5o4	t1_hsr9scu	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsrbney/
glc3l365	In the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, Russians comprise a very significant minority in these regions with 38 and 39 percent of the population respectively. Now on to the republics, there is no demographical research that has been done yet that shows the share of Russians in the republics but I would assume the share of Russians in the republics is a bit higher than in the regions. Why? Mainly because the republics hold districts such as Krasnodon which have a Russian majority.   The Ukrainians that live in Donbass, Slobozhanshchina and Eastern Polissya are no different from Russsians.	1642250375.0	hsrbufk	t3_s4g8cx	t3_s4g8cx	/r/russia/comments/s4g8cx/are_the_donetsk_and_luhansk_peoples_republics/hsrbufk/

ms6e8	>Actually next question: in the long term; what do you think the state of affairs will be with that type of thing happening more and more? And. Are you seeing it more and more?  Yes. There is a struggle in the government between liberal-minded elites and 'patriotic' (for a lack of a better term) ones. By this I mean they have different paths for Russia in mind, globalist one and nationalist one. Liberals are still in control of the economic block. Among them are head of Central Bank of Russia, acting and former ministers of finances and ministers of economical development. Their actions are directed at keeping Russian economy as a resource export-based one. For example, they do not approve use of profits from oil and natural gas exports to stimulate economy. Because "it will raise inflation". They prefer to follow IMF advices and invest those money into foreign economy: [https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/28/imf-advises-russia-not-to-spend-its-national-welfare-fund-a65765](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/28/imf-advises-russia-not-to-spend-its-national-welfare-fund-a65765)   On the other side are Putin, Shoigu, Lavrov, PM Mishustin, first deputy PM Belousov, some others. As I understand, they're building a new iteration of planned economy. By planned economy I don't mean 'how much every factory should produce', but rather having a complex mathematical model of the economy and its inner dependencies, which would allow to predict bottlenecks (like energy crisis that is unfolding in Europe) and plan better for budget spending.   Globally, there is an ongoing struggle for a new world order between globalistic policy of USA + UK and nationalistic policy of Russia + China. I'm sure latter ones are the right bet.  >Do you still reside in Russia or have you moved?  I'm in Russia; just moved from Yekaterinburg to Saint Petersburg last year. I've spent several vacations in Europe during last decade, so I have something to compare life in Russia with.  I expect much more turbulence in geopolitics around 2024-2025, when there will be next presidential elections in Russia, then next presidential elections in the USA. I think there is a nonzero chance of the breakdown of the USA, and I think Russia is the safest haven to live through those years.	1642251143.0	hsrd35u	t3_s4d5o4	t1_hsravxl	/r/russia/comments/s4d5o4/russian_spread_of_wealth_questions_about/hsrd35u/

p7h2ze	You can ignore the official Kiev statistics. It does not reflect the real situation. Many things in these statistics are propaganda. Let's say. What is your native language? This refers to the language in which you constantly speak. But after 20-30 years of propaganda, residents of Russian cities (Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Nikolaev, Zaporozhye and even Donetsk and Lugansk until 2014) answered that "the Ukrainian language." But in reality, these people speak only literary Russian. And they don't know many from them Ukrainian at all. They only heard it on TV. Therefore, all the statistics there are distorted. What did the Americans from GALLUP do?   They saw the discrepancy between these statistics and reality. After all, they were in different cities, where people speak Russian, and statistics show other things. They came up with a trick to deceive these poor people who were being exposed to propaganda. They invited people to complete the survey in writing. There were different questions on different topics. But there were two forms to choose from: in Russian and in Ukrainian. What the trick. 83% of respondents chose the Russian form and only 17% chose the Ukrainian form. Here is the real situation! You will also see a similar picture in the language queries of different social networks. Also about 80-90% Russian language and 10-20% Ukrainian.

6cg4g	Yeah, it worked more or less like this with USSR, which had the option of escalating until the yanks were forced to the diplomacy table. Given that modern-day Russia is much weaker than even the Union (however less powerful than the US that it was), its options fall short, so the US essentially has free reign, limited only by its internal politics (and mutually assured destruction, to a small degree).	1642439337.0	ht24jm9	t3_s5picc	t1_ht13f1y	/r/russia/comments/s5picc/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_all_this_hypocrisy/ht24jm9/

hjtcpzel	Personally I wouldn't call him corrupted.  He is just a loser.  * Name at least someone fired over his anti-corruption investigations. There are so many claims and allegations against high-ranking officials. Don't you think there's a power struggle there? Yet Navalny achieved precisely nothing with his works despite all the views he gets on YouTube. Or was publicity his main goal?  * Name at least one of his anti-corruption investigations done from scratch. They are all repackaged content presented as if Navalny's team did them. For example, pretty much all the locals knew that the expensive plot of land with a bunch of buildings was Medevedev's residence. Yet Navalny's team simply omits the fact it's well-known among those who want to know about it. You can achieve a lot by not mentioning things. The same applies to the so called Putin's palace: the data is like a decade old.  * Even if Navalny's team comes up with an original claim that A leads to B which leads to C, they actually omit things again manipulating you into believing things that have never been said. They will present you with A and C, but not the interstaging B. Navalny would show you someone owns property, he would claim he knows who gifted it, but he does not explain why and how they would gift that property.  * There are typically easier explanations for everything. So called Putin's palace looks like an expensive hotel or a government residence ‚Äî you can even see the individual hotel suites. Why would so called Putin's palace have a hookah room anyway if the Grandpa does not smoke?  * Whenever evaluating anything, numbers are massively overinflated. This plot of land is worth 1 billion! Nobody would ever shell out that amount of money.  * Overall you are led to believe things that are not true. After watching the video on Putin's palace you may think they had access to the compound. They only show you the CGI.  * This is a philosophical question about the nature of monetary compensation and you have your right to disagree, but I don't understand the following. A CEO of a game development studio can make $100 million a year. Why can't a president or a prime minister of a whole country be compensated similarly? He is just a manager with a family, not a saint. Why can't Putin, Medvedev or whoever own an expensive residence? I propose the radical idea that government officials are allowed to live like all the normal people, too. Yet Navalny's investigations operate on the basis they aren't and they should live in poverty for some reason.  * The assassination attempt‚Ä¶ where do we begin. To whack a guy even abroad you need a person willing to spend 20 years in prison and an ice pick. Imagine how easy it can be when you are inside the country ‚Äî just make it happen like a car accident for example. Instead you are led to believe FSB would go with the usual ‚Äúpoison that works unreliably and doesn't seem to be able to kill anyone‚Äù plot. Can you name at least someone who was killed by Novichok by the way? The main sign of its usage is death.  * ‚ÄúWe arranged a phone call with a guy who attempted to murder me!‚Äù Except you are again carefully manipulated into believing the guy admitted things that he didn't say. He merely said internal services were closely monitoring their beloved opposition public figure to avoid, god forbid, anything bad happening to Navalny. That's right: FSB had a few guys closely watching and protecting him to avoid anything weird happening, and it was a thing for years. Why would they wait so long?  * Finally they got sick of his shit and put him behind bars. Over the years Navalny was allowed to walk free from so many things that would otherwise result in lengthy prison time. Navalny even was released from the country after the whole poisoning brouhaha to save his life (or at least it was presented as he urgently needed care in a German clinic) ‚Äî and I'm sure it was allowed to happen only with the Grandpa's approval. Yet it was another political stunt which was the last straw.  * His complaints in prison were hilarious. He was monitored (oh no, they came in the night and checked whether I was in my bed!), he was treated with care, there were public visits from journalists. Meanwhile, in the free and just democracy: Assange (a guy with actual investigations and not ‚Äúlook how lavishly your Putin lives‚Äù) suffered a stroke in prison over the extreme stress. Can you imagine how loud every Western media outlet would weep if something similar happened to a Russian guy who published some YouTube video about Medvedev's boat?  So you are dealing with a loser who achieved precisely nothing aside from PR stunts. And look where it led him: after only a year in prison nobody even remembers the guy.  It's pathetic.	1642439861.0	ht25wqb	t3_s648xd	t1_ht1gok5	/r/russia/comments/s648xd/a_year_after_arrest_navalny_says_no_regret_about/ht25wqb/

6cg4g	Serious answer: multiple reasons.  First, the US is working very hard to undermine MAD, in two chief directions: ballistic missile defense and first disarming and decapitating strike capabilities. There are multiple projects for both, and infrastructure for both moved ever closer to the Russian borders.  Second, the weapons of mass destruction aren't a panacea. You can't use nuclear blackmail to solve all your diplomatic and military issues, not by far.   Furthermore, there's a lot of escalation to cover between peacetime and an all-out nuclear war, including proxy conflicts, guerrilla wars and support for rebellions, attacks by expendable vassals' conventional forces, and limited long-range strikes.   Would Russia nukle the US if it arms and supports a Chechen rebellion? Would Russia nuke the US if it provides weapons, say, to Georgia or the Ukraine, and encourages their governments to attack Russia? Would Russia nuke the US if a number of American cruise missiles, say, destroy a hydroelectric dam somewhere in Russia? It's brinkmanship, of course, but it's reasonably safe, because no one wants to burn in nuclear fire, and mutually assured destruction is mutual for a reason.	1642440059.0	ht26flr	t3_s5picc	t1_ht11m8w	/r/russia/comments/s5picc/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_all_this_hypocrisy/ht26flr/

5xtagdr8	> The Baltics spent three hundred years in the Russian Empire, then saw Russian specialists sent there by the Soviet government after university graduation to help build their economies.  Was this by the choice of any of the Baltics? That inevitably determines the decisions made by a nation and their idea of what's ''fair''.  > because there have been Russian populations there since before such entities appeared on the map at all  I suppose I did generalize and historically the post soviet nations do differ in many ways, however, despite of the ''entities'' not existing on the map, the nations have been long established in the regions. In the same way Russian Federation is a successor of USSR and previously the Russian empire and you don't view yourself as a newly freshly formed country/nation. It's the reason these nations seek independence all together, they don't perceive themselves as Russian and Russians are not them.   > Denying ethnic minorities the right to speak their language, as well as representation in the elite, is absolutely abuse.  Changing road signs to another language is not really ''denying ethnic minorities the right to speak their language". Russian is very prominently spoken in post soviet states and no one is going to jail over it. Non-Russians are pretty much expected to speak it.  Couldn't say the same about the reverse situation that occurred in Russian Empire.   I can recognize that the change was overall not beneficial to Russians that have been living there a long time, but neither were the repeated occupations to other nations. There's still a whole lot of resentment over it in people's minds and the historical events cause turmoil in everyone's lives.  Regarding Finland and Sweden, that is more ancient history than last 30 years, I'd expect a lot to change in Europe over the next century if we were to avoid another war, which starts to seem less plausible but regardless. But I admit, I do not know about the Sweden's and Finland's common history that much and their relationship during Sweden's rule.  > Wow. Should the Welsh seek to assimilate and become English? Should the Scots?  This is looking at it entirely the other way around. Welsh are not English in the same way Estonians are not Russian. What happened with Welsh regarding England is perhaps similar to what would've happened to soviet states had they never been liberated and reestablished themselves. The Welsh and Scottish had their cultures watered down significantly.  > yes, but claiming that it's "ethnically uniform without persisting minorities" can only come from ignoring the very basic facts of reality on the ground.  I do admit I possibly don't know the reality of the situation. The speculation was that having small percentages of various minorities has an overall different influence than a larger uniform but culturally different minority spanning 15%-25% of the whole population.   > Sort of a weak reason there, this injustice should be fixed asap.  Absolutely. But on a more serious note, it isn't really about what the Germans or the English did or didn't do, it's about what the Welsh, Irish and Scottish would want.  > Finland and the Baltic states had never had an independent national statehood before 1917  The Finnish language, thus the Finnish nation, has been present and developing in their region for a really long time though. I think this is most of what shapes national identity and its relationship with its land.   The particular border disputes is a much more complex topic. It's much more straight forward to say that the Polish, for example, are historically based in Eastern/Central Europe rather than, you know, South America or something, than to argue which particular areas in Europe should belong to them.  > Would it be the right thing to do to grant any regional identity national statehood, and see the dozens or hundreds of wars start between them as they fight over interlapping settlement areas?  I think this is one of the things that time itself resolves and people stop caring. Of course there are no need for new conflicts if people themselves feel no clashing differences and are satisfied. And it is true that dissatisfaction and disputes can be aroused in people with organized methods, however the success of that declines as time passes and long standing friendly relationships develop.  > or Estonians or Latvians in a Russian state should have had their culture and language protected and preserved (as they were), but Russians in Estonian or Latvian state are "foreigners who should aim to assimilate"?  This is curious as we might be exposed to different sources regarding those periods of history. The efforts of Russification and instances of press ban even are highly accented.	1642596517.0	htb82db	t3_s5mkoc	t1_ht9e42c	/r/russia/comments/s5mkoc/whats_the_media_coverage_of_the_ongoing_situation/htb82db/

9yi4f982	My advice would be to firstly look for any Facebook or VK pages for foreigners living there if you want an immediate network and secondly to put yourself out there by going to bars and cafes etc and just trying to socialise. It will be hard with a limited amount of Russian, but if you know English to an adequate level you will definitely find locals who want to speak in English and practice. As for the bureaucracy, all I can advise is to familiarise yourself with basic principles of legal process etc and see if you can find a native speaker who would be able to translate for you - unfortunately this will be a little harder than in a city like Moscow or Peter but Yekaterinburg is still big enough to have native or advanced English speakers.

I am aware of media baloney - and I know that for a fact - I used to live in Eastern Ukraine, have many friends there. LNR and DNR separatists are supported by Russia - sure.   But separatist forces are mostly locals plus some russian volunteers with combat experience.   >They're already involved.  Who are *they*? I am russian and I am not involved. No regular units of russian army are involved either.   >The question is will it remain like Vietnam, or will it escalate into Afganistan.

p7h2ze	There is a very interesting marker in politics that the Russians have understood. If the West loves a Russian (Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Navalny...) then this is a traitor to Russia. And such a person brings enormous damage to Russia and the Russian people if he gets power here. And vice versa. If the West hates a Russian (Ivan Grozny\*, Stalin, Putin...), then this is a Russian patriot who has done a lot of good for Russia and the Russian people.    \*Ivan Grozny is not really Ivan the Terrible. The mistranslation is part of the demonization myth.    Therefore, when you now notice how Putin is being demonized, without even knowing the truth, you can appreciate how Ivan Grozny and Stalin were demonized in the West.	1642605478.0	htbrgsz	t3_s7rqwj	t3_s7rqwj	/r/russia/comments/s7rqwj/what_the_heck_should_be_this_this_is_another/htbrgsz/

nlfofey	Are we talking about recent events?    The Russian military conducted military exercises after another escalation of the situation and violation of the truce in the Donbass (in late autumn), after which NATO announced that Russian troops were on the borders of Ukraine and were planning to invade Ukraine right now, while Belarus was distracting attention with the situation with refugees on the border with Poland, then they announced that Russia would attack in January-February, then they announced that they planned to attack on Christmas Eve, now they are again talking about the end of January. With the exception of Crimea, Russian military camps stand hundreds of kilometers from the borders of Ukraine, one near Smolensk (200km to the borders of Ukraine), one near Voronezh (300km), there may be some smaller camps, but these are the main ones, as far as I know, and even the NYTimes refers to them. When the media talks about "troops on the border", people probably imagine how the troops are already almost breaking through the border posts and invading Ukraine, while in reality the Russian troops are closer to Belarus and Moscow than to Ukraine or Kiev.        When the invasion does not happen, the media will most likely tell how Putin got scared, or how Putin bluffed and blackmailed NATO, but NATO bravely stood up for Ukraine and did not succumb to Putin's threats, something like that, but the damage to the economy has already been done simply by threats of new sanctions , and then they will impose new sanctions for "Putin's threats" and the economy will suffer even more. At the moment, this is their main idea, to harm the Russian economy as much as possible, because they believe that when the savings of ordinary Russian citizens (and first of all Russian oligarchs) will take a hit, the Russian people will rise up against Putin or the economy will collapse and Russia will fall apart into smaller countries.	1642605991.0	htbspxl	t3_s7faju	t1_htbjt8j	/r/russia/comments/s7faju/does_putin_want_to_integrate_ukraine_and_belarus/htbspxl/

6cg4g	> Was this by the choice of any of the Baltics? That inevitably determines the decisions made by a nation and their idea of what's ''fair''.  Again: three hundred years before these entities appeared on the map.  >the nations have been long established in the regions. In the same way Russian Federation is a successor of USSR and previously the Russian empire  Not at all. The Russian Empire was a state, so was the USSR, and so is the Russian Federation. They inherited each others' international treaties, established embassies, etcetera. The Baltics were drawn arbitrarily on the map by an occupying power: there is no objective reason why Latvians in particular should get national statehood, but say Latgalians or Livs shouldn't.  >It's the reason these nations seek independence all together, they don't perceive themselves as Russian   Neither do Tatars or Chuvash or or or or, so? Similarly, Pskovians or Novgorodians did not share an ethnic identity with the Muscovites in the XIV century; similarly, again, Gasconians or Burgundians did not share one with the Parisans, or Bavarians with Prussians.  >Changing road signs to another language is not really ''denying ethnic minorities the right to speak their language".  It is simply creeping derussification in a country where some 80+% speak Russian as their native tongue. A state-sanctioned effort to make Russians (or their children) less Russian and more Belorussian. Same as in the Ukraine (see below)  >Russian is very prominently spoken in post soviet states and no one is going to jail over it.  Haha, nope. The Ukraine has introduced a law some time ago that not just bans importing or printing literature in Russian, but mandates a certain share of broadcasting time (75% if memory serves) to be in Ukrainian, and service by any commercials companies be offered exclusively in Ukrainian. And yes, there are already some three thousand reports for breaking that law, because throughout the Eastern and to a large degree Central Ukraine the language everyone talks in the streets is Russian.  >Couldn't say the same about the reverse situation that occurred in Russian Empire.  The Russian Empire had a single official language, but that changed in the USSR, once again I remind you.  >I can recognize that the change was overall not beneficial to Russians that have been living there a long time, but neither were the repeated occupations to other nations.  If you mean "being a part of the Russian state" by "repeated occupations", then they were beneficial, objectively, as the aforementioned Ukraine still surviving on remains of the Soviet industry left over when the Union fell atests.  >This is looking at it entirely the other way around. Welsh are not English in the same way Estonians are not Russian.  So Welsh are "foreigners" who by your own claim above should "seek to assimilate". Same as Estonians were in the Russian Empire and the USSR.  >The speculation was that having small percentages of various minorities has an overall different influence than a larger uniform but culturally different minority spanning 15%-25% of the whole population.  And what would that difference be? The minorities in Russia form 25+% share of the population in their national republics; in some of them, up to roughly 85%. So?  >But on a more serious note, it isn't really about what the Germans or the English did or didn't do, it's about what the Welsh, Irish and Scottish would want.  The German occupying forces did not run a plebiscite in the Baltics. Neither did the White Finns when they slaughtered the Reds. Install a puppet government in St. Petersburg today, pump it with money, allow it free reign to do as they please with dissenters, pour media propaganda onto the population through local and international media, and in a couple dozen years to maybe half a century you'll have some Ingermanlandians claiming a separate identity from the rest of the Russian stock. If you want a real precedent of the process at work, check out Hongkongers. Ask the Scots if they want independence before and after Brexit (e.g. within a handful of years), and you might receive notably different results. Etc.  >The Finnish language, thus the Finnish nation, has been present and developing in their region for a really long time though. I think this is most of what shapes national identity and its relationship with its land.  Except it doesn't work this way. There have always been Finno-Ugoric tribes living from Scandinavia to the Urals; their languages are not discrete and different but a spectrum of dialects diverging over time. Take, for instance, Karelians: the Finns consider their Finnish Karelians a subset of Finns; in Russia, they have a national Republic of Karelia.  Do they have "an established national identity and a relationship with their land"? Had the Germans won WWII, Karelia would've become a part of Finland, and thus Karelians on this side of the border too a subset of Finns. Is that to mean that Russia is "repeatedly occupying" Karelia? Or that fighting back the Finnish Army back out of it during WWII was "a Russian invasion"?  >I think this is one of the things that time itself resolves and people stop caring.  People did not care in the Soviet Union until its economic system started to fail, given rise to local ethnic nationalisms. As noted above, ethnic and national identities are flexible like this. History demonstrates time and time again (see: creation of Russia by Moscow principality, creation of Germany, creation of the US, creation of the EU) that large state entities are the most viable and the most stable; as long as every ethnicity's rights are ensured, this is the obvious main way for humanity's development.  >The efforts of Russification and instances of press ban even are highly accented.  Third time around: state language, korenization, no official positions without knowing the language.	1642608114.0	htby3ql	t3_s5mkoc	t1_htb82db	/r/russia/comments/s5mkoc/whats_the_media_coverage_of_the_ongoing_situation/htby3ql/

And did i mention he famously wrote of how he had "[never been able to dislike Hitler](https://twitter.com/SarahTheHaider/status/1300360063845126144?s=20)"?   And to top it all of... he was just kind of a shitty writer. His writings were quickly co-opted by the US government, of course, and as such easily driven to high fame, but his books are kind of shit! I've read them and stand with Isaac Asimov in regards to how just not really all that good at all his writing is. [Here's Asimov's review of 1984](http://www.newworker.org/ncptrory/1984.htm) where he talks of it.  George Orwell was kind of a really, really bad person. Like, awfully bad, i didn't even get into his military service for the british empire where he was extremely racist against their subjects and hunted elephants!

"Protection", my ass.  One has to be dumb as a brick to trust NATO or any other organization completely controlled by USA or GB considering all the known facts and deeds of NATO and it's leading members.  But there is more: some of the NATO officials have the nerve to demand Russia to move it's own military forces away from it's own border.    It's as if they didn't know that Russia has it's own interests including maintaining it's own safety. Which does not allow the presence of enemy infrastructure capable of causing irreparable damage in the event of an attack by NATO countries right near it's borders.     But there is another option: russian nukes return to Cuba + few more South American countries.     Sounds totally safe for me.

5xtagdr8	> Again: three hundred years before these entities appeared on the map.  This makes me wonder what is your take regarding the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or Polish-Lithuanian common wealth. Perhaps Latvians and Estonians are a somewhat different case but I'd be surprised if Lithuanians viewed themselves as suddenly appearing on the map in the 20th century. They had a king crowned in the 13th century.  >  there is no objective reason why Latvians in particular should get national statehood, but say Latgalians or Livs shouldn't.  And why aren't they demanding statehood? Because they mostly assimilated to comprise current Latvians. There's no one left to desire statehood. To avoid similar fate nations try to establish themselves culturally. It's a strategical move that I doubt would be viewed negatively if there wasn't present multiculturalism due to previous historical events. Consider Japan and their fairly xenophobic policies. Rich culturally though. They never seem to receive the same extent of criticism that many western states do when it comes to this.  Assimilation and watering down of culture does happen to some nations and they slowly vanish and merge with others, globalism is now causing western culture to seep into nations and that's a whole separate issue, if one perceives it as an issue all together.  This makes me wonder, would you not mind to see Russia getting extensively westernized?   > It is simply creeping derussification in a country where some 80+% speak Russian as their native tongue.  I think this aspect is often taken within the context of USSR. Within USSR most learnt to speak Russian as that's just how it was. Of course 30 years later a lot of people still continue to know the language cause things don't change that quickly, but it's not viewed any more as a language that those who aren't ethnically Russian should have to use.   It is true though that an opposing effect is now happening everywhere with English where it's becoming sort of a second language and people are expected to speak it. But it's more of a natural shift which often receives less opposition.  > The Ukraine has introduced a law some time ago that not just bans importing or printing literature in Russian  Didn't know that, so fair enough. That is indeed excessive.  > So Welsh are "foreigners" who by your own claim above should "seek to assimilate". Same as Estonians were in the Russian Empire and the USSR.  That's spinning it around a bit. There is a distinction between people choosing to live in the lands predominantly inhabited by a different nation rather than their own and a whole nation being occupied by another power.   Surely you must be able to see that the situation of Russians in current day post soviet states doesn't quite compare. It is true that they didn't move there with intention to leave Russia. But Russia is still there.  It's perhaps a bit more like the English moving to Scotland and then Scotland becoming independent from United Kingdom. It would be inconvenient for the English, but England is still there, it's just separate from Scotland.  > People did not care in the Soviet Union until its economic system started to fail, given rise to local ethnic nationalisms.  That probably varies on sources one is exposed to. There are always groups that are nostalgic of the old regime but from what I've read and heard of people's memoirs of life under the regime, economic failure was far from the only problem or source of dissatisfaction.  > that large state entities are the most viable and the most stable; as long as every ethnicity's rights are ensured, this is the obvious main way for humanity's development.  That I can agree with. However it seems that in itself requires substantial cultural similarity. Even minor social issues such as liberal migration policies and recognition of same sex marriage are causing disagreements among EU nations.  These responses are getting excessively long, I'm sure I missed some points. Some I might not even have sufficient knowledge to express an opinion on.	1642618690.0	htcqffu	t3_s5mkoc	t1_htby3ql	/r/russia/comments/s5mkoc/whats_the_media_coverage_of_the_ongoing_situation/htcqffu/

4b7rn1xk	Every single year since 2014, Russia has moved troops near their Western border (Ukraines Eastern) and does yearly training. Yes, tbh it‚Äôs a bit of a provocation, and Russia swinging their dick around, but they are literally doing testing and training within their own borders, and definitely not ‚Äúinvading‚Äù anywhere.   Also, as far as the 150,000 soldiers, even if that number were to be true (which is most likely inflated), who would Russia only send ~15% of their *active* troops, let alone take move out of reserve? Does it not seem to be a small effort on Russia‚Äôs part if they really do plan to invade?	1642619081.0	htcrhs0	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htcqwgm	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htcrhs0/

Yes, there's a lot of fear mongering going on in the media, and there's probably some incentive to join NATO involved, but it all doesn't come down to "the Swedes are paranoid". Russia has antagonized Sweden a lot. Your country even simulated a nuclear attack on our capital. And with your track record of invading surrounding countries, annexing sovereign nations territories etc, stationing some troops on Gotland and considering joining NATO for protection is not exactly a completely unfounded course of action.	1642619581.0	htcstw4	t3_s2y809	t1_hshj5z8	/r/russia/comments/s2y809/help_an_ignorant_swede_understand_the_russian/htcstw4/

1nxg52ul	Russia have 400,000 troops in the Southern Military District alone on the permanent basis if I recall correctly. When I saw reports in the US media about Russia amassing 100,000 troops on Ukrainian border, I begun laughing, because that would have to mean that Russia have basically withdrawn 300,000 troops from there.  Yes, full scale inversion of Ukraine would require some preparation, but I have no doubt that Russians would try to hide it and given "competence" Western intelligence services have shown in the past, I guess they will likely succeed. Besides, it does not have to be all out invasion. There are plenty of people in the Ukraine itself that are willing to side with Russia if given some support. I mean there are two breakaway republics armed to the teeth that rely on Russian support for years.  &#x200B;  >Western Media. Propaganda? Is most of the Russian media not controlled and censored by the state?  Yes they are. But propaganda is not limited to state media and all media are controlled and censored by somebody. At last with state media public have certain control over them.	1642621840.0	htcyx3j	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htcwxfc	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htcyx3j/

yqhvm	Well, picture 9 is from one of Jason Bourne films, that I know for sure. 13 is from K-19, a film from 2002. It's actually not the worst film depicting USSR though, and is quite well made, my regiment's political officer actually put it on for us while I was serving.   It's not necessarily about the *state* being villains. It's just *Russians* in any way that they might appear.

yqhvm	This idea fails when you consider how modern warfare works. Russia has already utilised missiles that go from ships in the Caspian Sea all the way to Syria. Conventional forces are no longer limited to their immediate area of operations.    That, plus nuclear weapons (including supersonic cruise missiles with nuclear payloads) guarantee Russia's safety from a potential invasion much better than any buffer zone would. Especially when establishing such a zone costs so much in both direct investments and in the reprisals that hurt the economy.	1642624830.0	htd6zyq	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htd3bls	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/htd6zyq/

2rzwuerl	I'm doubtful. These ships have a specific role: to arrange landing on a contested or hostile beach.  Delivering large equipment to Cuba would be more efficient using cargo ships, which can dock and unload in ports with remarable efficiency.  Due to distance, people and small equipment would benefit from air delivery. Nobody wants to slowly steam across the Atlantic when they can arrive in hours via airplane.	1642625009.0	htd7hne	t3_s7vobn	t1_htcdxij	/r/russia/comments/s7vobn/six_russian_landing_ships_sail_past_britain/htd7hne/

f6avfqpv	The other day I listened to a webinar about from the Iranian American Institute about cultural stereotypes of Iranians in American media. There was a consensus that there were essentially three archetype-depictions of Iranians in American media:  * The Bazaari carpet-merchant * The fanatical terrorist * The decadent sex/drugs/rock and roll Persian millionaire  It is my view that there are plenty of stereotypes of Russians in American media as well. I note the following ones:  * The barbaric Russian military brute (e.g. Ivan Drago from Rocky) * The honeypot Russian spy who uses her sexuality to extract state secrets from American men * The funny-hat wearing Russian * The pathetic, unemployable alcoholic Russian man * The backwards, babushka-clad Russian grandma * The Russian ballet dancer * The vaguely Asiatic Russian mystic (admittedly this kind of died off with Rasputin) * The female Russian prostitute (this one is related to the honeypot spy) * The joyless Russian mafia member * The communist intellectual  In the view of the Americans, all Russians are merely a composite of these basic characteristics.	1642625084.0	htd7oup	t3_s7pryw	t3_s7pryw	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htd7oup/

My observation from my last visit is that it's full of South Korean girls who want to go do Europe but don't have the time and money so Vladivostok is their substitute 'European' city to take endless selfies with those selfie sticks walking around all day.

At the start of the war, the USSR had 3.2 million soldiers in the border areas, while the Axis invasion force numbered 4.3 million. At the most critical moment, during the Battle for Moscow, the capital of the USSR was defended by only 1.25 million soldiers who defended themselves from 1.9 million Nazis, moreover, with a twofold advantage of the Nazis in tanks, planes and artillery. The Soviet troops began the Battle of Stalingrad with only 386,000 soldiers on the front line, when the Nazi side numbered 430,000. When the Battle for Stalingrad was coming to an end, the Soviet troops reached a strength of about 1.1 million, when the Nazis were about a million. The USSR had no numerical advantage almost anywhere before the Battle of Kursk, but as soon as the USSR managed to achieve at least an equivalent number of troops, the Nazis were continuously defeated until the very end of the war.	1642628433.0	htdgy93	t3_s7pryw	t1_htbtpzj	/r/russia/comments/s7pryw/typical_american_cinema_about_russia_and_russians/htdgy93/

Sorry to say, most Americans don't know, and don't care to see the truth.  There's even cases when Americans would tell off folks who experienced Chernobyl's tragedy directly, government or civilian, and claim they were wrong about their own life experiences because the show told them so.

In reality though, who knows? Putin is generally good at the game, but even a grandmaster can lose sometimes.   Personally, I think both sides need to chill the fuck out and leave each other in peace. The West won‚Äôt because of their giant ego and belief that their way is the only right way. Russia won‚Äôt because it means the West encroaches on its sphere of influence. It would behoove both sides to stand down, leave Ukraine as a buffer and establish individual trade agreements.

Nominal GDP implies that were the Ruble to ever achieve parity with the greenback, it would dwarf both the US and Chinese economy, which is stupid.     Purchasing Power Parity is much more useful. Imagine accounting for exchange rates and factoring in how much a single unit of currency actually buys, but that would be a useful metric.	1642636550.0	hte190r	t3_s7t4yu	t1_htdwgml	/r/russia/comments/s7t4yu/the_most_accurate_description_of_the_endless/hte190r/

A lot of high ranking Soviet officials wrote that Andropov would have been able to implement the needed reforms and hold the country together which is interesting to think about.

4b7rn1xk	If the RF was going to invade, they‚Äôd do it away from media attention. Notice how both the Georgian conflict, and Crimea both caught the media off guard?   They were playing catch-up to report past events. When the media is constantly going on and on, It‚Äôs manufactured hype for views/click. I highly doubt Russia will actually invade under the current circumstances. Russia literally cannot afford a war right now.   Russia has also built up troops along their western border every year since 2015. Its ‚Äúyearly training‚Äù, which is obviously intended to be ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù without a doubt. But it‚Äôs not as if there is an ongoing invasion? They‚Äôre just at the border, and honestly more like ~400Km from the border.   Essentially:  Russia won‚Äôt invade currently, and especially not while media attention is at its peak. They always catch the media off guard it seems (Crimea and Georgian conflict). This isn‚Äôt a new move on the behalf of the RF, it happens yearly.	1642696533.0	hth5qmc	t3_s8c7jl	t1_htgol2q	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/hth5qmc/

ib6p23ku	If it does, it probably won't happen for a while though.  The decline of the Roman Empire is said to have spanned from the reign of Commodus (AD 192) to approximately AD 476, but this was at a time when sufficient numbers of people with pitchforks could effectively topple a local governor.  With modern technology, it's a lot more difficult.  Perhaps America is on its decline, but even if they split, I would hardly see any of the successors sinking any lower than say the French or Spanish empires to what France and Spain are today.  France and Spain are still relatively wealthy compared to other countries.  It's just that they aren't globally prominent.  You might have at worst something like Yugoslavia and perhaps they'd lose Hawaii or some Pacific Islands, but I don't see anything going further than that.	1642698258.0	hthah7a	t3_s8gfyk	t1_hth6df2	/r/russia/comments/s8gfyk/western_liberals_be_like/hthah7a/

31jlerr8	This has already happened to me personally. I read the European news in 2014, which claimed that Putin had staged the coup in Kiev to steal Crimea. And my reaction was, "What? Take away the Crimea? What nonsense!". To be fair, the coup was also clearly initiated by someone else. But the situation with Crimea seemed to me at the time to be a fantasy of the Western media.  If Russia really goes to war with Ukraine I will be very disappointed. But honestly I don't believe it will happen in the next few weeks at least simply because the equipment will get stuck in the mud halfway through, and no one ever plans attacks that will immediately fail. Mid to late February is clearly a better time. And somehow it doesn't fit with the hysteria in the Western media today.	1642700888.0	hthhswz	t3_s8c7jl	t1_htflfnu	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/hthhswz/

Travelers who arrive in Russia without an entry visa will not be permitted to enter the country, and face immediate return to the point of embarkation at their own expense.  Russian Embassy..  In my regard the average person seeking travel in the US can not just go to Russia and see it for what it is unless like I said under specific circumstances such as a visa..

Hence most Americans/Russians don‚Äôt know shit about either place because they‚Äôve never been there.	1642702988.0	hthnkww	t3_s8kvnx	t1_hthmg2t	/r/russia/comments/s8kvnx/just_to_let_you_know_not_all_westerners_are/hthnkww/

dswwqlco	Honestly, it shocks me that Russia keeps letting America "impose sanctions" like America has all the power in the world. Refuse to export Vodka for a little bit and watch how fast America starts throwing a tantrum depending it's leader play nice with Russia. Honestly, I'm an American and I admit that we have lost control of our government (especially after they shot down the voting rights bill). The world needs to come together and save America from its government. We don't want the empire (we want our problems here at home fixed) and our leaders just keep empire building and sending us to die in foreign lands.	1642703203.0	htho6a6	t3_s8c7jl	t1_htfg6vg	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/htho6a6/

fd7ey	The same applies to British people. We need a visa to enter the Russian Federation. An invitation is required, but this can be purchased online if you provide a hotel confirmation. Once in Russia, we have to register, but often this is a service the hotel provides.   I've always known this and perhaps this is why I consider it normal. The same requirements are necessary for Russians to visit the UK.  I do accept that traveling to Russia is more complicated than other countries and financially challenging since visas aren't free. I assumed this is what prevented a lot of people from traveling.	1642703491.0	hthoyzn	t3_s8kvnx	t1_hthnkww	/r/russia/comments/s8kvnx/just_to_let_you_know_not_all_westerners_are/hthoyzn/

7e23owtf	It‚Äôs simple, in the USSR you couldn‚Äôt take the money out of the country. With the fall of communism Russia opened up and the currency has been leaving Russia for 30 years. There are several avenues for this, whether thats because foreign products dominated the domestic market because of perceived quality and ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù, so Russian industry had to shutdown because there was no market for their products, or because people who came in to possession of profitable corporations got wealthy selling mostly natural resources, and instead of keeping money in the communities they would just move to some subtropical region of the globe and spend the bulk of their money there. Now with sanctions some of these avenues have been cut, or hindered. Now some foreign products have been eliminated from the market completely and thus has given domestic producers and empty playing field, these new businessmen now can‚Äôt leave due to the precarious international situation and are forced to keep their money circulating in Russia. This is basically the same thing trump wanted to achieve in the US with the trade war. Of course this is a double bladed approach but I believe it‚Äôs currently keeping Russia a bit more insulated against foreign economic troubles but can cause domestic producers to become complacent and the quality will suffer and that when someday trade will open up again the same process of leaking currency will begin again.	1642704696.0	hthsarp	t3_s8jbpd	t1_hthldi6	/r/russia/comments/s8jbpd/from_january_1_2022_the_export_of_unprocessed_or/hthsarp/

He was seriously wounded in 1944 and relegated to kitchen duty; still got a medal for delivering hot food to the tankers in a deep breakthrough.  The other was sent on a business trip to Belorussia in June 1941, only to find German motorcyclists entering the railway station as he arrived. He jumped on the last train to the East and went to enlist the moment he was back in Moscow. Served in horse recon, got several wounds and a serious concussion at the crossing of Dnepr (his horse knelt and waited until he regained his senses when he lost consciousness and had his neck caught in the reigns) and was moved to serve as a teacher in the Vystrel course.	1642705063.0	hthtay4	t3_s8ds5i	t3_s8ds5i	/r/russia/comments/s8ds5i/how_did_your_family_contribute_to_victory_in_the/hthtay4/

p7h2ze	Especially for you, I will draw an analogy to make it very clear. Swabia=Belorussia, Bavaria=Ukraine, the rest of Germany=Russia. That is, it is a single people, with small regional differences. In 1991, Germany falls apart. Swabia and Bavaria become independent states. Bavarian nationalists seize power in Bavaria. They are gradually squeezing out a single German literary language. The Bavarian dialect is declared the sole official language. Rewriting history. The main motive is that the Bavarians are the right Germans. And the North Germans are a mixture of different peoples. Half German. Then in 2014 in Munich, the Americans and the British stage a Maidan, where an even more radical Nazi power comes. They generally forbid the German language even in cafes and shops. Translated all German schools and universities into Bavarian. During these 30 years, the Bavarian language itself has been artificially moving as far as possible from the unified German language by adding hundreds of new words, borrowings from the English language.    But northern Bavaria refuses to submit to the new Nazis in Munich. They take power in Nuremberg into their own hands. They say they are all Germans. They want to teach their children in their native German language. And not to divide the German people into different parts. Munich sends troops north and starts bombing Nuremberg and other cities. Northern Germany helps them with weapons and humanitarian aid. But she herself does not interfere in the conflict. Is it clearer now?	1642707301.0	hthz9z9	t3_s8en9z	t3_s8en9z	/r/russia/comments/s8en9z/what_is_the_russian_perspective_on_the_ukraine/hthz9z9/

4rgna	Not really an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù per se. Russia already had military control of Crimea, thanks to an early 90s agreement with Ukraine. Not a single person died during the takeover, which was mandated by numerous referendums by the Crimean people who never really felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù in Ukraine, and really had enough of Ukrainian rule after the illegal Maidan putsch. There might have been some minor incursions into Donbas, but even that‚Äôs disputable. So, this supposed ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù was mostly a myth spread by the post-Maidan Ukrainian regime and its Western handlers.	1642708517.0	hti2mi4	t3_s8c7jl	t1_hthldjm	/r/russia/comments/s8c7jl/excuse_me/hti2mi4/

f6avfqpv	>And Mitch mcconnel, joe Biden, Liz Cheney, most neoliberal democrats,  most neocon republicans  This is true. I think Hillary Clinton played a key part in getting most Democrats onboard the anti-Russia train. I remember when Mitt Romney ran against Obama IN 2012, Romney said "Russia is our top geopolitical enemy" (this was before anti-China hysteria also swept the nation following Trump and COVID). Romney was mocked as an out of touch old man who was stuck in the past when he made these remarks.   But after Hillary Clinton blamed her loss to the fat, idiotic Trump on a nefarious Kremlin plot rather than her inability to relate to working class voters and the limited appeal of her ultra-Type A personality, she managed to get most of the Democratic establishment to move towards Romney's position. It also helped that Romney became the face of anti-Trumpism within the Republican Party, which endeared him to Democrats.   Either way, Russophobia that was derided as a paranoid vestige of the Cold War by mainstream liberals not long ago has come back into fashion.   >even video game developers(Russians the only enemy ever)  I remember one of the first video games I played as a kid in the late 1990s was *Metal Gear Solid*. It was about a terrorist/mafia cell of Russians who infiltrate a military base to steal a nuclear weapon. For some reason even though the main bad guy had a British accent, all the normal enemies were Russian.   The only Hollywood movie I can recall that showed a positive portrayal of Russians was *Enemy at the Gates.* Even pieces of crap like the Angelina Jolie movie *Salt* (set when Russian-American relations were still relatively good) used the old stock character of the sexualized Russian female spy, who is revealed to be a Russian agent when the audience sees her (you guessed it) wearing a giant coassack hat.   Russian men are always depicted as stupid, joyless brutes (usually outsmarted by the American hero and also probably as alcoholics) and Russian women are always depicted as either rural babushka grandmas or spies or prostitutes. It's absurd.	1642708949.0	hti3sdi	t3_s8k5po	t1_hti0k4m	/r/russia/comments/s8k5po/years_ago_the_simpsons_poked_fun_about/hti3sdi/

It's almost as if the govt realized that the market didn't fully correct after 08 and decided to tighten their belts (leading to their decision not to support the ruble during sanctions) in order to get govt accounts in order in case of a recession.

1645m7	I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs would be fair to mention Caucasian accents since people from that region are typically non native speakers, they do learn Russian early, but they speak other languages at home and that‚Äôs what impacts the way they speak.  I believe OP is asking about native speakers and among them,  the language is pretty universal and most of the times we can‚Äôt say the difference, however if you  really pay attention and analyze you can spot subtle nuances; they are more obvious if a person is from a small town or a village. People from Ukraine or close to Ukrainian border often pronounce ‚Äúg‚Äù very softly and it sounds sort of like ‚Äúh‚Äù or ‚Äúhg‚ÄùAlso there are many words in Russian where it‚Äôs hard to say whether the word is spelled with an ‚Äúa‚Äù or an ‚Äúo‚Äù because we pronounce a sound that is kind of in between ( little kids have a hard time learning those in school) . For example, ‚Äúmilk‚Äù - Moloko. People from Moscow region tend to overpronounse ‚Äúa‚Äù in those words - ‚ÄúMalako‚Äù, while people from the north of the country - overpronounce ‚Äúo‚Äù.

f6avfqpv	What do *I* personally think of China? It's a major world power that has narrow territorial disputes with neighboring state, which can all be resolved fairly easily through negotiation. It's also a country that is far from perfect, in my view, but which has amazingly lifted 1/7th of the world's population out of poverty in rapid fashion. And I think that China is understandably suspicious of America's geopolitical motives and fears that it might be next on the hit list. Above all, it's a country that I think we absolutely have to cooperate with in order to address climate change.   What does the American *government* think of China? The one thing Democrats and Republicans seem to be able to agree upon is that China is an evil, revisionist power that wants to spread un-freedom and authoritarianism all over the world, and that Taiwan isn't part of China. Neither party wants to get painted as "weak on China" by the opposition.   What do Americans *in general* think of China? Well, a lot of them have no gripe with Chinese people but blame the Chinese government for COVID, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and so forth. Most Americans also won't accept the idea of China displacing the United States as the world's dominant Super Power, and they tend to think that China is an aggressive, revisionist bully in geopolitics.	1642716878.0	htio8lp	t3_s8rujo	t1_htimgbf	/r/russia/comments/s8rujo/this_cartoon_was_recently_featured_in_a_prominent/htio8lp/

2t068aaa	I fully agree with the title of this post. I have never really considered Russia as an enemy country or as threat (I grew up in communist town, so even during the cold war I never had all the propaganda about the evil Russian), and I don't really realize why we are not a lot closer. I currently learn Russian, I am an old guy, I don't do it because I hope to earn money with my knowledge and not because I think of moving to Russia (I am too old to emigrate anywhere), but because I love the language and the culture. I see a lot of Russian people on youtube while learning and I certainly cannot start to see them as my enemies.   I really don't understand this desire to install OTAN bases as close as possible to Russia but I can imagine how the US would react if overnight Canada or Mexico decided to become friend with Russia and host Russian bases at the border with the US. They would certainly not take it with a big smile. Provoking Russia is a very bad idea and I really don't understand why it is done (maybe to distract the voters from the real problems that would actually need fixing) In my opinion, Europe should treat Russia as a friendly country we would all benefice from that.	1642718000.0	htiptx2	t3_s8kvnx	t3_s8kvnx	/r/russia/comments/s8kvnx/just_to_let_you_know_not_all_westerners_are/htiptx2/

nyr4w	One of the problems with the Russian economy is that it is mainly dependent on raw exports: oil, gas, coal, minerals, wood. Processing them and selling finished products rather than raw resources would be beneficial to the economy, but that requires actual effort. Selling raw oil or gas right now is much easier and brings in quick money ‚Äî enough for certain people to get rich, so they don't see much incentive in trying to create processing facilities. The government, unfortunately, mostly seems to agree and doesn't make enough effort to push the economy towards higher degree of product processing. This here seems like a step in the right direction. However, it would be even better if there were proper conditions to stimulate the growth of processing industries, rather than simple ban on exports. Making processed goods should be done because it's profitable and beneficial, not because it's literally the only option allowed.  There's a problem, though. If you want high quality goods that will be in demand in other countries, they will be expensive for Russians. So you'd have to build your business almost entirely export-oriented, and that can be a risky strategy with no guaranteed payoff. If you create goods for the domestic market, they will have to be somehow made cheaper, and this probably means lower quality. Unlike China, Russia doesn't have the nearly endless manpower you can use as cheap labour. Russians will actually want to get good wages if they are to work hard (and even then it's not a guarantee, lol). And higher wages translate to higher prices for the finished products. Dealing with this requires careful strategic planning and proper execution of that plan that would involve improvements throughout the entire economy at a roughly similar pace. And that's something that's not yet happening on a large scale. The economy is certainly improving since the 90s, but perhaps not fast enough.	1642722308.0	htizpys	t3_s8jbpd	t1_hthldi6	/r/russia/comments/s8jbpd/from_january_1_2022_the_export_of_unprocessed_or/htizpys/

635diibl	I think the specific character of the antisemitism that matures into Naziism arguably does have some roots in Russia - the PotEoZ were written by an Okhrana agent in involuntary collaboration with an English science fiction author, the Black Hundreds definitely prefigured what fascism later became, and you have groups like the [Aufbau Vereinigung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufbau_Vereinigung) which were critical in spreading various antisemitic theories from Russia to Western Europe.   However, antisemitism as such has existed since the Middle Ages in all of Europe, if in significantly different forms, and if anything came late to Russia, so claiming that antisemitism in general originated in Russia is obviously absurd.	1642722358.0	htizu9l	t3_s8dt3d	t1_htgaj5w	/r/russia/comments/s8dt3d/anyone_else_in_the_russian_diaspora_get_asked/htizu9l/

hzsosi0z	One thing I've never understood about vaccine policy in western countries:  So the purported purpose of COVID-19 vaccination is to reduce the rate of hospitalization, right? And most clinically approved vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, AstraZenica, Sputnik V, etc.) have all shown to have a >95% effectiveness against hospitalization. J&J and AstraZenica have been removed from shelves so to speak by western countries because they supposedly have a tiny but present probability of causing severe side-effects in some people (even though Moderna and Pfizer are guilty on the same count, but let's just sweep that under the rug for a second). BUT, Moderna and Pfizer are the only two vaccines that require an initial TWO dosages and still then only last for a few months without boosters.  So riddle me this: if all of these vaccines have shown to be equally excellent at achieving their purported goal of reducing hospitalization, why are the two vaccines that require TWO vaccinations rather than ONE preferred? I find that very strange, that western countries would choose the vaccines that require twice the number of doses to have the samme effect as the other vaccines, it certainly doesn't make it any easier for them in the effort to get their population fully vaccinated. Admittedly there is research that suggest the overall efficacy of the mRNA vaccines are higher than their viral vector counterparts, however this research is spotty with the studies being performed in different countries and at different periods in the pandemic with different variants being dominant, so it can't really be constituted.  I find the seemingly baseless loyalty towards some vaccine manufacturers by several western governments to be... dubious.	1642730309.0	htjigqu	t3_s8x1yn	t3_s8x1yn	/r/russia/comments/s8x1yn/sputnik_v_shows_higher_omicronantibody_levels/htjigqu/

gxbhz	Gee, I wonder what happens to developing world countries that decide to not play ball with the west.  Oh yeah, they get sanctioned until their cities are polluted and rotting off the map or even worse they get their government decapitated.      The fact of the matter is that larger countries have a natural influence over the countries around them. And while this doesn't always mean cozy relations, it does mean that messing around in there by further-away countries is going to antagonize the larger country.       Same way that the USA has been brutalizing Cuba for 60 years for going their own way and allying with the USSR, Ukraine is similarly pissing off the Russians for trying to get in bed with Western Europe.     It's not to say that Russia deserves to have Ukraine (nor the US Cuba), but their response to try and secure Ukraine from falling into the political orbit of other countries is an entirely reasonable and predicable response.       If China were to start trying to draw Ireland into its orbit, you can bet the UK would put troops in Northern Ireland and start running special ops inside the country and possibly even try to foment a coup to install a UK friendly government.	1642730491.0	htjivnl	t3_s8vqoy	t1_htjg9z1	/r/russia/comments/s8vqoy/but_russia_is_attacking_us/htjivnl/

f6avfqpv	>Meanwhile if Russia were to sell arms to countries in the USA's neighbourhood, they'd be sanctioned left and right.  There's no need to resort to "if." Look at what happened during the Caribbean Crisis. Russia moved missiles into a sovereign country's territory 90 miles away from Florida with the permission of that country's government. There was almost a nuclear war.   Meanwhile the United States has maintained the Guantanamo Bay naval base in that very same country for over a century *against* the government of that country's wishes, but that's ok because the United States owns the Western Hemisphere and the Latin American countries have to take its orders.	1642732709.0	htjnzrh	t3_s8vqoy	t1_htjjxls	/r/russia/comments/s8vqoy/but_russia_is_attacking_us/htjnzrh/

f6avfqpv	As an American I am constantly baffled at how little my fellow Americans seem to know or care about what a terribly stupid idea NATO expansion is. I am also sick and tired of paying for the defense spending of ungrateful freeriding European welfare states. I would rather use that money to help African American and Native American communities here in the United States rather than allow the French and the Italians to fund lavish welfare states full of ungrateful, bitchy baby boomers because they don't have to pay for their own defense spending.  The only sensible country in Europe seems to be Germany.      Also this nonsense about Sweden and Finland wanting to join NATO is bullshit.

f6avfqpv	It's just like with Iran. Somehow the Iranians are the bad guys because of the "character" of the regime; they're suicidal fanatics and can't be trusted. Never mind the fact that the United  States invaded and occupied two countries  *that share borders with Iran* over the past 20 years; that proves nothing about America's character and it was done in the name of Le Freedom.	1642736972.0	htjxlvy	t3_s8vqoy	t1_htjwrmi	/r/russia/comments/s8vqoy/but_russia_is_attacking_us/htjxlvy/

93dx0v16	^^ ‚ÄúBrave-Way3622‚Äù already articulated the similarities between the two. Hence my trolling and calling it semantics. Over here in the U.S we have Parishes or Counties depending on the State. The actual difference between the two is pretty minor and is more based around origination and individual state history. If you were to conflate the two, most folks here would understand what you meant, and that‚Äôs if they even understood that there was a fundamental difference in the first place‚Ä¶ Russia is a country made of smaller parts with unique cultures, America is a country made of smaller parts with unique cultures .. hope that makes more sense	1642737219.0	htjy5au	t3_s8gfyk	t1_htjocxk	/r/russia/comments/s8gfyk/western_liberals_be_like/htjy5au/
