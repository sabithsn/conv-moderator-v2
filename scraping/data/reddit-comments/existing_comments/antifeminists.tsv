737crz7b	My wife is a therapist who had a client who was sex trafficked by a “friend”. They went to NYC to go shopping and see the sights. Before they were to return home, the “friend” said she wanted to visit a friend of hers. They went to the person’s apartment and hung out for awhile. The “friend” excused herself to go to the corner store to buy cigarettes…and, never returned. The woman was repeatedly raped and then forced to prostitute herself. It took her five years to escape that life. The kicker is that she still sees her “friend” around town and the person, when she sees her, doesn’t acknowledge her or apologize.	1640832898.0	hqhwxjz	t3_rrnggo	t3_rrnggo	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrnggo/un_report_confirms_women_are_the_majority_of_sex/hqhwxjz/
82h98hd9	You got downvoted (why?!) and I upvoted you. I do think everyone should be able to vote. I also think **everyone** should be subject to the military draft, and that **includes** women. I once dated a chick in grad school who came over from Israel to attend grad school in the US. She was fit and pretty and very nice. She showed me pictures of her with her unit in the IDF, carrying a rifle. I asked her what she thought about compulsory military service, and she said "Would you fight and possibly sacrifice your life for your people and your way of life?" I said I would, and told her about my own service. She said "Well then you understand. It's about loving your people and being willing to sacrifice for your people."   She was an awesome person. She totally got it. She thought American chicks were fu&%ing children, and I understood that. She had been rocketed, shelled, and fired on, and had fired back, to defend her people. And in doing so, she had earned the right to have strong fu&%ing opinions about the world and what should be done, and I respected that. She wasn't a feminist or an anti-feminist... she didn't have time for that. She was a world citizen and had confidence and knowledge about her positions, and people respected her for it, because she had stepped up and done the big scary things, for the greater good.  I'm not Jewish, though, so things didn't proceed beyond that, LOL	1640832947.0	hqhx1d7	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqhi3ba	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqhx1d7/

18q1w2ti	>"Globally, most persons prosecuted and convicted of trafficking in persons continue to be male, with around 64 and 62 per cent respectively."  This is a direct quote from the UN report cited.  While I wouldn't be surprised that female offenders are more likely to fly under the radar or cry their way out of convictions (ie "I had to or else I'd have been hurt...") there's no evidence that supports the claim in this post that a majority of trafficking is committed by females.	1640833949.0	hqhz98v	t3_rrnggo	t3_rrnggo	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrnggo/un_report_confirms_women_are_the_majority_of_sex/hqhz98v/

qgjik0p	i meant firewood as in the twigs branches and chunks of wood from rotten or insect ridin trees. my sister certainly doesnt like chopping firewood. that's a solid point about how time consuming cooking was. one of the keys to economic development is childhood nutrition and education. i was trouble when i was a kid then during highschool i did a 180. if a household is large like if a family is rich or they have to work some distance from one another there is plenty of work to do and women would let their neighbors or friends use equipment or materials or they would outright hire folks. a lot of education can go into those aspects and i think about 60 of small farmers worldwide are women and that can take a lot of education. lol the thing about the more agreeable sex is that if they see someone as predatory, exploitative or disgusting then they will have it in them to be even more cruel and disgusting "in return". its also pretty damaging to be in the military even outside of combat due to all the trekking material transport poor conditions and the risk of hanging around low ranking military personel as it turns out that the same traits that make for good officers also makes them more trustworthy XD so support personel will be left tending to the larger portions of the army who arnt as likely to be so trustworthy due to a number of factors. overall women tend to avoid poor working conditions and even with dating a women will tend to rate herself as above average while rating an average man below average. with men it tends to be a bit more accurate but guys will rate girls based on both looks and personality but tend to be bad with estimating a girls personality	1640835738.0	hqi37cc	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqhtsuq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqi37cc/
2u414jx5	Man invented the interpretation of religion, religion invented the sciences, the interpretation of religion stimulated the idea of strategic warfare, the military kicked out the Puritans who created an important country for the world, the cycle of war created the United States and who did not fight was destroyed. The woman took the subway built by men, came to the house designed by men, put her things on the furniture assembled by men, turned on the computer designed by men and wrote on the Internet invented by men that men are not needed and men are evil because of whom all the troubles of the earth. Well, I can only add that men motivated the leftist agenda in the geopolitics of all countries, because 20th century capitalism doesn't work in 2021.  Women scream and hate men the loudest at the moment when men gave women privileges. Ordinary men who love women do not understand how to live in this world.	1640835907.0	hqi3k7i	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqgubxe	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqi3k7i/

I have also never met a guy who hated women. I wouldn't have a friend like that.   I did know a man who was bitter about the courts because his divorce was messy and  another guy who was wrongfully accused of rape. Even when she said it was false it was too late he could never go back to his town.

It will just harm them, as it does. But if Middle East is a sick body, it needs this antibiotic. Doctors say that antibiotic as a medicine can kill good bacteria along with the viruses, that's why they reccomend small dose consumption. Or can even write probiotics, that protect from antibiotics damage. (Speaking from experience.

4uvq8vx3	actually, women do not make much in prostitution and pornography. if they do, they are in the top 1% of those in the porn industry which is extremely unlikely.   also yes, pornography and prostitution does exploit women and children. i hate the mainstream narrative that sex work and pornography is empowering because the reality is very different for women in prostitution.   a woman will enter sex work because of financial troubles. “Poverty is the primary driving force behind women becoming prostitutes. Prostitution is a repression of women and children, and utilizes the vulnerability of poverty to further exploit them.” https://www.borgenmagazine.com/prostitution-poverty/  many— “82% had been physically assaulted; 83% had been threatened with a weapon; 68% had been raped while working as prostitutes; and 84% reported current or past homelessness “, “Of the 130 people interviewed, 68% met DSM III-R criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD. Eighty-eight percent of these respondents stated that they wanted to leave prostitution” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9698636/   many would much rather have a stable job that being a sex worker, and this is why they cant “just leave”  —  https://www.womenslaw.org/about-abuse/forms-abuse/sexual-abuse-and-exploitation/forced-prostitution/leaving-prostitution/why  Educate yourself.

1x6rbyhc	A lot of cultural appropriation is highly appreciated. Now I don't mean stealing cultural artifacts from other societies and displaying them as colonial trophies. I mean cooking like an Indian, working hard like the Chinese, Producing tech like a Russian, Making art like an African, sculpting like a European, camping like a native American. Matter of fact, if you don't steal physical artifacts from people, then whatever you're doing, if it makes your life easier, is probably alright. Imagine applying melanosilicates on your skin to survive radiation damage, and getting called out for blackface? Melanosilicate compounds are black. Or seasoning chicken with paprika and getting called out for cultural appropriation of Indian culture. Or adding agbayun to your condiments table to cure hot sauce burns, and being told your...ah; you get my point.     What is termed cultural appropriation is in most cases just preserving or spreading culture. I'm certain if the Greeks said they wanted the alphabet back we'd regard them very weirdly. And yes, People should return stolen artworks to their native societies (if requested).     Keep cooking like and Indian, and creating like an African. Don't let some dunderhead tell you you're wrong for using another culture's means of survival to survive.

I dont care about feminists,but i made fun of you guys basing your identity on anti feminism or bothering with anti femnism.  In the optics field, you lose immediately because you are opposing women.  In the argumentation area,most people here are incels,or palecons or something else right wing. So its the same bullshit but from the shit humanity has seen for thousands of years.  Ill come with a hot take. Most feminists are misandrists and have some deeply held hatreds towards straight men and women. Its not a healthy community.  This place here has people i cannot stand just like the misandrists on the other side. Paleocons,incels, religious people, fascists.  Just because feminists are garbage people doesnt mean you guys are better.  And lastly, I expected to get banned.

1x6rbyhc	And being the native in question, I can tell you it's entirely a matter of favoritism. Here, in your last year, as part of the final examination process, you must apply for a position in campus. You are not given a choice in this matter. So, females and males apply. And there are actually more females alive, thus in school. So more females apply. But despite this, a very huge percentage still fail to meet the cut off point. So the ever higher cut off points for boys is entirely means to lock most of them out. The result is a much more sophisticated crime network, as many brilliant minds loose the opportunity to advance themselves legally. So while we do not have a very high violent crime rate, we are considered the de facto capital of cyber crime and financial crimes on earth. Most of these boys, learn to code or design systems, and since they have no "papers" their skills are generally irrelevant. So apart for the occasional freelance gig, a majority of their skills are used in advanced crimes. Further, though careful lobbying, we do not have laws that restrict this. Now there have been petitions to make the cut off points equal and permanent, but the feminists, daughtered fathers and simps in government are numerous, so this is unlikely to happen. Hence more boys will be locked out of tertiary education in future, and the sophistication of "crimes" will continue to advance. I say crimes, because what is done is illegal in the client countries, not here. From online cheating, cyber espionage, criminal accounting, tax evasion systems and other interesting things.  The root cause is gynocentrism, an ideological child of feminism. It tells society to put down the boy and empower the girl. Leading to a society with more than 3 million broken arrows. And yes, considering we now have bio hackers, it's not going to be good for anyone. Specifically the feminists.	1640870978.0	hqjkzni	t3_rix4o6	t1_hpf1096	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqjkzni/

3sl19poy	I don’t know what sci fi movie you’re living in but it’s definitely not reality. Besides if you don’t mind me asking so I can confirm these statistics, what school is this in question. Also just because more women are alive by a really minutiae percentage does not by default mean there are more women on campus. Also I’m pretty sure that regardless of the school, it’s trying to heighten the national average of women in stem, so in other schools where this imaginary test may or may not be applied to get in stem positions, there are still more men entering than women on a national basis. In order to change those numbers on a national basis, there needs to be a lower standard for more women to enter the field. For example, if there is a school that one group of specific people are entering and there is a surplus of those people, a school will make the bar higher in order to cut down on disparity. Have fun with your sci fi novel in the making though. Cause half that response was sickeningly hypothetical. Boys that may get rejected for conventional positions and documentation can still do freelance work since you don’t need a degree in computer science to code. They don’t become top secret web spies, most of them just end up doing html or building a portfolio with smaller jobs like a normal person. Plus biohacking isn’t actually biotechnology hybrids, it’s legitimately a term that gym rats came up with for pushing their body over its natural limits using supplements and psychology tricks.	1640871680.0	hqjma86	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqjkzni	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqjma86/

So there's no such thing as a dead thread here, just opportunities to see other perspectives and consider them further.  Now, you've used terms which I assume are meant to be insulting, but I don't understand most of them. Incel I get, involuntary celibate. A fallacy, as the world is populated with very many cheap whores, so the celibacy of these chaps is entirely voluntary. Fascists I also get, but regardless of our disagreement in many positions they hold, I still consider all opinions to have some level of reasoning, and thus may have merit. Religious people are just that, believers in invisible deities, and while I will never understand them, I do understand that in this forum, they're against feminism.  Yu are right of course, on the point of loosing ground because feminism is considered a female. But as I have come to learn (through this forum), feminism is not the same as women. Thus not being a feminist doesn't mean you hate, or have to hate women. Now, some do, and that's fine. You have the freedom to hate or love whatever or whoever you want.  The mods do indeed give a fuck, but are quite tolerant to opposing opinions. This forum is not an echo chamber, your opposition is welcome.

An example would be her listing ‘hardworking’ as a character trait that she’d like. I can give my old economics teacher who was an amazing teacher, hard working, dedicated, inspiring, properly made you love the subject. He was the poster boy for hard working, but, as a teacher, he probably didn’t make as much as he could’ve. Reckon this woman would want to date him, or is it money that she’s attracted to, and not the hard working personality trait.	1640876650.0	hqjwlrp	t3_rrsoy0	t3_rrsoy0	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrsoy0/whawhat_in_the_f/hqjwlrp/

It’s a rather hateful word because it literally means hatred for women. And I don’t think I’ve ever met even one guy that actually feels that way. Maybe that Elliot Rogers guy but then again I never met him and supposedly his issue wasn’t that he hated women he hated the fact that he couldn’t get a particular type not sure if this led to him becoming a real incel or not that’s up for debate. But regardless I have yet to meet a man that is the actual incel. Like I said it’s just a term used by women that are either upset or trying to insult usually a man when they are right about something or saying something logical or truthful that they don’t agree with.	1640878866.0	hqk1qno	t3_rs0gge	t3_rs0gge	/r/antifeminists/comments/rs0gge/theory_on_incels_and_femcels/hqk1qno/

I don't disagree with you on any point. But you do realize that this woman in the picture, Andrea Heinz, joined the sex industry because she had gotten herself into a lot of debt by 22 due to bad life choices and then made millions of dollars doing it, and then opened up a brothel for other women during the last 4 years of her career. So if she was being raped for her entire experience, I highly doubt she would have opened a brothel for other women to get raped too.  This is what we're making fun of. A transactional relationship that you agree to is not rape, especially if you consented to it.  She by the way is completely sex-negative, and believes that all sex work is bad for women, even heavily regulated.  >Also, sex-negative self proclaimed feminists are not that rare. The entirety of FDS is anti-sex work, and they seem to be called feminists in your book.  FDS is a group of extremists and is the most hated sub on reddit.

I know, it feels like a different kind of problem but I think these people share the same kind of belief in their head.

7exrq0w2	>Its not just about the severity but about the frequency, and you can bet your ass both these things are tipped to one side especially in muslim countries  Women are both much more likely to commit domestic violence and do it more frequently as well.  Quoting Dr. Donald Dutton (domestic violence researcher):  > Then there's the data, the information on who perpetrates domestic violence. Now, you know the US is the world leader in this respect because there's been five excellent victim surveys done in the US. Huge samples, representative samples, starting from 1989 and running right up to 2004. And they all say the same thing. That it's 50% of reported domestic violence is bilateral. It's a two person thing, back and forth, back and forth. 35% of the remainder, the unilateral domestic violence, is female perpetrated. 15% is male perpetrated. And of that 15%, 10% or 2/3 of it, is just like a push or a shove or a slap, it's not the serious stuff. So that leaves 5% that fits the stereotype of serious domestic violence, male perpetrated domestic violence. 5% of domestic violence actually fits that stereotype. That's all.  From [Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence (Whitaker et al., 2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/):  > Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.  That means women are 2 1/3 as likely to commit domestic violence as men.  See also [References Examining Assaults by Women on Their Spouses or Male Partners: An Updated Annotated Bibliography (Fiebert, 2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261543769_References_Examining_Assaults_by_Women_on_Their_Spouses_or_Male_Partners_An_Updated_Annotated_Bibliography):  > This annotated bibliography describes 343 scholarly investigations (270 empirical studies and 73 reviews) demonstrating that women are as physically aggressive as men (or more) in their relationships with their spouses or opposite-sex partners. The aggregate sample size in the reviewed studies exceeds 440,850 people ___ > especially in muslim countries  Hard to know without data. Either way, why does the average prevalence / frequency even matter in an individual case? Just because a certain race of people murders more on average, doesn't mean we should punish an individual from that race committing murder more, right? In a similar way, I don't see how you justify not punishing a woman in the same way as a man, unless you believe women are inherently better than men.	1640882396.0	hqkai4e	t3_rquh65	t1_hqjrxnh	/r/antifeminists/comments/rquh65/science_proves_the_world_has_a_profemale_bias/hqkai4e/

And as long men and women are unhappy, they will destory themself and normalize that behavior. Its the downfall of humanity and its collective concioussnes. But I blame the society, because we who came from dysfunctional families got brainwashed by sex in the city, Californication and the goverment.

1x6rbyhc	No. That would contravene the private information statute.     Regardless, in STEM, reducing cut off points is similar to allowing sub par individuals into fields they are not qualified for. That happens, and it's not going to end well. But I'm looking at the whole picture, And the whole picture does show this to be a fact. It is not Sci-Fi. I have lived it, and seen how it ends. Feminism by gynocentrism is the cause.  Biohacking is not the same as dieting and playing such games. Biohacking is gene editing to create desired results in living organisms. From creating better seeds, to creating seeds susceptible to certain diseases in order to damage the standing of agro-companies. This actually happens a lot nowadays, just more sophisticated due to the interesting methods we have of verifying produce.  Going back to stem, this gynocentric BS, make it very difficult to trust females in STEM. One always has to consider the risk that the individual is sub par, only acquiring papers through the mercies of a system laden with favoritism.  As for your point on building porfolios, that's great in the west, but doesn't work around here. A portfolio is great, but one cannot stay hungry and homeless for 5 years. You do what you need to do, and get to your life goals.  The point stands. You females want equality, then you must be treated exactly like men. That is equality. That is the stated goal of feminism. You cannot justify favoritism, based on the fact that you are female. You had the same chances in life, you got through high school. Then given the fact that we have the same capacity for intelligence, then you must attain the same cut off point as the boys. Otherwise, you're all just full of it, and equality through your methodology is just female supremacy, nothing more.	1640883852.0	hqkearq	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqjma86	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqkearq/

1x6rbyhc	Well, it's difficult for them to enter the career. If you got your hands on freshman applicants, many are females. Before the end of the semester, very few are left. A look at the coursework will show you that the material has over time been easier. Whether this is due to advancement in technology to pick up the slack, or just gynocentric activism in the senate boards, is up to you. Of course, one only has to look at how the job market is to understand these things. There's less females in the workplaces, because you can't have lower requirements for one gender to enter the workplace than another. A worker is a number that must output the market average to be viable. Otherwise, fire her and employ the young lad who can actually do the job.	1640884331.0	hqkfk16	t3_rix4o6	t1_hp0iqfj	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqkfk16/

I also do not have a problem with women voting however they should be required to serve the nation as much as men do. Otherwise I dont care how much a woman cries for "equality", it will only be her asking for privileges.   I dislike compulsory military service personally especially since I am in the Middle East but it is one of those aspects of life you gotta take care of. I feel like it's the state's way of getting free labor without calling it slavery.   In the very least, I think that accountability between the sexes should be equal. I hate nothing more than a "strong independent woman" that blames literally everyone else once things go wrong in her life.	1640889189.0	hqksg89	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqhx1d7	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqksg89/

3sl19poy	If the standards are lower that doesn’t imply subpar abilities it just implies that standards are higher for males because there’s simply more of them. I’m sorry you feel so personally attacked by the way that statistics work but it’s just fact that to deal with surplus, people set things higher to act as a filter. The scores that women get are adequate. Besides, it’s literally coding and computer science, something that can be done without a degree. Given the nature of coding too, there’s no such thing as producing sub par code. Codes have one conducive route to the program that’s being run so if a woman was actually subpar, then her codes just wouldn’t continue to run correctly. Coding is like math in the sense that one input has one output.	1640889583.0	hqkthrz	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqkearq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqkthrz/

ir2g7	what's funny is that the double standard is so ingrained that if you use the same body-shaming, sexist insults on them "fat bitch, cunt, slut" suddenly you are the misogynist and "hate all women".... but if they use it against you (small PP, incel) they are definitely not misandrist because they are "empowered" to do so!... WTF?  Yet at the same time, we are all supposed to be equal... (but not really)   The best example of this was when I heard a co-worker saying the delivery guy was gay for rejecting her advances, and she sounded disgusted and angry about it...

Yet, her identity has been kept anonymous and she has not been held to account. What a disaster. The British injustice system is truly criminal. Feminism is truly criminal. I remember being attacked relentlessly by feminists when I first wrote an article about this story. They attacked me for stating that it was a false accusation. They claimed that it wasn't proved a false allegation, despite being retracted and dismissed by the police.   It wasn't just me that they attacked. They attacked any and all newspapers that made this claim. They forced The Telegraph newspaper to amend their article on the story in which they called it a false allegation. They forced The Telegraph to apologise for calling this story a false allegation. They weren't satisfied with only killing this boy but they also went after him after his death. It's no wonder his mum took her own life. Feminism killed these two people!!

18q1w2ti	Yes, that's why I can believe the numbers might be a little low for female convictions... but I don't think the numbers are so wildly off that it'd support females being the majority if that makes sense?  Closer to 50/50 would be something I could potentially believe given crime statistics in general... especially since women are more likely to involve themselves in the less "violent" criminal behaviors. Women in trafficking operations primarily work as a "lure" to capture vulnerable people, but aren't as common in the steps further down the trafficking chain... this is why coyotes in Texas are almost entirely male, even though I'm sure many probably have females in Mexico who put them in contact with their victims.  Even Ghislaine Maxwell fits that profile, she helped to find girls, move them around, and entrap them but wasn't often as personally involved in the next steps of the process as Epstein and his colleagues. Luckily it seems like justice will be served in her case since.	1640914467.0	hqmj6vt	t3_rrnggo	t1_hqm4yhu	/r/antifeminists/comments/rrnggo/un_report_confirms_women_are_the_majority_of_sex/hqmj6vt/

7bjndvbl	I would support it if it wasn't in places that don't need feminism, like America or the UK for example. And it would have to be equal with both the goods and bads if it were in places that don't need feminism. If it was actually for equality and not equity.   I'll support it but I won't be a feminist.   If feminism is actually about equality, then they should have no problem advocating for the following: Make women register for the draft alongside men, or get rid of the draft. Make women have equal sentences for the same crimes as men, acknowledge men get sexually and physically abused and raped, make laws that make it rape if a woman rapes a man, teach kids that both men and women can be victims and victimizers, get rid of anti-male hate speech on social media (they don't remove it because it's technically not against their TOS,) have the majority of custody 50/50 if both parents are fit for it and want custody (the majority of custody cases are mothers having full custody, even when they're the abusers,) actually arrest women for domestic violence against their children, husbands, boyfriends, etc., let fathers have a say when it comes to pregnancy and abortion, have news articles label it as rape instead of "has sex with" when it comes to women raping minors, including students, acknowledge men have feelings and support them aswell, have homeless and abuse shelters for men too.   That would be actual equality but let's be real, feminists are never going to advocate for this stuff, especially with what they're still teaching children in schools. They only want the benefits of "equality." they'd be pissed if you said workplace deaths and suicides should be 50% men 50% women.	1640918253.0	hqmrkrn	t3_rsi039	t3_rsi039	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsi039/if_they_could_define_misandry_and_feminism_as_two/hqmrkrn/

We do not base our opinions by the behaviour of the radical feminists, to then dislike feminism. That would be just what they accuse us of doing.

Dad didn’t really do much  and relied on his mother for money  until a few years ago and really didn’t offer to help while my mom had seizures on the road and went to the ER frequently. He is now hard-working factory worker and sells shoes on the side and is now there for the both of us.

aba5aa1o	Probably burly ladies are more likely to go to the army, as not all ladies are small, some are tall and big - 1.8 - 2 m. I think they have higher chances. I am 1.74m, not burly enough, especially when I lost some weight 2 years ago. I'm 22. And I've seen people who look small and soft but are strong and big people, who look burly but aren't strong enough. You don't need visible muscles to be strong. You don't even have to be the strongest human in the world.  F-movement followers complain loudly that they are the ones forced to perform toxic roles and think that society has toxic expectations for them, which seem annoying. But that's false. The most toxic expectations are towards the males, and this triggers me a lot. They say, that noone would give a crap for a man who doesn't provide or similar things and the worst nightmare is not being allowed to show emotions. Guys are not robots and they too deserve unconditional love and compassion and this is why the submissive feminine pages on Instagram teach ladies to be loving and supportive to their partners. And this is why I am here, as a lady to catch every chance to send you positive nurturing vibes.	1640939946.0	hqntdzr	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqj1mf5	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqntdzr/

Some things you can try to dive into next: the philosophies that feminism evolved from; feminism being contradicted by neuroscience; feminism having no historical or factual basis; the core of the people that shaped feminism were abusive, pro-pedophilia, and wanted to kill men; the improvements in mental health and personal relationships of those who abandoned feminism.

4uj85tsl	It seems like we live in a feminine world where compassion and kindness come first at all cost. This is a huge danger for the children as it teaches them self-depreciation and harmlessness as a virtue in and of itself which means the children will be either very weak (if they are boys) and doormats or entitled brats(girls). Instead, he should show them kindness and compassion have a value as a sacrifice for something greater to be achieved in the future. There is no honour and respect that you get by depreciating yourself in front of someone who may not feel that way about you and whereas he may have done it with good intent, the road to hell for men becoming weak and incapable of standing up for themselves and valuing themselves is paved with such chivalrous gestures.	1640942206.0	hqnw8ho	t3_rsomra	t1_hqnq0p9	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsomra/an_interesting_post_from_fds_simping_is_their/hqnw8ho/

7c5l7lw7	People often call me names when I don't support something or believe something that's a temporary fix because I actually look at the end result of what happens long term with certain movements. I was born a woman, I was designed to be a woman and I have absolutely no desire to be equal to a man. Equal respect yes, for our differences. I really don't care if a man makes more than I do, they are providers by nature, they should. I don't care if they have the majority of the jobs. I don't care or desire to take on the responsibilities they have or have had. I just want to be able to be a woman, and I can't anymore. Because of the feminism movement, men don't make as much anymore, men don't have the benefits anymore, society assumes every household is two income so the price of everything is based on that. Relationships suffer now, marriages suffer, children suffer because we aren't allowed to be men and women anymore,  we have to be both and that goes against human nature!

aba5aa1o	I understand you. Feminism originally was about free Choice. Simple. But feminists are scared to be dependent and perceive the homemaking as slavish dependence, think that housewives are victims and slaves of domestic violence shit. And this poison fear turns into hatred against homemaking and the desiring homemakers end up being underrated and seen as doormats, but they are diamonds. Material success, whatever it is doesn't matter, the most important thing in life is being a good person. The point of a life is to love and being loved.

glkrg48i	Honestly, I kind of feel what your asking is too broad. to make any kind of definitive statement the 'feminists' would need a manifesto, as for me, I'm never on just one side. there are parts I agree with on the left, and parts on the right etc.. and parts where I don't care, others where I do, but am not informed enough etc etc..   my point being, I'd need to see a clearly defined list of what you're asking me to support :P because SO much of feminism today starts good, and drops off a cliff.   'we want more women in the tech world' - Ok, I'm down, if they want to sure!   'we want more women in the tech world, then patriarchy is keeping them out' - Well, no, go fuck yourselves.

Roughly speaking, even the constant hormones testosterone and samathropin will not make a woman a man.   Even calcium metabolism and cortisol and adrenaline metabolism is different in women...so the female army is something like a sedative for the female ego. A Chinese weak man with a height of 1.50 meters can easily kill a woman with a height of 1.90 with the same trim.  What can I say about feminism, I like the struggle of the women of the 2nd wave.   There was logic and results, modern feminism destroys everything...   All this politics of double standards and hypertrophy of everything because men had more power in the past? The Germans had Hitler, is that a reason to hate Germans in 2021? History is for learning and correcting mistakes, not for hating people for past mistakes.	1640950662.0	hqo6on5	t3_rri0cf	t1_hqntdzr	/r/antifeminists/comments/rri0cf/male_privilege_im_sorry_but_this_fact_gives_a/hqo6on5/

304eh18o	No. TRP, unlike feminism, isn't a movement. Never was. It's a way of seeing the world. And how you utilize it, is up to you. For a lot of men, it's going through the divorce system makes them take the TRP. It's not fictional imaginary ever pervasive patriarchy, where mansplaining, maninterrupting exist. Where we live in a rape culture. Jokes lead to rape. TRP is where gender differences exists.   Now, is there a toxic version of it. Yes, the ones that mixes with the PUAs.The main TRP on reddit is toxic AF. but the TRP that MRAs first used isn't.   It also learns about womens nature, though it sometimes goes to toxic level when it mixes with the PUAs.	1640957113.0	hqog4yu	t3_rsoxug	t1_hqns1lr	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsoxug/when_feminism_meats_rselfawarewolves/hqog4yu/

35c0i	No they did not. They lobbied for the current definition and fought against one that included envelopment. Have you read the current FBI definition?  Lots of influential sexist feminists are seeking power and promoting misandry rather than helping all victims of nonconsensual sex.  For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**   You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g.   Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206  > > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and   > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.   2010 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  *data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*  And non CDC study...  *A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  *a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*  And another non CDC study...  *National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  *when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*   If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.    Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women’s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn’t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims’ fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1640974386.0	hqpiv69	t3_rsmsmq	t1_hqphqg2	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsmsmq/feminism_was_broken_from_the_start/hqpiv69/

h2jt1i58	Honest question: how is feminism a good thing for equality?  Seriously would love an answer.  because you people love to say this, you literally never back it up.  You people just spew out talking points with zero substance behind them.  At least here people can actually explain their stance and give non anecdotal reasoning behind their statement.  If it's so good, why is it literally not working and no progress has been made in 50 years?  Why is it such a rejected concept by like 75% of people if it's so good?  Funny we can agree stealing is bad, but we can't seem to agree feminism is any good.  It's not where near as clear cut as you want to pretend it is, not even close.  So I ask again, how is feminism good *for equality*?  And no, I'm not patronizing you, I am asking you to support your claim with facts as a common curtsey because of a statement on a forum you made publicly (and managed to throw insults in there too unprompted... feminism sooo good.  right?

It's always we don't owe men shit... but also, hey, I'm a woman of this group, you should respect me by default and fuck it, give me more because I "**deserve** better"  You deserve what you earn, period.  If you earned a life being a single mother because you got pregnant and kicked the father out, that's a you problem, and unfortunately the child's too to a much bigger and impactful degree.  I don't give a shit about single mothers when it comes to their kids, kids first.

19w9grf9	from wikipedia:  Feminism is a range of social movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men.  u just said to give some substance then pulled out a 50 years of useless feminism and 75% of people rejecting it out your ass. lmao.  fighting for womens rights has stopped in the last couple of years as women have equal rights in most places. thats why the term now isnt all about women its equality of the sexes. to be anti feminist is undermining all the shit people have fought for.   to directly answer your question, feminism is fighting for equality. not against it. i think this sub has a skewed definition of feminism, or a lot of them are incels who wont take the time to google what it is. not saying you are but thats probably what majority of reddit sees this sub as.	1640982913.0	hqq3gee	t3_rsvbv7	t1_hqpz2gn	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqq3gee/

h2jt1i58	So first off, I really appreciate your response and having a conversation. I am not attacking you, but am giving a detailed rebuttal.  Christianity is about helping the poor.  How does that work out?  point here you can say all you want, but what you do is what actually matters.  A man can say he doesn't hit women and believes women are princesses, does that matter though if he hits his wife?  Of course not, you don't care about the words, you care what he actually did.  >to directly answer your question, feminism is fighting for equality. not against it.  If you fight for ONE group and not ALL groups that is NOT equality.  If you own 5 cars, but you only drive one, are you driving them equally?  No, you are not, you're favoring one.  Say you are trying to get the miles up (say miles are rights) so you drive that car to get the miles up *like the rest*, are you being equal?  No, you are STILL not driving the other cars the same amount.  When you fight **for** women that is **NOT** fighting for everyone.  Calling feminism about equality sounds nice, but that's absolutely not what you people do, you favor women over men.  That is by definition not equal.  Which is 100% fine, but we ask y'all stop saying one thing while doing the other.    Let me put it this way, mens rights, MRA, *is not about equality*, it's about men, no one else.  Same concept as feminism, but for men.  Neither of those movements are about equality, egalitarianism is.    Here is a real life example of how feminism is not about equality and in fact against men, abortion.  I have literally never, not once, seen a feminist say "hold up, we are fucking men over with this, we need to include them since this impacts them"  Literally never.  Equality with abortion would be "Women need the choice, but it should not come at the expense of men (say he wants the child or not, just the opposite stance of the mother), so we should include them in the conversation"  But it's not that, at all.  It's "men make abortion hard and it's *women's* health", which is framed that way to make it all about women and blame men, that's why they refuse to use the term "family planning" anymore like we did 15 years ago.  It was to intentionally exclude men, that is by definition not equality.  I understand your reasoning behind giving me the wiki page and definition.  But what I am saying is I don't care what you say, I care what you do. And my point is *what feminism does* is flat out, undeniably, not good for the overwhelming majority of men.  If you exclude men or any group, at all, in any capacity, you are not about equality no matter what you say.  Saying it's to get women even or whatever is fine, but it's not equality and it does not benefit everyone, it benefits women.   You simply can not be about equality if you do not treat all involved equally, feminism as you stated with your definition is fighting for women, no mention of men.  That's flat out not equal treatment.  If you favor women that's fine, but don't pretend favoring women is good for everyone, it's good for women and no one else.   Feminism: the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes *favors women, excludes men*  Mens rights: The MRM in particular consists of a variety of groups and individuals (men's rights activists or MRAs) who focus on general social issues and specific government services which adversely impact, or in some cases structurally discriminate against, men. *favors men, excludes women*  Egalitarian: the doctrine that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. *favors no one, excludes no one*	1640984414.0	hqq6zbc	t3_rsvbv7	t1_hqq3gee	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqq6zbc/

Also, your reading comprehension is terrible. I didn’t say 99% of women identify as feminists. I said they buy into the feminist narrative ( “women are oppressed, underpaid, sexually repressed by men, etc.”) That in turn makes for misandrist legislation and policies that discriminate against men.	1640986442.0	hqqbn8v	t3_rs77yz	t1_hqofrpu	/r/antifeminists/comments/rs77yz/she_couldnt_handle_the_fact_that_i_have_a_height/hqqbn8v/
h2jt1i58	I am stating through action, forge the definition, feminism is not for equality, that's all.  Which is 100% fine, we just ask that people stop pretending it is when it favors women.  It's like it's worse to admit it favors women, but honestly even this sub would not care if feminists would just say they are looking out for themselves and no one else, because then we can have a discussion which leads to fixing things (much like you and I discussing here and not throwing insults and stuff).  If more responded like you did to me, the tension would be almost zero.  So I, and I am sure most others here, appreciate you for this.  We need these conversations and need them to be productive for either side to move forward with the other.  And yes, I 100% agree feminism even as we know it here and now in the US, is needed elsewhere.  There is no doubt about that.  If you lurk around here and MRA enough you'll see we mention this often.  Almost as a dig at western feminists to say you want women's rights, but you care about petty things instead of standing up for women living in real rape cultures and real male dominated societies.    I get what you are saying about FDS, but FDS is like Scientology to Christianity in my analogy.  Regular feminism is still rather extreme to men.  FDS does though crank it up way more to beyond extreme levels.  So again, I appreciate the conversation and I appreciate, and will speak for others, that you took my response for what it was and to see my perspective instead of throwing talking points at me.	1640986479.0	hqqbqct	t3_rsvbv7	t1_hqqa975	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hqqbqct/

dsa9cr2s	That’s because women like men. Actual grown-up take responsibility for their own actions, take care of themselves and have a good heart for taking care of people around them men.  NOT whiny-assed little boys.  But do not be deceived, I don’t care how good looking a man is; if he treats me badly either in words or actions I will leave.  Life is too short to put up with that kind of treatment. If a man is kind, honest and has integrity it doesn’t matter what he looks like because strength of character stands the test of time. Looks fade. Not just of course for women but for men as well.  I do not believe men get better looking with time.  This site says women don’t have the same “quote” market value as they age but neither do men. Men lose their hair. And their teeth. And they get bellies. And their muscle turns to mush. Same as us. Men and women really are not different in that way at all. And if that’s not attractive to a man to see a woman like I doubt most women would find  that attractive either. I know I don’t.  I don’t care how much money he makes because I make plenty of my own.  However if a man respects himself and takes care of himself a woman notices and that is hugely attractive to a woman.  And of course speaking for myself I noticed that right off. No one wants to crawl spend time with someone who is flabby and smelly. Doesn’t matter whether they’re a man or a woman.

If a woman were to call me a dog well they should be able to take being called a bitch. If you want equality you need to be able to take your own bullshit. Oh this hole thing with quite a few feminists I've see saying a man should take care of a woman. While a woman remains independent is a fucking contradiction. You can't be independent and be taken care of and if you say that is what a man is supposed to do it is inequality for women. Wanna know how cause the man does literally everything. If you want equality maybe start tallying down the things woman do have that men do. Which is actually everything and more. Then something most extreme feminists do is not realize you can't fucking change the entire God damn world. Something bad is always gonna happen learn to get over it and stop acting like a child.

And yeah, they were all nit picking that he was big and scary and a nazi and acting like "well yeah, I'd be quiet if a huge nazi ...." but they completely missed the point. Big Tall Fit Chad with muscles and hair and all of a sudden the women are IMPRESSED (not really scared but kinda, and they like that). It's the 'bad boy'... I mean, if the dude was holding a TV, would they realize it was about him being a crook/bad boy/petty thug? No.. So the nazi tattoos are used to insinuate he's, at minimum, a non-conformist.

It seems that most feminists subs are misandrist totalitarian echo chambers.

The red pill doesn’t actively seek to harm women for men’s amusement; feminism actively seeks to harm men for women’s amusement.  The red pill lifts men up. It’s a positive movement based on improving oneself and understanding biological and social truths.  Feminism... puts men down. It’s a negative movement based on perpetuating victimhood and the bitterness that goes along with that, which it does by spreading lies and misinformation.

d1l8v4fn	In my opinion women calling other women pick me's is like men calling other men white knights or simps. Sometimes they genuinely are pick me's, sometimes they genuinely are simping, but the term gets thrown around so easily that it doesn't have a lot of meaning at all anymore. These are simply buzz words now. Like the terms Feminists like to use "incel" "scrote" if you call people those things purely as an insult, the word loses its intended meaning. And such doesn't mean much at all, most of the time it's the person throwing around insults like those who are actually the deluded ones. If I were to call a random woman on the street a bitch, does that make her a bitch?

d02d86er	Patriarchy definition:  "a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it."  Okay, so let's see if men's issues and a patriarchy can co-exist.   A patriarchy is built on the idea that men are more capable and should control things and women are weaker and should stay at home with the children.   "Men are subject to selective service". A patriarchy would see men as more capable, and therefore they should be the ones sent into war and they should make the tough decisions.   "very rarely given custody in family court" According to sexism and patriarchies, women are the ones who belong at home with the children. So the kids go to the women.   "commonly have to pay alimony" Men are supposed to be the strong breadwinners, they can pay. The poor women shouldn't have to work, they're supposed to be at home with the children after all. You know, the children that they won in the custody battle.  "are substantially more likely to be charged with the crime if done, and twice as likely to be convicted of the crime." Women aren't as smart or strong as men, so they aren't as dangerous! Let's let them off free, so they can get back to baking cookies and making sandwiches.   "They are laughed at and ignored when victims of rape and DV." Men are big and strong, they don't have to be protected like fragile little ladies. (I hope you can detect the heavy sarcasm.)  &#x200B;  When you think of stereotypes of the feminist movement, you might think of women wanting to the freedom to work instead of being forced to stay at home as a housewife. Or the idea that women are as strong as men and that they're not intrinsically better caregivers.   Now, let's see how some of those ideas about men, would be seen through a stereotypically feminist lenses.   "Men are subject to selective service." Women are just as capable as men, they can do what a man can do. If men can be drafted, then women can too.   "very rarely given custody in family court" Women aren't more nurturing then men, that's a sexist assumption. Both women and men can take care of their children.   Trying to free women from gender roles, would also free men from gender roles. If feminists fight against the ideas that one gender is inherently different or better then the other, then that idea can't be used against men. Now, some feminists are sexist as hell, and they're actually hurting men and women with their sexism. (Usually in TERF or radfem spaces.)   But feminism as a whole, the point of it is to fight sexism.	1641020192.0	hqs5e71	t3_rsmsmq	t3_rsmsmq	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsmsmq/feminism_was_broken_from_the_start/hqs5e71/

9d5310md	A lot of it is also has to do with how women show aggression, especially towards men. When a man wants to show aggression, chances are he will either directly intimidate you or assault you physically. When a woman decides to it, she cannot try those alleys because she will be weaker overall and that is an uphill battle. Nobody will take a 5'2" petite girl seriously if she decides to throw down.   Instead women show aggression through social and emotional attacks and literally anyone who has ever made a woman really mad can attest to this fact. In a sense, feminism is women's way of partaking in gang violence (mostly because they hate men as a group for some reason. Maybe they were ugly and rejected or maybe they had a shit relationship with a man in the past). This is also observable by the way they treat other women that disagree with their ways and their "empowerment". I am certain there are multiple women here who have been mistreated by the feminist hivemind because they dared disagree or ask a question the hivemind disapproved of. If feminism was truly just about women's empowerment (notice how I am not  even attempting to say equality but instead saying empowerment), these women wouldn't have been chased out.   The reason they cannot accept that men didn't really have it good and the reason they portray MRA's as evil incels, is because once they are forced to acknowledge it they cannot attack men without losing their social backing.    Or so is my theory. Feel free to add or discuss parts you disagree with, as long as your argument makes sense and isn't stemming from what you "feel".	1641025449.0	hqsc430	t3_rtb575	t3_rtb575	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtb575/the_feminist_basis_and_its_issues/hqsc430/

aba5aa1o	Originally feminism was simply about free choice. If you wanna be a housewife, free to go, if you wanna be a man who likes to focus on you family more, completely free to go. But unfortunately f-movement turned into poison. But I as a lady second guess patriarchy, although I submit to my boyfriend, because it make males suffer. They aren't full-power masters as moderns try to describe them. They weren't allowed to show emotions. What kind of regime gives men rights and economic power, but deprives them from the right to express feelings. This is the core reason why I am pro-mens rights. Old-school patriarchy also didn't allow men to get closer to their families and other similar things. These disturbing things about patriarchy must be most regarded, because you guys deserve compassion and loving environment. And I wish you to be gifted by fate with loving, adorable partners.

It's full of comments written by someone that is clearly extremely young that likes playing computer games for children. She has an obsession with playing computer games for young girls, like really young girls. What's a woman in her 40s/50s, one with kids doing playing computer games? Her overly exaggerated, pornographic story does not add up at all!! It's clearly nothing but a figment of her own imagination.   Don't let perverts/lowlifes like this girl her drive you to separate from women.

I'm just curious to see how many people have written off feminism entirely, and how many would be open to supporting it if the toxicity was taken out. Granted, it'd mean taking out about 60% of the entire ideology, but... well, it's a hypothetical.

glkrg48i	Exactly, we're talking in hypotheticals, but at the same time, I think.. I get it. you know? we're tribal people by nature.. the left gave women a cause to rally behind. an excuse. you aren't where you want to be in life? It's no longer your fault.. who wouldn't ride that train?   I think your last sentence, as tongue in cheek as it was, is quite accurate.. hell, even in the last 48 hours, I asked for proof on a post about some claims made, and they used the fact I post here, as reason to dismiss me.. when I'm here debating with you rationally about their movement and how to HELP it gain traction in the right way! this is my point.. Sanity and reason have gone out the window.   If a feminist mouthpiece does something.. it's great. if it comes from somebody on the otherside.. it's bad. it doesn't even matter what it is. It has gone TOO far down the toxic rabbit hole, how can it wind back? how do you go back from 'kill all men' how do you go back from 'all men must be taught not to rape' etc.   This isn't a fight that concerns me, I work from home, I'm married.. the only person I sexually assault is myself on tea breaks! but I'm fighting it because I feel so bad for all the young guys out there who are good people trying to find direction. because the feminist movement is the biggest redpill recruiter there is. and I do not agree with the redpill movement, I think it's the other side OF feminism. both crazy imo.	1641039774.0	hqssd14	t3_rsi039	t1_hqsnxrt	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsi039/if_they_could_define_misandry_and_feminism_as_two/hqssd14/

There is no benefit to being a bloke anymore, 10-20 years ago, maybe. but not anymore, hell, the biggest proof the wage gap doesn't exist IS capatalism. because if it did, the male unemployment rate would be higher by a large % as companies would hire women for cheaper.. Capitalism doesn't give a fuck about your feelings. so the fact that isn't happening... goes a good way to disproving its existence without some bent stats.	1641039956.0	hqsskue	t3_rtfgzm	t3_rtfgzm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtfgzm/least_pathetic_modern_feminist/hqsskue/

9xisz247	Feminism at first was a good thing. I would've even called myself a feminist if I was around back then. Women should have the right to vote and the right to stray from traditional gender roles.   I hate gender roles and stereotypes more then anything. A core reason I'm so against feminism is that they perpetuate negative stereotypes for men. (Men are stupid, drunk, sex pigs, and clueless privileged oppressors.)  Maybe if feminism put a little more attention into breaking the negative stereotypes of men, rather than encouraging them, I'd be a lot less hostile.	1641077820.0	hqv20yl	t3_rtluch	t3_rtluch	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtluch/is_it_sexist_to_oppose_old_classical_feminism_do/hqv20yl/

aebs2hfc	Patriarchy benefits women who don't want to be whores and who do want to have a family and a stable monogamous relationship. Patriarchy also benefits uglier women to find such fulfilling child raising family relationships because men have a harder time hooking up casually, so more men decide to settle for marriages.  What these half brains don't realize is destroying the patriarchy is destroying the family but forming a family is more like a sacrifice and settling for something proper instead of messing around and having fun for men so it's a compromise and they can and do very well do without it but the majority of women end up miserable in a society where forming stable families is discouraged or frowned upon.	1641082482.0	hqvcvvt	t3_rtfgzm	t3_rtfgzm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtfgzm/least_pathetic_modern_feminist/hqvcvvt/

runoh	I believe that women and men should be treated equally under the law. But there are also biological natural differences that lead to different behaviors, outcomes, and choices.  We live in a society where literally everything has been designed to undermine anything male to the point of horrific discrimination against men in school, the professions, and certainly in the law. That's not healthy for society. And it's not healthy at all for women. And I believe the vast majority of women are quite happy in traditional roles of gender and sexuality and marriage.  That's the irony here. Yes I think some elite like university type feminists have gained a little bit.

Funnily enough, I think that calling that behaviour childish in and of itself is incredibly charitable. I’d call it something far worse.

1x6rbyhc	Well, most bugs in games come from predominantly female teams, so there's that.  Lower standards for joining campus, does in fact mean subpar abilities. Statistics are exactly what I'm using here. The High School exam is a standardized test to determine where students land in the bell curve in question. Therefore, unless you're claiming that women are lower intelligence lifeform compared to men, setting a lower standard/bar for them is favoritism (this is a fact). Based on this, it is logical to say they have sub par abilities. There are not more boys, not in the world, not is school...heck, there's no species with more males than females. So your statement: "If the standards are lower that doesn’t imply subpar abilities it just implies that standards are higher for males because there’s simply more of them." Makes absolutely no sense, not statistically, not quintessentially.  To say that the scores for women are adequate, is frankly just an insult to the collective intelligence of men. They're not adequate, they are sub par, the par here set by thousands of years of male engineers, and decades of effective computer coding standards.  This sub par standard of admission, is a product of the gynocentric project, a product of feminism. I stand firmly against it, not just because I utterly abhor feminism, but because the logic of opposing it, is sound. Gynocentrism has no place in a civilisation seeking to progress itself. If you want all individuals to be equal, then equal standards must be applied to all of them. This is not a question of gender politics, it is a question of the very purpose of learning institutions. If the standard for joining school, is feminized, then all men might as well forego school, and take apprenticeship opportunities with fellow men. Otherwise, schools, and learning institutions must be kept fair.  You, my dude, have lost perspective, on the purpose of this forum. Even worse, you have lost perspective on the actual purpose of tertiary learning institutions.	1641110894.0	hqwvnyc	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqkthrz	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwvnyc/
3sl19poy	Bell curves are skewed by higher populations so if there are more men that enter the field, the standard has to be higher to put the bell curve back in the middle. It’s like the economic concept that in order to get more companies entering into perfect competition, the prices for the product have to lower. That doesn’t mean that it’s lower quality, it just means that there’s shortage. Also where is your source that most bugs come from female teams? If you would link me the article that you’ve read that or where you found your proof then I’d like that. Also yes, statistically more males enter stem subjects than females just because more women exist does not mean that there are more of them entering stem. You even conceded to the fact that for decades, engineering and computer science has been male dominated so of course there are more men entering stem.	1641111447.0	hqwwdbm	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwvnyc	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwwdbm/

Clementine Ford is the epitome of classic feminism. She is a misandristic and misogynistic refuse dump of animated hatred.  She is a hypocrite and a cunt of the highest order. The fact that she is a woman means absolutely nothing to me. I'd say the exact same words if Clementine Ford was actually Clayton Ford.  I made a post 8 months ago [where she excused women who commit infanticide as victims of depression and of men being the abusive monsters that drove them to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/n05se9/famous_and_prominent_australian_feminist_believes/).

1x6rbyhc	You do realize that here the discussion is about joining campus, not choosing a course. Even then, standardization is not something to be pushed around to favour the intellectual capacity of anyone. Wanna join stem? Get the grades, this is not sport, you don't shorten the metre so women can be taller. Also, an economic concept, is not an economic fact. If a company wants to compete, in a free market, you let the market decide.  The regulation of pricing are not for the benefit of the company, they're for the benefit of the consumers (citizens). In the same regard, it is deplorable, that because of the whining of some people (feminists), consumers get sub par people working on their products. Bug ridden games and apps, with horrid stories an UXs. Badly edited CGI in films, with an inexistent entertainment value. Faulty phones that explode on charge, because someone though it looks good with the battery fitting the frame. Range rovers with neither range nor rove, that also have a terribly "small" driving experience. Ineffective governments, with leaders who cannot think with their heads. A global society of "the learned" populated with PhD holders, good...except the PhD is in online sexual harassment and other such majors. A civilization of people afraid to say what they truly think about things, because some wide hipped apes, have a tendency to brigade them out of their freedom of speech. A legal system, built to favour certain people, in every possible way; just because they have more holes. Thus stands the matriarchist planet, engulfed in abject terror, choked by the silicone tits of the neo-fascists; the feminists. Yeah, gynocentrism really improved the world, huh?  As for the article, I'll look for it when I find time to do that. For now, I think I'll take a break from this, before I get too frustrated by your lack of perspective.	1641113606.0	hqwz2it	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwwdbm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwz2it/
3sl19poy	Okay but you hinted that you went to this school that the commenter was talking about. What school is that exactly where they have the set of parameters? Besides I didn’t say it was pushing the intellectual capacity in favor of anyone, it’s pushing the population capacity. Besides economic concepts are economic facts? The entire definition of an economy is classified as a concept. If I said economic theory that would be different. Besides, until you could provide proof of what you’re claiming, it’s really not fact, just an emotional assertion that you have. Besides, I’m pretty sure history has a more in depth complex history of women being beaten into sexual slavery and denied basic human rights, so I’m sorry that equality looks like oppression to you but that’s your prerogative	1641114138.0	hqwzq65	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwz2it	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hqwzq65/

d1l8v4fn	I think a lot of us *just want to be happy*, atleast that's what I want. Life really gets you down sometimes, it gets your mind going through all sorts of things - how you got here, people that've wronged you in the past, people that are still wronging people in the current day, opportunities you've missed or messed up somehow. It's important not to lash out like a wild beast, saying the worst most vile things you can think of in an attempt to damage anyone reading what you wrote, this achieves nothing. When I was a little kid my mother used to say " If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all ". I've had women come after me on dating apps, matching with me just to send me an essay on why I'm a bad person or how I'm not doing enough. One has tried to get me fired from my job before, another young woman from a dating app has an Instagram account she uses to advertise her Onlyfans, on said Instagram she posts all the profiles of men she takes issue with, basically just venting her frustrations with any feature she took issue with, problem is she was doing it on a public space. I've had one of my cars keyed for turning down a date with a woman. All I was ever looking for really was happiness, someone to commit to long term, but I found a lot of hate and manipulation along the way. Now I'm indifferent to it/them, I can't relate to their way of thinking.	1641114672.0	hqx0dvg	t3_rta2xb	t1_hqtbpf2	/r/antifeminists/comments/rta2xb/what_are_the_rules_for_this_sub_and_are_females/hqx0dvg/

99cker03	Ah yes the benefits of being able to get assaulted and you can't do shit about. All the most life risking jobs are at our disposal for us to die on while to nice saf eons are reserved for women. The privilege of child support. Even having to pay it if its not your child  what an amazing thing to have. The gracious ability to be sent to prison two times longer than a woman if not they get sent at all. Never being able to say a thing about what is going on in your life without being called a bitch is such great privilege. While women are entitled to emotional care and support. Never in any future will we have rights as a fathers. Nor rights to our belongings after divorce. Yes we have such great fucking privilege.	1641119756.0	hqx6hvz	t3_rtfgzm	t3_rtfgzm	/r/antifeminists/comments/rtfgzm/least_pathetic_modern_feminist/hqx6hvz/

feumoazx	But the main post is not rape, not coercive sex since the customer didn’t forced her of anything he paid for a service, the reason why she’s doing it (having ton of debt) is not of his concern.   You understand that if everything is a form a coercion then something is wrong about your argument. Your trying to stay coherent by saying « yes some form of coercion are just worse than other » but that doesn’t change the fact that your argument is ridicule. There’s something called responsibility, I know you women don’t like it   she has the responsibility to pay for all her irresponsable debt, nobody forced her to have debt. how she’s paying back is not of the debt issuer concern because she’s an adult   The reason why she’s doing prostitution is not the concern of her customers, they are just paying for a service.	1641122085.0	hqx9b04	t3_rqxo0v	t1_hqwx929	/r/antifeminists/comments/rqxo0v/if_it_wasnt_ever_enjoyablethen_why_did_you_do_it/hqx9b04/

e13pa32v	Now after talking to many antifeminist women here, i see, most antifeminist women have more male friends, because they all were bullied since childhood by their own fellow girls... And this law applies to Boomers, Millenials, and the Gen Z...  There is this girl in my class, no one talk to her, probably she is depressed too (I mean, i was once too, so I know how it feels). She doesn't talk with anyone either... I like her though (as a sensible man, i have never liked a girl so much, she's a special case though)  Maybe i can atleast be her friend, or maybe help her out of depression so she talks more with others... Well i will make sure to atleast make her happier than the bitchy ones :)	1641122509.0	hqx9t78	t3_rpyoa8	t3_rpyoa8	/r/antifeminists/comments/rpyoa8/why_am_i_not_a_feminist/hqx9t78/

5bz207z4	I love that she goes on to claim that men are the abusers  Data shows that women initiate domestic abuse more than men and are the victims of reciprocal violence.  Data also shows that we are more likely to abuse children than men.  Data also shows that women are more likely to murder their own child, and more likely again if that child is a daughter.   Rape of women by men is a horrendous crime, nobody, in any Western culture supports or endorses it against women, it's also been falling consistently since the 1980s as a crime everywhere.   On the other hand child murder, child abuse, child sex trafficking by women as a crime has been increasing globally since the 1980s.  But they don't want to do the actual research and get their facts, they'd all rather rely on tropes of outdated information.	1641122917.0	hqxaavh	t3_ru3etw	t3_ru3etw	/r/antifeminists/comments/ru3etw/sniff_sniff_smell_that_i_smell_hypocrisy/hqxaavh/

awg1ag7s	I'm especially interested in the area of violent crime victims. How do women get off saying that they're scared to walk down the street out of fear of being raped yet men never complain about being scared of being murdered, assaulted or robbed. Men make up the majority of victims of violent crime so shouldn't we be more scared. My theory is that women are conditioned to be scared. They're only scared because it's fuelled by the media with bullshit like 97%. Mass hysteria you could describe it as.

The study itself in its wider context was meant to show the links between men's behaviour and outcomes leading to rape but it just made people who claim rape culture look mentally unstable.   Funnily enough it has been proven by peer reviewed science that most feminists are mentally unstable.	1641140836.0	hqy5xyd	t3_ru3etw	t1_hqy5ck2	/r/antifeminists/comments/ru3etw/sniff_sniff_smell_that_i_smell_hypocrisy/hqy5xyd/

By the time that you have woken up, the other survivor in this plane has claimed all of the coconuts on all of the coconut trees, stacked them on their piles, sheltered that pile from all the wreckage from the plane, declared they own it, and they say that they would be willing to give you said coconuts if you throat their cock.

77o6a7cx	If you want to take it literally and assume what she means, then I can too. And what I got from it is, a lot of men don't know how to humble themselves when getting attention they've never recieved before. To me beauty is in the eyes of the beholder so who is anyone to classify a whole group of people as ugly? Which also makes me question why you're okay with classifying a whole group of people as ugly. You can accuse her of being judgemental, you can even bash her for the way she worded it, but the way I see it she's not wrong.	1641160532.0	hqzm9kw	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzky5x	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzm9kw/

evsusrl	I'm not okay with classifying a whole group of people as ANYTHING, other than people.  Okay. What if we flipped it?   Would giving an ugly woman a chance make her so conceited that she thinks she rules the world? I can absolutely guarantee you that Eilish would say no; that means she's implying only men would exhibit this behavior...  But, since that's hypothetical I'll go with EXACTLY what she said and exactly what you said.     "Give an ugly guy a chance and he thinks he rules the world"  For argument sake, let's categorize men into "Ugly" and "Not Ugly". (This is obviously not the case, as I agree with what you stated in "beauty is in the eye of the beholder")   This implies that all "Ugly" men are inherently so low self esteem (like your ex), that if given a chance (Note- she simply said "given a chance", not any sort of specific chance) they will now be so conceited to "think they rule the world".   So what does this mean of "Not Ugly" men? Are Not Ugly men impervious to this conceit? Are they so used to being treated nicely that they don't have that conceit?  As you said, your ex had low self esteem and turned out to be a cheater. So was he Ugly? Or did he just have low self esteem? Or both? Because I know plenty of men that are handsome as fuck and have low self esteem.   In your own words, beauty is in the eye of the beholder... Okay, so that means literally any and all men can be put into the Ugly category, since it's subjective, meaning that any and all men have that in them to become so conceited they think they rule the world.   So are ALL men just waiting for "chance" so they can feel like king of the universe, or is that only the ugly ones?   She throughout a blanket statement over men, not people. This is a sexist statement. You agreed with her argument, because of your anecdotal experience with ONE man.   Perhaps I'm looking too far into it (I did write a novel lol), but do you really not see how this could easily be denigrating all men, implying men are so easily corruptible that as long they are ugly, they can be convinced they are "ruler of the world"?   Sorry about all the downvotes, if you even care lol.   I hope you reply, I'm genuinely curious about your take.	1641162137.0	hqzqe39	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzm9kw	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzqe39/

77o6a7cx	I do see what you mean. People who want to take the word ugly and adhere it to people who don't fit the societal norms is horribly judgemental and wrong. The way she worded it was horrible. As I see it, is the way I worded it. If you give someone whose not used to good attention and gain a lot of it at once, they aren't gonna know how to act, now mix that with an abundance of confidence and testosterone... Not to say if the roles were reversed an equivalent wouldn't happen, but usually the equivalent would be something like "the hoe phase". I do see the blanket statements though, usually blanket statements are horrible but from my own personal expirience, it is very much true except for the use of the word ugly. It's more about the attention or lack there of, then looks.	1641163733.0	hqzui2p	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzqe39	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzui2p/

evsusrl	Ah, I can see what you're saying as well, though I do have the complete opposite experience.   The thing is, I've experienced something similar with women multiple times, even to the point of being abused. (After the giving of a "chance", although I hate looking at it that way), but I would never ever agree with someone saying something like Ellish did, about men or women, or anyone for that matter. I find it despicable frankly.   She's said many other sexist and denigrating things that absolutely DO apply to all men, so perhaps I'm letting bias affect my view. It's entirely possible.   With that said, I can agree with most of your argument. I appreciate your reply.	1641164370.0	hqzw48j	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzui2p	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzw48j/
77o6a7cx	Yeah Billie has definetly been going down the wrong path lately. I think her fame has been getting to her head. Looking at all the awful things she's been saying/doing recently I can see how that would make you bias to this one thing. If I had remembered before commenting some of the shitty things she's been saying I probably would have had the same thoughts as you, but when I saw this, my first thought was when you give someone something they're not used to, they're not gonna know what to do with it and it's about a 50/50 chance they're gonna abuse it.	1641164795.0	hqzx72a	t3_ruep0e	t1_hqzw48j	/r/antifeminists/comments/ruep0e/thank_you_ms_eilish/hqzx72a/

aba5aa1o	Well, I can say that this is the ugly truth of modern days. Going shaking your bootie, drinking like hell and similar "party animal" bull* is zero empowering.  The primal role applying to the humanity before all gender roles is to be a good person.  I don't care about who is in charge. I am completely fine with Male domination. Tbh I think it's exciting. The things a person man/woman needs are peace, serenity and order. As long as those features dominate a life, a person doesn't need empowerment because they won't feel oppressed.  But unfortunately in real life sh*t happens, and people, especially men have problems to be solved which affect their health and emotional state, and they deserve compassion, understanding and support.   I as a lady am here to do what I can to try to relieve you. God bless you.	1641166005.0	hr009hk	t3_ru88w3	t3_ru88w3	/r/antifeminists/comments/ru88w3/men_and_women_are_not_the_same_rather_we/hr009hk/

aba5aa1o	I get it. You are in a state when you don't feel like entering a relationship and this is fine. Love is amazing thing, but every person has a different fateful time for it. You aren't obligated to feel attraction. It's a choice. Before feminism begin a poison, it was simply about free choice. I see no respect to your choice and that speaks very bad to them.

tffxn	I am huge anti-feminist in terms of wester culture, but this smell little bit, it is pretty much generalization and it is false information. Many people generally like confident people, maybe people who are little bit intimidating, because that is what "confidence" and "dominance" mean in the most basic meaning. The other things come around and said ladies do not know any difference between the positive and negative way of said terms. You know the truth when they say "I can not find any good guy" and similar things, when it is all about abuse..you know.      And this has nothing to do with feminism. Many ladies are feminist, but I do not really know the term? Passive feminist? Like those who preach stuff but act the whole different way.     And that is why I am saying it, that sub is the wrong place to ask, because most of those ladies are maybe feminist, by the definition, but really are just passive ones for the social and internet karma, nothing else.	1641168899.0	hr07hzx	t3_rsvbv7	t3_rsvbv7	/r/antifeminists/comments/rsvbv7/most_of_the_comments_under_this_post_are_from/hr07hzx/

Which is odd because she loves the way we raise our daughter and I had always praised the in law for being who she was and what she was doing with her life.. until she came looking for a fight! (She’s so entitled, toxic and narcissistic it’s disgusting how much two of her siblings worship her and will probably have issues within their marriages if they continue to listen to her…) anyways! She praises us for how we raise our daughter but I guess is too dense to to see just how we are raising her.. to be a wife, a mother but also educated and able to take care of herself without crushing her husbands soul.

6dr1ijt7	If you have equality in your marriage, it means you both have an individualistic mindset.  Essentially, turning it into a transaction where each person needs to do a defined set of household chores or other duties to balance things 50/50.  (And even then one could argue that it still isn’t “equal” in their mind and create conflict.)   Women also tend to get spousal support if they are earning less so basically she gets to rob her ex-roommate/husband.   As a man, if you’re smart you’ll find a woman who will let you take the lead, respects your authority, will do the household chores without being told to do so (you can help occasionally and do the more physically intensive tasks) and sees you as family instead of a roommate.	1641187395.0	hr1dgs0	t3_rurutr	t1_hr1a3hl	/r/antifeminists/comments/rurutr/anti_feminism_should_be_about_equality_not_about/hr1dgs0/

But it clearly doesn't. In my experience (and probably most people here), Feminism makes women miserable because it robs them of their agency and puts all the onus, blame, and responsibility on men.  Hell, at least most bullshit religions preach personal accountability. Feminism can't even do that.	1641197288.0	hr1ss9h	t3_rumd7r	t3_rumd7r	/r/antifeminists/comments/rumd7r/im_a_woman_and_i_think_modern_day_feminism_is/hr1ss9h/

1x6rbyhc	Equality is having the same standard for both. Different standards are a hallmark of favoritism. There's no history of women being beaten into sexual slavery and denied basic human rights. In fact for the 50,000 years of sapient humans being in existence, women have had far more "rights" than men. The whole weaker sex system, is meant to ensure the protection of women. Men have always been seen as tools, and if your mindset is anything to go by, I'd say that's not going to change. What I have stated are lived experiences, and are facts. This is an set of logical sequences, not emotional assertions. Economic concepts are not facts, the very term "concept" shows this.  What you have continuously attempted to deny, is the fact that the lower standards for women to join tertiary learning institutions is an illustration of gynocentrism, and a result of feminism. You have also denied and attempted to justify the result of this (sub par labor-force). This attempt to misdirect the core subject with nonsensical illustrations, concert tickets and such, is rather pointless. I have alluded to experiencing a similar system, not the exact same.   I think you know that a lower standard illustrates gynocentrism. You are thus attempting, like all feminists, to justify it and beatify it. You have lost the plot here, and in doing so proven what everyone knows. Feminism stops, when true equality is demanded. The statistical evidence, the real-life experiences and the logical sequences; have displayed the nude favoritism that feminists, and indeed women want. It's nothing new, 50,000 years of evolution (cultural) has made you what you are. Accept the facts, and quit trying to mould the data into something it's not.	1641199534.0	hr1vo5o	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwzq65	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1vo5o/
3sl19poy	I mean yeah there is, women didn’t have the right to vote, were sold into marriage contracts, were sold into harems, were collected as wives by cult leaders, African American slaves were raped in order to produce more slave offspring, many academic institutions didn’t allow women into higher education until the mid 1850s. I’m sorry my dear but the list goes on. Also you’re claiming your undeniable logic, but you keep failing to provide sources for what you’re referencing. I’ve got sources on hand. I hate to break it you but logic isn’t subjective. Plus, all I’m doing is illustrating the population statistics example of demand curve. Let’s apply it to a different group of people then. You being from Kenya, know that there are many brilliant students there that go to study abroad in America, but not as many of them apply to American colleges as Americans do, so in order to ensure that more of the exchange student population gets into these American schools, they make the test score standards for Americans slightly higher so that less of them get in.	1641200083.0	hr1wd3e	t3_rix4o6	t1_hr1vo5o	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1wd3e/

1x6rbyhc	Articles and data in the UNWomen.org forums is international. Sourcing the information therein, shows that this lowering of standard to ensure women join campus; is indeed an international phenomenon. What this essentially means, is that the global population of educated women, is only as such, because of gynocentrism, not because they actually put in the work. The said uneven distribution, is not because women did not have the right to join campus, it's because they want the benefits without the work.  A lowering of standards for women is one thing, but increasing standards so that less men join is another. And it happens. The reasoning I have received from education stakeholders, is that there's "not enough space." Essentially, giving away places to women, while ensuring boys do not have equal access to education. This is feminism, this is women, this is the gynocentric dogma. IT's fine to increase the standards, it just means smarter men. But to go and also attempt to push the same gynocentrism to companies, that's an overreach (guess it comes with having an ovary each).  Furthermore, placement in American colleges does actually have "equality" quotas. I find it weird that you would attempt to defend this by simply omitting facts that are available online. Of course, America is very broken country, so I expected such idiocy to exist there. Problem is when it's the entire planet playing gynocentric simp, that's a disaster waiting to happen.	1641200388.0	hr1wqo1	t3_rix4o6	t1_hqwzxln	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1wqo1/

3sl19poy	No I said the placement system that you referenced does not take place on an international basis first of all. In most American schools, placement exams only exist using what you’ve applied to. That’s what I was saying doesn’t exist on an international basis. Sorry you misunderstood. Also do you mind linking me these specific articles and data? You also say that men aren’t having equal access to education when computer science is offered at 86% of American schools including on the two year levels and certificate levels, so no the access to education is still equal. When did I ever say women did not have the right to join the campus by the way? That is not what I said, I just said that there are less women that want to join the campus than men, that’s what a skewed bell curve is caused by. Occupational aspirations for computer science is less common in women, so that’s where the skew comes from.	1641200891.0	hr1xe1n	t3_rix4o6	t1_hr1wqo1	/r/antifeminists/comments/rix4o6/what_roblox_posted_during_international_mens_day/hr1xe1n/

5bz207z4	I don't think that's the case, yes I agree when the economy broke in 2008 we saw an explosion in blame, there were in fact hardly any news reports related to race and then in 2008 the news media owned and controlled by the wealthy pushed a narrative of hate towards race and towards men in general.   So yes I agree with you on that point, I am not so in agreement that fixing the economy is the answer to the underlying issue.   I think then in reality the news cycle gave rise and vent to the massive undercurrent of hidden hatred towards men and traditional women and traditional values and I don't think that's going to go away, even fixing the economy isn't going to push these things back to the fringe because they have become too mainstream for too long.   Certainly long enough for the general public to accept this is the way it is.   I think in reality the only thing that will stop it is women themselves, of course that's asking women to speak up for men, yes and it's about time, those women who enjoy men, those women who want men must speak up and shit down those who demonise all for behaviour of a few, men speaking up get silenced because it's an easy win for feminists to do, they are nothing if not willing to take the easy win, however it's much harder for them to take down a woman, to have a woman who they claim to speak for speaking against them.  As men we have to remember one of our greatest weaknesses is to try to fix things, to fix an issue whenever a woman says something is a problem, that's has been used against us for too long, the problem is that we cannot fix the brainwashing that happens to feminists, many are openly mentally unstable and claim that being with other openly mentally unstable people and targeting their hate towards others helps them. They have already made up their mind about men, we have a penis and balls, or maybe not depending on your viewpoint, but we are men and by nature of being men we are warmongers and rapists and no amount of truth or facts will change their views, that they benefit from and openly enjoy benevolent sexism and do not see the hypocrisy is irrelevant.   It's not them who we need to change but those who's views are open to change, that is usually those who are listening, undecided, that's where good women speaking up can make the difference because try as we might speaking up does nothing but get us shut down.  The end result though is always going to be a race to the bottom, too many women enjoy men and enjoy the collective of feminism, too many enjoy the benefits of benevolent sexism and enjoy the sense of belonging to a group calling themselves feminists who will not speak up but at the same time will claim they actually don't hate men.   Then of course there are the women who don't hate men just some of the things some men do, goes the same for some women, they will not speak up because they believe their views are irrelevant, inconsequential and don't want to face the accusations of being a pick me.  Eventually the squeaky wheel gets the grease and these women will lose out, data shows its already begun to happen and will get worse, when it crosses that tipping point who will they have to blame, you guessed it.	1642515840.0	ht6gkeb	t3_s5kzpp	t1_ht69ut5	/r/antifeminists/comments/s5kzpp/i_cringed_so_hard_after_seeing_this_shit/ht6gkeb/

I had deep discussions on askwomen for example and I was banned for having them.   Fact is, feminists dont want discussions. They want you to nod and obey.	1642517566.0	ht6kkqn	t3_s3eg35	t3_s3eg35	/r/antifeminists/comments/s3eg35/feminism_vs_egalitarianism/ht6kkqn/

Consent as far as anything verbal, it's a bit more of a grey area, but even then, there are societal limits.  But consent as far as LOOKING?  I'm sorry, that's where it's absolutely bogus.  People are visually driven.  It's what a pair of working eyes are designed to do.  And so if someone doesn't like the fact that they're aware of VISUAL ATTENTION upon themselves, regardless of what they're wearing - well, sorry, but that's not the fault of the beholder that you're both in the same line of sight.	1642517805.0	ht6l58p	t3_s6emw2	t1_ht5mqia	/r/antifeminists/comments/s6emw2/ah_yes_very_logical/ht6l58p/

cuje14s5	Yes, feminists love to say mysoginy and the patriarchy hurts both sexes. Thats their fallback after you list all men's issues. So now the feminist goal is to dismantle the patriarchy all over the globe.  The issue is, the patriarchy didn't actually exist. They're chasing a Ghost. But they think they're fighting the good fight. They dont realize they're creating more tension and more issues with their movement. Because "how could feminism be wrong, its about equality".   No miss, this kind of thinking is authoritarian and borderline fascistic.	1642520557.0	ht6s0vp	t3_s70461	t3_s70461	/r/antifeminists/comments/s70461/argument_against_societal_norms_cause_the_wage_gap/ht6s0vp/

737crz7b	I have been speaking about this for years. About 30 years ago I attended a state university in NJ that has a women’s college (can you imagine a state university that uses taxpayer dollars having a male college?) and I dated a woman who was an RA at one of the dorms. One afternoon I was visiting her and some young women came in with a concern. The first-year students had to take a mandatory women’s studies class and the professor told them that if they wanted to be feminists they had to be lesbians. These women wanted to be feminists but they were heterosexual and didn’t want to eat at the Y. I stayed quiet but, when asked my opinion, I suggested that they complain to the department chair and the dean because that wasn’t education…it was indoctrination. This is when I started to look around and realized that the feminist movement wasn’t only anti-men it was also anti-heterosexual.   Straight women who allowed lesbians into the feminist movement assumed that they had something in common because they were all women. What they didn’t realize was that the two groups had completely different experiences when it comes to men. Straight women wanted to improve their relationships with men while lesbians wanted to replace men. To that end, lesbians acted just like men do when they want to take a woman away from their man….they listen to their complaints, show sympathy, offer a shoulder to cry on, provide tokens of affection, etc. Straight women see this coming when it’s done by men but they don’t see that they’re being seduced when lesbians are doing it.	1642521442.0	ht6ucbe	t3_s6tfla	t1_ht5tgdh	/r/antifeminists/comments/s6tfla/what_proportion_of_feminist_ideology_is_pushed_by/ht6ucbe/

cuje14s5	Look into the John Money experiment. Look into more egalitarian societies (like Sweden) and what occupations do the 2 genders occupy. Ask the hard question: why are feminists obsessed with occupations with power? Why dont they seek equal representation on all levels of workforce? Why dont they seek equal representation in electricians or plumbers?  Because they dont seek equality. They dont do that for the same reason they never bring up any men's issues. Feminists dont work for equality. They work for superiority. Dont let them talk with their words.

dmwlt5jl	You're forgetting an essential element, a lot of physical labor employers flat out refuse to hire women (even if they have an outstanding resume in the field), mock and discourage them from continuing their application, and even when they get these jobs, they are often mocked or treated differently, they are given lesser roles because they aren't seen as 'capable'.  Feminist are and have been fighting for women in those workforces. Only to be told that's 'not where women belong, what did you expect'  You want more women in these fields? Help stop the stigma around them not being women's jobs. Advocate for the women already in those fields, advocate for women trying to get into those fields, let employers know that women are just as capable, speak out against the hostility that is directed towards those women.  If you're not contributing to making an environment with less stigma and bias around the job then you're part of the problem.

dmwlt5jl	No it's health care in the way that they are sometimes required for certain surgeries, it's required to be on other medications (like acutane, sometimes treatments for other diseases), they are used to treat many different conditions, diseases, and issues.   Acne, endometriosis, cysts, cancer, I could go on.  And sometimes it is just used to prevent pregnancy and that's ok too. Because for some people pregnancy is life threatening, there are a million situations and all of them are health care.   It's not equivalent to lip fillers because that is a surgery purely for cosmetic reasons with no health intentions behind it. It's optional the way that an inhaler is optional. For some people it's the difference between life and death, and for some people it just makes life a little more comfortable, and there's a whole range of reasons and reactions between those two.	1642695620.0	hth39bm	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hth1qjd	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hth39bm/

It's also really tough to stay with this kind of betrayal and will probably make him a less good parent to the second child he was tricked into having.

35c0i	Then why don't they give similar the healthcare to men rather than push sexist legislation?  Lets look at what they did in Obamacare around this area...  https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/  All women's birth control including tubal ligation, female condoms, IUDs, etc are free by federal law. As you can see, vasectomy, male condoms, and any future male pill or vasogel is explicitly not covered.  We opted for the safer, simpler, more reliable, lower cost, lower risk of complications vasectomy. It cost us a $1k deductible, while my wife could have gotten a riskier, more complicated, less reliable, higher cost, higher risk of complications tubal for free. IMO that is discrimination against men and forces reproductive responsibilities onto women in families of lessor means. No one cares about men, but women may be heard on that second point.  https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/  Preventive care coverage also has three categories. Adult, women, and children.  Domestic violence screening, STD testing, and smoking cessation programs are free for women, not adults. There are free cancer screenings for women (PAP, mammogram), but none for prostate cancer (PSA).  If states have mandated that insurance plans cover vasectomy or PSA without a copay, you can no longer get a high deductible plan in compliance with both state and federal law in 2021 because vasectomies/PSA cannot be considered free preventive care like tubals/mammogram/PAP.  See:  https://www.apbenefitadvisors.com/2018/03/08/irs-vasectomies-are-not-aca-preventive-care/  https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/irs-transition-rule-hsas-male-contraception.aspx	1642696962.0	hth6wed	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hth1dv2	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hth6wed/

5n5yiqb1	It irks me how.words have seemingly lost their original meaning.  Feminism was not this idea that one gender deserves more privilege than another gender.  It was about having the same platform to climb from.  Same rights, same consequences, same opportunities.  Equal treatment and equal footing.  The thought that a movement of equality is now a movement turning into anything but equality is horrible   I would love to see the real feminists of this world reclaim that word and bring it back to what it was meant to be.  I'm all for equality across any group of people, but the shit I see these days is not that.	1642697633.0	hth8qdi	t3_s8lkd8	t3_s8lkd8	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/hth8qdi/

Personal experience: a family friend was in a SUPER abusive marriage. Her husband was one of like 5 of the small town police officers. She was pretty stuck. She ended up pregnant. He told her "get an abortion, or I beat it out of you". In that case getting the abortion was the best thing she could do for her own safety.

It also doesn't address a lot of the actual issues that women need addressed, but rather seems to slap a bandaid on it and call it good.

Feminism has lost its meaning for a while and its dumb for feminists to hate on women who are anti feminists	1642699190.0	hthd1ua	t3_s8lkd8	t3_s8lkd8	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/hthd1ua/

FDS doesn’t want gender equality, they are hard against the lgbtq movement and incredibly racist, they are just all around reactionary, which makes them the political enemies of progressive feminism.  It’s also not a no true Scotsman when the only people you are excluding are people who objectively do not fit the widely accepted definition of the word “feminist”. Ffs, a big chunk of FDS kweeeeens don’t even attempt at calling themselves feminists.	1642699657.0	hthedso	t3_s8ka0o	t1_hth99yf	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8ka0o/would_you_guys_still_marry_a_female_if_you_found/hthedso/
e6yjqcmd	Give her my time and resources upon knowing that she's a feminist? Over my dead body sir! And marriage? Now that's funny sire.  But in all seriousness, the problem is that a whole lot of modern women are chameleons in this regard. The deceit, the subterfuge, the dishonesty, that's what you better look out for. They can say just about everything that you would want to hear before marriage, then the true color would be revealed.  That's why dear Men, and this is advice from a prominent public figure who actually cares about Men: Close your eyes. Close your ears. Just look at the actions of women. What they do or did, the choices they made, how they're moving through life. You'll have a pretty (or not) clear picture of the woman you're dealing with.

We never do it back through, we respect women (only the good ones) with respect  You as a feminist might have got my respect, but you are a troll, I have seen enough of your comments since months...  Feminism is and will be a shitty ideology, it was okay till the 1st wave, now it's a trash idea... Spreading it further is making the balance get unstable...

5x9r4ntn	Do you mean the left-wing ones that abandon liberty at the first sight of it being a hinderance? Or the ones that until recently were considered far-right, and actually upheld the values of liberty? If you read about the second ones they were one of those groups that the left was created to oppose, and have a completely different philosophical framework that rejects Rousseau in favour of Locke. Evidence agrees with Locke, and he has been the inspiration by US Republicans used to fight a US democrat enacted set of laws known as "Jim Crow Laws".  That is the same tactic as feminists saying that they are the women's rights movement, when they actually hindered it.   The critical flaw is upstream so arguing which proven liars are the good guys, when we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that none of them are is pointless.	1642700333.0	hthg9s0	t3_s8370g	t1_htgvw8e	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8370g/proof_feminists_dont_actually_care_about_women/hthg9s0/

9l7rdcfg	If a woman desires to show more body parts in public, then surely she is trying to look sexy and therefore wants sex (And not with her boyfriend if she's going to a party like that). A dress like that is fine for in the house to impress your partner, but presenting yourself in front of others dressed like that really shows you have no dedication to your partner and want sexual attention from others. Think about it. You know I'm right. I'm from a high school where just about every girl was desperate for sex.	1642700593.0	hthgzl6	t3_s7gvb2	t1_htfrcgm	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7gvb2/i_say_a_what_yall_say/hthgzl6/

dmwlt5jl	Ok I just assumed that "The South" was pretty commonly used to refer to the southern part of usa as I have seen many people in and out of America refer to it that way and I assumed you would infer what I meant (which you did). So I apologize.   My intelligence is just fine thank you. I had a full ride academic scholarship and am a fully functioning adult, but that aside I don't really understand what good insulting my intelligence does, especially since you were accusing me of using personal attacks.   If you obsessively read my comments as much as you say you do then you'd see that I also support men's rights. I have spoken out for and done a lot of action involving men's rights. I have researched and written papers getting to the root of many of those issues.   I have never spoken against men's rights, I have only spoken for men and women's rights to be side by side.   >We never do it back through, we respect women (only the good ones) with respect  This is very easy to prove false. I see sexist trolls every day, this isn't special occurrence. You literally made an entire post just to dox me lol. I see all men as inherently good and all women as inherently good. It's not for me to decide who is good and bad, who has value and who doesn't. I make it my goal to treat everyone with respect unless they have done something specifically to disrespect me, then I will stand up for myself.  I will continue to stand up for the things near and dear to my heart, but I will never hate men just for being men nor would I hinder any progress towards men's rights. I will however continue to stand up for my own rights and my own philosophy that I have based on my beliefs and ideas and persona experience.   I hope you genuinely put work into trying to make the world a good place.  Peace out.	1642700876.0	hthhrrg	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hthemff	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hthhrrg/

(I guess not STEM, of yes, then nice)  And well, In India, most University/College seats in STEM are taken with MERIT and HARDWORK (All India Ranks) by Men, the women don't, although they themselves choose not to take up STEM  Yet wanna know what women get ? They get reserved seats in colleges... Even with lower ranks...  Some lower scoring girl snatches away the man's seat because of her gender  The society and politicians say this is to "equalize the number of both genders to give equal chance"  And now my question, what about fields where women are more and not men ? So men get the same vice versa ? NOPE.  Also in the west, 60% seats of college are taken by women... Tell me, now, do men get the same reservations ? No right ?  Why the hell there are special female laws which you goddamn people take as "rights" which is actually discrimination against boys ? Huh ?  Well typical Feminist  Fight when want something  But don't wanna give back anything if they have something in excess  Feminists want 3 things :  1. Power of a Man (without Merit and Hardwork btw lol)  2. Privilege of a Woman (Society and laws favour women worldwide, exceptions being terrorist countries)  3.

When you let them talk, they'll say shit like Muslims are savages that'll flood your borders with rape gangs, or trans are all sex crazed cultists who want to touch your kids.

Example, 10.4% of prisoners are women... feminism wants to abolish sending women to jail.    So 10.4% is big enough to want laws to change and change the way society functions, but 8% is small and no worry.

What goes under in this never ending debate of abortion is that it hands women ALL the rails and takes away all responsibility that falls on *just* them. Want to have sex? You can (accessibile casual sex)! Don't want to deal with the consequences? You don't have to (free access to abortion)!  When it comes to men though? You want to have sex? Weeell... risk of rape allegations, me-too fears, but yeah you can have sex. Don't want to deal with the consequences? Too bad for you, if she gets pregnant you're forced into fathering the child or paying child support, if you WANT to keep the baby, you can just hope she wants to keep it to because you have no say in her abortion.

dmwlt5jl	>Who the fuck is gonna take back your rights in 2022 !!! You see ! This false Idea of "Patriarchy" is the problem !  Globally: In India people are protesting making marital rape illegal, let that sink in; letting women drive and have passports and travel in places like Saudi Arabia; gender targeted violence all around the world, especially bad in places like south America; genital mutilation; forced abortions; forced sterilization; "virginity tests"; female genital mutilation; disrespect within careers especially if they also have children; hiring bias; sexual violence; the ability to do things without a man's permission (ex: reproductive surgery, driving, passport); bias against women workers in the medical field; bias against women in manual labor jobs; not being taken seriously when it comes to health concerns; harmful stereotypes; lack of respect   >Well may I know which degree are you pursuing ? (I guess not STEM, of yes, then nice)  Why do you assume I'm not in a stem field? That seems like an unnecessary comment to add. I am pursuing a plant biology/botany degree with a focus in sustainability, environmental impact, and genetics.  >And well, In India, most University/College seats in STEM are taken with MERIT and HARDWORK  Are you assuming I haven't earned my place through Merit and hard work? I was selected among 50 people across the entire country based on my grades, community service, leadership involvement, ACT score, and application essay. From there we had a first round of interviews, where they selected 20 candidates to continue to interview to earn the scholarship. From there was another round of 10 interviews where they pick five people to give a full ride. I was one of five people who worked my ass off hard enough to be accepted. If you are insinuating I got my position because of anything other than my ability you are mistaken.   >Also in the west, 60% seats of college are taken by women... Tell me, now, do men get the same reservations ? No right ?  In the west more women apply to college and more men go straight to jobs right after highschool.  I agree that while all the reservations and whatnot had good intentions behind them, they aren't the way to promote equality and carry out the real necessary goal, which is encouraging more women in these fields and tearing down actual (very real ) barriers preventing them from doing so. But like I said I agree that this is not the way to do it. Bandaid over a bullet hole kind of solution that only harms everyone.  I want 3 things:  1) to be respected and seen as capable like a man is and to be given the same opportunities to put in the work  2)  to be not automatically deemed irrational for being a woman and to not have someone hate me just because of my gender  3) to be seen as an adult and to be treated like an intellectual equal who just shows up, does my job, and gets my shit done. I want to be seen as a freaking person because some people really truly don't view me that way.	1642703458.0	hthovrs	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hthjm2b	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hthovrs/

dmwlt5jl	One of the many reasons I went on birth control for a little bit was because I lived on a college campus. Break-ins were pretty frequent in my dorm/ campus. I lived next to a parking lot called 'rape alley'. I had late night classes and had to walk 20 minutes home in the dark. If something happened to me I wanted to be safe and know that I wouldn't have the burden to my health, education, and mental health that a child would be at that point in time. Shit happens, it's just looking out for myself. Point is, people don't always have sex willingly  >It's only health related with sex. No sex, no need for birth control  This is just not true people have so many reasons and uses beyond controlling birth even if they are average and healthy.  My roommate: is not sexually active and has never once been sexually active in her life. She's on birth control to regulate anxiety/ depression and they go with her medication for those, and ovarian cysts.  Her sister: on birth control for repeated problems with ovarian cysts  My friend: was required to go on birth control for a minor surgery  My roomate's friend: was on it prescribed by her dermatologist for acne medication  My other roommate: on it for regulating her periods/ acne/ to take with other medicine  These are all examples of normal healthy people who have been on it for many reasons and examples of why so many people do take this medication. It is health care. This isn't even taking into account the women who use it to treat cancers and many other diseases and ailments.   Even if it is to prevent pregnancy. Thats still health care. As I said I was on it for a bit and one of those reasons was to prevent pregnancy. I am in a long term happy relationship with someone I plan on having kids with in the future. We were not in a place to have kids, we had other important things in life to get through.   Some women literally need to be on birth control because a pregnancy would be dangerous or life threatening.   Many people are in relationships but aren't ready for kids. Family planning is health care. But sex is an important part of many healthy relationships, so to say just don't have sex wildly overlooks a lot of experiences.	1642704410.0	hthri8q	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hthleqg	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/hthri8q/

ih121btv	>Then what the fuck is it?  Feminism is an ideology first. Consider the -ism. It is a set of theories about how society is constructed. This is what egalitarians, MRAs, and antifeminists oppose; their set of theories.  >Because last I checked it's about equality between all genders, and was created by women for women to achieve equality.  You do not use dictionaries to understand ideologies. It is not the purpose of a dictionary to teach you such things, to teach you sociology and theology. Its purpose is purely linguistic. You are looking for an accurate definition of feminism in the wrong places.  Wikipedia is also heavily biased in favour of feminism, a platform controlled and edited endlessly by feminists such that it gives readers nothing but a positive picture of feminism.  You do not learn about feminism from any dictionary, let alone a biased one, or an unreliable, corrupted website such as Wikipedia. You learn the true definition of feminism from feminist literature, discourse and advocacy written by its most celebrated theorists.  Feminism is not an ideology seeking 'equality'. All the feminist literature, discourse, advocacy from the late 1800s and early 1900s to the current day has mainly focused on hating men and infantilising women. Feminism is about hating men and infantilising women. This is the true, accurate and impartial, definition of feminism.  >And ngl we kinda need feminism especially if places like this sunreddit exist specifically to bash women and their beliefs.  No MRA or Anti-feminist will seek to hurt any women. They don't need to.

At the beginning I really thought  it was something to keep working on, however later on I realized how twisted her mind was. Like everything was sexist for her. Said that only woman in politics can make a change, won't watch movies made by men, only by black woman. And often enough she would drop the old white man sentence EVEN ABOUT ME although I'm a colored migrant (!!).  That was an eye opener to me.

And sadistic women exist... and a female rapist definitely would/could have a sadistic personality... so to say that men can't get raped is just bullshit. If a a 15 year old was forced to penetrate his say female teacher he didn't want it to happen. And it it was forced on him. Then say if he was raped by a male. You think being fucked in the ass by force wouldn't affect someone. Then you have then idea of sadistic women who could be rapists. Their are multiple things they could do to traumatize a male... so fuck anyone who says men can't get raped.	1642707081.0	hthyp2m	t3_s8h3vk	t3_s8h3vk	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8h3vk/the_vocal_minority/hthyp2m/
8jkk12dm	I replied to a comment that said in African households with no father, the males are only valued for their sperm and money. That’s a generalized racist statement with no evidence backing it up. Every household is different and every person is different. To say that women can’t raise a man properly and can’t instill a sense of self worth in male children is a racist trope. I’m not “triggered” though I’m sure you love throwing that word around. No one has to “advocate for racism against black mothers” in order to be racist. Simply saying that black mothers teach their male children that they are only valued for their money and sperm is racist	1642707157.0	hthyw90	t3_s45rhp	t1_hsslwoe	/r/antifeminists/comments/s45rhp/more_masculinity_not_less_what_a_beautiful/hthyw90/

I've never once had a person tell me I can't do something because I'm a woman not one time!!! I've always been able to obtain any goal I've worked towards, have never felt oppressed from obtaining my personal life goals once I set my mind to it.   Yes my first marriage may not have been the greatest circumstance in the world but is definitely not the worst circumstance and I am not going to be a bitter old cow about it and hate every man in society because one man who I married and had children with ended up being a dud.   Once I decided to get out of that circumstance the only person that was holding me back was me I obtained every goal that I intended to achieve and nobody told me I couldn't achieve any goals because I'm a woman.  Who legitimately tells people nowadays in the real world to their face they can't do something because they're a woman  ?

This feminist female  sits next to us and all of a sudden, when she heard me mentioning Jordan Peterson, starts screaming that he is a fascist and he enables incels. Oh, sorry little girl, but I'm not having it. So I start to ask her what exactly she knows about his work and what is the reason he thinks of him as a fascist.  I wasn't really in the mood, but since she wanted it... Challenge accepted. She tried to tell me how incels are dangerous but I kept asking her how is JP a fascist and how he enables them. After another sentence or two she got all red in her face, trembling and she told me full of hate that she doesn't want to talk about this fascist because it makes her feel ill. "Imagine how those poor bastards felt fighting real nazis". I retorted. And she got out of the room immediately.

5nwqhfks	Depends. Feminism has become such a broad umbrella that anyone can call themselves feminist, whether or not they fit to definition. This is purposeful on the part of the movement, basically you can’t fight something you can’t define, but I digress.   If a girl I was dating said she was a feminist, we would need to have a serious talk about what she believed and if she was open to hearing my view. Depending on the outcome of that talk, if she’s willing to hear me out and potentially be convinced, or if she can provide enough facts data and statistics to convince me I’m wrong, although I’ve done lots of research, then she and I might continue dating. If she’s not open to discussion and dismisses my research and data, then out the door.   But feminism would immediately be a stop drop and roll moment for the relationship. Differences on such a fundamental level lead to relationship failure if not immediately addressed.	1642710092.0	hti5r8g	t3_s8ka0o	t3_s8ka0o	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8ka0o/would_you_guys_still_marry_a_female_if_you_found/hti5r8g/

dmwlt5jl	No, but only because if you make that a law it gets into like really really dangerous territory.That already is a law in some places and for a normal couple it's one thing, but it creates scenarios where a woman is raped and has to get get assaulter's permission for an abortion. There was a case about an I think 11 year old girl who was raped and had to carry the baby to term (causing extreme psychological and physical damage to her reproductive system because that's what happens when children are forced to carry a child that young) because she would have had to have the permission of her rapist to have the procedure.  It's not fair for anyone to be legally tied to their rapist for the rest of their life.  So when things like that are allowed to happen. No.	1642713028.0	htidnw3	t3_s8m6zb	t1_hti9lso	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htidnw3/
3bxjt84	You’re implying that men and women’s bodies are equally sexualised, when that’s just blatantly false. Women are by FAR objectified way way way more than men are. Even when mens bodies are objectified, it’s not even for women but other men - eg. Marvel movies, the big muscular superhero physique is there for other men because it’s the male ideal body type, not for women to lust over. Most women aren’t attracted to that at all, and are more often attracted to men’s personalities and lust over men like mr darcy or other literary men who are romantic, caring and kind. This is obviously way different to how women are objectified EVERYWHERE we look, and it’s purely for the pleasure of men. For as long as I can remember I’ve seen naked women’s bodies used for decoration, but not the same thing with men. Surely you can recognise that this problem of objectification is VERY one sided ?	1642713093.0	htidudo	t3_s7gvb2	t1_htgc8kk	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7gvb2/i_say_a_what_yall_say/htidudo/

There is no wage gap there, women are believed when getting assaulted (though SOME like to take an advantage of that; ew) and women are in control of thief bodies.

I’m objectively an intelligent person, so I’m not sure why you think that because I’m a feminist ? I’m an idiot, when clearly you’re the one who is extremely misinformed on what feminism actually is and your responses clearly indicate that you’re irrational and insecure, as well as not having a clue what you’re talking about. I don’t have a “crap attitude” by pointing out societal inequalities, and my boyfriend is also a feminist so he agrees with my takes. This notion that my relationship won’t last because I’m a feminist is just stupid and you should probably do some reflecting on why you think that’s the case.

aba5aa1o	Heavens, today I saw a post on sub relationship advice where one guy shared how he was called sexist and judged just because he refused to sleep with a married woman who was offering herself to him at work. He said that she poly shamed him. The guy just has morals and knows perfectly that he should not mess with a taken person. And he had asked if he is on the wrong and if she has the right to be offended. I wanted to write him that she has no moral and no right to be offended. It was lousy by her side to offer herself to another when she's in a relationship. But the post got removed and comments were locked. What the hell is wrong with that sub? The guy didn't violate anything. And he got banned for sharing that he refused sex with a married woman?

9nq1	Allow me to make this simple for you.   You want something from me. Specifically, you want me to change my opinion about something. You don't know what my actual opinion is, because you haven't bothered to ask, but you think you know it, and you want me to change it.   I don't want anything from you. I don't care if you change your opinion about anything or not.   So, if you want something from me, but I don't want anything from you, how exactly are we supposed to make a deal? I'm not going to give you something for nothing.   You could, I suppose find something you have that I want, and offer it to me, but you don't know what I want, and I don't know what you have to offer. So that would take some figuring out.   So far all you are doing is fussing. I don't actually value fussing, because if I want some, I can get it for free.

And equality of outcomes, which is what you're actually about and what you want.

This can change, but it will require MRAs realize r/mensrights mods aren't serious about men's rights activism and them making their own subs to compete with the sub.     While that sub has pretended to support free speech, it removes the comments of and bans members that speak out against trolls or hijacking of discussion topics, demanding that all posters take the higher ground no matter what.

If that ain't sexist I don't know. Feminists also often act misandrist towards men they disagree with and shame them too.

fnidh4yr	Feminism is about equality, and as a feminist we push for women to have choice. If a women wants to spend her life as home with kids and serve her husband, that’s fine if that’s her choice, but people just want to make sure that those women are aware that sometimes them making that choice is because of years of conditioning. There are some people who call them selves a feminist who will make you feel bad for that, but they aren’t really feminist if they don’t want all women to be able to live freely and safely with their own choice. But there is a big difference between between having an opinion and invalidating people lives. If your “opinion” is that other women shouldn’t be able to do what they like, then thats not okay and of course people won’t be happy with that	1642730813.0	htjjmgs	t3_s8lkd8	t1_htjhs70	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/htjjmgs/

dmwlt5jl	Overall, no. I understand this probably sounds harsh, but from a constitutional standpoint it's a bad idea. This is a question that has been brought to court and was found to be unconstitutional. Like it sucks and I'm in support of being able to opt out of child support payments, but it violates the mother's rights to privacy and agency over her own medical decisions to have to have some one else's permission for her own healthcare choices. That's not a power that should be put over anyone, and the second you let that happen it goes down a slippery slope from there and it could continue to branch out further and further into violations of the mother's constitutional rights.  https://www.findlaw.com/family/paternity/fathers-rights-and-abortion.html	1642731348.0	htjkuix	t3_s8m6zb	t1_htjivzw	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htjkuix/
djxsshev	The posts I linked show evidence of the mods' traditionalist stances and agenda. It explains everything about how they act: from how they show leniency to trolls in the name of "free speech" (while banning those that speak out against those trolls), promote and pin traditionalist talking points, hold men to higher standards than women, retroactively remove posts that don't push a traditionalist outlook and ultimately discourage any real progress on equality for men if it goes against their concept of "masculinity". Traditionalists act exactly the same way.  It seems from the start, r/mensrights was a traditionalist forum masquerading as a men's rights forum. That IMO largely explains why it has made so little progress on men's rights and allowed others to come in and derail any MRA discussion.  You should check out the subs:  &#x200B;  pro\_male\_collective, promalestrategy, advancing\_male\_rights, pink\_pill\_watch, MenInMedia and NothowMRAswork for more effective MRA subs (also check their discords if they have any). While you may not be cheered for making generalizations about women like the ones you made in your screenshot, there is at least zero tolerance for trolls and anti MRA people that try to derail discussions on those subs, unlike on r/mensrights where such people are welcomed and allowed to hijack discussions.	1642731567.0	htjlcoy	t3_s81vz7	t1_htjg5u9	/r/antifeminists/comments/s81vz7/the_mensrights_sub_seems_to_be_turning_feminist/htjlcoy/

So why am I shamed for not being a feminist when feminist fights for having a choice? Why are feminists the one always invalidating me and not the non or anti feminists as much?  I also am childfree. My choices aren't due to conditioning, or at least not the conditioning of feministic ideology, but due to deep self reflection and tons of research I've done on my own.  >If your “opinion” is that other women shouldn’t be able to do what they like, then thats not okay and of course people won’t be happy with that  My opinion is that women should be able to do whatever they like, including being anti or non feminist. By all means be a feminist, but don't go insulting women who aren't feminists by calling them pick mes or men who aren't feminists incels. That's kind of what I'm getting at here.

There are a lot more black men in prison than there should be, and many of them are in jail because of bullshit drug laws that are enforced across racial lines. Men are also going to to to jail longer than the average woman, which means they're getting punished more than their female counterparts.

3onyqpi7	It was never about equality or morality. It was about socially condition men to remain on standby and be designated their role by women. They will choose men they want for a casual hookup/FWB. They will choose men who will play the role as the lifestyle provider AKA the "safe guy".  They also have the man that acts as a therapist/relationship counselor, and the one they go to for quick, the backup guy, etc...  That's why they absolutely CANNOT STAND the absolutely fucking AUDACITY for a man to decide to have his own standards, or when he refuses to cooperate with the role he was designated. It goes against all the hard work they have done trying to convince men to play their role in her fantasy-maximized lifestyle.	1642734956.0	htjt5to	t3_s8m6zb	t3_s8m6zb	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htjt5to/

Feminism and feminists concerns itself  and themselves mainly with the rights of women and not equally about men, which I find problematic. Feminism and feminists also doesn't hold men and women equally as accountable.

If this truly was women’s natural role would women not pursue higher education and work, or organise to demand equal rights (or anything for that matter). This line of thinking about “natural roles” is outdated and were used as an excuse to oppress certain groups.	1642739155.0	htk28kj	t3_s7o03u	t1_htd2upa	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7o03u/an_interesting_quote_and_point_against_feminism/htk28kj/

Maybe you feel like you live in a rape culture, but that's your experience.. not mine, hence why I agree to disagree as our perceptions and experiences are clearly very different.  Unless there's some proper scientific study on how I live in a rape culture that isn't made by feminists, my view is that I myself don't live in a rape culture. I can't speak for others but I definitely can for myself.  >It’s a thing, it’s disgusting and it’s the people that say that it’s not a even a thing that prevents that  Well that's reaffirming and gold to know.

2zae96xw	Well guess I'm the one person on the planet saying that then, so you're wrong. Women do get raped sure, but that doesn't mean there's a culture for rape anymore than there's a culture for murder just cause people get killed. As for consent, I've not experienced any man I know making jokes about consent, and despite, I can handle a fucking joke about consent as long as it isn't serious. As a woman I've never been scared to walk home. As a woman I'm rarely catcalled and objectified. No one's judged me for my choice of work either. Like I said, my experience is different than yours, but some women like you apparently just can't fathom that there's women who don't have the same exact experience as you.  If you gotta resort to insults to prove your point, then you're not really making a convincing argument are you?

7tqmop0f	For me personally, it would be a dealbreaker. Not because disagreeing with the political opinion of others makes me cut them off, I view having different political viewpoints in my circle as a good thing, becoming an extremist starts when you isolate yourself. It helps me with viewing the world from other points.  But, when it comes to a partnership,as the one in which I am currently. I need to align with the other person politically. Your political opinion is usually a strong signal for the way you think and view the world. Meeting a radical feminist would end up in arguments incredibly often, I can't keep my mouth shut about political opinions I dislike, and as long as I am not proven wrong, I will gladly continue to argue. This would ofc lead to a very toxic relationship.  Then theres the option of meeting the, moderate feminist. "Not all feminists are like that" kind. Where I also wouldn't want to be a part of that relationship due to the way that person would view things. For example, the majority of these feminists would have their opinions based in emotional reasoning, instead of logical conclusions. Which isn't what I want, I wish to have a person that can match me in thinking. I disagree often with even moderate feminism. If the feminist possible partner is someone who is in the 1st or 2nd wave of Feminism, I would probably give it a try.  Currently, me and my partner both have a laundry list of reasons why we hate feminism. Ranging from issues of not enough attention being given to men's issues, to how this weakens our society militarily, or even the history of the 4th wave feminism which stems from a infiltration program by the USSR. I recommend looking up Yuri Bezmenov for more on that.  In summary, I wouldn't date a feminist, I need a person who can ideologically match me to be my partner.	1642746099.0	htkf438	t3_s8ka0o	t3_s8ka0o	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8ka0o/would_you_guys_still_marry_a_female_if_you_found/htkf438/

Same problem in politics: all left-wing movements are based on lies and delusional logic - hence will never have a profoundly benefitial outcome on a 1000+ people scale. Feminism is one of those.  If you want I can link to a comment of mine where I have references to neurological and psychological research pointing out that it is men's biological nature to care about women + a few other things (almost everything is open access). That points out that the entire premise that feminism is based on and "patriarchy theory" are abnormal from the point of biology hence cannot be applied to the vast majority of men.	1642747119.0	htkgq0e	t3_s8370g	t1_htkd0qr	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8370g/proof_feminists_dont_actually_care_about_women/htkgq0e/

fvm6rs7n	It is relevant in a number of ways.        Before answering your question, I am going to throw some statistics at you that will I hope help start making the connection between feminism and Jews.        Jews make up roughly 2% of the population in the US. In the UK, they make up 0.2% of the population, in France its roughly 1%, etc. Despite making up insignificant minorities in all of these countries where feminism was born and constructed then spread around the world, Jews form the majority of the founders, leaders and financiers of feminism.        Most of the founders of the feminist movement are Jewish: Betty Friedan, Robin Morgan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, Simone Veil, Mary Ellman etc. etc. Jews also played an important role in the early women's movement e.g. the Jewish League for Women Suffrage. They played an operative role in injecting in feminism its anti-Christian sentiments as well as many other Jewish ideas and principles.        All of the Marxist theorists who pushed the idea of feminism in the 1800s were Jewish, Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Mosses Hess. The founders of the feminist sexual revolution, that revolution that has spread sexual degeneracy across the globe were Jewish. Wilhelm Reich and Sigmund Freud the godfathers of the feminist sexual revolution were both Jewish.        Most of the most anti-male, radical feminists have been Jewish: Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Gayle Rubin, Elizabeth Gould Davis, Sally Miller Geaarhart etc. etc. etc.        There is clear correlation between Judaism and feminism, but what causes this correlation? Why, of all people, have Jews played a significant role in the formation and rise of the feminist movement?        The answer to this question is very simple.        Judaism is made up of many branches. The largest branches of Judaism are those of atheistic Jews (Jews that do not believe in God, but are born racially Jewish) and Reform Jews (Jews that believe in a liberal approach to interpreting Jewish texts).        Reform Judaism is the largest branch in Judaism followed by Atheistic Judaism. It is heavily influenced by Marxism, communism and feminism. Reform Judaism is essentially feminism in the form of a religious ideology. They believe in and promote the exact same ideas and principles as those of feminists. They believe in and promote the feminist interpretation of patriarchy, they believe in and promote the idea that gender is a social construct, that men have throughout the ages oppressed women, that sexuality is a social construct, that abortion is a right, that there is nothing wrong with sex outside of marriage, that consumption and production of pornography is normal etc. etc. etc. Reform Judaism, the largest branch of Judaism in the world, is feminism and feminism is Reform Judaism.        Judaism by the admission of some of the highest Jewish authorities in the world has played an operative role in the rise and spread of feminism. Take icon of Judaism and Professor of Government Sandy Meisel as an example. In this following citation he notes that Jews have led the feminist movement in America from the 1970s onwards.        ‘From the early 1960s, Jews served as advisers, political operatives congressional staffers, “idea men” and powers behind the throne. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Jews rose to political prominence in the civil rights and anti-Vietnams War movements. From the 1970s on, Jews led or were influential in most, though not all, of the political reform, feminist, consumer rights, gay rights, environmental and other public interest groups and related foundations and think tanks that came to dominate the Democratic Party.' Jews in American Politics, 2001.        I must note here that Judaism is a dogma that is unconventional. I would not even call it a religion, but a racist ideology. Let me elaborate on this. In Judaism, you don't have to believe in Judaism to be considered a Jew. In Judaism, so long as you have a matrilineal Jewish lineage i.e. you are born to a Jewish mother (note that Judaism is extremely matriarchal. It is from Judaism that feminism borrows many of its anti-male theories surrounding sexuality and gender etc), you are considered a Jew. In Judaism, you are considered a Jew so long as you are racially Jewish, even if you reject Judaism. Most Jewish sects also believe that they are a chosen people. All also promote the concept of racial nepotism, a concept that renders them extremely tribalistic i.e. they work together, regardless of their beliefs, to push and promote their own racial interests. Combine their radicalistic views and nepotism with their belief that they are a chosen people and they are rendered a racially supremacist ideology.        I have just touched briefly on this topic here. If anyone has any questions, ask. Note that I am in the middle of exams at the moment, so my replies may be delayed.	1642749204.0	htkjto1	t3_s7p2mj	t1_htez1aj	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7p2mj/these_claim_to_be_feminists_the_organisation_they/htkjto1/

That's kind of an unflattering view of an entire sex.   In my personal experience, both my girlfriends know my reddit username, and see me commenting here on a regular basis.

If guys don’t want to sign up for the draft, then maybe you  should round up some guys and protest it. There’s plenty of people volunteering for the military to the point that the draft probably doesn’t need to exist anymore unless we’re in a dire situation where we’re about to be invaded, but there’s a fat chance that that’ll ever happen.	1642750437.0	htklkmu	t3_s7o03u	t1_htkamae	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7o03u/an_interesting_quote_and_point_against_feminism/htklkmu/

bncmf6s6	Feminists want women to have equal rights... Without equal responsibility. As an example, I believe if men can get drafted, women should too. I also hate that I got shit on by modern feminists a lot when I said that I was a stray at home mom (currently not) because "you're spitting in the face of what women worked so hard to get". Umm, nope.   Modern feminism is demasculating men and superiority, not equality. I work hard at every job I do, I make more than my make coworkers, and I make time to take care of my husband and children.   I was told to "check my inner misogyny"...	1642750907.0	htkm8cg	t3_s8lkd8	t3_s8lkd8	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/htkm8cg/
6zb3hozn	 male and female incels are similar in that they see the opposite sex in a very one dimensional negative way but their views are very different. For guy incels they only see women as fucktoys created to serve all their sexual needs, female  incels see men as something they can take advantage to benefit themselves, etc using a guy for strictly use for dinner knowing full well she doesn’t want to sleep with him, convincing a guy to send them money.

However, I think it's important to understand people, especially those who live with me. So I was always interested to learn as much as possible about my partners. And use this knowledge to make them feel comfortable and valued in the relationship. And loved.

2b47v3o5	I have a son who is almost 2 years old. We all know what mothers go through during pregnancy and child birth. When my wife was pregnant, I made her food every day. She ordered pre-packaged meals meant to help the baby grow that I prepared 2 to 3 times daily for about 12 weeks. I looked after her when she was unwell. I did the groceries, cooking, house cleaning, dishes, etc. I gave her massages wherever she felt sore or just to help her relax. I did what I could to take the burden off her. All this while studying full time and working part time to make ends meet. It was physically and mentally exhausting, but I did what I had to do because that was ***my*** role.  I'm sure most men do this for their partners and it is almost always overlooked. All my female friends say "*she had to carry the baby so she has more rights*". I don't like this since it undermines my efforts. I didn't carry my son for 9 months, but I did my best to ensure they were both looked after.

49s1vwb5	Legit question.  How is she wrong? If she's taking care of everything at home, that allows him to focus on his career.   Considering many men these days have garbage jobs with crap pay,  requiring the wife to work too. But it doesn't end there for the wife.  When the wife inevitably gets off work, she goes home to take care of the kids, clean the house, cook the meals, run the errands. Women who are put into those types of situations by their partners are better off being single moms: one less child in the home to clean up after.   If you want a 1950s housewife, you have to provide like a 1950s husband.

5hpt95wu	When, exactly, does it become a baby human? Upon leaving the womb? Naturally or via cesarean or does it not matter? What about premature births that require months, sometimes as much as 3, of ICU neonatal care? Since these premies are technically less viable (and kept basically in medically contrived wombs) than babies born at full term does that make them less valuable? Does the fetus become a baby when it first breaches into air or only when it's fully emerged? Can you kill/abort a baby when the cord is still attached because it is technically still attached to the mother? Since you define a life's value as being determined by feelings and a conscience does that mean it's ok to abort people in comas, under anaesthesia or even asleep? If you're against aborting sleeping people what about fetuses who are proven to experience REM sleep at 26 weeks. Is that the exact point they become human babies in your estimation? Is it ok to abort the fetus a few days before that? A few hours? A few seconds prior to 26 weeks post conception?	1642773902.0	htlkk86	t3_s8m6zb	t1_htlarxs	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8m6zb/this_might_be_a_hot_take_but/htlkk86/

Now if she doesn’t get access to the money he brings home, then that’s a different situation and financially abusive.  If she’s also assuming all of those domestic roles while working a full-time job as you said with no help from the husband, that’s also fucked up, but it’s not what the original tweet is discussing. It’s discussing SAHM, which I presume to be women with husbands who make enough money for them to be full-time SAHM.	1642775492.0	htlo6qu	t3_ra2533	t1_htljwwi	/r/antifeminists/comments/ra2533/imagine_being_a_hardworking_husband_working_from/htlo6qu/

r5n9u6y	Are we really going to rehash the "77 cents to a dollar" narrative? That's been debunked multiple times since like 2016! Even hardcore feminists now understand how dumb and nonsensical the wage gap argument is. Heck, this is my first time seeing someone bring it up in over 2 years!   However, I've got a question for you. If you feminists are so concerned about women's rights, why do you never talk about how women having basically zero rights in the Middle East? That's where the real fight for equality is at. So, why do you folks never talk about it?	1642776536.0	htlqp2q	t3_s5kzpp	t1_htk3m2m	/r/antifeminists/comments/s5kzpp/i_cringed_so_hard_after_seeing_this_shit/htlqp2q/
fvm6rs7n	'Why do you care?' is an oxymoron, a self defeating, false dichotomy. It asserts that there is something wrong with caring about what others think/say/do, whilst showing care in what others think/say/do. I hear this type of argument from feminists all the time when they are backed into corner. It is moronic, goldfish level IQ and not just any goldfish level IQ, but IQ of a goldfish suffering from severe mental retardation resulting from a neurodegenrative disease at a terminal stage, where there only one function brain cell left inside the brain of the goldfish and it is on its last breath.	1642776650.0	htlqzfc	t3_s9476z	t1_htkzxut	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9476z/why_does_only_one_ideological_side_get_to_have/htlqzfc/

e13pa32v	well also  the majority of MRAs might be us men, and majority of feminists are indeed women, but the fact you said is 100% right  but there are 2 reasons I would think of why it happens :  1. Women antifeminists come here because they are tired of forced victimhood feminists play, false fear they portray, but most importantly the misandry of feminists makes women sympathize to men, and thus the caring women come here in MRA circle, and in return get the respect back (which they deserve), but we men never ask for anything else in return as payment from antifeminist women 2. Male feminists on other hand have been fooled by the system since ages (I was one too), and they think females are above them, but most importantly, they want sexual pleasure and have an urge to get laid, thus they bootlick feminist agendas blindly  Thus this actually proves that male feminists are the "real incels" and not us MRAs as the feminists portray lol, their hypocrisy and double standard is killing me XD	1642777742.0	htltpi7	t3_s8lkd8	t1_htlkgad	/r/antifeminists/comments/s8lkd8/when_will_they_understand_this_is_a_strawman/htltpi7/

If calling someone born a man a woman makes a person happy - fine.  I have the same.argument for.most anything.  If my life, my health, and my rights aren't hurt, do what you like to be happy.  I won't be a problem.  What I dislike is the attitude that fosters this "walk on eggshells" movement.  If someone doesn't know what you identify as, and you attack them for getting it wrong, then don't expect support from them going forward.  You embarrassed them.  Why would they support you now?  I don't see enough of this.  I see immediate aggressive behavior.  That's not going to win allies or enable acceptance.  I think if people were kinder both ways, things would be a lot easier.

We (late teens and twentysomethings) are witnessing the failures of the generation of women before us, and spiritually arming ourselves against making the same mistakes.

h64yio9y	A brigade is where users of one sub will post offensive or rule-breaking content en masse in an effort to either attract attention to moderators or just derail discussion.   “Jailbait” is slang for pictures of underage girls in either bikinis or skimpy clothing. Not exactly child p*rn but definitely creepy and against the rules. Subs like AHS has raided subs they wanted taken down with these images to try and get them banned  Peter Bright (aka DrPizza) was a blog writer and in 2019 was arrested for soliciting a minor who was actually an FBI agent. Just looking up “dr pizza arrest” will give you a bunch of articles about him. What the articles don’t usually point out is he was very active on Reddit and r/IncelTears (the last sub before their old one was deleted by the original mod) He would constantly bag on incels, conservatives, basically anyone he disagreed with just like much of Reddit. And it makes the jailbait raids makes sense too. To this day IT denies that he was a prominent member of the sub.	1642783327.0	htm8f81	t3_s7o03u	t1_htlhnxr	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7o03u/an_interesting_quote_and_point_against_feminism/htm8f81/

5ccw4cmh	https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape  There are multiple studies and statistics which show that men are much more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape. I linked one, which is a quick and easy read, above. I am also happy to send you more studies if you were like. Statistically men are more likely to be raped then falsely accused of rape. While data may not be perfect considering a lot of rape (and I am guessing false accusations too!) cases go unreported, it is not a minor statistical difference, and so very clearly true, even if the numbers are not absolutely exact. I am glad there is a subreddit for victims of false accusations and I do genuinely believe it is a problem, but (statistically) it is very clearly not a bigger problem then sexual assault, and considering the rarity of being falsely accused, it is not something anyone should be concerned about randomly happening to them (I guess unless they are a celebrity for whom false accusations are often more common).   I’m referring to percentages. Yes, I entirely believe that some people’s lives have been ruined by false accusations, as you said, we can see this by all the reports on that subreddit. But more men’s lives have been ruined by rape then being falsely accused of rape. This is not to say that the number of people who have been falsely accused are negligible, of course they are not, we are on a planet of over 7 billion people.   1 in 6 American women are a victim of rape in their lifetime, and 1 in 33 men. Do you mean to tell me that for every 33 men you know in real life, at least 1 has been falsely accused of rape?   Not only all of that, you are **15 times** more likely to be falsely accused of murder then falsely accused of rape, yet I much more often see people worrying about getting accused of rape (or other sexual assault) then murder.	1642783829.0	htm9so7	t3_rv8j3r	t1_ht184l0	/r/antifeminists/comments/rv8j3r/does_doing_that_stop_false_sexual_harassment/htm9so7/

Because she views you as a slave who must grovel at her feet for a chance at her hallway coochie. Or just ghost you because she got her free meal and not even thank you.   The blue haired haired feminist will screech at and bemoan you for perpetuating toxic male supremacist behaviour of domination and belittling because she could obviously open the door herself and she doesn’t need a man or any gender to do it for her. But you’re right, she’ll take the free meal. But, like university, you pay a class you don’t want.

11lf14	I know how depressing it is to look at. Things have gotten better, but it may not seem like it considering how slowly things have gone.   Feminism has lost a tremendous amount of ground over the past 20 years and they are continuing to lose ground.   Equal rights equal lefts went from being seen as unacceptable extremism to a mainstream idea. Lawsuits from due process violations are starting to seriously damage schools and men are starting to check out of higher education en masse. The cdc is finally recognizing female perpetrators of sexual violence and found a near parity in male and female victims. The law will do what it has always done and follow the overton window.   I know the dating market really fuckin' sucks right now, and waiting 5 to 10 years isn't exactly a solution for those in it now. The only solution I see happening there is sex bots becoming a thing since the women who never grew up will will always have simps to siphon money and approval from.	1642792024.0	htmw0ex	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htmw0ex/

egbd6agl	Reply to your dumb ass comment where you told me off myself and got removed:  What have you done? You're spewing hate like a pissed off teenager. Stop and think for a sec, what are you accomplishing? You're only doing your part to give this movement a bad image. This kind of talk pushes people away and makes us look like we don't deserve support, because we're just a woman hating cesspool of bitching and complaining. Look at what people on other subs are saying about this sub. They think we're full of shit only looking for excuses to express our misogyny. If that's what you're doing, do it somewhere else cause you aren't welcome here. People like you do nothing but prove them right, and give the world more reasons to not take us seriously. What kind of fucked up mental gymnastics are you doing?  People like you are what's holding society back from overcoming all these issues. You could be spreading awareness and trying to get people on our side, show people the fucked up issues we're facing, put light on the empathy gap and the horribly skewed statistics that everyone thinks are legit. Spewing hate only gets you more hate. If you wanna keep being a miserable fuck, then you go ahead and do that. Just know that you're a fucking leech and you're just as bad as the most toxic feminists.   What you're doing is actually harmful to everyone and I'm just calling you out on that. I don't think that makes me a "little pacifist bitch" but you're free to have your shitty misguided opinions.   I can only do what I can but I'm sure as shit not gonna hate on the entirety of the opposite gender just because I'm jaded about what the feminists have done to society. You're right that feminism is winning, and that's why we need unity. Hating on women isn't gonna achieve that, it's just gonna make us stagnant at best and move backwards at worst.

d1h4a	Okay.   First, there is within some of us the desire to fight, and fight, and fight. And then fight some more until we are too tired to fight, at which point we go to sleep -- so we have the energy to fight again the following day. This is something not often acknowledged but it helps to explain why we keep fighting even in the face of impossible odds. If we can, we should try to get such people on our side of the fence.   Second, the reason Western feminism is impossible to take down is because it is being supported by Plutocrats who use it to distract from class and to keep the peasants divided. As the plutocrats become more and more powerful this will become unnecessary, at which point the whole IdPol thing will serve only to vilify the Plutocrats themselves, since they are White males. This is when things will turn around. At that point the Plutocrats will drop the whole IdPol thing -- or better yet, turn it upside down -- and the feminist shit will recede. I give it ten to twenty years before this happens so if you are young, hang in there. If you are not young, take comfort in the fact that future generations of men won't have to put up with the same shit we are currently up to our necks in.	1642796836.0	htn9952	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htn9952/

3s4lioa6	No they’re worse. Many incels are know for commuting violent acts. Elliot rogers is a really famous. He killed 6 people I believe. He was trying to get into a sorority house to kill more people, but his access was denied. His crime also inspired another incel to take a van and kill 10 people. Like I said before, in not a feminist or anti feminist, but with SOME feminists, even though they make a lot of really stupid comments like kill all men, that’s never actually translated to violence against real people. And most of the time, even though men don’t have domestic violence shelters, most people in the real world would shun those who are abusers, men or women.	1642797163.0	htna66y	t3_s7o03u	t1_htmyat6	/r/antifeminists/comments/s7o03u/an_interesting_quote_and_point_against_feminism/htna66y/

71ellra9	Want some examples?  Currently trans men and women can be excluded from the military because they're trans. They can be denied medical insurance and medical treatment from hospitals. Trans people can be excluded from political position for being trans. And trans men can be denied pre natal treatment due to the fact that they identify as men not women.   Additionally until the 1980's it was completely legal to kill trans people due to the some specific laws excluding them. In the 1990's the US had banned trans people from being a part of the military outright. Across the sea in Asia if you're trans you can be murdered and have no protection against it. In Russia trans people are treated like lepers, and can also be legally killed.

How I identify isn't anyone's business besides my own , I'm not going to be offended if someone accidentally misgendered me . However if they do it on purpose just to see if it offends me I'll just walk away from them , there's no point in fighting someone over how I choose to be seen in my body . Because their opinions on my life doesn't matter because I'm not hurting anyone , they aren't helping me build my life , and they aren't paying my medical bills for it so it doesn't matter.	1642802896.0	htnq35z	t3_s9awgo	t1_htm16cb	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htnq35z/

You didn't literally mean it (though I feel a very trolly response coming on this).    I don't care about it enough to fight against them.  Someone wants to be something because they feel more comfortable in their skin, what business is it of mine to fight them on something that really doesn't Impact my life?  So long as they are not taking something from me, or saying they are better than me, I don't care to fight them.  I tend to try to be as nice as I can when it comes to this stuff.  Assume the best until the person proves they don't deserve it.  Every group has their assholes, but judging the whole group because of them just makes you hate everyone.	1642804071.0	htnt8ps	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnrc3a	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htnt8ps/

A hard working man who despite everything at the end of the day took time to ask me about my day . He was a family and never met a stranger , only a friend . He was wise and taught people different things . He was strong and never allowed me to do without . He was someone who didn't judge as long as it wasn't hurting anyone . He taught me things like how to be strong in the worst of times and laugh in the best of times . Sadly I lost him in 2014 along side my aunt . So my idea of a man is my papa , a good , honest , hard working man who was kind but also firm when needed, but always cared about his family . Basically what feminist say is a toxic man .

It used to be traditional to drown women who were accused of being witches. It’s also biologically natural for humans to shit on the floor, but we don’t do that for good reasons.    Also explain this. If women staying home and taking care of kids while the husband is working is so natural according to biology, even though animals haven’t evolved like us, then why is it that there’s more and more men saying that they’d like to be stay at home dads?

It if only hinges on that aspect then what about people who are born with both sets of genitals . Here's the thing there are really amazing men that never father a kid , and don't have that choice so basing it on if you can have kiddos or not is not a good argument due to alot of good men can't father kids .	1642806930.0	hto0qw5	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnzmjq	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/hto0qw5/
aebs2hfc	Lol yeah I wouldn't worry about it too much. Despite the feminists trying to convince themselves and others otherwise, men and women have very different innate natures.  Just think about it. Despite all the encouragement, privileges, positive discrimination and the reverse for men, women aren't really doing anything near what men are doing in tech, business, media, art, sports, industry, science, you name it. Women just aren't drawn to competition, they just make a big fuss of the little they do.  This is one of the reasons feminists are so angry and aggressive all the time. They know they're fighting a battle that they cannot win because women just aren't interested. They are really interested in getting attention, social maneuvering, manipulation and the like but in men's world, they simply aren't producing or creating much if anything of value.  Now this isn't to say normally women wouldn't be contributing to society, they would and still do in womanly ways, but to feminists' dismay, not in the way of taking over men's domain of competition for direct power. It's just something that they're neither capable of nor innately interested in.  So don't be fooled. They're trying to make it appear that way but feminism hasn't won, women have nowhere near wrestled control of real power from men and they can't. It's just a lot of noise they're making.	1642807068.0	hto13hd	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/hto13hd/

6cs90s1n	You are lucky to have had such a strong role model and you keep him alive and honor him with your love for him.     I do have a problem with the way gender dysphoria is being treated but understand it's the best short term solution (as gender expectations/roles are slow changing societal vehicles). But to me putting all eggs in the "gender" basket will lead to a quick relatively easy fix for a large portion of people but these solutions will always be subpar.     I wrote something about it which I hope you would read:     My problem with the way gender dysphoria is being "treated": The route that is currently being pursued is a band aid solution that will always be far from perfect. Gender dysphoria exist solely because of the existence of perceived/actual gender expectations.         At a certain age (usually starting from a young age) people will feel than the expectations that are placed on them because of their sex will feel extremely claustrophobic/hard for them to adhere to. This because the social expression that comes natural to people is certainly NOT binary; there is considerable overlap between how both sexes would like to express without social norms being in place.        The more the "natural/intrinsic" expression of the individual lies at the far end of the normal curve (towards the opposite sex) the more this individual will be considered abnormal from a social standpoint (gender norms). In general; the more tension exists between gender expectation and the natural temperament of said individual the more this person will want to transition (to make his appearance match the social construct of gender).        Wearing this "costume" will always be subpar at best (mostly because the dysphoria is not an actual rejection of the original form/body but of it's social expectations). Destroying the husk because of the claustophobic expectations society places upon you simply by merit of your birth sex is a damn shame imo. I can eleborate further but this is not the main focus of this post.        But what would the best possible solution be? What would be a cure to this problem?        The cure would be fighting for the right of INDIVIDUAL expression; gender IS the enemy not sex. Sex only dictates the mean of the "normal curves" of expression but every expression is valid as normal curves are extremely wide and have extreme (in this case almost complete) overlap. If we can stop shaming people for the way they express or deeming them to be less/not feminine/male because of the way they behave we will cure gender dysphoria and all the non-binary, demiboy etc. nonsense at the same time (nonsense because it's a solution to a problem that does not have to exist and siimply exists because we as a society keep taking the easy route).        So in the end I symphatize with you; for how society has made you feel like your expression/believes etc. did not fit your "skin". I also realize that for you as a individual this is probably path of least resistance (fighting against  societal norms every day seems exhausting). But on the larger scale; your treatment perpetuates the toxic mindset that we are not free to express ourselves in any way we deem fit regardless of birthsex.	1642809877.0	hto85t4	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnvseh	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/hto85t4/

6cs90s1n	To me a man is simply a man because of his sex. Gender is the enemy: societal expectations and gender roles are highly toxic.      So while I do not agree with his tone; I do agree with the notion that a man is simply a man because he was born a biological male. I also do not think being man or a woman for that matter hold ANY major weight beyond that simple factuality (from a sex perspective; I reject gender).     You can express in the exact same way as your grandfather and be equally worthy of praise and admiration while having a female form and calling yourself a woman. The notion that being a man/woman holds any intrinsic weight beyond the superficial biological aspect of it is highly toxic.     So define what a woman is: XX; holds no weight whatsoever it's simply a clinical observation (beyond the reproductive/romantic aspect)     So define what a woman is: XY; holds no weight whatsoever it's simply a clinical observation (beyond the reproductive/romantic aspect)	1642810412.0	hto9h10	t3_s9awgo	t1_hto0qw5	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/hto9h10/

But I've also seen and heard alot more women these days that are becoming abusive too. Probably more better at being emotionally abusive to their partners and other people than men are. It's pretty scary. Men commit more to physical abuse. Although, in saying that... women can get away with alot more and I've seen a woman take a swing at her partner once. No one said anything. Go figure.  For me, I support no group, people are arseholes.

6cs90s1n	I do have a problem with the coddling mentality though. Not because of hate, but because I think not questioning the need for the movement to exist in the first place will lead us down a dark path of increasing boxed thinking and ultimately less humanity and freedom of expression for people that do not want to transition to "new boxes" non-binary, demiboy etc. But also do not want to feel like pariahs because the do not fit the ever narrowing traditional boxes.     I notice and increased emphasis and even narrowing definition on the traditional male/female gender roles and therefore inevitably more dysphoria. This will cause an increasing number of people to experience dysphoria in the binary; and an increase in (social) transitioning to non-binary, demiboy, the opposite sex (trans) etc.     re eloborate take of this as a response of this to beniesixx98	1642811445.0	htoc0qg	t3_s9awgo	t1_htnt8ps	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htoc0qg/

The idea of feminism is equality for all genders and it started off that way but has branched into other races. I don't get the hate for feminism, I get the hate for fascists but pointing fingers at feminism feels like looking at someone getting beaten by a cop then blaming criminals for making cops violent.	1642813707.0	htohify	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htoghmp	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htohify/

I hate to invoke a left wing mantra, but "be the change you want to see".  Just doing small things in your daily life will change the world.  No more P&G products, no more corporate media.  Live a peaceful life free of garbage, and let the evil tear itself apart - that's the ultimate conclusion of leftist garbage.  They crave human flesh, and eventually they will turn on themselves if you are no longer a target.	1642814682.0	htojvjg	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htojvjg/
5mzi92rs	It’s interesting…. One can completely screen out the echo chamber containing radical feminists. As much as they themselves and social media likes to think radical feminism is important; it really isn’t.  Sit there and ask yourself…‘what are stamp collectors, vintage car enthusiasts, trainspotters or other narrowly niche and self important/absorbed groups thinking about a topic.’  You probably wouldn’t even care, right?

I am appalled by the simplicity of such an accusation. “Feels to me on a whole that men don’t see women as whole people” and people are agreeing with it? This is so disturbing to read. I can only blame actual brainwashing for such a thought to be said with such simplicity and for no one to even call it out? I’m really really genuinely disturbed by this. I can hope that this is just a fringe, I mean I really hope that this is just a fringe…  Edit: i’m not gonna argue anything. There’s no argument that can be responded with here. What am I gonna say no that’s not true men as a whole don’t see women as less than whole people. I mean seriously? There’s no rational argument response, because just the idea and far out notion of the statement is it self appalling and can’t be argued with.  This is so disturbing.

itskmak0	I hate to say it, but things will continue to get worse and worse. Another user said "future generations will realize that these years were bad and maybe they'll see us as the good ones". Unfortunately that will not be happening anytime soon, not in our lifetime. So many feminist parents are brainwashing their kids into being feminists, I literally see feminist mothers on instagram and tiktok, dressing their sons up like girls, and making their young sons wears "the future is female" t shirts. The future generations will be even more brainwashed, and it will keep getting worse and worse. Nothing will ever be normal again, the feminists have too much power and they will continue to do more damage with 5th and 6th wave feminism. Castration at birth will probably be a thing in the future and we don't have a say in anything, so many companies and brands are even pandering to feminists.	1642825296.0	htp8fqx	t3_s9d7iy	t3_s9d7iy	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htp8fqx/

In reality not all in fact not even majority of women seld identify as feminists in the western society to my knowledge.   Feminists, like most morons, are confident due to Dunning-Kruger effect and are extremely loud and prevalent.

d8fsxtys	You’re a pathological liar as most female worshippers are. For starters RAINN uses self-report studies with small samples of women often over phone. I will now site you a wall of information debunking your hate speech against men:  **Studies demonstrating roughly gender parity in sexual assault victimisation**  *The CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys.*  Here's one everybody in the MRM knows. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys. I've seen feminists try to cite this as evidence for their "rape culture against women" narrative, but they completely ignore the evidence of gender parity in victimisation in there. While the lifetime stats show a larger gender gap, if you look at the (more reliable and relevant) past year numbers for rape and made to penetrate from the NISVS, all the reports show that in the year prior to the study roughly equal proportions of men and women were forced into sex.  [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs\_report2010-a.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf)  NISVS 2010 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.1% of men were made to penetrate and 1.1% of women were raped. Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.  [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf)  NISVS 2011 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.  [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf)  NISVS 2012 showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.  [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf)  NISVS 2015 showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 and 2 on page 15 and 16 respectively.  In each of the years the case count for male rape victims and female victims of made-to-penetrate were too small to provide a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  You can see that the estimated proportion of male victims of made to penetrate each year look very similar to the estimated numbers of female victims of rape. So if made to penetrate happens about as often as rape each year then by most people's assumed definition of rape (forced sex) then men are approximately half of rape victims.  (Also, if there is any doubt here that past year figures are more reliable than lifetime figures, [this](https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/13060) source notes that "Research tells us that 20% of critical details of a recognized event are irretrievable after one year from its occurrence and 50% are irretrievable after 5 years", which suggests that lifetime prevalence is less accurate.)  [Study on Child Abuse: INDIA 2007.](https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/sites/default/files/documents/4978.pdf)  Not only that, gender parity in sexual abuse and assault is not restricted to the West, as this report on child sexual victimisation in India shows. The major groups studied in this report were child respondents in the age group of 5-18 years, comprising three separate age groups 5-12 years, 13-14 years and 15-18 years. The second category of respondents was young adults in the age group 18-24 years.  The report breaks sexual abuse down into two main categories: "Severe" forms of sexual abuse (which includes being sexually assaulted, forced to fondle genitals, forced to exhibit private parts and photographed in the nude) and "other" forms of sexual abuse (which includes forcible kissing, sexual advances made during travel and marriages and exposure to pornographic materials).  Of the child respondents, 23.06% of the boys surveyed reported being subjected to one or more severe forms of sexual abuse, compared with 18.58% of the girls. 51.86% of the boys surveyed reported being subjected to one or more forms of other sexual abuse, compared with 49.57% of the girls.  Of the young adult sample, 60.58% of males reported being subjected to one or more forms of sexual abuse during childhood, compared with 41.12% of the females.  In some places like Delhi, boys are about *twice* as likely to experience sexual abuse than girls.  [Prevalence of Key Forms of Violence Against Adolescents in the Arab Region: A Systematic](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30399-9/pdf) [Review](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(18)30399-9/pdf)  A 2018 review of the data surrounding violence against adolescents in the Middle East. It provides a thorough summary of available evidence on violence against adolescents in the Arab region. It has this to say about sex differences in victimisation:  "When results were disaggregated by sex, reported rates of all forms of violence, **including sexual abuse**, were usually higher among males compared with females. This was reported in Palestine, where physical or psychological maltreatment was reported by 1/2 of males and 1/4 of females \[42\]; in Egypt where over 1/2 of males and about 36% of females were physically punished \[29\]; and in Lebanon where males reported significantly higher rates of sexual harassment/abuse than females \[49\]."  [Prevalence of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse among a nationwide sample of Arab high school students: association with family characteristics, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and quality of life](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-010-0311-2)  This 2010 study found among a sample of approximately four thousand Kuwaiti students that there were no significant gender differences in the prevalence of sexual attacks and someone threatening the subjects with sex. The prevalence of someone sexually exposing themselves to the students and unwanted touching of sexual parts was significantly higher among the boys.  [The Rates of Child Sexual Abuse and Its Psychological Consequences as Revealed by a Study Among Palestinian University Students](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222884781_The_rates_of_child_sexual_abuse_and_its_psychological_consequences_as_revealed_by_a_study_among_Palestinian_University_students)  While this 2001 study is chock-full of feminist blathering about "patriarchy", its results are interesting.  The study aimed to achieve the following two objectives: First, it sought to examine the rates of sexual abuse in Palestinian society at three ages (12 years or less, 12–16 years, and 16 years) by three perpetrators (a family member, a relative, and a stranger). It used a sample of 652 Palestinian undergraduate students, and used Finkelhor’s (1979) scale for measuring sexual abuse.  Thirteen different acts of sexual abuse were presented in the questionnaire. Participants were asked to indicate whether or not they had experienced each of the acts by three different perpetrators, that is, a family member, a relative from the extended family, or a stranger, at three age periods (i.e., under the age of 12, from the age of 12 to 16, and over the age of 16). Responses were based on a dichotomous scale (0 “no,” and 1 “yes”).  Similar rates of sexual abuse were found among female and male students regardless of perpetrator or age, and this pattern of symmetry existed for even the most severe forms of sexual abuse (forced sex). The study notes that "the current research findings indicate that the rates of the problem are similar among female and male Palestinian students."  **High rates of female perpetration**  [Women's Sexual Aggression Against Men: Prevalence and Predictors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024648106477#/page-1)  "In this study, we investigated the prevalence of women's sexual aggression against men and examined predictors of sexual aggression in a sample of 248 women. Respondents reported their use of aggressive strategies (physical force, exploitation of a man's incapacitated state, and verbal pressure) to make a man engage in sexual touch, sexual intercourse, or oral sex against his will. ... Almost 1 in 10 respondents (9.3%) reported having used aggressive strategies to coerce a man into sexual activities. Exploitation of the man's incapacitated state was used most frequently (5.6%), followed by verbal pressure (3.2%) and physical force (2%). An additional 5.4% reported attempted acts of sexual aggression."  [Sexual Assaulters in the United States: Prevalence and Psychiatric Correlates in a National Sample](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-012-9943-5)  This is a 2012 research paper using data from the U. S. Census Bureau's nationally representative National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 2001-02). It found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of selfreported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had “ever force\[d\] someone to have sex … against their will,” 43.6% were female and 56.4% were male.  [Sexual Victimization Perpetrated by Women: Federal Data Reveal Surprising Prevalence](https://malesurvivorbop.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/StempleFloresMeyer2016femaleperpetators.pdf)  "A 2013 survey of 1058 male and female youth ages 14–21 found that 9% self-reported perpetrating sexual victimization in their lifetime; 4% of youth reported perpetrating attempted or completed rape, which, again is defined to include any unwanted intercourse regardless of directionality (i.e., respondent reported that he/she “made someone have sex with me when I knew they did not want to”). While 98% of perpetrators who committed their first offence at age 15 or younger were male, by age 18–19 self-reports of perpetration differed little by sex: females comprised 48% of self-reported perpetrators of attempted or completed rape."	1642844847.0	htq4i0d	t3_s4zbug	t1_hszbd7o	/r/antifeminists/comments/s4zbug/this_subreddit_is_pretty_depressing/htq4i0d/

d8fsxtys	You’re a liar if you say the government / organisations are always providing accurate long term results for sexual violence gender ratios.   For starters these are the same groups of people who set up undeniably anti male policies and undermine the rights of men & boys. They also defined the rape definition to specifically exclude female-onto-male forced penetration meaning almost all cases of women raping men do not count without an object being used. It’s a little odd to claim women get raped more then exclude men from rape statistics, isn’t it?   Governments also set up male only drafts and female only allocated DV shelters that discriminate against men. They are not reliable because they’re filled with misandristic liars.	1642845262.0	htq524l	t3_s4zbug	t1_ht2wcjm	/r/antifeminists/comments/s4zbug/this_subreddit_is_pretty_depressing/htq524l/

If you think Wikipedia is wrong, why do you think the article still says so, and why hasn't it been corrected?	1642849141.0	htqac07	t3_s9ks4s	t3_s9ks4s	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htqac07/
bci24ojc	**[Sally Miller Gearhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Miller_Gearhart)**     >Sally Miller Gearhart (April 15, 1931 – July 14, 2021) was an American teacher, feminist, science-fiction writer, and political activist. In 1973, she became the first open lesbian to obtain a tenure-track faculty position when she was hired by San Francisco State University, where she helped establish one of the first women and gender study programs in the country. She later became a nationally known gay rights activist.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642849162.0	htqad1r	t3_s9ks4s	t1_htqac07	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htqad1r/

If you believe that's hate speech then you've never actually experienced it.  Also, your statistics are extremely outdated. I'm not going to believe something that was said 10 years ago and hasn't been backed up or had further claims made about it since then. Especially when all current statistics say the complete opposite.	1642850139.0	htqbqjr	t3_s4zbug	t1_htq4i0d	/r/antifeminists/comments/s4zbug/this_subreddit_is_pretty_depressing/htqbqjr/
aebs2hfc	Exactly. Denying this is in the interest of the feminist agenda because they want to push forward the idea that men and women are only different by nurture(it's because of the patriarchy and capitalism!!!) and there aren't any innate natural differences that may have caused different roles in society that men and women have.  Physical violence is men's domain.

6cs90s1n	I find it is extremely difficult to have a non black-white conversation about this topic online. I feel like most people are conditioned, from their political leanings, to simply take the stance their political hivemind dictates without having ever challenged their views (not even with an inner dialogue); To me people that so strictly opt into the far left or far right "brand" are simply echo-vessels and I will be able to tell what the person thinks about a subject simply by their political view      I refuse to believe EVERYONE on the far left (if they would not have been exposed to cult thinking) is intrinsically:   \- pro-choice     \- pro neopronouns    \- pro trans females competing with biological females in sport   \- pro the idea of cultural-appropriation   \- etc.  Yet everyone I have spoken online either opts into all the above or none of the above depending on their political background.  It is understandable though: insisting the world is grey will leave you to be a bigot in the eye of the left and a tree-hugging poof in the eye of the right (though I have to say there is still a bit of grey to be found on the right, the neo-left is mostly all black/white). Individuality is lonely in a world that is becoming increasingly polarised; a world were you have to choose sides or be deemed the enemy.     Also the majority of people are not intellectualy capable or as capable as they would like to convince themselves they are. Reiterating a stance (that the group has decided for you) will make you feel empowered and capable. So internalizing these intellectualy capable sounding dogmas and convincing yourself they are your own is extremely tempting.     All of the above makes it increasingly tempting to be a hive minded drone; there is little pay-off to being a critical thinking individual. But at the same time the only true conversation can be had when critical thinking individuals interact and collide.          I am not concerned about the downvotes; it simply a by-product of me bumping against/challenging the internalized coding/protocol of one of these zombies. Their biggest fear is waking from their stupor and being ripped from the comfort of their collective madness: realizing they are still alone and stupid, because they never developed any or were incapable of having any thought worth having on their own. Those poor unfortunate souls...  *I'm looking forward to having a conversation with a self thinking human.*	1642851500.0	htqdnzm	t3_s9awgo	t1_htpr6ki	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htqdnzm/

cjj0rhnu	As Business Management student, this is the best outcome they could have choosen  Quite a lot of men have basic knowledge of repairing minor issues in car and performing maintenance. So men are more likely to need assistance in a case of breakdown. And less likely for a punctured tire, which is difficult during night time. So supporting men and potentially sacrificing all their female customers would shut their entire business down.  Now by openly saying they support woman, anybody who opposes this is seen as woman hater. And it's not a new info that law and justice is a woman's bootlicking sidekick so they will most probably turn a blind eye. Also "feminist organisations" or better termed "non-lethal terrorist organisations" will indiscriminately file petitions and lawsuits for "woman protection".  So even if they loose a lot of male customers. They just solidified their female customer base.

"Of all the rape cases that are registered, only 1% is genuine," says    Gupta's lawyer, Vinay Sharma, who regularly defends men accused of rape    in Delhi.  "The rest are either registered to take revenge or to take advantage of the person in some financial matter," he says.

And u know what this does? Takes up precious times of courts, hurts the daughters and wives of those accused. And women aren't taken seriously because of these false cases. I hate rapists as much as those who falsely accuse of rape. And I want to fight both.     But ur stuck in trying to hate men so much, u don't want the truth of false cases to come out. which ends up hurting innocent women.

So you being happy is just natural, same with me  While on other hand Feminists are always ready to spread hate... Now in India, they are going to legalize Marital Rape (only for women, men are still the abusers as per law)  And as a matter of fact, 75% rapes and 85% domestic violence in India are already FALSE (as per 2015) and now a new law, in which even if a guy tries being romantic, he would be charged with rape by the wife...  Good job Feminists, this will make men paranoid, and good women would have an extra burden to prove themselves to men (just like men to women, currently) and woosh now both sides need to prove to other he/she ain't bad... And love ? Nah, that would be lost, competition would be the motive, lead by the hate for the other gender....

If Feminism means women shall work, why the hell aren't they encouraging girls to pick up STEM field jobs or get into sport or join army ? Oh I see, that takes effort and hardwork (but Feminists just want freebies, no responsibilities)  I am sad that how many girls will fall for this shit... I wish they were taught to get a good respectable job, maybe become CEO of some company, but nah...   Do sex work, then bash men for being sexual beggars and Incels and what not, and then cry on media "why aren't we paid equal in (traditional) jobs ? 😭"  Disgusting.

More feminists are there amongst women, making men paranoid, then men think each girl is a potential falsely accusing feminist  At the same time, women are made to believe each man is a potential rapist  And now both become paranoid, both never talk, both hate each other, both now have political agendas  And boom, real love ? That's gone...   So as a result, no relationships, no marriages, then no children  Then finally no future generations, humanity ends...

empa4mmt	>s? Because that's what your complaining about  I can get sex if I want sex. I'd like higher conscoiousness stronger women that expect as much from themselves as they do their partners adn are capable of viewing thier thoughts feelings and motivations as being primitive and animalistic and needing to be risen above to create the kind of life and relationships they are seeking.

e13pa32v	Well as you see from my name, I am into No Fap  I know the ugly truth about porn industry  Porn industry is indeed dehumanizing women, but it also dehumanizes Men by an even larger extent  I saw pornstar info webpages, for the girls, there are 1000s of articles written in 1000s of words (literal essays mentioning big boobs, big cunt, bouncy, jiggly and countless demeaning terms)  For men ? Lol, men don't even get attention, all he is expected of is to be a large heavily built six pack abs dude, having 6 feet height, an 8 inch cock, and making absolutely no fucking voice... We are just shown as living Dildos there... And yet they make lesser money in porn than women... Plus men are given drugs to last longer...   Also, these articles are written by Feminists themselves (mostly Feminist men), lol these men are the real Incels, sexualizing women all the time, not us...  I have written this countless times on MensRights, but even they disagreed with me... C'mon guys, can't you see the truth ? How porn preys on men's views to run their businesses (all porn is intended for men watching it mostly) plus the male performers are given zero recognition ?   Where is the feminist outrage for helping male pornstars ?

Take assaults by strangers, they want you to believe women should be scared shitless to walk down the street, they are rape targets and it's a regular thing.  But it happens literally 5 times more to men.    Or homeless, unemployment, abuse shelters and on and on.  When it's a tiny portion that is women, it's a massive deal but only for them.  Yet men are kept from their children at an alarming rate, ehh, no big deal, it's not a big enough number, in fact, out 20% is bigger than the men's 80%  That's how they operate, it's crazy to me.	1642872844.0	htrlp3v	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htrke1l	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htrlp3v/

The second argument you can make is this, if sex work is work, then buying sex is no different to buying a sandwich, why get upset at men who are in a relationship and buying sex.

d8fsxtys	You have the brain capacity of a small monkey. I already explained this to you 3 times. The government does not include female-onto-male forced penetration under law due to misandry and feminism. This means rarely is it actually taken into account to statistics unless an object was used. You can’t not include male rape victims then suddenly make vague claims about how there’s an epidemic of men raping women. Government statistics are highly inaccurate with rape because of this.

e13pa32v	Always has been  If you have heard (or even read) the book Sapiens, there the author describes perfectly of how, when humans became more advanced, their lower body structure became a big more streamlined, allowing them to stand up rather than walking on 4 legs, their hips became smaller, but their brains were being a lot more developed, the size of the babies heads were increasing.  As a result, there was difficulty in women giving birth to children. To fix that, nature evolved us into being in a premature state when we get born, and after that, learn the basic skills of life while growing fully (as a child) and then work after that phase...   Thus, women started to look for safer men (so that the child gets to live) and started choosing stronger and smarter men... Also the fertility rate fell...  And 40% men didn't even get a chance to mate...   Also this leads to women becoming more valuable for society, even sexually, as they got scarce and men were seen as being disposable. Another reason to why men see more porn and get hooked onto that as compared to men, it provides a super stimulus to the brain (a response from brain when it gets something in abundance, which is also necessary for survival, mostly sex and food, thus same reaction happens when we eat a pizza or a burger, they have higher fats, so higher storage of food for future, and thus eating more)  Feminism or the Woke culture actually NEVER fought against this system, instead they amplified it even more... See Western societies as a matter, wokeism is more there, feminism too, and obesity as well, also porn watching rates and young sex relations and spread of STDs...  That's what Feminists did, they made us go back to being jungly Hedonists, not successful Universe Conquering species...  Plus they used Hitler's tactics to say lies louder more and more and louder and louder, so that at one point it becomes the truth, Feminists are the very thing they swore to destroy (as per definition)	1642873716.0	htrnx2l	t3_sa19w8	t1_htrm4hf	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa19w8/antifeminists/htrnx2l/

I don't you are a bigot , more like misinformed on the topic of trans people , but not a bigot . I have opinions on being trans that not alot of trans people will agree with and while i appreciate your take . You have understand that my take is my own experience. But I do have to mention that trans people aren't born with the chemicals in our brains that identify with our bodies . For example I wasn't born with a brain that recognized the body I have as my own , it's always felt wrong and still does . It got worse after my miscarriage to the point I would bind my chest in unsafe ways begging to be myself . But I'm also poor right now and can't afford it . So I have to make do . And what's sad I came from a traditional home that were actually bigots . And I see your point on having kiddos but honestly with how the world is going do you honestly want a child growing up in the madness when suicide rates are so high and the cost of living getting worse by the day not to mention how bad the government system treats everyone? I definitely don't want that , and another thing innersex people are born with both sets of chromosomes they actually have to pick their sex . It's more then just black ,white, and Gray. Especially when it comes to being trans , but you have people who aren't just willing to talk about it , they want to fight about it and for what , just to be heard ? Meanwhile more and more trans women and men are being killed and raped just because That's their identity .

Yes the female stars get more "attention" but they are also expected to do more degrading acts and be abused more often. Just because the women are focused on doesn't mean they are treated any better.  If anything Id say that men are abused by the porn industry mainly by being the intended consumer of it. Props to you doing nofap cus porn is an extremely addictive and psychologically damaging product and not enough people talk about that.	1642876270.0	htruibm	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htrktik	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htruibm/
e13pa32v	Talking of OnlyFans  Well, there's discrimination too, lemme ask you something...  Who will earn more money and gain more attention  A female nudes poster, or a male nudes poster... Whom do you think ?  Answer is obviously a woman... Hence discrimination in this field against boys...  What do men do to earn for college degrees then ? We clean the streets, work in shops, do construction work, etc.  As a result more men die in workplaces... Those who don't get jobs (men) do this for life, they stay broke  Now most girls (Feminists) don't like a broke man, he grows into depression (another thing that males are more depressed)  And as a result more suicides (76% suicides are men)  Otherwise, they join army to pay.... (99% war deaths are men)  Then also, retirement age for women is much lesser, for men it's higher... Plus in the West (where most of the OnlyFans models are from, aka developed countries), 60% college seats are taken away by women and not men...  Yet no one focusses on this issue  Also, a man would have to do dirty jobs to make money, costing physical strength and actually still keeping him broke and depressed  But, a woman has the privilege to just sell nudes and earn thousands of dollars, throughout most her life, then using feminism, just marry a any successful man when they approach 30)  You see ?

He cannot act natural... Plus, they are given literal DRUGS to keep them erect, this is how porn exploits male performers...  Their body selection requirement criteria is much more hard (sometimes impossible) to achieve as compared to much normal ones as intended for women...  Plus you don't see the "drugs" point ? The injections, and the pills, given to men, to forcefully create a sense of "men should last long if he's a real man" which is totally against nature's law ? Also ask him to ejaculate as soon as the director tells him to ?  Isn't that proof of male exploitation ? (Both male and female performers suffer, but atleast one earns more money and fame being just in fine shape, while the other gets lesser pay (man in this case, lol feminism exposed) despite putting more effort in body ?	1642876759.0	htrvrye	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htruibm	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htrvrye/

ub8mbpz	Your first argument is a great point..for some reason feminists think the rampant abuse in prostitution is just some accident of culture or poverty or whatever, as if we can regulate the industry enough to stop the abuse.  In actuality abuse is inherent in any industry where someone is literally objectifying and selling their body.  Here's another argument: what other job carries a risk of pregnancy? What other job entails swapping dangerous biohazards like semen, saliva, and urine with zero oversight or protection? Oh, aside from condoms of course... which obviously NO john will ever pressure a prostitute to take off in a private room.	1642876857.0	htrw0zu	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htrm4j8	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htrw0zu/

6cs90s1n	I am not of the opinion that a person is without merit without having kids; having them should be up to the individual entirely. Kids are a big responsibility and therefore noone should feel like having them is mandatory.     The intersex argument that keeps being repeated is extremely flawed:  The vast majority of intersex people have a phenotype matching largely matching the sexual dichotomy and their gender expression also largely matches this phenotype. This is because the Y chromsome will cause an embryo to develop as male regardless of the amount of X chromosomes: so XXY is male and therefore people with Klinefelter are male. As a medical doctor I have met people with Klinefelter and their appearance is simply male and they usually identify as male same as XY people.       Also I do think you were born with a brain that wired more akin to that of a biological male. At the same time I do not believe is the reason you reject your "birth form". The thought that in a vacuum; were you are the only person that has ever lived (and therefore never met the opposite sex) you would look at your body it did not belong and should be modified seems ridiculous. To what would you want to modify your body if you would have never even seen a biological male? I do not think there is some kind of inner eye that would know what the male form is and would therefore cause you discomfort not fitting this almost religious entity at that point.     To me this thought experiment demonstrates you are not dysphoric because of your body; but because of the gender expectations that are inevitably associated with the body you are born with. In our modern world noone lives outside of the grasp of it's culture and your brain makes you want to express in a way that is considered to fit the opposite sex too a MUCH higher degree. The important distinction being; that while I fully believe you rejected your birth form it is not caused by biology but because the expression your brain deems most comfortable does not match the social construct we have created for your birth sex.     Furthermore I do not condone violence against anyone. I am sorry your life path is so difficult and you have not received the support you deserve.	1642878246.0	htrzlkv	t3_s9awgo	t1_htrpf3t	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htrzlkv/

They make it seem like domestic abuse occurs because of misogyny.

It's rather you, by being rude and judging people without knowing them, who deserved the cause.   Username checkout, actually it's my based Leorio sigma stare profile picture that triggered you. You're just jealous that my flag looks cooler than yours. And my transphobia is not related to my sexual orientation, you LGBTphobic.  No, seriously, I'm not transphobic, and super straight is not transphobia. It's just a troll response to the morons who call as transphobic the straight people who are only attracted to the opposite sex (so almost everyone). So if they call you transphobic, you can call them LGBTphobic, since they insult you for your sexual orientation. While the whole thing started as a joke, they couldn't stand the paradox so much, that they chose to call super straight transphobic too. As if they didn't understand that you can't solve all your nonsense by putting phobic words on it.

3aq77j7x	I feel like pornography could subject humans to indignities. People who watch it and fap to it alot will probably be suffering from porn addiction. If people profit from showing nudes or drawing hentai they will earn money from the simps and most of that porn will have females. If more and more people get addicted to porn it can make females feel unsafe. I'm scared that video game or other communities will be well known for their unofficial pornography, especially the furry fandom. I have seen way to much porn from furries and I don't like it. I feel like they are trying to profit from it or get people horny.  If porn industry rapidly grows then people might get horny and help porn stars profit and even teenagers or children could get horny. They just don't care that much about age restriction and they say there 18+ when it spreads from media to media to media and minors are still vulnerable to seeing this type of stuff.   I don't expect anything good from the porn industry.	1642880457.0	hts56da	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htrktik	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/hts56da/

9ojyvtfr	No, it really isn’t. Men commit rape because they feel that sex is a need for them, they feel entitled to it. There is a reason they are almost always perpetuating it. In fact, many men (especially when exposed to porn which is extremely misogynistic) don’t recognize certain situations as rape. So yes, it’s a misogyny issue. https://endsexualexploitation.org/violence/#_edn1 [from above link]: Committing Sexual Offenses and Accepting Rape Myths:  A meta-analysis of 46 studies reported that the effects of exposure to pornographic material are “clear and consistent,” and that pornography use puts people at increased risk for committing sexual offenses and accepting rape myths.[vii]	1642883950.0	htsdq6g	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htscvh1	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htsdq6g/

fvm6rs7n	All leaders of the feminist/women's movement have had serious psychological problems, each and every single one of them without one single exception.  Mary Wollstonecraft, a woman from the early women's movement that lived in the 1800s the lifestyle of contemporary feminists, one that contemporary feminists celebrate as an icon of their movement, suffered from a myriad of psychological problems foremost of these chronic, clinical depression so severe she attempted suicide two or three times throughout her short life. Icon of early 1900s feminism Charlotte Perkins, author of the Herland Trilogy, a work seminal in feminism, like all other icons of the feminist movement was also diagnosed with a myriad of serious mental health problems. She suffered from hallucinations throughout her life. She was diagnosed with psychosis and depression. She was throughout her life deemed clinically insane. Like many of her feminist compatriots she wound up committing suicide. Simone de Beauvoir, icon of mid 1900s feminism, was a chronic depressive. She was throughout most of her life addicted to drugs. She was also an alcoholic. She died from cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse. Kate Millett, icon of 1960s/70s feminism, was clinical diagnosed insane. She was extremely violent and psychotic. She was by order of a court locked up in a mental asylum from which she escaped before joining the feminist movement and becoming one of its foremost leaders....  I can go on and on and on, but I think I have made my point.  All icons of the feminist movement have have had serious psychological problems and/or chronically abused drugs. Test this claim of mine for yourself. Look up any icon of the feminist movement then search their medical history. You will find that they have a history of serious psychological problems.  Insanity is a prerequisite to feminism. Those that aren't insane before they join feminism are turned insane by feminism.  In my previous comment I mentioned an icon of feminism that was recently found starved to death. This would be Shulamith Firestone one of the biggest icons of the feminist movement. She is considered a mother of radical feminism. She was in adulthood, after living feminism, she became extremely psychotic. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Feminism literally drove her insane. In 2012, she was discovered dead inside her own flat. Her cupboards were all empty of food. She was suspected of having starved herself to death. Her corpse lay undiscovered in her home for weeks, until its stench reach the doors of her neighbours who informed authorities who then broke her door down to find her dead inside. She was totally abandoned by her own sisters. None of those women in her movement who called her their mother and sister cared to check up on her. She died alone and out of food in a miserable condition. There is no better example of the devastating impact of feminism on an individual than the life and death of Shulamith Firestone.  You won't find information such as this on YouTube or anywhere else in the world of feminism, a world full of people living in near total ignorance.

cytmev70	Funny thing is, domestic abuse has all kinds of abuse.   Control  Physical Abuse  Sexual Abuse  Emotional Abuse & Intimidation  Isolation  Verbal Abuse: Coercion, Threats, & Blame  I'm a victim myself. My ex wife completly and almost instantaneously switched as soon as we got married. From verbal threats and degrading me in the bedroom to expecting favors in return for sex. Well kind of. If I wanted sex, I'd have to fold laundry, do dishes, and just general household chores. Not, *hey I'll let you fuck me if you do the dishes tonight.* it was, *you're not fucking touching me, unless you do those god damn dishes.*  And if I ever didn't finish a task because I worked and had other projects, she'd take her little toys to the shower and get herself off. And if I ever was caught jerking it, it was the end of the fucking world. From anger and screaming at me to crying and playing victim because "I didn't want to fuck her anymore".   We ended up getting divorced less than a year after getting married(her choice). Her excuse for a divorce was because I changed, or wasn't the man I was when we were dating. Come to find out, she got knocked up by some married dude she worked with. Good riddance to her, and good luck to that dude.   I'm married again now, and have a wonderful wife and three beautiful children, I'm a stay at home dad, and she loves me being home with the kids and not in some daycare where they may be ignored or bullied etc.   My ex wife blocked me on all social media's but I ended up finding her sister's Facebook a couple years ago, and omg, she is huge, with like 5 kids. Like, I'm glad it ended when it did, because she did want kids with me.

And because of it they go as far as causing nerve damage so doctors will cut that limb off . And as soon as it's gone the person because happier and say they feel normal. That's how it is being trans , the more we live in the wrong body the more we hate ourselves , until we can get the surgeries done alot of transgender individuals have shown signs of better life improvement as well as being alot happier in life overall especially since they have to see at least for 4 doctors to make sure this is what they want .As for me I don't allow my dysphoria control my life , however it's there but I Aleve some of it by presenting myself as male , dressing more masculine , acting more masculine so much I've already changed my name and address myself as a male . My partner and my mom both help where they can if it is a bad day of dysphoria. And that's all I can ask for.

8w6m5	>I can get sex if I want sex.   Umm.. Okay?   >I'd like higher conscoiousness stronger women that expect as much from themselves as they do their partners adn are capable of viewing thier thoughts feelings and motivations as being primitive and animalistic and needing to be risen above to create the kind of life and relationships they are seeking. I'd like more capable women.   That's more of a social thing and who you interact with. There are many women providing the main household income for their family and adhere to their partners emotions and concerns. If you're not finding "capable women", you've got your sights set on narrow and you're not looking very hard.   >I beleive that as well as opressing women our society has coddled them and I'd just like someone who views their mind the way I view mine and expects as much from themslves as I do myself.  This isn't uncommon. But moreover, what makes your views better than their views? They're also looking for someone to view their minds the way they do. You're painting this like it's women that are the problem when men do the same thing.   >An example, I'd like a woman who is strong enough to see a man being vulnerable emotionally and if she feels a hint of revulsion at his weekness, to be awoken enough to see past that as a primitive thing in her own mind, and recognize he may not be vulnerable due to weakness, but perhaps as an act of strengt and deliberate choice because doing so is what creates the closeness and connection that SHE craves as well as him. Some women seem capabnle of seeing past that to begin with and caring for a man as a human, but man, one little hint of that feeling of revulsion at weekness and most just think its because he is weak and don't even consider where that comes from in themselves.   Really sounds like a you thing. Or at least the people you converse with. This honestly just sounds like someone hurt you by this on the past and now you just expect women to be horrible people that can't convey meaningful emotion with men. You're using words like primitive to describe how you think women will react, which says more about you than what the issue is.   >In my relationships I have done more than my share of emotional labor   "more than my share" sounds like you're blaming your partner isn't putting enough into the relationship. If your partner isn't reflecting what you need, then it might not be a good relationship for you.   >which has been admitted to by all my exes,  I'm sure.   >but then after I stop trying  Key words here.  >they text me and say how much they miss the connection etc but just seem to want me to commit to creating it in return for their presence in my life.   Wait what? Isn't that what you're asking of them too?   >Them shouldering a truly equal share of the responsibility is something I just need not for my ego or feelings but because it just doesn't work well otherwise.   Very valid and it goes both ways.   >Its a social norm women get and need more emotional support and it's just silly and many women can't even consider that could be real.   And why is giving women emotional support a bad thing? We do it for men all the time. Ever been to a gym? Boys be constantly supporting each other and telling each other that they're yolked and looking swol. So isn't there also a social norm to boost the emotional ego of men as well? There's a lot of strong women that don't want your emotional support, in the way you're thinking, all the time. I've been with women and men that get annoyed if I coddle their emotions too much as well as the opposite of not coddling enough. Find the right person for you. Emotional support goes both ways. We really shouldn't be depicting it as a weird social norm.   >I don't think you and I are going to be on the same wavelength. I wish you the best. Enjoy your freedoms.  We're probably not. I see women losing their rights and access to their own body while the men in here are complaining about social norms. It's not the same game. Enjoy your true freedom.	1642888827.0	htspo8r	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htrjm8d	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htspo8r/

Sadly for you the fact remains if I rent a prostitute then I'm renting her body for sex, buying or renting is irrelevant she is just an object, the object being paid for.   You actually have no way out of this argument now, surely you must realise that you've dug your own way into it, I can see it and so can everyone else, it's why I'm getting the upvotes and you're not.   What you've still not been able to argue yet is why, when somebody pays for a service where that service involves the person they are paying they are wrong for seeing that person as the item or service that's being paid for.   Also you still have not been able to argue why if sex work is work there is any moral jeopardy for the person paying for the sex, when buying sex is as buying a coffee then cheating with a prostitute isn't cheating, unless you're will to argue that a man dating a woman cannot buy a tyre change.

I say my exes are looking to get me to commit to creating connection in return for being with me, and you ask fi I'm asking the same from them.... No actually I'm expecting it to be we both are commited to creating it in return for the other person being commited to creating it as well.   &#x200B;  How are women losing access to their own body? Someones making you wear chastity belts? Access to birth control and abortions isn't accesss to your own body. You may have a right to those things but they are not your body they are medical procedures. Your body is the thing that creates the pregnancy with a man's sperm. You can argue having a right to those things but you cannot argue they are your body.   See the thing is, this si the first time I have said anything invalidating about yoru experience. Everything you have said has basically been arguing and invalidating my experience while the things I have said are more explaining my perspective without invalidating yours. What does that say about the gender dynamic? That my feelings and perspective are treated as valid by women or society in general?  &#x200B;  You are right emotional support goes both ways. I would like to find a woman capable of considering the fact here is a social norm it goes more one way than the other. Obviously you're not willing to even consider that or else youd say hmm I'll think abotu and observe that instead of just telling me I'm wrong. Up till this post, I've tried to engage in a style of communication leads to discussion more than arguement, a sharing and observing more than accusing or blaming but your communication style seems to be only debate, and this is exactly an example of what I find very difficult to relate to and communicate with. I get the feeling if I'm not telling you how brave you are you'd argue with me and both those are just boring.	1642891071.0	htsvazs	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htspo8r	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/htsvazs/

Usually by throwing things at the bloke. Eventually the male would respond and inflict greater damage (obviously). When we turned up, the woman would have bruises and the man would be arrested. But when we went to pub-brawls, the first question we asked was "who threw the first punch?" That's who would be arrested. I was only a young bloke but I could never figure out why the different standard.  The real downside of this though was that it skewed the statistics regarding DV. The feminists could claim "99% of arrests for DV are men".

6cs90s1n	You are talking about body integrity dysphoria. The current theory being they have a lower amount of grey matter linked to the mapping of the body part that feels foreign to them. I believe the same or a similar mechanism is not likely in the case of gender dysphoria; I believe it is simply as the name states a dysphoria of gender (not meeting social expectations because your "wiring" and gender expression do not match the cultural expectations that are being placed on your birthsex).    This in turn gives rise to rejecting the physical characteristics that are associated with our binary and are the distinguishing features between sexes. eg removal/modification of the penile tissue, binding/amputation of the breast etc. Removing these features allows one to more readily be perceived as the opposite gender; which in turn causes the environment to place less expectations upon you regarding your biological sex and more of your gender (opposing sex in the case of transgenders).     So while I do think gender dysphoria feels the same way to you; the mechanisms at play are totally different. From a very young age gender expectations start to "infect" the body and in particular the ones associated with the birth sex, When the mind is in harmony with these expectations an individual develops normally. If the mind rejects these expectations multiple possible scenarios unfold;    \- The individual resists and rejects the gender expectations and is able to claim the expression he/she wishes, while also claiming his/her birth sex. Insisting it is the world that is at fault for creating the burden of these expectations  where only freedom to express in any way should exist. Thus purging his/her soma of the infection of gender. Only sex remains and the individual is truly free. (This is the utopia, it requires a combination of either/both an extremely strong individual or a society with very mild/no gender roles)   \- The individual experiences moderate/mild dysphoria and drags on. Puberty and the bodily changes associated with it form a second test were all of the listed outcomes can occur again. Later in life as social expectations tend to lessen dysphoria might decrease or even be alleviated in total.   \- The individual experiences extreme dysphoria and wishes to transition as quickly as possible.     So while this might feel the same as body integrity disorder to the individual the implications of the different pathways are vast.     **Gender dysphoria pathway**   biological alteration in the brain (or simply an individual with a gender expression lying on the far end of the normal curve; towards the opposite gender) **->** Exposure to culture/gender roles **->** Physical traits become associated with gender roles (especially the sex organs in the broadest sense) "the gender infection stage" **->** Gender expectations not matching the way the mind wants to present **->** The gender is rejected and therefore the body that has become one with the gender (through infection) is rejected (**at this stage, which starts from a very young age; the condition, to the individual, is indiscernible from body integrity disorder** **in it's presentation**. One of apparently rejecting the biological body. But in the case of gender dysphoria looking at the mechanism we can still see it is actually a rejection of gender)     **Body integrity dysphoria pathway**   Biological alteration in the brain causing the individual to not recognize the limb as it's own/feeling off/foreign **->** The "target" limb is rejected      The importance is the way both conditions can be treated. In gender dysphoria we could, in theory, get rid of gender and it's expectations and cure new occurences of gender dysphoria overnight (But sadly it is not that simple culture is very resistant to changes; but it can be done if we want to and would probably face less backlash than the current agenda).    What we do now is treating the symptoms; you are a victim of gender roles and because you do not fit the claustrophobic box you were initialy placed we try to peel away your skin; put your bones in a new bag and place you in a new more fitting box.       In body integrity dysphoria we can only remove the limbs that are being rejected; which is controversial and no other treatments have been reported to have been succesful with a high degree of scientific consensus.	1642893625.0	htt1i25	t3_s9awgo	t1_htsp7g0	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9awgo/matt_walsh_shuts_down_gender_pronoun_debate_on_dr/htt1i25/

And while they are toddlers they are being affirmed by "experts", to make their transition go more smoothly as they age. By 8 they have hormone blockers. And if parents, and usually its the father that goes against it, they go to ail in certain countries or states. And also they can lose access to their children. Children belong to the state now.   &#x200B;  We are living in a very sick world, a very feminist world.	1642894927.0	htt4o2m	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htt2d8l	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htt4o2m/

83tk0jof	Yeah I'm not so sure about the rhetoric here, as you can reasonably have a campaign on issue A, when issue B is also important. You don't have to talk about every issue at the same time, or people aren't going to campaign on every social issue that happens to exist.  Now I think violence against (often) young males is an important issue, despite the fact that the perpetrators of the crimes are normally going to be other young males. Obviously that doesn't change the fact that it's completely unfair on the victims a lot of the time.   And sure, there may be a bias in what gets more of the attention. The political left tends to be soft on crime, except where it's something like *violence against women* and then they apparently believe in strict enforcement all of a sudden.  I think it's also noteworthy that so much violence is committed by men. I don't think that gender is purely a "social construct", but rather, there are just real differences between the sexes and men are hardwired to be more aggressive. Obviously most men can still behave themselves and aren't criminal thugs, but yeah, higher average aggression.	1642895140.0	htt564a	t3_sad34d	t3_sad34d	/r/antifeminists/comments/sad34d/the_un_and_the_pope_advertise_ending_violence/htt564a/

5bz207z4	Then sex work isn't work, and moral actions are applied, morality is in effect. The prostitute and the John are both immoral in the it actions.   Or sex work is work, sanctioned by society and not immoral and no different to any other purchase, pick your poison here but you get one or the other but not both. The person paying for the performance, or massage as you've put it considers the person providing the service no more than they provide the service.   If sex work is work then there is no moral issue, a married man can buy or rent a woman for as long as he wants, no different to paying for a massage, your words, so given that paying for sex by your own words being nothing more than buying a performance, paying for a massage or in my words buying a coffee, why attack the John, for paying for a service, especially if he's married, marriage means nothing, other than a joint enterprise to potentially reduce costs or raise children, love is nothing, meaningless and of no consequence, marriage vows and laws have no meaning.   Or sex work is immoral, not valid work, a prostitute is then somebody worth more than the situation they currently find themselves in, efforts should be made to help them find a way out.

8w6m5	>Uhh, a lot to reply to. Ill pick a couple things. I say my exes are looking to get me to commit to creating connection in return for being with me, and you ask fi I'm asking the same from them.... No actually I'm expecting it to be we both are commited to creating it in return for the other person being commited to creating it as well.  Entirely valid and should be expected in any relationship.   >I mentioned I can get sex because saying I sound like an incel is both dismissive to things I'd say, implying they only come from my sexual frustrations and self centered perspective, and also a little silly, I mean that whole term, incel, as if sex is like the god we are all searching for. its just sex. Big deal pretty commonplace. What about trust? helll of a lot more valuable these days.  What about trust?   >How are women losing access to their own body? Someones making you wear chastity belts? Access to birth control and abortions isn't accesss to your own body. You may have a right to those things but they are not your body they are medical procedures. Your body is the thing that creates the pregnancy with a man's sperm. You can argue having a right to those things but you cannot argue they are your body.  Are you serious right now? How is an abortion not involved with a womans body? I know what you're trying to say by definition but it's just ignorant. Not only did they ban abortions from clinics, they made it a crime to do so on your own. People can turn women in for going out of state for their own abortion. This had nothing to do with the state or the government. This is her body. You're literally telling women that they're not allowed to remove a potential "parasite" from their body. Some women don't want to sacrifice 9 months of their life attending to something that's just going to feed off of them both before and after pregnancy; especially if it's there without her consent.   >See the thing is, this si the first time I have said anything invalidating about yoru experience. Everything you have said has basically been arguing and invalidating my experience while the things I have said are more explaining my perspective without invalidating yours. What does that say about the gender dynamic? That my feelings and perspective are treated as valid by women or society in general?  You have/are equally invalidating my own experiences, if not more so. Why even bring the gender dynamic up in that part? Honestly, I'm giving facts and offering a conversion. I don't know what feelings you feel I've invalidated, but I'm sorry if I have.   >You are right emotional support goes both ways. I would like to find a woman capable of considering the fact here is a social norm it goes more one way than the other.   You know how I know you're just upset and trying to lash out? Turn around what you have been preaching on this. If I said  I'd like to find a man capable of considering the fact there is a social norm it goes one way or the other, you'd probably find it immediately offensive or at least very false. You'd think of a thousand ways that I'm wrong and a thousand times that I'm mistaken. But the very idea of making a claim like that is just ignorant; right? I mean, you have a woman, right here, that even proposed it. Why is this a battle for you?   >Obviously you're not willing to even consider that or else youd say hmm I'll think abotu and observe that instead of just telling me I'm wrong.   But I'm the one that brought it up? What?   >Up till this post, I've tried to engage in a style of communication leads to discussion more than arguement, a sharing and observing more than accusing or blaming but your communication style seems to be only debate, and this is exactly an example of what I find very difficult to relate to and communicate with.   Not even close. I gave very basic questions with minimal infliction. Please read what I asked in my original comments.   >I get the feeling if I'm not telling you how brave you are you'd argue with me and both those are just boring.   I get the feeling you're reflecting here because I've not once asked for a medal. Don't just assume stuff like this. It's not good.   >I haven't even told you you're wrong about anything till this post when thats all you have told me.   I literally asked a question and responded to your claims. I'm sorry you don't have the chance to prove me wrong?   >You seem to have nothing to offer or share other than telling me I dont know what I'm talking about and my impression of you is one of lack of substance in you and instead a fcous on your rights and freedoms with little of meaning shared for what thats like for you.  Where are you getting this from? I asked a question and responded to some things you said. What do you want me to offer? You've literally spent this whole post and the last one telling me that I've just been cruel to you while you bash into me. Little meaning for what freedom is to me? Jeeze...   >The bigger thing is, I go through life constantly econsidering my thoughts and feelings as possibly being the results of ignorance or primitive drives that no longer serve me.   That's rough, to say the least. This is something you could maybe talk to someone for. Sounds like anxiety maybe or repressed memories.   >women don't seem to analyze and second guess themselves in that way  They most certainly do on some levels. It's not good to assume how other people think or what they're thinking.   >Like if you suggest perhaps their wanting men to compete for their affections does not serve them, they feel like you are trying to control them and stifle their freedoms and oppress them as part of the patriarchy because they should be allowed to be promiscuous. To consider that perhaps the ways they have men compete are irrelvant and unrelated to what it is shes looking for in a partner is not something they are willing to do. This is where the word primitive comes in.    >Mens primitive nature is to fuck everything that moves right?   No... Kind of. Women also like sex. But we, as a society, decided it was wrong to force people to do that. I certainly know some women, and men, that will talk a ravage game about a guy they want to bang. They don't do it, because it's wrong.   >We've been rising above that for centuries,   Yes; we, as a society, have risen above it. Or at least tried to.   >what is the female counterpart  What? Everyone is in this together. Are you expecting a medal or something because you're male?   >how can or should women rise above it?  Rise above it? Some are. Just like how some men are. I'd dare to argue both. But women at this point aren't really the problem in terms of overly forceful sexual assaults. Men are typically larger and stronger, so it's easier for them to do so. Thus, men tend to commit sexual assault at a much higher rate than women. Men are sexually assaulted more, and that's not argued. But men are also the ones to typically do it.	1642897547.0	httb37l	t3_s9d7iy	t1_htsvazs	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9d7iy/whats_the_point_anymore/httb37l/

You don't have to talk about every issue at the same time, or people aren't going to campaign on every social issue that happens to exist.  The problem with your take here is that issue A is literally the only issue that is given exclusive attention and it has been that way for a very, very, *very* long time, whereas issue B is barely an afterthought despite being the objectively larger one when it comes down to numbers and statistics.

wo721	Leto’s son, Paul Atreides, is next in line to take power of their house. Leto is never once portrayed as bumbling, idiotic, neglectful, etc. I can’t remember specifics but he was the exact opposite of the stereotypical father in feminist-influenced media. Leto is strong, brave, courageous and stoic. While also leaving room for emotion and caring for the emotional state of his son and what he means for the future of their house. He has this absolutely fucking *amazing* scene with his son in their family’s graveyard. Again, can’t remember specifics for the life of me. But it was everything that feminists *truly* fear about men. That men aren’t just emotionless rocks out to use everyone for their own gain. That a patriarch, which he is, is not inherently evil. He is an ideal leader, and the supporting cast show this with their *earned* loyalty to him - not blind fanaticism/zealotry. There is a severe lack of role models like Leto, at least to me, for young boys in both fictional media and real life.   If I have this all wrong or someone has a different take on Leto’s character, please feel free to add on. My analyses aren’t the greatest, just writing from my shitty memory and nonstop stream of thought.	1642904800.0	htts2qz	t3_s9vako	t1_htstwhi	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9vako/we_all_silently_agree_that_this_is_also_a_problem/htts2qz/

e13pa32v	I am 17 so yeah bold of you to believe I have sex all day lol XD  but, I am opposite of you, sadly :(  but that porn and all also promotes sexualization of women, I used to have that in my mind all the time... studies are important, career is important, money is important, in order to survive (also fitness) but, they are nothing more than "MERE PIXELS ON A SCREEN"  thus why waste time on this age of screens ? better to be productive for humanity  Ikr, I have that Nikola Tesla like mentality, but then again, such men change the world, not the ordinary ones...   No Fap isn't forced, but yeah I get it, if you get happy, do it.... fapping/sex might be alright, but porn is NOT. (again in my opinion)   and I am not religious, I am an atheist... No Fap is not semen retention btw... and, No Fap too has some valid proof.... but again, you keep your beliefs, I will keep mine  end goal is however being against feminism as one though lol... for both of us...	1642913794.0	htucdd1	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htuanok	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htucdd1/

Since I couldn't FAP, I looked to have sex to get off and that made me much better at getting women.       The only thing I'd say is, you're 17.  Go and enjoy yourself.  Get fit, gain knowledge, and go outside.  I wouldn't have been caught dead going back and forth with people on a website when I was 17.  It's one of the best times in your life, enjoy and develop it.

kwzqf	Nothing you said relates to anything else you said.  You can still FAP and build great things.  Accountants, doctors, engineers, scientists, astronauts, military personnel (I can promise you we FAP a lot) ALL FAP.  The amount of sex workers pales in comparison to all the other occupations out there.  It's not like we're taking our best and brightest and turning them into sex workers.  The people that are suitable for other jobs will still do other jobs.  I agree we need to combat poverty and teach people, but that has nothing to do with this conversation.  I really think this is an age difference and a culture difference.  I didn't grow up in the digital age, yet FAPPING to sex workers (magazines) was still done as much as today.  Do you think people are ignorant of greedy companies?  That's all anyone complains about.  Instead of blaming shitty companies, promoting the good ones or building your own are the only real alternatives.	1642915195.0	htuf7w3	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htudpzz	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htuf7w3/

8ynspnfb	I don't have anything against sex work. If she has such low standards that she will do anything to make money then that's enough of a red flags for me. It's very hard to live in this world and social media influence us a lot to buy expensive stuffs that we don't need and it's obvious that many of us aren't smart enough to understand this propoganda and take a stance against it. So people would eventually resort to any job to make money. Such people who do sex work just for living a luxurious life disgusts me.  However I'm not against people doing sex work just to pay their debts or student loan and then quit immediately. I respect such people because they didn't get corrupt by the easy money and gave up the job after the goal was achieved.  People's past is always important.

Still, yes, 88% of porn does depict this, just from the first few pages I haven't seen anything degrading. Moreover, just because there's aggression during sex, doesn't mean it is specificly woman-hating.  And plus, porn users don't actually make porn, nor do they criticize and say shameful remarks about the women (well, nothing too serious like telling them to die or something, only commenting on their body which IS misogynistic, but it IS a porn site sooo..)  Still, I don't mean to sound rude in any way.

5bz207z4	Feminists in this regard are directly responsible for creating their own misery, and increasing the misery of millions of women.  Another example of the dangerous ideology that it has become.   Do all prostitutes hate what they do, I suppose not, I suppose there are some who enjoy it, revel in it even but they are the exception to the rule not the general case which in my view invalidates their view when we know the vast majority of women do not like what they do, do not like what they have to do, would wish to be anywhere else doing anything else.   However if sex work is work, then they create a sword of Damocles over every single sex worker, first off they objectify themselves, so cannot expect to be thought of as anything other than a sex object where they are of course the object being sold, second they can say they hate what they do, what sympathy do they garner, most people hate their job, if sex work is work then they deserve no special consideration nor treatment, do we offer help, advice and protection to leave the industry for a train driver, a doctor, a software engineer, a lawyer, a road sweeper.   If sex work is valid work then the billions worldwide being spent to protect women who are caught up in the trap of prostitution goes away, justifiably so because no other job gets the same consideration, no other job gets the same protection.   They also by their demands trap many more women into that life who are currently trying to get out, these women hold their money until they have enough to leave and make their lives comfortable while they arrange to get the help they need to move on, that will of course be ruined by them having to declare their full income for tax purposes, reducing their income through taxes and as we all know taxation being a bigger issue for the poorer in society taxation is responsible for keeping many in a poverty situation, this will inevitably force many to continue in that life for far longer and face far more risks.	1642928453.0	htuzion	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htt9ouy	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htuzion/

9ojyvtfr	Thanks, I really appreciate these conversations too. I understand how it might seem like in a perfect world, rapists would be punished in the industry, but sadly that isn’t the case. In the same way that drug cartels continuously operate despite being illegal, so do rapists.  I highly recommend reading this blog post, it has lots of great information with sources:  https://artemis-the-protector.tumblr.com/post/669540544643530752/yeah-because-you-can-totally-tell-how-smart-i-am  Some key takeaways from it are the realities of the porn industry. Human trafficking, child sex abuse, rape, coercion, etc. are rampant in the industry. This often goes unpunished due to lack of regulation and the victims not being taken seriously. You can see this in the testimonials from real porn actresses in the linked post. Because that’s what they are… actresses. Of course they’re going to pretend everything is fine when the camera is rolling.  You can also see the misogynistic attitudes. Yes, most of those aggressive acts are directed towards women. You have titles like “dirty teen whore gets anally destroyed” and similar. Very misogynistic in nature. You said something about how men might make degrading comments about women in porn but it’s ok “because it’s porn” and I ask… why does that make it ok? Isn’t it worse that saying degrading things about women and their bodies turns you on? If you weren’t a misogynist, why would porn appeal to you when most of it involves women being tossed around, slapped, choked, and generally just treated like objects?  Also, there’s this:  https://artemis-the-protector.tumblr.com/post/670758316208685056/blackswanenthusiast-we-know-that-tell-that-to  This post contains links where men who direct and buy sex talk about women. You can see the misogynistic attitudes plain as day. You also have to consider that by supporting this industry, these men are also supporting the rampant rape and trafficking of the industry.  So yes, I believe porn is inherently misogynistic. The subject matter itself glorifies the degradation and pain of women, and the industry itself routinely exploits and abuses the women working in it.	1642931477.0	htv3csb	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htuxzu7	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htv3csb/

99cker03	Ah yes a another feminists taking one issue that goes throughout humanity and turning it to women based off of their own feelings about it. Shut the fuck up bitch. Just cause you got raped doesn't make it a woman's only issue. And not everything with men revolves around sex. Feminists think more about sex than the men they batter. And plus when most women want sex they can't take no for an answer. Have you ever had someone trick you into having a child with them.  Hmm well I have, that is literally only a man's issue. Yet you'd probably make it into a woman's issue. Has your mother tried to kill you cause she didn't want a son no but I have.  Have you been called sexist for not wanting to be with a woman 200 pounds hmm probably not cause men having preferences is shamed apon like we can't have morals. Have you gone to court and damn near went to prison for not paying child support for a child that isn't yours nope cause thats only a man's issue. Have you been accused of rape for denying a woman probably not. Have you been feared just because you are walking down the street. Have you been pepper sprayed for walking into a store probably not. Have you been raped by your fucking teacher at the age of 15 and told you probably liked it screaming inside whole your body is enjoying something while your mind wants nothing to do with it PROBABLY FUCKING NOT. Then told you probably enjoyed it and that women got no consequences under the law. And guess what I've been raped 2 times in my life 1 my teacher female. Two my uncle. Hmm funny but its only a woman's issue right. Yet I can state more man's issues than I already have. Bitch just cause women deal with it doesn't mean it only women.	1642933739.0	htv694s	t3_sa6h1z	t1_htsdq6g	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa6h1z/and_none_of_those_things_she_listed_are_gendered/htv694s/
59y3ty09	Govt. Is not going to listen to MRAs demands. Because that's not a popular opinion (due to media) & Simping for woman will get them more votes. Due to media feminists & simps (99.99% of men), MRA issues/concerns will never become popular with general population. On top of that most young kids both (m&f) are feminists due to indoctrination at schools and social media.  So your best way to success is to hurt govt in unusual ways for their Simping. By not getting married, not making kids & living in a minimalistic way, you are actually creating issues for govts. Since 99.99% Indian men are simps, they don't give a shit about men's issue, they will laugh at MRA's. So let them suffer from these laws. When they get trapped in a false case, then they (not all) will learn a lesson. But it will take decades. That is the reason to support marital rape law.  This protective mentality (to save humanity) is good in an ideal society. But in a dysfunctional society (where we live), it's a simp mentality. So having that is not good for the you right now & in future. If you try to help a woman who is getting assaulted. Some will say thanks, some will say nothing, some will file fake cases. So best thing for you is to look after yourself & your family. You a have a lot to lose if you get trapped. There are a lot of example out there. Give these feminists what they always say. They say they are empowered, strong blah blah blah, so let them deal with that. Give them freedom. If someone asks why did you interfere, then tell them Men & Woman are equal. Enjoy the shitshow. Humanity only exists in social media &  in public it is reserved only for woman. There is no incentive for us.  After I left MRA, I never supported a single person who is suffering from false cases by wife. That guy agreed to all of these when signed on the paper. If he didn't read terms and conditions, then it's his fault. So he deserves no sympathy.	1642933749.0	htv69n5	t3_sa19w8	t1_htux265	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa19w8/antifeminists/htv69n5/

bmrlx9pm	 Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."  "Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

1x6rbyhc	Oh it does. I mean think about it. If the statistics are that women suffer more gender based violence, then the question of who initiated the violence calls into question their victimhood. So that if a woman slaps me as hard as she can, and I punch her as hard as I can, I am the victim, but she's the casualty. Nobody thinks the Nazis were victims for getting punched really hard by the allies...so why would anyone think women are the victims.  Your experiences, regardless of the gynocentric makeup of legal systems, illustrated a fundamental flaw in their logic. If you slap me, I am the victim, if I defend myself, you become a casualty. So the data that states the victimhood of women is false. In fact men are the victims, the difference is, they are not the majority casualty.	1642936669.0	htva3gg	t3_sa9ora	t1_httvqs4	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa9ora/what_feminists_dont_realize_when_men_say_if_were/htva3gg/

I think we can all agree that it is primarily MEN who kill men and also MEN who kill women.   So when people talk about ending violence against women, is it really fair to call that unfair towards men?   Women are a lot of things, but they are SIGNIFICANTLY less frequently violent criminals when compared to men yet are frequently still the target of violent crime.

Secondly it means that I treat you as I have been treated, as all men are treated, you do not get the tight to special consideration, women first is a historical idea, now it's every person for themselves, if you fail then it sucks to be you.  If your scared to walk home alone at night well you get to experience what we sometimes have to and no you don't get to ask any man to help you out.

Culture is a series of norms based on habits refined over time. Habits are actions by individuals. The individuals in question are female, so the gynocentric culture is rooted in the actions of females. One can only act in accordance to their nature, so female nature is at the root. This is not misogyny, and you cannot scare me with such foolishly feminist tags.

They call egalitarian movements sexist or misogynistic just to smear it in the eye of the public.	1642941679.0	htvgvh0	t3_saskoq	t3_saskoq	/r/antifeminists/comments/saskoq/how_about_we_should_all_be_egalitarians_instead/htvgvh0/

Splitting the bill is in my view way down the road, a first date should always be nothing more than a coffee date or drinks, a second date or third date is where you split the bill, it's where you find out what she really sees in you, are you a food call, a safe port, a backup or does she want you, if she does she'll split the bill if for nothing else than to show you she's worth your investment.   I know a lot of women are in this sub but please understand I can only speak from a males perspective, I don't know what subs you should read to get the red flags to look out for in men, to you then I say put your fantasies away, stop thinking if you overlook this red flag he's acting prince charming, they aren't.	1642942846.0	htvimks	t3_sangko	t1_htvfqp2	/r/antifeminists/comments/sangko/what_happened_to_equality/htvimks/

However, lots of these FDS women call something that is not to their own personal preferences for red flags, which doesn't really make sense as what's not one person's preference can be another's persons preference.   Like, just cause I don't wanna date someone who's religious myself doesn't mean that being religious is a red flag. For someone who's religious, dating someone else who is religious is a green flag.

Whenever I see this rhetoric it baffles me that people don't realise they're essentially victim blaming.  Lesbian couples have a disproportionately high levels of domestic violence - actually the highest out of straight couples and gay male couples - but since it's women abusing other women, that effectively cancels it out and doesn't really matter?

"the Patriarchy" is just the same scapegoat mechanism the Nazis with a made up, imaginary "Jew1sh world C0nspiracy" to justify their atrocities  * they already had success with it ... they changes the laws with their false narrative that shows them as "victims" although statistics and facts prove otherwise ... (Example "domestic violence": statistics show that 70% of DV attacks are initiated by women - mostly because they think there would be no consequences ... statistics also show that lesbian couples have the highes rates of DV)  we are currently in a very similar situation like in 1933 Germany ... the Nazis were successful with their narrative to portrait Jewish people as parasites and "harmful to society", people really were convinced that Jewish people were destroying and exploiting the Germans, the Nazis used their own language like "Dolchstosslegende" and imaginary "Jew1sh W0rld C0nspiracy" to brainwash everybody. Beating a Jewish person, locking the up, killing them ... was considered beneficial to society. Currently we have the same situation with the narrative about men: feminists popularized "men are murderers and rapists" or "kill all men" ... a women can beat a man on the open street and get him arrested on made up charges without anybody intervening or helping ... this is the same situation as it was with Jewish people in 1933 in Germany.   If you think it's "harmless" I can tell you ... it's not ... it will slowly get worse ... if people don't fight it ... it will slowly get to a point where you will have "curfews" for men (already proposed) to make the streets safer for women ... or you will get areas where men will not be allowed ... if it gets even worse the next step will be "male ghettos" which you only can leave for work   if you think this is impossible ... this already happened nearly 90 years ago with Jewish people  feminist will not be dumb enough to build "camps" in the end ... it will mostly stay on the level of ghettos or they will lock up huge portions of the male population in prison ... their goal is what it always was: male slave labor/money without giving anything in return	1642952681.0	htw2fg5	t3_sat1ns	t3_sat1ns	/r/antifeminists/comments/sat1ns/feminism_is_about_equality/htw2fg5/

8sz8knes	I can defend it easily. Women's aid isn't asking the government not to fund gender neutral shelters, they're just petitioning to make sure funding is not taken from single sex shelters in order to do this.   I fully acknowledge the need for gender neutral shelters, as they benefit men, and mixed gender families fleeing DV. However, I also know that particularly  female victims of sexual violence often require a sex segregated space to recover and be safe.   There needs to be funding for both, and funding one at the cost of another is not a solution.

wo721	I agree. Unfortunately my father wasn’t the best role model. Not downright bad but not great either. He had a really bad temper and would occasionally take it out on my brother and I. But luckily those moments were few and far between. He was definitely very passive and has a seemingly avoidant attachment style. I think a lot of that stemmed from a resentment of giving up his career to be a stay at home dad. My mother wasn’t make as much as him when I was born, but she was on a path that would have her making *much* more than he would ever. While my brother and I have enjoyed the fruits of her labour, we are extremely well off and we both very much appreciate her and all her sacrifice, she has confessed to me that she would have very much preferred to have been a SAHM. She was seduced by the idea of a high-power, high-earning career and didn’t think of the consequences of working almost every waking hour of her 20s-40s. She managed to convince my dad that her earning double his projected salary cap and him staying home would have been better than him working and earning his still very much middle class salary. Recently, that reality has hit her. How much of our lives she missed in favour of board meetings, cubicles and the synthetic nature of the corporate world. The physical consequences of working a nigh 24/7 desk job has *certainly* caught up with her as well.	1642955062.0	htw8eev	t3_s9vako	t1_htvw5xv	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9vako/we_all_silently_agree_that_this_is_also_a_problem/htw8eev/

4c9h0	>What’s wrong is you are actively disparaging women for their clothing choices, which is the opposite of you being happy with everyone living their lives any way they see fit.  This discussion originally begin with a conversation about whether it's okay for a man to leave his girlfriend because she wants to go to a party dressed like a prostitute. First, people like yourself were arguing that makes him a sexist.  Then I argued that if women have the choice to dress however they like, men should have the choice to not be in relationships with women that dress like hoes, because that's equality. Isn't that what Feminism was fighting for?  Then, people like yourself asked me to explain why I wouldn't be in a relationship with a woman who dressed like a prostitute, and thus we ended up here. In other words, the goalposts have been moved. I do think everyone has the right to live life as they see fit. This includes that women can do whatever they want, and men can do whatever they want in response. Based on my experience, good men aren't going to be in relationships with women that dress like prostitutes, for reasons I've already explained. [Sexual objectification hurts women](https://wp.nyu.edu/steinhardt-appsych_opus/the-effects-of-sexual-objectification-on-womens-mental-health/), this is a fact that has been proven over and over again and cannot be denied. It doesn't make any difference if it's the woman sexually objectifying herself, in fact that's arguably even worse.  You're free to disagree with that. But honestly, the fact that so many people have been upset with what I've said (good men aren't going to be in relationships with women who dress like hoes) means I've struck a nerve. People don't become emotionally invested in a conversation like this unless on some level, they know there's truth to the claim being made. All you're doing is proving my point.  &#x200B;  >Plenty of women who wear revealing clothing are in happy, healthy relationships so you making a blanket statement like that is not only inaccurate, it’s just laughable.  I don't know any women who dress like prostitutes who are in happy, healthy relationships, nor do I know any good, high quality men that would put up with that when they have plenty of options of women who have self-respect and dignity and who do not treat their own bodies like an object.

8sz8knes	I think it is really unfortunate that there are very few options for men who need shelter in the UK. However I don't think the solution is to take essential funding away from women's only shelters or force women's only shelters to become gender neutral in order to keep funding.   Surely any reasonable person can admit that there is a dire need for both women's only shelters, (which despite existing 'everywhere' are being forced to turn women away because they can't meet the increasing demand caused by the pandemic) and gender neutral shelters.

3s4lioa6	I’d say that initially this doesn’t seem like such a bad idea, but the thing is, this paper misses two really crucial things. Those things being that consent can be withdrawn anytime and neither the man or woman using contraception. As far as consent goes, I know a lot of times people in here like to just claim that women will change their mind afterwards, but that’s not the case a lot of times. Does it happen? Yes it unfortunately does. But a big problem is that people don’t understand consent isn’t a simple yes or no. I see that you have a checklist of activities and that’s a good start, but as I said earlier, consent can be revoked any time during the sexual act itself. This is because many times partners try something new and the other may find that it is not comfortable. If the other partner is comfortable with is, then there’s no problem, but if they find an activity physically painful and the other does not stop what they’re doing after being told to, then yeah that is classified as rape.   As for contraception, both men and women have been found to tamper with it. On this form, both partners could easily lie and say yes. And at the same time, contraception is is not 100% effective especially if used the wrong way, so even if you do use contraception, getting pregnant isn’t necessarily a give away that holes were poked in the condom of that the pills weren’t taken.   Not saying that it isn’t a good thing to get consent written down, but when it comes to one of the partners not stopping an activity that is harmful, then yeah that’s where this paper falls down hill.	1642960971.0	htwns0x	t3_say46k	t3_say46k	/r/antifeminists/comments/say46k/must_use_this_form_before_sex/htwns0x/

Women are genetically more risk averse, more sensitive to the elements, and have less aptitude for physical strength than men. Socially women are currently taught mostly that they should be allowed to do anything they want with no fear of consequences with an opposing social doctrine that they women should face consequences for their actions.   The opposing social doctrine (anti-feminism) has been growing for a while, and is slated to continue pushing both feminist and generally gynocentric social doctrine back.	1642962642.0	htws60d	t3_sar60q	t1_htvdywp	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/htws60d/

I'm not saying every girl is like that, but you are signing a deal with another person who will benefit from breaking it.  Focus on your studies & future.

4jxw6vf	>You’re right. I don’t know you. But even a glance sends tradcon / right winger red flags.  How about, instead of digging through my profile, you start a civilized conversation, like an adult, to find out what I think? If I were as nasty as you, I would say that it's typically a leftist behavior, but I won't. You just stick me with questionable labels, hoping that I will defend myself for not being on this or that political side, while I have my own way of thinking. There is no wrong in having some right-wing or conservative ideas. Everyone has good reasons to think what they think, and each point of view is defendable.   The trap is to join one of the extremes, and to reject everything that is not of your political side. I hope this is not your case, because if you want to talk about red flags, you also send some too. Not to mention the way you seem to view the right wingers, the simple fact of having the word "trans" in your username suggests that you only define yourself by your gender, and that you support intersectional movement, which is just an extension of feminism. Nothing forbids you to listen to diverse opinions, to accept some and to reject others, whether they are from the right or the left.  >You have the word ‘triggered’ in your bio which is used by misandristic anti-SJW’s  I hope for you that there is not also some trans people who said that word, by generalizing like that, you could end up saying that being trans is misandristic and anti-SJW. So yes, I use anti-SJW language like "trigger" because I think it's appropriate. I've lost count of the number of times I've been banned from subreddits because one of my jokes triggered a moderator, so I put it in my bio. There are still some labels that can fit me, I like the "anti-SJW" one, you have to be blind to not see the alarming rise of the woke ideology absolutely everywhere. But "misandrist", seriously? That's probably the dumbest thing you could've said about me, I'm literally here because of misandry.  >You also have super straight in your pfp and are ranting about ‘transgender people forcing me to date them.’  Now your interpretations go way too far. You're literally twisting my words to try to stick me with your stereotypical definition of super straight, that you must have learnt in some extreme trans activist meeting. Although not that extreme, considering the influence they have today, we could almost talk about a new standard. But hopefully, common sense still exists. I'm only talking about some stupid extremists, not about all trans people, as you would like me to do. Like I said, super straight started out as a huge troll to mock the idiots who invoke transphobia at the slightest inconvenience. On a lighter note, it's also for me a satirical way of making fun of the people who put their sexuality or gender flag behind an anime character on their profile picture. And unlike them, my flag is based and is not seem everywhere.  >I wouldn’t date a tradcon like you even if I was paid for starters so stop ego-lifting.  I didn't ask you anything, take a breath. Even if you were a biological woman, I'm not attracted by the hysterical ones.  >Kill all men is also claimed to be a joke from TERFs to deflect criticism for hate speech / declaring malecide against men and they use your same talking points. It’s a mind-numbingly stupid excuse.  "Kill al men" is very explicit, feminists are the ones who gave this meaning to these words, while super straight only reflects a reality, that some extremists label as transphobic, by giving it a completely twisted definition, that you're using right now. Let me quote my own comment about what super straight is originally:  >It's just a troll answer to the morons who call as transphobic the straight people who are only attracted to the opposite sex (so almost everyone). So if they call you transphobic, you can call them LGBTphobic, since they insult you for your sexual orientation. While the whole thing started as a joke, they couldn't stand the paradox so much, that they chose to call super straight transphobic too. As if they didn't already understand that they can't solve all their nonsense by putting phobic words on it.  Super straight is only transphobic because you want it to be, but it doesn't work like that.   >your right wing nonsense makes men’s rights movement and true anti-feminism look bad  You made up an idea of who I was based on my profile picture, which is basically just a troll/joke, so you could insult me without reserve, by putting tradcon/right wing labels on me, that only reflect your own extremism. With a mentality like that, who do you think is the more harmful? You have no legitimacy to talk to me like that, but since I don't have your arrogance, I will not tell you to get out like you do.   Now, if it's to come up with such a narrow answer again, it's not worth my time. I will continue to be antifeminist, whether you like it or not. Good bye.	1642966761.0	htx2o2f	t3_s4zbug	t1_htvt77r	/r/antifeminists/comments/s4zbug/this_subreddit_is_pretty_depressing/htx2o2f/

It is mind blowing to me how women can not grasp their advantage is in their 20's pretty much as a default, then they absolutely waste the world being at their fingertips, get to a point where it's gone, and they have nothing to show for it and have a litany of voids to fill.    Instead of telling other women to NOT make the same mistakes, they just double down.

h2jt1i58	> What would the man get in return?  Most women can not answer this question anymore as they have brainwashed themselves into thinking this whole "strong and independent" shit is the way to go.  I asked a girl in Hinge a few days ago what made her unique as that was her big selling point to me.  Like magic the convo completely died and a day later she unmatched.  She literally got stumped by a question she promoted.  I feel like I am seeing more and more women unable to actually tell a men what she brings to the table or what makes her so great.  They say it all the time, but being able to articulate why is getting rare at a rapid pace.  It's sad too because it's trickling down to women who are not feminists.  Feminism is absolutely ruining dating and it's painfully obvious.    Like if you're strong and independent, great, but realize you are going to STAY independent, that's the down side.  It's the exact same reason they say men staying alone can be a bad thing overtime.  It applies to women too, humans gunna human after all.	1642967507.0	htx4jv6	t3_sangko	t1_htv3s19	/r/antifeminists/comments/sangko/what_happened_to_equality/htx4jv6/

hqrq3oku	Yeah for me it's the opposite when it comes to tempers, my mom, God bless her soul (don't worry she is still alive) was loving but had a temper that got to the point of me recoiling back when she goes to my face, it mainly comes from her hitting me, and of course I come from a country that isn't exactly advanced so to speak, we still live on the "hit if they misbehave model" to the point that when you get bad marks on a test the teacher would slap your arm with a stick, hell I've seen kids who misbehave get hit with a big PVC pipe, the kid, who I've never seen get even after taking punches, came back sobbing.    and so because of her hitting me, I kinda built a reflex of recoiling if she's mad and near me, of course she stopped, but that wasn't the only issue, she also loved to mess with me in a not fun way, now I'm gonna admit I have a short temper with games, so I get vocally mad, so she teases me, and I tell her to stop and I get more angry slowly, so she then gets mad when I'm raising my tone, the worst part is when she tells me, and excuse the translation as she says it in another language, "if you're raising your voice now, what are you gonna do when you grow up, hit me? You're gonna abuse me?" Just the fact that she dares to think that I even imagine laying a finger on my own mother.   now of course I had some bitterness towards her but I learnt to forget and forgive, yes what she did is extreme but I can only blame it on this country's terrible traditions (most kids born in the 50s to 90s grow up on beatings and yelling), and besides, holding a grudge to my own mother is just something I'm not looking for, I'm not one for cutting people off and generally I'm not a fan of keeping around old memories, it was terrible but Hey, that's life, and she stopped why she does and knows better, I say that learning to forget and forgive and to not good grudges is something important in life   keeping old wounds open is only a road to more pain.	1642977289.0	htxu0ve	t3_s9vako	t1_htw8eev	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9vako/we_all_silently_agree_that_this_is_also_a_problem/htxu0ve/

They think that she won't mind being sexualised because of her work and will treat her that way. The solution: ban sex work. It's not real work and the women are just disrespecting their bodies by hawking it off to different people.	1642986474.0	htyh6ad	t3_sa3xd5	t1_htx1xy0	/r/antifeminists/comments/sa3xd5/from_the_mag_for_13_girls_that_taught_them_the/htyh6ad/

e13pa32v	Love making is accounted as sex, it is loyalty, by not doing that, aren't you promoting cheating ? Cheating is another thing which feminists do, a LOT.  I am Indian, in marriages, now the Fiance's of the groom go away with their boyfriends, and chest on the Fiance. How are there 2 guys you may ask ?  Well, actually, in India, a girl can easily find a guy to marry, a rich guy for life, if the boyfriend ain't rich, they now stay underground, and cheat on their partners, shit even have babies together and ask the other innocent guy to pay. But that info is not revealed.  When the cheating is caught, there's a direct court case logged by the woman, by article 498a of our constitution, in the charge of Domestic violence. That's a false accusation, but now on the husband and his entire family.   Also, as a matter of fact, this domestic violence law is highly messed up, firstly, it's only made for women. Second, it's 85% of the times FALSE. Yup. That's the situation.  Another law biased towards women, aka Marital Rape law, is  on its way, now people men will have to sign this maybe to prove innocence. And Feminist women may manipulate the guy by saying "why are you signing this, don't you trust me huh ? 🥺🥺🥺" And boom then anytime she can come, even after 10 years, that the husband raped her or hit her....  That's the situation now.  Thus, Sex is love. Nothing else. If a girl sleeps with 10s of guys or maybe even 30, and doesn't study properly or build a career, and then goes to choose a virgin lonely guy, who is btw rich, she can easily do that. Here, all girls are seen as innocent. Thus, sex is love making, not mechanics...	1642988075.0	htykycb	t3_say46k	t1_htxxaow	/r/antifeminists/comments/say46k/must_use_this_form_before_sex/htykycb/

The loophole i can already see in that document is the absence of a sobriety clause and a slot for names and age range. Even if you put the 4k'est quality camera with verbal confirmation while she signs it there is always the arguement of "being forced to sign" or mildly under rhe influence of date rape drugs during signage. Plus she can claim she said "stop" in klingon at negative 2000 decibels during intercourse but you refused. There are so many loopholes her lawyer can use while she puts on the waterworks at the right intervals.  Finally, some judges will perceive the document like they do with prenups: toilet paper with ink on it. Nonetheless its a good initiative, it would just be unfortunate carrying the CONsent and the CONdom just to end up getting CONned.	1642992237.0	htyv4bf	t3_say46k	t3_say46k	/r/antifeminists/comments/say46k/must_use_this_form_before_sex/htyv4bf/

dsa9cr2s	Well India is a long ways away so that doesn’t really affect me but… There’s a lot of domestic violence that goes on in India. If that’s what we’re talking about. Tons of violence against women and they get so despondent that they basically put gasoline on themselves and light themselves on fire or commit suicide some other way because they are in such a desperate situation. People all over the world are suffering from this and it’s man against women and women against men. Traditionally more men against women in the patriarchal societies. It makes me glad I live in Canada. Honestly it’s not like I see huge groups of feminists marching down the streets of the city I live in.  It doesn’t affect me or anyone I know men or women. Doesn’t affect us at all. In fact the word feminist I used to hear all the time in the 60s but I’ve never heard it until the whole red pill movement. I have to be honest I think sometimes it’s a lot of men who are looking to point the finger of blame at someone because their life didn’t turn out the way they were told it would or they thought it should so they’re looking for someone to blame. But society is just shifting and that’s just the way it is. You have to try to live your best life.

ioivqs6b	MP Jess Phillips laughs at men's rights debate request "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRWUsn4yyJI   She literally laughs at male suicide, when someone brings it up in the parliament. Now, I know u would say she is an extreme feminazi, but she was actually supported by feminists after this and the actual issue was never adressed. Instead it turned into, women get harassed bla bla. I dont condone harassing her, but lets be real it was just to turn attention away from actual problem.    Which was never even adressed by these feminists     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXGkVsMdXxE , Feminists protest against men's spaces calling it sexist. Meanwhile want specific spaces for women     A very good comment from this misleading video by feminists     A more accurate title would be  “men’s rights activist sue feminist funded womens spaces over the exclusion of males and male spaces”   If men are not allowed to have their own spaces over laws that say it’s discrimination which was lobbied by feminist, then  technically women having spaces just for women would be discrimination.     See the difference in framing that title?    Men’s rights activist are not trying to exclude women’s spaces from existing per se they are trying to demonstrate those groups blatant sexism in not allowing men to have their own spaces, if that happens to simply shutdown a sexist feminist class or group its not men’s rights fault those groups decided to be or happen to be blatant sexist and therefore removed, that’s feminist fault.	1643005355.0	htzlur0	t3_s9ks4s	t1_htx50gx	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htzlur0/
ioivqs6b	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLFIsv7ATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLFIsv7ATE) This video is by a female MRA     In short one good point from it, more women are going to college now than men. But They still get affirmative action and support from government. Back when women were less, there were much calls to improve the gender ratio.   Now that men are lesser in colleges, why are feminists not helping to get affirmative action for men?? In fact there are still much higher support for women and affirmative actions for them. It's like they simply dont care about equality     Also, one very good point about feminist hypocrisy as said by Dave Chappele. It is a woman's right whether she wants to have an abortion or not, and men should have no say in this. Then men should also have say whether they want to pay child support or not. And if IM wrong, then perhaps we are all wrong. According to feminists, men should have no say in abortion of their child, but should be forced to pay child support. Not to mention there are so many cases of men being forced to pay child support, for a baby tthat wasnt even theirs.     **And these are just some basic hypocrisies from feminists, and why feminism is rotten at it's core. And just check r feminismstopswhen subreddit for how they pretty much are hypocrite about everything.**	1643005783.0	htzmiav	t3_s9ks4s	t1_htx50gx	/r/antifeminists/comments/s9ks4s/what_feminism_really_is/htzmiav/

They are *fantasies.*  A teenage boy can fantasize on their own older teacher, and even believe they loved it when they are coerced into sex. This still can cause trauma in a developing adult, or condition them in orher future relationship where they are abused.	1643006414.0	htzngza	t3_sb74vy	t1_htys3pq	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/htzngza/

This action alone recruited more men to the MGTOW cause and lifestyle than anything else. * they practically achieved the complete opposite of what they wanted to achieve * their subreddit is actually done with it's task (as their name implies) but they are now targeting other subreddits which don't fit into their worldview ... practically playing 1984's "thought police"	1643012051.0	htzv9vi	t3_sbb6wm	t3_sbb6wm	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbb6wm/trouble_brewing_on_rmgtowban/htzv9vi/

d8fsxtys	Your privileges:  -not being required to register for the draft  -cheaper Obama care  -lower pension rate  -Higher life expectancy  -everyone in society having a gynocentric bias  -Not having it legal for men to rape you whilst it’s still legal for women to rape men.  -teachers having a grading / education bias for you  -vast majority of genocides against men & boys  And far, far more. Oversexualized? Or perhaps you just hate male sexuality. Why can’t men admire women? Men can think and feel whatever the hell they want bigot. People believe boys are losers and innately stupider than girls because they are male. Kindly stop speaking through your anus feminist. Stop making excuses for that fact that women are lazy and leech off of men. Women are and always have been more than free to take on workplace roles that men have, you are just embarrassed to admit you leech off of men so you blame them. You are a misandrist. Misogyny doesn’t exist. There is no anti-female laws or any of it, there is systemic misandry though and countless evidence of. You don’t have an argument, you just cited an article of girls being raped. Guess what? Everyone of any demographic gets raped sometimes. Women aren’t special and don’t deserve special attention when they are victims. And how bold of you to make such an argument when the laws in everywhere but 6 countries don’t include female-onto-male forced penetration meaning it’s impossible to charge women or count them in statistics unless they used an object. In Africa 40% of boys report being raped, mostly by female perpetrators. Incestious pedophilia crimes are very common and thousands of cases or more get called in weekly to child protective services weekly. “Woman can barely exist without her husband.” By which you mean woman can’t leech off of anyone without her husband? She can go get into employment. The idea women can’t in many countries is a myth as I’ve explained. “Women were just barely even able to drive in 2017” and men in first world countries still can’t vote unless they’ve registered for male war slavery (selective service.) women are privileged anywhere. In genocides terrorist groups segregate the sexes let the females run off and burn the males alive. There was one country where they slaughtered 70% of the male population I remember.   Incel tear is a hate sub filled with nut cases who recently had been revealed to have been breaking DOS / DDOS laws. It’s going to be gone pretty soon LOL.  Get lost you misandristic feminist scum.

4i96paa8	>We can call it “strong dislike” if you prefer that.  Yes, because "disliking" and "hating" are two very different things.  We dislike the kind of women I mentionned as an example, but we wish them no harm. We will mock them for sure because its entertaining to do so, but that is it.   >Are you seriously claiming that the few thousand women who have been selling a few nudes and bath water in the past 10 or so years, are the reason the female gender have been underrepresented in the fields that “create” for the entirety of human history?  I stated these as an example, they are not the reason for the under representation of females in certain fields, but they and social medias in general are responsible for the crazyness that has been going on for a decade now.   As for the under representation you speak of, lets talk about that, and equality and tell me why you rarely (almost never) see a woman working in "sewer" jobs, electrician, mechanic, road building/building work or even as bin collecting employees? I thought you gals wanted to be equal to men? Why no woman do these jobs?

71rkq7bz	I’ve seen it too. All I have to say about that is… My ass. The only thing feminism has ever done in terms of making male victims unheard of is **encouraging** it.   In 2010, feminists in Israel **opposed** changes to rape laws that would make it so that women could be convicted of rape. In 2013, feminists in India pressured the government into rewriting rape laws so that only men could be convicted of rape.  More importantly, why isn’t there any feminist outcry against male rape victims and female rapists? Oh right… because it’s only an issue if the victim is a woman and the perpetrator is a man.  And yet, people still think feminism will fix it. Considering the whole mindset feminists have about looking at only one side of gender-neutral issues, it **won’t** unless oppressing male rape victims and defending female rapists even more is what you’re talking about.	1643019874.0	hu04snp	t3_sb74vy	t1_hty36xl	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/hu04snp/

35c0i	You can't stop quoting biased rape statistics in your quest to make men out to be rapists? You can't stop blocking gender neutral rape laws? Really?   For statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)  She is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the "victims" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely "unwanted contact"**   You see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g.   Detecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206  > > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**  Src: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf  She is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.  Most people talking about sexual violence refer to the "rape" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for "made to penetrate" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.  As an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm  > **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**  and  > The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.  vs  > **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**  and   > Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators **For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),  So if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of "made to penetrators" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**  But since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs "only" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group "nearly all the men were raped by other men" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...  And before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.   2010 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf  2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf  2015 survey results -  https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf  Scientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known  *data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were “made to penetrate” someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*  And non CDC study...  *A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*  The Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/  Another non CDC study...  *a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*  And another non CDC study...  *National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had ‘ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,’ 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.”*  Time - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers  *when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being “made to penetrate”—either by physical force or due to intoxication—at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*   If my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.  https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/  Just maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at "rapists", rather than "men".  And it isn't just the US.    Feminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms  So a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.  Israeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.  https://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape  Nepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...  > Women’s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn’t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims’ fight for justice.  https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities  **Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.  http://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528  So women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men	1643025859.0	hu0cqhp	t3_sb74vy	t1_hu0cg6o	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/hu0cqhp/

iyzp8vjo	You stopped helping and protecting women because they like philosophy and to think logically?  1. Everything you do is decided by your brain.   2. When you are born, your brain is programmed to react in certain ways to certain situations.   3. You have no control over how your brain is initially programmed, as it is a result of your genes.   4. There are 2 ways through which a brain can change itself: By doing it on its own, in which case it was programmed to make that change from the start, or because of an input from the outside world.   5. You can't control the outside world. The only way you can change anything in the outside world is if your brain makes the choice to do so, because it was programmed to do so.   6. There's no way for you to change your fate, from the day you are born to you die, every decision you make is based on the initial programming of your brain and the world you were born into, nether of which you have control over.  Can you point out where the logic fails?	1643027749.0	hu0fnvx	t3_sar60q	t1_hu055ez	/r/antifeminists/comments/sar60q/feels_good_to_insult_these_bitches/hu0fnvx/

Only ~7ish % of people support feminism, by making them look rediculous in the eyes of the "normies" and showing that a better alternative to feminism exists feminism will go further and further past the  breaking point, following the same path as the KKK in the US. The KKK is an accelerated scenario and follows the same tragectory as the rest of left-wing movements (not exclusive but invariable). Same path just at different speeds. Feminism is roughly the same point as kkk was around the civil rights movement in the US.	1643029300.0	hu0ib0p	t3_sbjq2r	t1_hu0fwml	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbjq2r/the_recent_misogyny_on_this_subredditaccording_to/hu0ib0p/

7bjndvbl	I get what you're saying and I can agree with a lot of it.  There is a difference between anti-women and anti-feminist. Anti-feminist doesn't mean wanting to get rid of women's rights, and definitely doesn't mean hating women. A lot of anti-feminists have been personally negatively affected by feminism and they should be allowed to vent and rant about their experiences. Anti-feminist women aren't the priority for this kind of thing, it's both men and women. Sure, we can be affected by it, but we're not the only ones. A lot more men are negatively affected by it.

5x9r4ntn	The movement for equality is egalitarianism, with men's rights and women's rights being branches of it addressing men's and women's sides of issues.   For the most part majority of the issues that have priority for egalitarians are men's rights issues as they are much more agregious than current women's rights issues. This can be summed up to feminism has and is pushing for depriving men of basic human rights such as due process rights in court, presumption of innocence, legal definitions that exclude the possibility of female perpetrators, being forced to pay child support for someone else's children.

11lf14	Teachers mark down boys grades and the entire public education system revolves around helping girls learn.   Beyond that grades don't seem to matter much in terms of practical application. Once women have to actually accomplish something they tend to quickly fall behind the men of the field in terms of skill.   Even if we ignore that, my argument against the whole "girls can do anything better than boys" is: then why don't they? If girls are so much better at everything then why haven't they accomplished anything on their own? Why haven't they made a better version of penicillin? Why haven't they developed stable nuclear fission energy? Why haven't they terraformed Mars? Why have men been the ones carrying the development of human society on their shoulders this entire time?	1643044550.0	hu1hysh	t3_sbmmkn	t3_sbmmkn	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu1hysh/

Yet you need to be full on hard core addicted to porn for that... If it was the case porn in general. just about all men and women would be affected by watching porn. Plus not I say again not everything regarding men revolves around sex.

Idk about anyone else, but back in my high school years, both boy and girl students would fuck around not actually do their work, but more often than not it was boys that did that. It’s also possible that the reason why boys have lower grades than girls on average is maybe related to mental health since it’s mostly other men who hold men to a ridiculous standard of not expressing themselves.	1643049194.0	hu1um1x	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu11xxv	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu1um1x/
99cker03	By law women cannot be considered pedophiles and rapists. Thats why. See in the eyes of the law a woman fills a child out of pure love and compassion in want of a relationship. They pity her for her bad deeds. Rape of man from a woman is not even deemed possible because men are stronger that women by average. Plus their is this stereotype where a man can't get hard unless he wants to. Basically meaning rape of a man for a woman is impossible because be git hard meaning he liked it. When actually guys get hard as a reaction to something attractive. Even if you don't want to it would/could happen. Notice how sometimes a guy gets hard without even noticing it prime example. Which actually gives a extreme severity to male rape. Your body is enjoying something while your mind is screaming no. Tbh as a victim of rape as a man... That ficks you up in the head... bad...	1643049318.0	hu1uxub	t3_sb74vy	t1_hty4kv3	/r/antifeminists/comments/sb74vy/everyone_was_defending_this_monster_in_the/hu1uxub/

3s4lioa6	Eh men having more mental health issues isn’t quite right. I’m a woman on the autism spectrum and the reason why men get diagnosed more often than women with the disorders that you listed is because early research was only done on guys. Now it’s becoming more common for girls to get diagnosed. Back like 10 years ago it was thought that girls couldn’t have autism so I would have probably been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder or something. I’ve also heard that statistically women attempt suicide more often, but men use more lethal ways so that’s why their commuted suicide rate is higher. Suicide is definitely a big problem for guys, but I hate that people say that women only attempt suicide for attention because men probably have more access to guns and at the same time, even the least deadly method can leave you in critical condition. I think women tend to use pills, and even though they may not kill you, they really can leave you brain damaged. And if someone does do that stuff for attention, that’s a mental health concern it self. Suicide for both genders is a big problem, but the issue that I have with it is that people just talk about while not actually doing anything about it. But I definitely think your right on the gender expectation things. That can really affect how you perform in life.	1643051194.0	hu1zzqb	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu1w52k	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu1zzqb/

9j0zm0dh	the erection of men works the same way as "getting wet" for women ... via the vegetative nervous system (which nobody can control by will): * if a woman does not get wet then this can be multiple of a thousand reasons: she's not in the mood, she does not like the guy, he's ugly or in some other way unpleasant or she has a medical condition ... and so on and so ... this is something every woman understands * if a guy does not get an erection (it's the same mechanism via the vegetative nervous system) it's pretty much for the same reasons as women not getting wet: he is not in the mood, he does not like her, she's ugly or in some other way unpleasant or he has a medical condition  so you're telling me that the 40+ year old, overweight and nagging women in FDS complain about not being able to be pleasant enough to excite a man? what a surprise!	1643051396.0	hu20j1q	t3_sblvo9	t3_sblvo9	/r/antifeminists/comments/sblvo9/fds_at_it_again/hu20j1q/

Also, looking through a social lenses, [people are more likely to mean when anonymous.](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/who-is-that-the-study-of-anonymity-and-behavior) They're more likely to exaggerate or say what they don't mean. [Most people don't read articles before commenting](https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-read-the-facebook-newsfeed-think-they-know-more-than-they-actually-do). What makes you think they're gonna full support what's said when it's an anonymous rant?   Also, have you interviewed people for their opinions of what they look for when they upvote or like something on the internet?   Look, you're taking one example from millions on a social media website that hasn't been thoroughly looked through or examined. You have a conclusion and you are finding things to support your conclusion that cannot be considered evidence, rather than looking at evidence and then drawing a conclusion.	1643051785.0	hu21kca	t3_sbsyuu	t1_hu20b3r	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbsyuu/its_interesting_thought_experiment_up_until_they/hu21kca/

35c0i	The rates of partner homicides didn't used to be that far apart. Then women got help and resources and the rate they killed their husbands dropped a lot. Men didn't get DV shelters they could use to protect their kids from their abuser without getting kidnapping charges giving the abuser an upper hand in custody, government funded help to allow them to get easy restraining orders, DV intervention public policy and programs that favored them, etc. Therefore the rate that husbands kill their wives hasn't dropped much. Maybe if we want to eliminate the desperate husbands in mutually abusive relationships killing their wives, we should give them better options. That would probably save a lot of women's lives just like doing it for women has saved a lot of mens lives.  "Gender Differences in Patterns and Trends in U.S. Homicide, 1976–2015" by James Alan Fox and Emma E. Fridel. The data comes from FBI statistics ("FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports, SHR").  https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vio.2017.0016?journalCode=vio&  Here's part of the conclusion that the authors came to:  > Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.  Here is a graph of intimate partner homicides by sex over the years from the study. Notice the trend for women as they got help vs men that didn't?  https://m.imgur.com/a/6Hx9dJt  God forbid we help men, even if it would save womens lives.   "The reason women need these resources and men don't is because more men kill their partners. We need more one sided services."

3s4lioa6	It was because back like 70 years ago the only test subjects being used for disorders like ADHD or autism were boys only, therefore the criteria for the disorders was based on boys only. As far as the symptoms go, men having more apparent symptoms isn’t because of mental health, it’s because of the fact that like I said the criteria for mental disorders was only based on boys and then there’s the fact that autism symptoms show up differently in girls. There’s studies that show that men and women with autism can camouflage their symptoms, but for some reason girls are better at it. But even though women can camouflage symptoms better, they often have more trouble with social interaction and behavior problems. So it’s not that mens lack of expression for mental health disorders makes their symptoms a more apparent. It’s more that it’s a gender difference in how autism presents. Some of the autism difference between the genders is attributed to the fact that women are more expected to be social. Like for example boys are expected to play with trucks and for girls it’s dolls. In a way, women are also the ones that are more expected to be quiet and submissive too. I’ve heard that that’s also often the reason why they may not ask for promotions at work too.	1643052957.0	hu24nux	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu21ar4	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu24nux/

imdju7u6	But males with autism get ostracized by their peers and stereotyped as "loners". I do think it has to do partly with the empathy gap. Men with disorders get far less sympathy from their peers and they even get bullied for it. I think that's part of the reason why autism goes undiagnosed in women vs. men. Because it has less social consequences in women.	1643053369.0	hu25qpk	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu24nux	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu25qpk/

Women get bullied for it too. I got physical abused for my autism from my dad, and sadly that’s not the only case of that happening. The thing about mental health issues in the autism community as well is that contrary to the general population, women with autism are more likely to have mental health issues and commit suicide more often. So the less social consequences thing isn’t right either.	1643054390.0	hu28f4b	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu25qpk	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu28f4b/

vw89l	Women are higher in agreeableness. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149680/)  This basically means they are more inclined to go along to get along. Let's not go making this a black and white issue either. Women TILT more towards agreeableness than men that doesn't mean every woman is more agreeable than every man.   Jordan Peterson describes it like this.   If you put 50 men and 50 women in a room and I asked you to pick the most agreeable person, if you picked a woman you'd be right 60% of the time.   Women also score higher in neuroticism (negative emotion - fear, anxiety) to about the same rate as above.   Seems to me these things go hand-in-hand. If you're more nervous, it's easier to go along to get along. You could also say that the more agreeable you are the more likely you are to go along to get along which would cause lower negative emotion due to the safety of the group and not standing out.	1643054489.0	hu28og1	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu1xcsy	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu28og1/

1x6rbyhc	What I got from it was an old research trick. Essentially, if you follow the data, you'll find paywalls or just dead ends. Rang up a few research centers and found the data shared to be largely exaggerated. Regardless, the idea shared if a good disproof of what they say. Essentially, if they started their own companies, they would occupy the grand positions...and probably shut up with the gynocentric pouting.	1643058234.0	hu2ii1e	t3_sbmmkn	t1_hu1tg7e	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbmmkn/girls_get_better_grades_even_in_stem_subjects/hu2ii1e/

Common causes include:  Heart disease  Clogged blood vessels (atherosclerosis)  High cholesterol  High blood pressure  Diabetes  Obesity  Metabolic syndrome — a condition involving increased blood pressure, high insulin levels, body fat around the waist and high cholesterol  Parkinson's disease  Multiple sclerosis  Certain prescription medications  Tobacco use  Peyronie's disease — development of scar tissue inside the penis  Alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse  Sleep disorders  Treatments for prostate cancer or enlarged prostate  Surgeries or injuries that affect the pelvic area or spinal cord  Low testosterone  Stress  Depression  Anxiety  Basically it's not uncommon and it's fucked up to be shaming those who have it.

9ojyvtfr	Or maybe it’s because you are just misogynists.  If the only good women to you are “anti feminist” and you have a designated class of women you think it’s ok to call “bitches and whores” as you have in other comments, you’re a misogynist.  It would be the same as saying “I like black people but not those n*****s”  If you truly have respect for a group of people, you don’t reserve respect for those you deem to be the “good ones”.	1643060405.0	hu2oa9b	t3_sbjq2r	t3_sbjq2r	/r/antifeminists/comments/sbjq2r/the_recent_misogyny_on_this_subredditaccording_to/hu2oa9b/
