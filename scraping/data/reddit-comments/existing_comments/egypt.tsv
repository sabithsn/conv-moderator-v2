cez81dpl	People's culture is just to throw in the street,  as If the street is a large garbage can. When we were kids, the bus supervisor used to tell us if we have garbage throw it in the street from the window as to not get the bus dirty, this could have been easily solved by a plastic bag in the bus!I have seen a very nice lady this year getting out of her car emptying her pockets in the street after parking underneath her house, which she could have just thrown away the trash in the garbage can infront of the house, or in her apartment, but no she had to be a lazy loser and throw it in the street.	1641549769.0	hrmadox	t3_rxjn91	t3_rxjn91	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hrmadox/

1qixfqu5	What? How does telling somebody merry christmas as a respectful gesture equate to me celebrating the holiday? I agree that their religion is completely wrong in my perspective but at the same time that does not mean we should not wish people who celebrate the holiday a merry Christmas, it's even hypocritical that you insist that my gesture is only on my behalf, that's very same as insisting that the gesture is on behalf of all Muslims, if I cannot say "on behalf of Muslims" neither should you insist that it is only on my behalf and not other Muslims, neither of us control our brothers and sisters, you telling me common knowledge about Christianity is insulting in of itself	1641550659.0	hrmbjg4	t3_rxwxh3	t1_hrmanc7	/r/Egypt/comments/rxwxh3/merry_christmas_to_my_christian_brothers_and/hrmbjg4/

9wl0p676	Fun fact: Egypt has never been a rich country. However, in the 60s, cairo was labelled the cleanest and most beautiful city in the world.  It's not about the economy or the country it's about the people. The older generation is hygienic and clean, thus the country was clean during their time. The newer generations (late 80s and 90s kids) are mostly dirty and throw their garbage anywhere thus the country became dirty during their time	1641552797.0	hrmec22	t3_rxjn91	t3_rxjn91	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hrmec22/

2ata1k25	It is not a problem of any religion per se. It specifically is a problem with religions that denounce the material world in the favor of a heaven.   The Ancient Egyptians religion was their land. Their heaven was to take care of the reeds and the golden wheat fields they sowed in life. Their religion incentivised treating the land and the people as blessings given to you by the Gods to keep them safe and happy. Thats why they built wonders and created wonders. Because they loved themselves and their lands. Even if life was much much much more difficult physically, economically and politicaly.   The modern religion though that incentivises ditching the material world for the sake of the immaterial, and not just ditching but actively constraining everything on everybody and creating bad conditions to leverage their political support with the need of Egyptians to go to "jannah". Well, you can see the results of a thousand years of that religion right now. You can look into all the other different countries that use it and you can find it more or less the same.  I am not hear to debate religions though. I've said my mind and if you have a problem with what I said then I am sorry about that but I am not willinh to discuss further.	1641555395.0	hrmhwh2	t3_rxjn91	t1_hrlushh	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hrmhwh2/

2ata1k25	You are absolving people of any personal responsibility and enabling bad behaviour. I was born in Egypt . I was raised in Egypt. I was educated by the Egyptian system and I am a product of the Egyptian culture.  Yet, I believe in personal responsibility and I have a duty to my community to make it better. I try to make it in time. I don't  throw shit on the streets. I don't do many of the bad behaviours of the Egyptians. Why cant people have the same basic principles as any cultured individual ?      If you keep treating people as children and keep giving them excuses for everything then don't complain when they abuse you and your community. People need to stop and think of consequences to their actions. But why would they ? They want to go to Jannah not live in Jannah.

b1d56vud	back in the early 2000s Alexandria waste disposal was given to private sector a French company won the contract ( I can't really remember the name but the same company was providing the same services in Dubai) they were doing amazing job, hiring people with attractive salaries I remember seeing the garbage truck more than 3 times/day in every street and trash cans every where. and as usual the governor said they must be doing some money out of the trash (the company used some public factoies to recycle) that's why they hire trashmen with salaries that went to 2000- 4000LE back in 2007 and claimed that the company should pay the government money for making money out of trash that they paid the company to collect	1641569553.0	hrnav8v	t3_rxjn91	t3_rxjn91	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hrnav8v/

4denv	Sounds nice. How much did you engage with them to become friends with them?  I mean - today I was just sitting on a bench on the boardwalk, and a guy comes sitting next to me. After some general introductions he asks if I want to come to his shop for some tea...  Now I've had negative experiences before where going to someone's shop for tea ended up with them nagging me to buy something from their shop, in a way of "here is a free gift!... Now give me money!" - and their "hospitality" is just a trick to try to get me to buy something - so I say no. I'm just chilling here in the sun, I don't want tea, or go anywhere.  He's chatting with me for about half an hour, gives me his number "in case I need anything" like a taxi, or food for "non-tourist prices that he'll get for me"  After that he asks if I like beer and whether I want to go buy some beers and go to his apartment (I'm also a guy btw)... Of course I'm like yea no thanks (seemed kinda weird)  But anyway, I don't know how I'll make friends with anyone if my default assumption is that they'll probably scam me - but, so far 100% of the time those kinda interactions end up as some kinda scam.  How do you interact with them and become friends and not just get scammed?	1641571059.0	hrneyqx	t3_rwgwto	t1_hri21t1	/r/Egypt/comments/rwgwto/what_is_the_stereotype_about_egypt_that_you_hate/hrneyqx/

If you add salt first it will take much longer to boil. Add the pasta and stir frequently to prevent it from sticking. Spaghetti takes around 7 - 8 mins.       \-Strain the pasta under cold water to stop it from cooking.      \-Drizzle with olive oil and a dash of pepper.

Yeah I’m sure Egypt has suffered economic losses, but 55 yrs later very unlikely the 67 war has much impact (economically). In fact i think that may be hard to argue as economic trade between Israel and Egypt is at the highest levels ever today.	1641576300.0	hrntja4	t3_rxjn91	t1_hrnsn0z	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hrntja4/

ogd50	Been in a relationship for almost 3 years. Her family was much wealthier than mine. When it came to marriage arrangements she insisted -thanks to her family of course- to live in some fancy apartment that I can afford but will cost me all my money and some of my family's too that was unacceptable for me I felt like I'm being used. so it didn't work out for us.  After years of break up I concluded that she didn't hate me she hated my life. She loved the THINGS I DO not the WAY I'M and money was behind it all.  I hope you don't fall in this hole. calculatinos are critical for any project's success. but when it comes to relationships calculations are not applicable because we're human not an excel sheet.	1641577821.0	hrnxtq1	t3_ryaxfx	t1_hrnl5vt	/r/Egypt/comments/ryaxfx/how_much_should_you_afford_to_marry_a_girl_who/hrnxtq1/

e6n8dk36	wtf dude, your point of view is all screwed up, I will start with this thing of religion. I no longer consider myself Muslim but you can't blame this on religion! This thing with  people "ditching the material work for the sake of the immaterial" is screwed up. What do u think of European people who are christian do they throw their shit in the streets on behalf of your sick argument! Egyptian houses are clean, you can't deny it , are they agnostic in their houses and Muslims in the street. Egyptians trying to get rid of their shit properly, their religion: ohhhh boo wait you have to sacrifice the material world for the immaterial world, Egyptian ahh I would go to pray then instead of wasting my time trying to get rid of it properly! Fu_ that dude. Where are those billions that were dumped into solutions for this problem! The government doesn't even believe in approaching any problem in a scientific manner, you can tell this from the way it acted towards the pandemic, I was taking my thanwyaa Amma exams during corona, there was zero regulation to take us safe, who is now to blame on this the religion, the resources! Using those tablets we were given since our first way of hs would be damn convenient, but instead we didn't use them, as what would happen in case of an electricity outage, seriously! If you invested money in people instead of treating them like that, the situation would be different	1641579736.0	hro3869	t3_rxjn91	t1_hrkv00o	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hro3869/

13vbod	No mate, your words exposed you, and you are making it worse now, lel.   It's like you are saying Egypt is a Christian country. What's the difference between you and someone who claims that Egypt is an Islamic country? You are both clowns.  Then you explain your BS with a comment that totally contradicts your actions. Look at this  >I love this image because it represents the fact that Christianity is an undeniable part of the fabric of this nation.  Who is denying that? and how does this image represent that? You are literally modifying the Egyptian flag to put a symbol of your religion there. What a bad joke. It's also safe to assume that your image is denying the rest of the fabric of this nation.  >what is more important is for all of us to fight ignorance and hatred when ever it rears its ugly head.  Your post is the definition of ignorance and hatred. **No wonder you don't  want this conversation to go back and forth**. It's amazing how many clowns are supporting you.  These kind of posts gives reasons to extremists to raise their voices. The only thing you are making by posting a picture like this here is an attempt to trigger people. Congratulations, it worked. **Next,** we will find a random Muslim guy posting a similar post after modifying the Egyptian flag and putting an Islamic symbol there. :kappa:  How do moderators allow this?	1641585038.0	hrohrst	t3_rxwxh3	t1_hro8xvn	/r/Egypt/comments/rxwxh3/merry_christmas_to_my_christian_brothers_and/hrohrst/

I think you are misusing the word Cuck. I think you mean to say that Egyptians lately have a colonized mentality. Well, that can change but it has to start with Universities. We have to develop the language in such a way that the higher sciences, like Medicine, Physics, and Engineering, can be taught in Arabic, with Arabic texts, and Arabic instruction.

8xx3648	I will tell you why :  1.We were invaded many times in history and were always a colony for someone till 1952 and at that time it was a militarist dictatorship that treated the people shit and doesn't give them a meaning, till today, so egyptians as a society never had a real feeling of being independent and powerful, we are raised on the mentality of the herd and who tries opposing it gets excluded and either flees or gets arrested or discriminated, and that's everywhere in the streets and media and social media  2.Our government profits a lot from foreign investments and they play a big role, that's why they let foreign investors have their own names and symbols or so as a form of thanking them and saying without you we would be nothing, because our economy truly depends on the gulf, and you might say they could have made egypt socially and economically independent, well no shit when you have corrupt leaders everywhere with the not so educated people that live under inferiority influence all those centuries, you never get dignity for the country  But overall I think we have much bigger problems to solve and if we solved them we wouldn't have had this problem, education, life quality of the average egyptian, freedom of expression. Dictatorships either make their country too independent and ignorant or too dependent with feeling of inferiority, and we don't want any of those we just want independence and dignity as you metioned  But I like how you say in the title we cucks then go on and say you cucks excluding yourself ;)	1641588883.0	hros39i	t3_ryc6x3	t3_ryc6x3	/r/Egypt/comments/ryc6x3/random_thoughts_about_how_much_weve_become_cucks/hros39i/

grt141e8	Invaded many times? You think Germany and England weren't invaded too? When they build something in England do they name after Romans or build it in Roman architecture? Imagine if we called it the French Canal because the french helped build it?? How embarrassing would that be! We still call it the AMERICAN uni of cairo even 100 years later!! WHY? Because the  CEO alone is american and has to be american by law?! Imagine in 500 years, 90% of our best unis are named after other countries!! Imagine El Azhar was called the Frankish University 900 years ago or smthn. Its embarrassing man. And your 2nd point is very true, thats exactly what I said with the whole 'roz' reference, but even still, when we build things on our own look at the inferiority complex. In the new capital and new alamein for example, the luxurious higher class neighbourhoods are all done in European style and named european things (completely our choice and no foreign investors involved), meanwhile the middle and lower class areas are done in Islamic/Middle Eastern style. If you yourself believe you are inferior to Europeans, then why do you think Europeans will respect you when you cant even respect yourself??

But these places you mention in the US are usually smaller towns. They would never name their best colleges or newest cities with another country's name, no matter how much that other country donates to them. It's a big sign of an inferior nation, people, culture.

Or are you importing all the work (e.g. trains and a lot more)  2. How are you funding all this development? Unfortunately by massive amounts of external debt. How certain are you that we'll be able to maintain a serviceable amount of debt? This debt is in dollars. Which means, that we can't print our way out of it. Which means that we must pay them back in dollars. How to get these dollars? By increasing our exports. But our exports are trash. Entire private sector is trash. What should we do? Increase your exports and be globally competitive. Are we doing that? Fuck no. We're so involved with internal politics.	1641598289.0	hrpgh48	t3_rw8j3b	t1_hre3wf7	/r/Egypt/comments/rw8j3b/is_going_back_to_egypt_a_thing/hrpgh48/

But I think companies are slowly dropping this requirement, because hiring good SWE is brutaly hard. Overall, I'd recommend getting the degree if you can and try to land a job while studying.  If you're feeling bold, you can try and take a CS degree equivalent online via OSSU CS or sth similar.

eooodjdr	if you're talking about luxor/aswan trip, I was there mid November, and the food was good most of the time - great at times. Defiantly go for the food option because there are few places that would make food that taste as good as the cruise's + it will be easier for you and your friends to follow along the trip's program without worrying if they will start moving without you.      Plus, you could still try the cuisine at night when you go out. The first night at Luxor we went to Light and Sound, which was not a part of the trip's program; so most of the nights you will find yourself free to do or go wherever you want. Just return early the night your cruise departs from Luxor.	1641599548.0	hrpjk8y	t3_rygbuw	t3_rygbuw	/r/Egypt/comments/rygbuw/has_anyone_taken_the_nile_cruises/hrpjk8y/

If you study Computer Engineering you study everything a Computer Scientist studies, and extra hardware stuff on top.  The idea that CS is more software focused while CE is more hardware focused is a myth because it puts CS and CE as "same but different", when the relationship is actually not symmetric at all. In reality, CS is "software focused" because really you only ever study software. CE isn't hardware focused at all. There's still just as much software as in CS.

11jxkw	Well, it depends on your position obviously. I'm speaking of junior-mid level positions. To net 75k (after tax) will definitely put you in the high end of this bracket. Especially if you're hired outside of the US and under the payroll of a company based in the EU. The taxes will eat a considerable chunk of your base income which itself is atleast 20% less than in the US.  Remote software engineering is just the most popular. Especially on Reddit et al.

11jxkw	Netting 3.5k a month in most of the EU is above average. An average gross salary is about 60k EUR. Net would be 40-45k depending on where you live. 45K/12 months is 3.75k  3.75k EUR is a little less than 70,000 EGP a month.  Being a contractor is a whole other story. Most contractors are either paid hourly or by project. So for the purpose of our argument, I'll only discuss hourly work. Hourly work is deceiving, because you don't get paid on vacations and sick days. Even the hours you're booked for are pretty unstable.  Also contractual work/freelance has it's cons. No health insurance, no stable income which means no unsecured credit line and overall it's a headache, unless.. you're a well paid contractor.	1641601864.0	hrpp5j9	t3_ryfji2	t1_hrpn8jm	/r/Egypt/comments/ryfji2/whats_your_monthly_income_aftertax/hrpp5j9/

11b8qr	In every sense. Engineering professors more often than not had more integrity and also cared more for the "faculty's reputation", which had the convenient consequence of making even shitty teachers manage a course well enough for it to be useful and educational, even if it required more effort from the students' end.  Bema3na, even when a professor is a horrible teacher, they still put in place challenging assignments, projects and exams which puts pressure on the students to, through one way or another, learn the subject at hand both theoretically and practically. So students would leave "shitty" courses still having learned at least the baseline of what that course was about.  On the contrary, CS professors very rarely have integrity and the faculty has no reputation to fend for. This has the inconvenient consequence of making shitty professors practically kill every course they teach because they simply don't care. Assignments and projects are nonexistent, and if they do make some then they'll be either a- brain-numbingly easy, or, b- very weird and the opposite of educational/useful, just "difficult" (usually involves using very odd and discontinued technologies for example, and I use the word discontinued literally not figuratively). Even their exams are usually just recitations of the slides they stole, because they aren't good enough to come up with anything on their own most of the time. There's literally no pressure whatsoever on students to actually learn the subject at hand, they just start aggressively memorizing slides a couple of days before any exam and that's well more than enough to get satisfactory grades even.  So in practice, a student can "attend" a computer architecture class in CS, but if the professor is shitty then the course will go by and they will absolutely pass it without retaining a single piece of information about architecture.  So at the end of the day, in my experience, CE's "baseline" of competence is substantially higher than CS' baseline just because of that factor alone. If someone graduates CE, there are things you can more or less guarantee they know. If someone graduates CS, that person could literally be unable to write code to begin with.  I have CS graduate friends who can't write code. Again, literal and not figurative.  This is simply not something I have ever seen from CE CU. At all.	1641603340.0	hrpsm9g	t3_ryfji2	t1_hrpplvs	/r/Egypt/comments/ryfji2/whats_your_monthly_income_aftertax/hrpsm9g/

w4sts	**I gotchu**  get a reasonably sized pot and fill it with water  add a few tablespoons of salt and turn the heat on  add your pasta of choice  let em cook for a few minutes, stir occasionally so they don't stick, easiest way to test for doneness is to just taste it, remember, you want it to be slightly less cooked than perfect, not raw, but has a little chew to it.  Drain the pasta in a strainer, but keep about a cup of the starchy pasta water aside, rinse the pasta with cold water to stop them from cooking further (optionally you can drizzle a little oil to keep em from sticking)  in the same pot you cooked the pasta in, add enough oil of your choice to coat the pan and go a little higher, chop an onion before you heat the oil (you don't want your oil to be too hot), and add your onions.  optionally you can add chopped green peppers and a chopped chili for an extra spicy kick with the onions as they're getting cooked.  when your veggies have softened and the onions have gotten darker (golden, not brown) add that cup of starchy water you put aside earlier.  now for the most controversial part of my recipe, add 3 tablespoons of tomato puree (معجون الطماطم) and stir, DON'T skimp on the puree that's 70% of the sauce!  You can now salt and spice your sauce, I go for around 2 teaspoons of salt and one tsp each of pepper and cumin, and maybe some garlic powder if I'm feeling like it.  you let the sauce cook for a while until it thickens, taste for seasoning and that's about it!  you now add your pasta and mix everything up and bon appetit!	1641609010.0	hrq5p6s	t3_ry8imo	t3_ry8imo	/r/Egypt/comments/ry8imo/whats_the_best_type_of_sauce_or_stew_you_use_when/hrq5p6s/

2ata1k25	In your eskewed ideology and mind everyone is against rich people because you deserve their money more than they do. So when you meet someone who is willing to use their objective thinking to not follow the same shitty ideology as you, that person is either wrong or a rich guy.   The answer to your queation is I am upper middle class. My father created his business from scratch and now we enjoy the life of moderate wealth. We are not a 1% by any means but we are not poor either. I guess that makes me and enemy of the proles right ?  And I do know lots about socialism. No need for "re-education" thank you. I ve read economoc books, economoc theories peddled around by socialist wannabes and partisans, I ve seen socialism live in every failed socialist state in the last 30 years and I ve read about failed socialist states starting from the Lenin red revolution.   Btw, European countries are capitalist not socialist. They employ socialist concepts as public healthcare, education and transport. But their economy is based around capital ownership by individuals. And certain countries you perceive as "socialist havens" as the nordic three are literally oil countries. They have billiona in assets of oil and they use these billiona to fund programs for a handful of citizens. The three countries I think have a pop of 60 million or so. Like half Egypt's pop. Flip that around and I guarantee you these countries would go venezuela route very quickly.   Anyway good luck arguing with people online with your theories. Maybe if you put the same time into economic education and businesses you would have been the millionaire you whole heartedly want to rob.   You can also check various ideology subreddits and go spend your time there and stop using cheap gimmicks to win the upvotes of poor hungry no brainers.

16raja	TIL they removed SATs from Egypt. Honestly I (and a few tens of millions others) saw it coming a mile away. It probably has to do with the brain dead rich retards who buy the leaked exam every exam period. If it's not because of that then they're still brain dead rich retards (I only mentioned those who buy the exams, as for the others I honestly feel sorry that you have to go through this shit over and over and over again with no change in sight).  Basically the situation with SATs in Egypt from what I keep hearing every few months is that people leak the exams and then for a few dollars they give the exam to their students and these students having then do the exam exactly as taught causing an unrealistic grade imbalance which in turn causes the board to get annoyed and punish the country for the offense. I guess this is a straw that broke the camel's back situation in which they got annoyed and decided to just ruin the lives of every Egyptian who is studying in the American system as punishment for what those rich idiots did.  This is coming though from someone who studied the British curriculum abroad so I don't know much information about the situation as I only read the rants of people.	1641616533.0	hrqlqzt	t3_ryocws	t1_hrq9vke	/r/Egypt/comments/ryocws/is_there_still_the_sat_in_egypt_if_not_how_should/hrqlqzt/

11b8qr	We can't all agree that Egypt has some of the best Software Engineers. Define "some"? I would argue that we have a really horrible ratio of talented engineers / subpar engineers compared to the West.  And to answer your question, it's very simple - AAA game development is expensive as fuck and will necessitate serious money. IIRC a AAA game is estimated to cost on average around 60-80 million USD to make. These numbers go much higher for specific genres, like MMORPGs.  So yes, the budget is predominantly the reason. And if you think the majority of Egyptian gamers will pay $60+ for a locally made game then you are just a very optimistic person. Facebook pages begging people not to crack the game doesn't mean people won't do it.	1641628692.0	hrr5gyr	t3_ryrv74	t3_ryrv74	/r/Egypt/comments/ryrv74/this_question_is_for_software_engineers_and/hrr5gyr/

16ylam	Not an artist or a software engineer, but I’ve got a pretty valid reason as to why this is so. You say you refuse to believe that it’s budgetary reasons but not believing it doesn’t make it disappear. Even when making an indie game, it’s still pretty expensive let alone having to find and pay for a team, location, assets, licensing, equipment, and the list goes on. Believe it or not tho, budget is the boring answer so I’ll try to indulge you with a better one.   Look at a country like India for example, and look at the amount of tech GENIUSES that country produces. There is a REALLY good amount of Indian gaming studios, a lot of which are just branches of western studios, but otherwise there is a pretty hefty amount of them, so why aren’t any of their games famous? 2 things, societal advocacy of the gaming community and EDUCATION in the creation of games. There’s a HUGE difference between software engineering, programming, and writing code and actually learning how to develop and design a video game. Just because someone can operate a camera really well, doesn’t make them a good movie director. You gotta learn how to form a story, tell the difference between a good actor and a bad one, and most of all having the fundamental knowledge of what makes a good movie. You can say the exact same thing when it comes to video game development. Hell, Ubisoft is opening a branch in Dubai because there’s a pretty good amount of students graduating out of game development and design programs in the region.  I can’t guarantee this, seeing that there aren’t exactly studies on the matter, but if Egypt had (and encouraged) game development programs, I feel like there’d be a pretty good chance of seeing some proper indie and AAA titles. Also cmon man, people thrive on video game piracy here, I don’t think a game being Egyptian would really change much.  However I do agree that this isn’t a reason for a lack of AAA titles.   TLDR; Budget, actually learning to make a video game, and not just studying programming are why we don’t have AAA titles or any good indie titles made in Egypt.	1641630698.0	hrr84kh	t3_ryrv74	t3_ryrv74	/r/Egypt/comments/ryrv74/this_question_is_for_software_engineers_and/hrr84kh/

3sjzff1z	If you’re a software engineer you have basic understanding of programming that helps you in any field related to programming. Doesn’t mean you’re gonna jump on the game development train without learning the technology but it’s gonna help.  There’s actually a lot of studios in Egypt but most of them don’t reach production level and the one that did RPG released it too early that people found too many bugs and refunded their money.   I think all you need is at least 5 experienced people to develop a successful indie game (gonna take years but still) because look at a game like Bright Memories. It’s made by a single developer who used stolen assets but due to how awesome the game is I think Epic helped him into buying the assets and he recreated some other assets or something like that but they solved the stolen assets issue. it’s made by a single developer. No funding, no huge budget.	1641636404.0	hrrfcw5	t3_ryrv74	t1_hrr84kh	/r/Egypt/comments/ryrv74/this_question_is_for_software_engineers_and/hrrfcw5/

3sjzff1z	We rank on HackerRank as from the top 40 countries to provide software engineers for example.   All we lack is awareness, a lot of people don’t even know what software engineering is but most people steal courses anyway so lack of education is not a reason. I am graduating from CS this year in all the four years i have been teacher assistants have always recommended courses. And if someone is feeling a little bit hungry for the field there’s OSSU on github which is the best place to learn CS in my opinion along with harvard and mit courses that are free.   Now that was my mistake all I meant is a big game as in scale and in quality turns out AAA meant huge studios with huge fundings (sorry ig). But budget is not an excuse. Looking at a game like Bright Memories, the game is developed by one developer and the assets are stolen. One developer, no funding whatsoever.   And the no cracking games on Facebook pages I think it already happened once with a game but it didn’t get famous or anything due to how much bugs in it. The CEO released the game without any beta testing so people refunded their money bc of how many bugs are in the game.   But the main reason of me posting this is if someone can make a game like Bright Memories alone surely we can make something like it with a team ? And it doesn’t have to be a game that’s massive. Look at Hellblade it’s a linear game with a story no exploring or anything good old walk this path fight monsters and listen to the story. Or Rocket league, try to score with your flying car. Or even Little Nightmares, brilliance in the game design and the mechanics of the game but it’s not massive or anything.	1641637542.0	hrrgsmb	t3_ryrv74	t1_hrr5gyr	/r/Egypt/comments/ryrv74/this_question_is_for_software_engineers_and/hrrgsmb/

And I have a friend who is also a student that makes 3k per month but in usd by working in CPA marketing. IMO as long as you have access to the internet you have no excuse for not making money.

A dentist working for the ministry of health makes about 2500-3500 a month and those in Insurance make 8000-10000 a month but that requires a very big "wasta".   Most private practices make around 5k as a start excluding clinic and salary fees. It's every dentist's dream to make 30k a month excluding mentenance and management fees. Big clinics make millions a month like "Shiny White", "Whitey Clinic" and other big names.	1641640763.0	hrrkv4k	t3_ryfji2	t1_hrorit3	/r/Egypt/comments/ryfji2/whats_your_monthly_income_aftertax/hrrkv4k/

3zx0jgmd	It’s simple, really. Most, if not all, Egyptians with the proper skills and talent work abroad. There are no AAA game studios in studios in Egypt so any Egyptian devs find work and opportunities abroad. Budget is also an incredibly important factor that we shouldn’t underestimate, though many other comments mentioned that.  You’d be surprised at how many Egyptians work in studios such as Ubisoft, for example. For every AAA game you’ve played, there was likely an Egyptian dev or two involved in creating it. Though not exactly a game dev, one of the lead producers at Ubisoft, Youssef Maguid, is Egyptian.   It’s also not just relegated to AAA gaming. There are a lot of indies, too. Rami Ismail is a great example of this. He’s a half-Egyptian and an industry veteran who worked on a lot of really good indie titles with the now defunct Vlambeer at the Netherlands.	1641642712.0	hrrng0m	t3_ryrv74	t3_ryrv74	/r/Egypt/comments/ryrv74/this_question_is_for_software_engineers_and/hrrng0m/

13isan	I am not sure how the problem advanced to the current stage but the real issue right now is that people became desensitized to the sight of garbage or the abused stray animals or the vandalized public places. basically the streets of Egypt look like a place where you would find Egyptians. if we remove the garbage and clean the whole country then people will distaste the cleanliness and find it odd. I am sorry for what I am about to say and I hope no one gets offended but asking why Egypt is dirty is like asking why garbage cans have garbage in them. it's supposed to be like that otherwise why would it be one the shittiest countries to live in?	1641643736.0	hrrov30	t3_rxjn91	t3_rxjn91	/r/Egypt/comments/rxjn91/why_is_there_garbage_everywhere_in_the_streets/hrrov30/

35ozlnov	Not to mention animation and usage of game engines. All these things require skills. I think we can have a small studio develop an I die game since the sale is smaller and it's doable. But there is the issue of marketing it as well. Not to mention that most people don't find the idea lucrative and a bit of a gamble. It's safer to try to work in fields like web development, Mobile App development, networking etc... Than to pursue a career in video games in a developing country. People want money especially in current climate, the former are much safer options to go for than the latter. Kinda like someone who wants to be a singer, the vast majority would tell him/her that it's a stupid dream and only 1 in a million realise it. And push them to something more "serious".	1641645360.0	hrrr7q9	t3_ryrv74	t1_hrr84kh	/r/Egypt/comments/ryrv74/this_question_is_for_software_engineers_and/hrrr7q9/

j8wzn	I'm the same (family from Alex). I'd suggest 6th of October or Zayed. It's a 2 hour drive from Alex, and much more modern. The lifestyle is closer to being abroad and it's already populated and people live there.  I prefer tagamo3 over them but it's an extra 1-2 hours to Alex, and it's pricier. However it's a nicer vibe and more places to go out in and more diverse.

czvtp96z	I am not a radical leftist, I’m more of a centre left. My surroundings (Egyptian society) are more on the conservative side ik that. But I don’t have to be part of it, nor does Mohamed Salah.   This society is toxic because it rejects any kind of change or anything new to it basically, you can stay conservative all you want, you have the freedom to do so, but I want the freedom to be different and I don’t want this society to keep trying to bring people like me back the societal and cultural norms. You be you and I’ll be me, except I can’t be me when everyone keeps oppressing people like me this way, that’s on the society part.   Anywho, this is Reddit, you can say your opinion, like I just said mine, but irl we’d have more peace if there was actual freedom of speech and criticism.   And yeah non binaries exist and also genderqueers, my views on that part of the far left are mixed tbh but either way, I let them be who they wanna be, freely, and I expect them to do the same for me.	1641999345.0	hscremq	t3_s1bpwa	t1_hsbqpgc	/r/Egypt/comments/s1bpwa/تمام/hscremq/

h8gc5tuv	1. that was a bad joke, sorry 2. As an egyptian who was born and raised in saudi arabiai can tell you that the difference between the two countries is night and day, i personaly loved the saudi culture more as it was more traditional and society was alot calmer especially where i lived (القصيم). Egypt is like a living on adrenaline, you have to move 24/7, no time to think, you have survive. So i do agree with you on almost everything you said as i've lived in both countries. 3. As for the job, you mentioned you are a software engineer, which is a very good field to work in you just have to find the place, Have you tried starting your own company or freelancing? I've known a few female friends who started an online marketing company and have done pretty well so thats an option. Your english is pretty good, have you tried giving courses or finding a job as a translator or a private teacher? 4.

a8qe5ow2	That's perfectly fine, I just find pvp games to be much more toxic than pve ones so I thought I might throw the suggestion out there.  A community I remember helped me with my understanding its game better is rocket league so I highly suggest it as far as pvp goes. The only battle royale I play is Apex Legends but it's to troll my high ranking friend and that's about it so, I'm not the best to ask about that genre of games haha 😅 Do note the players in Apex are pretty toxic though so I don't suggest it.

a8qe5ow2	*To be fair* yes, Cyberpunk is glitchy, but my point is this: It sold the 13 million despite its shortcoming and the hype prior combined show that interest for single player games is high.  In addition, in my opinion, a lot gems get released, the only problem is that they get overshadowed a lot by more mainstream appeal and, unfortunately, much of the spoilable parts get spoilt very easily due to how accessible everyone's comment on anything is nowadays, making spoilers much less lenient than they were back in the day, but still, as someone who looks for games continually to play, I find it easy to pick something to play that I like, especially if obscure thanks to the aforementioned reasons.	1642001051.0	hscvki4	t3_s24l4f	t1_hscuj4v	/r/Egypt/comments/s24l4f/dear_egyptian_gamers/hscvki4/

What seems natural to you is mind boggling to me ( existence of the nonbinaries and the no-judgment notions ).   It is not a matter of being conservative or leftists or anything really… these are just titles that limit what’s acceptable. You can choose to be a bit of a leftists, conservative, liberal, communist, capitalist, feminist, whatever it is that you want to shove in there as well: because we have brains to chose and judge as opposed to stick to a frame of thoughts outlined by others.

But definitely getting closer to your work is the priority in Egypt, it'll save you a lot of time and resources in the long run.

31eq11ie	Ok so my father was just like this took first dose in KSA and second dose in Egypt. First of all if you took the first dose in KSA then you know there is an app like an online health passport. My father took his second dose and got the certificate with the QR code on it and emailed them. Two days and the certificate got accepted and he was fully vaccinated.but because he took his second dose outside the kingdom he was still now allowed to enter without quarantine in another country.this was like November 202. He travelled to Jordan to take 15 days quarantine there and then go to the kingdom but 2 or 3 days before his end of the quarantine the ban was lifted and he travelled right away.so as long as i know if the app says you are fully vaccinated you will be allowed in.	1642004593.0	hsd4nth	t3_s24anx	t3_s24anx	/r/Egypt/comments/s24anx/does_anyone_know_if_this_certificate_is_enough/hsd4nth/
8t68a	Moved to sharm el sheikh and riyadh from cairo before that and had to get new friends. Its unorthodox but i actually used tinder and bumble to meet new friends. Hell my bestie of 5 years rn was a girl i met of tinder, another unusual way i got to make some friends is actually through this subreddit. The more traditional way is through work 'great friend i got to know in sharm el sheikh was through a after work party/outing where we talked a bit and clicked, at the place we went to i actually got to make a shit ton of friends even tho usually it takes me some time to warm up to people lol. Just dont over think it and be yourself, friends will suddenly pop out in your life when ya least expect it!	1642004698.0	hsd4xsl	t3_s27f07	t3_s27f07	/r/Egypt/comments/s27f07/how_do_you_usually_make_new_friends_when_you_move/hsd4xsl/

I absolutely love and love its flexibility that helped my poor situation over the uears and that it also scales up with your PC so the weakest PCs can play many modepacks with just 16 gbs or Ram that you can transfer later to a new one and stronger PCs can run shaders, texturepacks with higher resolution and use resource heavy mods that add nice visuals and turn it to almost AAA quality. It's underappreciated by our communities.	1642008088.0	hsddyu4	t3_s24l4f	t3_s24l4f	/r/Egypt/comments/s24l4f/dear_egyptian_gamers/hsddyu4/

79ycugng	There are extreme people on both sides. Same type of people on the opposition side that see everything bad and hate and undersell everything the country does. All the same shit as those that support the gov and never criticize. I could write this same paragraphs on the other side. And how anyone praising the gov for anything just gets called m3aras.   There isnt freedom of speech and that sucks and has never changed since, well like forever. Its stupid.   About the parades, those are good investments for tourism like our most important sector, very smart, lots of coverage online for relatively cheap. The mo2tamarat are really good too. The defence egx mo2tamar thing for weapons was great and helps develop and showcase our home made weapons, world youth forum is good too, gives youth a chance and shows their innovation and shit, its great too. Dont see the issue with those. And all the projects that were opened in upper egypt recently are important as fuck, not useless by any means, electricity and water Projects. Also good.  If the point of this post was a word against those that support the gov blindly and take any opposition to be enemys and evil. Then yea fuck those ppl and anyone one sided like that in general. But i disagree with trying to say the shit the gov is doing is useless or all for show to give the illusion of progress. More work is being put into Egypt in the past few years than the last 50 years combined. Thats a fact. All the investments in roads,tunnels,bridges,slum removals,monorail,metros,LRT,BRT,HSR,unis, haya karima, water projects, agricultural projects, all the projects that gave us self sufficiency, prison reform, military strengthening, cities, sinai development, upper egypt projects, and on and on. Its exactly what i want to see the country doing.   Thats not to say there isnt bad shit to be criticized, like lack of freedom of speech and opposition, tiran amd sanafir, need for more education spending/reform again cause last one sucked i hear, better urban planning, too much involvement from public sector.   Overall though, i see more bad than good and am pretty hopeful so much so that i think i plan on actually staying in Egypt rather than trying to leave. Wanna be part of the positive change.	1642009690.0	hsdiafb	t3_s256qp	t3_s256qp	/r/Egypt/comments/s256qp/spoiler_alert/hsdiafb/

4uusdfku	On the contrary this game design is more focused to be played casually , on daily basis it doesn't require any grinding just max 10-15 min a day is more than enough to collect all you need and that's the problem that many hardcore players and endgame players complain that ths game is so easy cause it's focused on casual players but i think you have a point that any new player will find it overwhelming cause you will find lots of content to be played ,so if you are not rushing and grinding through the whole game to reach high levels ,you will enjoy the experience. As i said there is no point in grinding in this game cause endgame is not that hard and the game is not PVP .	1642010318.0	hsdk06z	t3_s24l4f	t1_hsddu3q	/r/Egypt/comments/s24l4f/dear_egyptian_gamers/hsdk06z/

ci1gp3xn	If you're planning to visit the fancy hotels abd have some type of tour guide with you, you're okay. However, if you're going alone, just like the above comments, I'd recommend you to befriend an Egyptian before hand and do ALOT of research on us. You'd be surprised how different our cultures differ, so many things that you guys are A-OKAY with is frowned upon here. For example, public display of affection which is typically kissing your gf/bf would be frowned upon here. I acknowledge that you're coming alone, but I'm just giving you an example. One more thing, when buying something from the local marketplaces in Egypt, always bargain with the prices, even if it looks like they're giving you a great deal they're most likely ripping you off.  Sending love from Cairo. Always wanted to go to Canada. (speaking of which, be ready to face Egypt's moderate/hot whether conditions, could be bearable cuz it's winter though).	1642015061.0	hsdwqbw	t3_s1w88n	t3_s1w88n	/r/Egypt/comments/s1w88n/travel_advice/hsdwqbw/

b8aybpjr	The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile, which begins at Jinja, Lake Victoria,[11] and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins from Uganda Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[12] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[13] The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, where Cairo is located on its large delta and the river flows into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times and its annual flooding. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan dam. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt developed and are found along river banks. - Wiki	1642017575.0	hse3azx	t3_s2euks	t1_hse17nk	/r/Egypt/comments/s2euks/is_the_water_in_the_nile_salty_or_sweet/hse3azx/

b8aybpjr	He had bilharzia Abdel Halim died of liver failure as a complication from Schistosoma mansoni (reference St. George's University School of Medicine) on March 30, 1977 (a few months before his 48th birthday) while undergoing treatment for Bilharzia in King's College Hospital, London. His funeral in Cairo was attended by millions of people[7] – more than any funeral in the history of the Middle East, other than that of President Nasser.[27] Halim was reported to have had many more dreams and goals that he wanted to achieve, though his early death prevented him from doing so.[19] In the wake of Halim's passing, it was documented people committed suicide, including at least four women committing suicide by jumping off a balcony during his funeral march.[1][7] He was buried in Al Bassatin Cemetery in Cairo. - wiki	1642017721.0	hse3ooj	t3_s2euks	t1_hse1kz8	/r/Egypt/comments/s2euks/is_the_water_in_the_nile_salty_or_sweet/hse3ooj/

Im currently taking a break from Hypixel Skyblock, it's a really fun remake of the og Skyblock it took Skyblock to a whole new level with custom armours, bosses, mobs, game mechanics in vanilla. About Roblox tho .. it used to be a great until they started making the same games with different names and when they removed events 2018 had one 2 of the best events ever the RPO event and the Egg hunt, also the deletion of one of my favourite games was upsetting kinda why I left ( Pokemon Brick Bronze ).   TL;DR Minecraft is an amazing game for chill and competitive people and Roblox just seems more childish by the day and they keep removing stuff people liked.	1642020036.0	hse9vzq	t3_s24l4f	t3_s24l4f	/r/Egypt/comments/s24l4f/dear_egyptian_gamers/hse9vzq/

j8wzn	The top companies I can recommend in no particular order:   Orascom   Palm Hills   Talaat Mustafa   Mountain View   WaterWay   Beverly Hills   Hassan Allam  Sodic  Al Futtam (Cairo Festival City)   etc.     Most are large and really good.     A budget of 500K can be a decent 20% Downpayment (most require 10%, some now take 0%).     I'd suggest looking at:   Mountain View icity / Hyde Park   Palm Hills Badya (6th october)   Zed East / West  EastTown (Sodic)  Hyde Park  &#x200B;  These are pretty decently priced and many will offer long payment plans and decent down payments. They are also in populated cities. If you want to go to a more future(ish) zone I'd recommend mostakbal city, bloomfields.

Interestingly, I found an exit near Asiut that takes you southwest and I thought this would take you to Al Wahat (for some reason). After a couple hundred kilometers, I found out that it takes you to Al Kharga, which after a few kilometers, you'll find yourself in the beautiful costal city of Port Said /s then you will arrive at your final destination, the city of love.

I used to go out just to buy bags of fruits, Omg the strawberries, oranges even tiny bananas. My only disappointment was the mangoes there was a huge variety but they were either too sweet or too mushy hard pass. And that cactus fruit you guys eat, pass. If I go back to Egypt one of the reasons will be for the fruit, and it’s so cheap (this maybe because if the GBP exchange rate and I understand for citizens they are probably expensive).

sar21	To my very humble understanding, faith requires it.  The believing process for me does not necessarily require/start with knowing the logic behind every single detail. An everyday example of this: some of us can not wrap their head around/do not have enough knowledge when it comes to medical practices for example, yet we do believe in modern medicine without necessarily understanding all of its details, our believe in it is based mostly on the fundamentals and methodology it's based on.  Moving back to religion, some details/divine orders/etc may have a revealed or none revealed wisdom behind it I end up believing in those based on the rest of what I know and understand.  I came across this saying a while back in one book  وقد لخّص هذا الحال؛ ابن عمر رضي الله عنه لمّا قال: " لَقَدْ عِشْنَا بُرْهَةً مِنْ دَهْرِنَا وَإِنَّ أَحْدَثَنَا يُؤْتَى الْإِيمَانَ قَبْلَ الْقُرْآنِ، وَتَنْزِلُ السُّورَةُ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فَيَتَعَلَّمُ حَلَالَهَا وَحَرَامَهَا، وَمَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يُوقَفَ عِنْدَهُ فِيهَا كَمَا تَعْلَمُونَ أَنْتُمُ الْقُرْآنَ ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: لَقَدْ رَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا يُؤْتَى أَحَدُهُمُ الْقُرْآنَ فَيَقْرَأُ مَا بَيْنَ فَاتِحَتِهِ إِلَى خَاتِمَتِهِ مَا يَدْرِي مَا أَمْرُهُ وَلَا زَاجِرُهُ، وَلَا مَا يَنْبَغِي أَنْ يُوقَفَ عِنْدَهُ مِنْهُ يَنْثُرُهُ نَثْرَ الدَّقَلِ "  Referring to how the companions of the prophet PBUH had strong base of faith first that led them to understand the more detailed articles  PS I'm not a sheikh and not learned enough to give an informed opinion, I'm just trying to describe my Personal  understanding of the matter	1642025874.0	hsepmf8	t3_s2hmpg	t3_s2hmpg	/r/Egypt/comments/s2hmpg/الإيمان_بالتسليم/hsepmf8/

I didn't even bring my media to this i believe what i saw mate, you're making it look like it's personal on there tbh, there's Getty images for you if you don't wanna afford some pictures there's every single player and coach interviews and there are videos and clips filmed on youtube if that's what you wanna see, i didn't close my eyes to that but to believe my local news papers?! HELL NO. I admitted that the ones went to sudan were thugs mostly but didn't do any hostilities in sudan yet they're innocent told you to give me one news that if you believe YOUR MEDIA that any Egyptian got attacked in sudan in the stadium in 2009, yes they insulted shahata and sang a song on him but i Guess that happened even in the premier league on arsenal stands against wenger 😂, i won't argue any further tbh or justify cuz I'm kinda tired of all this you and us chat lol, your first reply made it look like you hated algeria, people already said that football is the reason of the hate but either it's us or you who's wrong we needed to forget not dig into it as you did.	1642031785.0	hsf49eh	t3_s1vcen	t1_hsf0hxt	/r/Egypt/comments/s1vcen/whats_happened_between_algeria_and_egypt/hsf49eh/

33lq2yjz	A small advice. If you are living in Egypt, take medicine even if it doesn't interest you that much for simple 2 reasons   1- you can study to become SWE during your holidays if you really feel about, most of IT employers don't require you to have a major in CS as long as you have the needed skills, study CS at college seems like a waste of time    2- just in case that you fail to find a job outside egypt (which is a high possibility)being doctor will definitely serve you better here in Egypt  I know what I said is kinda harsh but I am trying to stay realistic	1642032773.0	hsf6lfg	t3_s114kx	t3_s114kx	/r/Egypt/comments/s114kx/has_someone_struggled_before_choosing_between_cs/hsf6lfg/

Our belmadi screwed the starting formation a bit and many chances missed but it's understandable by me at least, i watched Egypt match and the only struggle is passing the ball in Nigeria's half and getting them to salah which shouldn't have been played as a cf at all.

a25k3fji	Your best and only option is sending it with someone you know coming from the uk to egypt.   I faced the exact same problem except my bank account is in saudi, i cancelled my card because it got hacked and issued a new one and they delivered it to my family. I tried to make them send it through post but aramex said egypt doesn’t accept receiving bank cards through post mail, i called dhl and they said they accept it but they must send it to the central banks for assessment which is completely unnecessary and it will costs 3,000 pounds.

1thqm9c3	On the long-term, practicing being social is the way to go buddy. Here’s why:  Your first time sexing is gonna be weird. Guaranteed. Even if it’s with your soulmate, wife, partner, whatever. It’s like… going to a cafe for the first time Vs after you’ve become friends with all the staff there. So, one time isn’t gonna be enough for you to experience sex cuz you’re mind is still getting used to the new sensations and the positions n shit.  Sex isn’t simple dick in vagina. Sex is a very complex act that ties in emotions and physical touch and sometimes it’s spiritual as hell. A sex worker does this for living. It’s like the waiter who’s nice to you but you know it’s cuz they just want the tip (lol). A friend or a girlfriend or a one night stand even is just a much deeper experience, esp during the first time cuz it’s a lot nicer when you feel comfortable and safe with the person.   I know you just wanted the name of a place and not a lecture or whatever, so I’m sorry about that and here’s a cool trick: If you can speak good English, go to a hotel and ask the concierge in English but be smart about it. He’ll refer you to a place/person and you might even get a high-end sex worker/escort.   Anyway, I just thought you had to know the difference between f*cking and sex because we already have so many misconceptions about sex in this country that it’s been ruined for us so hard (lol again). I wouldn’t want it to be ruined for you too if you go in with unrealistic expectations.  Good luck on your journey my friend. And remember, tinder is always an option.	1642037605.0	hsfgeax	t3_s2ja5o	t3_s2ja5o	/r/Egypt/comments/s2ja5o/weird_question_but_does_anyone_know_how_can_i/hsfgeax/

6hh12	late reply but I've been wanting to rant about this game for ages  before i start i wanna make it clear i love this game and its one of my faves as someone who has played every AC game except valhalla, liberation and those mobile game ones   as usual with ubisoft games they do an amazing job with the world and the setting and the general ambiance like you could just stand there, raise the volume and you'll feel like you're really standing in Ptolemaic Egypt  another thing ubisoft is good at is bringing the real life history into the game and adding their twist into it where it becomes a bit more fantasy-like but not in a bullshit way  (tho i didn't like how they went with the stereotype of cleopatra being some kind of a prostitute queen)  however I noticed they tried a bit hard to push the whole "ancient egyptians were black" thing by making the egyptians black with african voice actors   also i noticed some names in the game, like Aya, are modern Arabic names and not ancient egyptians tho i might cut them some slack cuz we probably don't know that many ancient egyptian names   the story isn't quite up to the AC standard we see in the first few games (especially AC2) but it's not bad its not as bad as the games that came after lol  i might be a bit biased cuz it's set in where im from and im the kinda gamer who likes exploring in open world games but i did like this game a lot	1642046929.0	hsg16ha	t3_rzr2l4	t3_rzr2l4	/r/Egypt/comments/rzr2l4/are_you_satisfied_with_ac_origins_in_its/hsg16ha/

j8wzn	Bank in Egypt suck. Period. It's like they are doing a favor by allowing you to give them your money.  I dealt with QNB and CIB. Both are decent, I prefer CIB more. I was with QNB since it was NSGB.  I'd consider EG Bank, just because they went through a make over and actually look pretty decent, and the employees are not stuck up assholes. CIB only really cares about you once you surpass a certain savings amount, then all of a sudden you are assigned a personal assistant and a direct number to call and a bunch of ass kissing.  QNB was great cause I had a lot of friends working there, like I would literally not even take a ticket and walk in and get shit done while having coffee. They also had decent online options.  Gov banks are better for the CDs and interest rate, but you said you don't care.  Chargebacks in Egypt suck, they treat each case as suspicious that you are trying to rip them off. Thankfully I never had to deal with that. Only card that interests me is the EgyptAir Credit card cause it gives me miles I can use to upgrade my status there (I don't even care about redeeming them at this point).	1642051358.0	hsg9qpd	t3_s1ewn9	t3_s1ewn9	/r/Egypt/comments/s1ewn9/need_advice_on_egyptian_banks/hsg9qpd/

8xx3648	There's nothing called it's meant to be like that. Devlepement of Politics and social dynamics changes everything throughout history. And you sre talking as if unity means letting the others occupy us, each nation has sovereignty that they protect, however it will be one united sovereignty instead of 2 different.  Take the USSR as an example, the Moscow russians, ukranians, baltics, central asia turkics, armenians, mongolians, each had their own culture identity heritage and most had a long history. However one day they became one nation. Yea it didn't go so well for its beginning especially they just got out of a civil war and then ww2, but you can't doubt they were afrerwards a very stable and strong unified state of different nations together.  If we united with some nations in means of uniting as one state without giving up your own identity and history then I don't see the problem? Algerians fought the french for independence as we fought the brits, not only that but they lost and suffered way more, 5.6M during the entire colonial era and 1-1.5M during their Independence War. We also had casualties but were never high like that.	1642055981.0	hsghb0t	t3_s1vcen	t1_hscmleh	/r/Egypt/comments/s1vcen/whats_happened_between_algeria_and_egypt/hsghb0t/

owkp1g5	>how much percentage of the Egyptian population use banking transactions daily  [67% of Egyptians](https://enterprise.press/stories/2021/03/18/we-still-banknotes-35647/) are unbaked and so only 33% have a bank account.   >Do Egyptians pay taxes? And how much does the black market contribute to the economy?  Taxes most of the time is taken automatically from the people without doing much, so the taxes are deducted from the peoples salary and taken without the people having to do anything or the Capital Gains Tax that was implemented this year where people who have less than 5,000,000 EGP invested in stock, won't have to open a tax file but their profits will be taken from the brokerage account by the Misr for Central Clearing and Depository. Also if you go to any supermarket or restaurant you more than likely paid a value add tax.  >Why do Egyptians not have a governmental payment system where every citizen has an identifier like the one in US & Europe (Social Security number) or barcode rather  Egyptians have a national ID number which I assume is the equivalent to the Social Security Number but I am not exactly sure.  >includes the private sector and all small businesses.  I believe every business has to open a tax file before it can open.   All of the stuff you mentioned is a problem the government is trying to handle and they definitely trying to increase the revenues they get from taxes, by promoting financial inclusion. While some of the new taxes are good others in my opinion are bad, and most of the time they delay implementing taxes if they are really unpopular, which is sometimes a bad thing.	1642073158.0	hsh3f8z	t3_s2w96m	t3_s2w96m	/r/Egypt/comments/s2w96m/taxation_in_egypt/hsh3f8z/

With our planet movement and rotation; solar system , the star emitting light  and the  body that bent the light movement too.   Adding all of these factors, and the fact that it doesn't have to be one body that affect the light but more - probably more than one at a time-, can result in the light changing shape frequently and super quick too.	1642074972.0	hsh5zb8	t3_s2o2qo	t1_hsgaik7	/r/Egypt/comments/s2o2qo/قولي_حاجه_شفتها_او_حصلت_ليك_بس_ما_عندكش_منها/hsh5zb8/

9rhgu9gj	WTF didn't know that 67% of Egyptians do not have bank accounts. That damaged my mind.    This means that Egyptians have billions of $$ in economic circulation that is not reported to the taxation institutions across the governorates halls and the Presidential government.    Given this premise, our GDP should be exceeded $500B or so like Italy, Brazil, Etc. Italy, for example, about 15% of its GDP is in the shadow.    Regarding your conclusion, Yes, I agree with you. Egyptians do not pay their fair share of taxes, and there are always many ways to cheat. There are tons of ppl making tens of millions of pounds and paying virtually nothing.    And as a result, that will dramatically decrease the government's revenue by a whole lot. The consequences will follow in every other aspect relatable directly and indirectly, which will minimize the government's progress, like how the government spending will prioritize. We have debts and interests, Etc, and there will not be too much to spend on infrastructures, healthcare, education.	1642075911.0	hsh7dg8	t3_s2w96m	t1_hsh3f8z	/r/Egypt/comments/s2w96m/taxation_in_egypt/hsh7dg8/

1e6nz65	Most Egyptians, whether lower middle class or properly poor are part of the working class, so I don't see the point in making it seem like that's not a huge portion of the population? Those people with no access to basic life necessities are similarly struggling, and they most likely are working class too just in the "unofficial" market. Economic strife is omnipresent in Egypt and it's all for the same reasons: the large, long-term projects ur praising require serious austerity measures that continue to suffocate ppl for the long periods of time that they take to actually make profit. Even when they do (see IMF loans taken out during Sadat era, running into Mubarak era), these ppl never live to see the fruits of such projects, it's usually a select few who do and the rest just eat shit. So I don't particularly appreciate me criticising your take that is honestly demoralising of public grievances as "me lacking vision" when YOU'RE the one refusing to hear people out!	1642078318.0	hshbb5j	t3_s2372r	t1_hsd6th8	/r/Egypt/comments/s2372r/تحيه_لكل_من_شاف_الخبر_وقال_احاااا/hshbb5j/

79ycugng	Youre grossly underselling the extent of the projects being done. "Shwayet masharee3 bent a7ba". The amount of projects in pretty much every sector is crazy. You never see this work being put in mubaraks rule. And we're not drowning in debt from these projects. Our debt is at very good levels and is said to be manageable. (https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/10/despite-reaching-all-time-high-egypts-external-debt-within-safe-levels)  You need to be patient. Proper Work is being put into the country, its not being left to crumble and just trying to keep yourself as a ruler popular by making things cheap and shit like allowing slums to flourish. Its been 7 years. Its not enough time for you to feel it. We are the generation that will have to feel the bullshit of the past 40 years this country faced.	1642078639.0	hshbva3	t3_s256qp	t1_hsds26g	/r/Egypt/comments/s256qp/spoiler_alert/hshbva3/

78vwcc67	That's exactly the whole point we are talking about.  What is sold locally is of a much lower quality than what is sold abroad.  You argument is that it should be so since locally it is cheaper? (Even though that's not quite the case, food in Germany is comparable to the prices in Egypt, especially when it comes to things they produce locally like apples for example)   In the end the government (Ministry of Agriculture) is responsible for providing the local market with good quality food (comparable to the exported quality).  >Unless you want the farmers work for you for free  They are already being paid pennies btw. That's why labour intensive produce like strawberries (since there are no machines that reliably pick strawberries) are being farmed in low labour cost countries like Egypt.	1642081375.0	hshh3ic	t3_s2au46	t1_hsh50ov	/r/Egypt/comments/s2au46/im_in_uk_rn_and_im_so_proud_of_us_we_export/hshh3ic/
1xq22uri	Actually he's right, the fruits and vegetables that are made to be exported are of higher quality and are not sold locally, there are specific farms in Egypt that make fruits and vegetables for export only, yes you can find the same types of fruits and vegetables in local markets obviously but they're not the same as the ones that are exported.

dmrx3yoe	Because the rest of the world has secularized while we were demonizing secularism and restoring the prestige of a thousand year old set of rules and ideologies.  And because of lack of education and lack of authority that challenges islamism due to fear of the people.  &#x200B;  And this has been persistent and it has many reasons. It's not linked to 1 govt or 1 entity.  I may even say it's linked to the people themselves. My friends in the uni cheat and get full marks coz their parents are professors.     And supervisors stage it among themselves that they'd help each others' relatives in exchange for the same.  Professors or teachers are unqualified or are lazy and just content with their fixed salary and don't care about bettering themselves etc.  &#x200B;  So please dont just ignore all of this and tie down the lack of education to the govt. Nasser for example has actually been way better than any of his predecessors in this field particularly.	1642187054.0	hsnxhf4	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hsnwxcn	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsnxhf4/

2x6xgod7	Long gone are the days of the single income family, back in the day everything was cheap in comparison and your salary could sustain your whole family.      Rising inflation and a much more dystopian society that is now used to the quick fix to get a dopamine high means people's attention span has shortened and their need for self preservation has increased exponentially.      No one really wants the responsibility of a relationship, let alone a marriage nowadays.	1642187282.0	hsny296	t3_s3scsk	t3_s3scsk	/r/Egypt/comments/s3scsk/the_divorce_rate_in_egypt_became_so_high_and/hsny296/

g9c70npj	Well when someone like mo who is a Muslim, doesn't even say happy new year or anything about the new lunar year which is more important to a Muslim but then he celebrates Christmas is just weird especially that he is a public figure, but tbh i never saw or heard anyone tell a Christian your religion is false or anything bad for Christmas i even have some christian friends and they never told anything bad that happened to them from Muslims like that is a bit rare and i would also find it weird and inappropriate to say to attack someone's religion unless they attack yours so i am kinda with you in that point. But the one with girls dressing inappropriately this is more of a cultural approach bec we aren't a society in which people can wear anything, you must wear appropriate clothes wether you are a girl or a guy while it happens more often with girls still some boys dress inappropriately and they too should be attacked for doing so like you can't walk in the street wearing an open shirt exposing your belly (which i have seen people do personally) you might not agree with me on this and say that in America or whatever they can wear anything but you have to realize that this isn't America and we have a different culture.	1642187333.0	hsny70p	t3_s3w3wh	t3_s3w3wh	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsny70p/

I am with him in just that other countries manage their own businesses but still we have a big issue in human rights and seeing people in this subreddit convinced by such speech made me depressed and sure that Egypt won’t go so far.  Concerning that other countries contribute to the war and chaos in other parts of the world that is totally a different issue that he want to mix things up.   Like US, Germany and Japan and other countries contributed in the attack on Iraq killed a lot of civilians. But we are talking about in their home countries not on others land. They don’t have emergency law every weekend or police attack your home and detain your father or mother in case they didn’t find you.

7cfe9rms	Here's how I see it:  By definition, freedom of speech means that you're free to say whatever you want no matter how much other people don't like it as long as you follow 3 conditions: 1. That you don't incite or encourage bigotry, racism, sexism or violence.  2. That you do not intrude on other people's freedom of **not** wanting to listen to you by shoving your messages down their throats or invading their space. 3. That you accept the possibility of someone firing back at you with **their** freedom of speech be it as jokes, taunts or outright dissing.  Generally speaking, people in egypt intrude on other people's lives as in they force there ideals down others' throats because they were raised that way. They weren't allowed to be different in thought or action and every deflection away from the societal norm was met with harsh and sometimes inhumane punishments from their families and in particular, their parents. As a result they grow up with the mentality of "you're either with us or you must be destroyed".  That being said, the example OP provided doesn't really belong in this situation because it's a video that was posted publicly on social media. If you post something to the "people" then you must be prepared for, and accept, the fact that you'll be met with opposing views and beliefs (which is completely fine unless they break the 3 rules stated above). If you aren't comfortable with criticism then keep your posts to your private circle.  TLDR, the comments on the video while not pertaining to some people's tastes are a representation of freedom of speech, and shouldn't be removed because it offends a bunch of sensitive snowflakes.	1642190317.0	hso5zf7	t3_s3w3wh	t3_s3w3wh	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hso5zf7/

4gb30xoi	Hello, iam currently living in Egypt and one of the newer generations, and would like to put out some points.  1. I like that you are critizing our society, that usually would lead to a better solution than the current one, but, you currently aren't living in Egypt and probably haven't gone to high school in Egypt and seen what the mentality of kids are, kids are the future and more important than your "friendly" neighbor that cussed out my mother for wishing her Christian friends a merry Christmas, extremely toxic people exist in Egypt and I can agree on that.  I have seen hundreds of adults who hate atheists and lgtbq, people of other religions and nationalities, it's sad but true.  However the newer generations have been exposed to so much foreign cultures by tiktok and other social networks that they have imprinted the open minded mentality on them, myself included. My school is full of Christians and Muslims we are together in harmony, one of my friends is in fact Christian and I don't hate atheists at all, however when it comes to lgbtq I haven't really decided an opinion yet as iam very conflicted with whether it's right or wrong, but nonetheless whenever iam online I treat them with respect.  I have seen so many kids who support LGBTQ and are very open minded in our generation, however I can confirm that the middle classes who are brought up in uneducated families aren't as open minded.  Lastly what I wish to add is that it 100% depended on the person, my grandma tells me tales of when they were living in isolated villages, Muslims celebrated Christmas and Christians celebrated Ramadan, it's truly a how educated your family was when bringing you up.	1642190355.0	hso630z	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hso20kd	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hso630z/

4ubem97i	While the concept is right there are 2 differences; a) English breakfast tea is a blend of multiple black teas, in Egypt it’s just 1 kind of tea, also the tea bag is not the only way to make tea here, tea can be used without a bag, either you use what is called tea infuser https://www.google.com/search?q=tea+infuser&client=firefox-b-m&prmd=sivxn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj22qaAhrL1AhWJ2aQKHfKCAVcQ_AUoAXoECAIQAQ&biw=375&bih=638&dpr=3#imgrc=1CG0eVn5i6azBM for example or you leave the tea to settle at the bottom of the cup, you don’t eat it or consume it in any way after drinking the tea, that’s the minor difference, the major difference is b) the peppermint used is in the form of fresh peppermint leaves not the one in the bag, and that makes a noticeable difference in the final output https://www.gourmetegypt.com/fresh-fruits-vegetables-herbs/herbs/mint good luck, hope they will like it	1642191274.0	hso8gaz	t3_s412g5	t3_s412g5	/r/Egypt/comments/s412g5/egyptian_tea/hso8gaz/

1hmd3y1	Thank you for your input. You are correct that I’m not as knowledgeable because I haven’t lived in Egypt for a long time, but I have kept in touch with friends I made in school while in Egypt and we often compare our lives, so I’d like to think that I’m a little more knowledgeable than others who live outside Egypt. I do agree with you that the younger generation is more open minded, however a lot of them are still prone to the same behavior. When I dated an Egyptian girl (I’m also a girl) her friends who lived in Egypt went after me on social media and would spam all my posts with hateful insults. I still think the younger generation is definitely more open minded than those before us, but I think the amount that accept LGBT or even just tolerate us are still very little. Nonetheless, I’m still holding out a little hope that one day I’ll be able to come back and not be worried someone will find out I’m gay and get me arrested.	1642191285.0	hso8hdp	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hso630z	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hso8hdp/

vx80c	I don't think that's a fair conclusion to reach. Being gay or atheist is, yes, legal in some countries but that doesn't mean that the people can't still judge them or snitch on them to their parents. In other words, yes, there is no legal action that can be taken towards these people but that doesn't mean that the disgusting intrinsic human qualities, of which we have been talking about, judging, snitching or any other, do not exist in these societies or that people don't act upon it. These qualities exist there as much they exist in Egypt. The government regiment legalizing or criminalizing is a whole different thing.    Also, that "judging" can manifest itself in other things. For instance, you can judge a person based on their political beliefs, it doesn't have to be sexaulilty, religion or what someone dresses only.    Likewise, thank you for having a civil discussion.	1642192730.0	hsoc8la	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hso20kd	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsoc8la/

If I walk down the street in Egypt holding my girlfriends hand, we’re both getting our asses beat and/or thrown in jail.   Are there homophobes/judgy people everywhere?

1hmd3y1	But is the rate of violence against LGBT in the US the same as Egypt? Definitely not. If Egyptians accept or hate LGBT at the same rate as Americans, why do people seek asylum to the US to avoid discrimination for being queer? Why did Sarah Hegazi need to go to Canada?   Why would my mom threaten to send me back to Egypt when she found out I was gay? because she knew I would not have the same freedoms I have in the US.   Also, why do people in this sub always tell queer people not to visit or not show their queerness? It’s because we are waaaaay less friendly and accepting than the majority of other countries, with few exceptions.	1642194798.0	hsohmn6	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hsognc0	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsohmn6/

23uq86bp	This happens everywhere not just in Egypt and not just regarding religion. People nowadays believe that what they think is the only right thing and everybody has to follow it. For those who say freedom of speech tho, there’s a difference between saying what’s on your mind and giving your opinion, and just insulting the others or forcing your ideology on people simply because they have a different view. Let people live their lives and you live your own. I would say tho that in Egypt this problem is amplified specially with religion, and the problem is the people who understand religion the least, are the ones who believe that doing anything slightly different than what they’re doing is wrong.

bmxfp4e1	First of all, props for genuinely asking for my reasons without attacking me- and I have to say that I still met 2 or 3 people who I still have fond feelings of.   That being said, I was ostracised from all social circles because I didn’t speak the language. It was like I wasn’t worth getting to know, simply because I wasn’t Turkish and didn’t understand Turkish. Nobody ever paid me the common courtesy of speaking a language I actually understand (English), which I know for a fact that the guys at work were fluent at. My boss and supervisor were both some of the most humourless, slave-driving fuckers I’ve ever met; which may sound like more of an issue with the company I worked for, but it was 100% an issue with toxic Turkish work culture where you’re expected to work nonstop like a donkey and be questioned when you’re 10 minutes late.  Add to that some people’s mindless fetishisation of Ataturk (most Turks I met were pretty much pleasuring themselves to his pictures) and the weird hostility towards anything of remotely Arab or Islamic identity; or even the barest suggestion that we have some words in common, and you might understand why I have these feelings.

7cfe9rms	Yeah I get you. It's called victim mentality. I agree with you but the point still stands, we can't suppress other people's freedom to express their opinions (within reason) and then expect ourselves to be able to do so. Only thing we can do is keep it civil and fight for the jusitce and change we wish to see in the world.

ci1gp3xn	Usually, I'm a lurker and just comment on something only when I'm comfortable or when I feel like it, but this will be my first comment posted out of rage.  I REALLY hate how you approached the situation, how you started the topic "Most of the Egyptians", and the way you're debating in the comments. No one is denying anything, dear. We're only saying that this happens to ALL of the societies around the world.  It may seem that this is a usual occurrence and that most of the Egyptians are nosey and filled with hatred, but if you think about it, people who usually see something neutral/like they wouldn't really react or give a positive comment, only people who have filthy shit to say will comment, hence you seeing a post with only negative comments and all that.  This is not just in Egypt, this is EVERYWHERE. You remember when Abo Treka (a famous Egyptian football player) went out and publicly complained about how he's against LGBTQ after its flag was displayed before some football match in the English league which his daughter was watching. EVERYONE wanted to cancel him ALTHOUGH he approached the matter in a respectful manner. Yet when some fricking christian priest publicly insulted OUR prophet, no one raised a finger.  I don't know how old you are, but you're clearly fragile enough to see that Egypt is the "bad guy" while everyone is a saint. Each country and society has its different cultures, different people, the good and the bad. Hell, I'd say Egypt is the best country in the world, displaying the good Christian/Muslim relationship, especially during wartime. Christians would cover the muslims' back when they were praying el gom'aa prayer, and the Muslims would do the same to Christians.  Still believe we're just the worst? What about THE NEGATIVE comments that female American-Muslims face for covering up their heads, or how FRANCE, AN ENTIRE COUNTRY, banned hijab for the girls under 18 years. The same country that claims freedom and embraces everyone.  If I could, I'd list the defects of every country but even that would take about a day worth of writing. You're too naive to think that an entire country is responsible for a few pieces of shits' comments. We don't all think the same, and I agree with you about throwing those with negative comments to hell. If it doesn't affect you and you don't have anything nice to say, then shut up.	1642197566.0	hsooqmk	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hsne0nf	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsooqmk/

7148mxg5	This ⬆️ And also don't stress over having a paid internship in a big agency from the start, such good opportunities are super rare unless you know someone who will get you the job/internship and this means that most people don't have this someone but they figure things out and start their career anyway and progress until they get whatever the job they want or have the connections that can actually help them Finding a job can be frustrating especially for people just starting off, but this is the standard situation, it's super normal but you have to try and stay patient  For the skills part, it also happens a lot, it's mainly skills and memory, not magical creativity, so you don't really totally forget you just need some time, practice, and inspiration (from practising, browsing artwork, and hanging out with communities that share your interest if possible) and it can also happen to you when you're perfectly fine, "Creative Block" is not a well-known term among artists for no reason  You're confused and frustrated but you're young and just starting your adult life so don't think of it as the end of the road when it's actually just the beginning Beginnings can be really tough but they don't define our entire future, it can always get better	1642198100.0	hsoq2y9	t3_s3qhc5	t1_hsmgk7d	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qhc5/i_have_nothing_to_wake_up_for/hsoq2y9/

9piild8n	It's deep in thr culture and kind of related to religion. Unfortunately after the cutlural changes in the 70's and 80's (gulf countries mass work migration) people were exposed to a culture where it's completely ok to judge and even punish someone if their religious "appearance" does not match society's taste.  With the effect of money as well, people started to inconciously relate the reason for wealth to being extrs religious -in appearance of course- and throughout the year, you have a society that is completely ok with judging.  Also in other cities in Egypt where more closed societies have always been terrified by norms and FEMALE's "honor" and demonizing anything sexual like it's something unnatural...this created a sexually frustrated society with fear of any appearance or act that they may find outside their forced norms. No awarness of the fact that people can be different and have different norms/beliefs/religions/values.	1642198381.0	hsoqrzn	t3_s3w3wh	t3_s3w3wh	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsoqrzn/

bmxfp4e1	Honestly its not about Atatürk himself; I’m just not a fan of cults of personality in general. I hate it with Abdelnasser in my own country, and when Americans do it with George Washington. It’s just super weird to me that someone picks this random dude in their past and derive that their whole personality from loving him.  Regarding your first point- I do agree that the language barrier would be an issue everywhere, but I think you may have missed my point. I’m not saying it pisses me off that people CAN’T speak English; but rather that they’re fluent and choose not to- even in my presence. My supervisor at work threw me a surprise birthday party and the entire work gang spent the whole “party” chatting with each other in Turkish in the corner while I stood next to the cake twiddling my thumbs. That is my issue.  To address your second point, let me tell you that I’ve worked in 4 different countries (other than Egypt) and have had upwards of 13 bosses from at least 8-9 nationalities by now, and by far and away the least empathetic, most arrogant and emotionless asshole I’ve ever had the misfortune of working under was Turkish… not only that, but the Turkish supervisor he placed me under was the second worst boss I’ve ever had. You can make of that what you will; my personal theory is that Turkish work culture in general is toxic, much like Italian and Pakistani work cultures, where’s you’re expected to give 100% of your time to your job for nothing in return. The reason I think it’s part of the culture is because it wasn’t just me- all the other expats at the office also hated their bosses and thought they were slave driving assholes. However, I do concede that I may have just had bad luck with my bosses in Turkey.  Thank you for acknowledging that last point; I believe that was my biggest problem, personally- and it was the main reason I never felt welcomed.	1642199196.0	hsossip	t3_rkkbfr	t1_hsopz7h	/r/Egypt/comments/rkkbfr/its_getting_out_of_hand_so_lets_remember_for_a/hsossip/

When you're asked about human rights in your country and go on to answer with the "what about their mistakes" attitude, that's a fallacy called whataboutism.

8zno0ehx	I'm neither an Islamist nor an Egyptian (my daughter is half Egyptian).  But I feel the term Islamist seems to be most commonly used now as a term by which to discredit others and dismiss their opinions.  I know older people (50+) who had high regard for the MB in the past,  but most of them seem to feel that group become largely ineffective and is not well led.  However, no one seems to regard it as a "terrorist group" except the U.S., Israel, Gulf leaders, some other Arab leaders, and those who have been influenced by them.  I've noticed that over the past 20 years, there has been a plethora of (fictional) films featuring "Islamists" who commit terrorism and that crimes/heinous acts are often attributed to them as red herrings.  (This has been  proven true in many instances).  Of course, the da'esh (Isis) and that ilk are an entirely different matter.  We should all condemn actual terrorism.  I wish we could have civil discourse and real conversations without labeling or dismissing those with conflicting views;  and without conflating the issues at hand.	1642201772.0	hsoz0q6	t3_s3qzvz	t1_hsms26r	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hsoz0q6/

Move the tea bag up and down and let it set for a minute or a minute and a half then complete the rest of the cup with milk or rather warm milk then stir it take out the tea bag and thats your shai b laban   Now you can further experiment on the percentage of milk to water to reach the specific taste you desire	1642203128.0	hsp28zs	t3_s412g5	t3_s412g5	/r/Egypt/comments/s412g5/egyptian_tea/hsp28zs/

mcltl4j	He's absolutely right about everything he said and you have to realize that human rights issues could have gone much worse if things didn't get stabilized anytime soon. Sure, Egypt is not perfect about human rights at all and they keep censoring things that ago against "the image of Egypt" or "the morality of the Egyptian society" but at least we're not Saudi Arabia level of authoritarianism.  The next step is for the Egyptian people themselves to build a healthy progressive society that treats everyone equally with dignity and respect no matter who they are since we can't demand a government to enforce human rights when the society they govern themselves isn't even tolerant to any ideas that go against their traditions or beliefs to the point of violence and ruination of people's lives.	1642205277.0	hsp78gg	t3_s3qzvz	t3_s3qzvz	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hsp78gg/

e1nqyjmc	Sure:  - people are much warmer and friendlier. They actually take care about each other here. - Egypt actually treats Muslims and Christians in a much more equal and rightful manner than western countries. Discrimination on the country scale is almost non-existent. That’s the total opposite of big countries like France who are actively pissing Muslims off. - it’s a developing country with so many MEGA projects being built at once, whether these are the new 22 cities or the new means of transportation like the monorail and high speed train. These all create opportunities and promote the country to a much better rate of development than any other developed country.  Here you go.  PS: I know the last point is very debatable, but that’s how I see it. It’s always much easier and future-proof to build anew instead of upgrading and improving already established infrastructures. It’s also more costly believe it or not	1642207372.0	hspbx9m	t3_s3qzvz	t1_hsp8rz6	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hspbx9m/

6i60pu2d	We were all born in a racist world and we should actively educate ourselves against it but the problem is when people don't have exposure with other cultures they remain ignorant about the problem and their own bias.  It can be little things where people don't mean any harm by it but when pointed out by a black person after being surrounded by so many people who validate them and don't see an issue with it then they would get defensive and blame the other person for being sensitive... For example, you mentioned 'blacks' in your post, something that is considered insensitive/ dehumanising by people of color in Western spaces and is kind of erased from the language to the extent that if you say it it sounds like an insult. People around the world are going to be offended by different things so it's important to just listen to what the other side has to say withoyt attaching them to a stereotype.	1642207605.0	hspcfwa	t3_s3l023	t3_s3l023	/r/Egypt/comments/s3l023/whats_the_deal_with_the_racism_against_black/hspcfwa/
hcb4bbp3	The west has zero right to lecture about human rights while they continue to kill millions around the world, either through military action like the US did in Iraq, or by ruining the world for everyone else by stealing every possible natural resource and ruining the climate so hard civilization may never recover.  That said though, I believe there are legitimate places where you can take the conversation around human rights in a responsible way and make the case for why certain minorities or classes of people need more rights or why you need better life standards and how you believe all of those come around. Those things inherently can't come about through war or violence but through legal and cultural struggle and a dialogue that will last for decades. Whatever it is you want to see, for the love of God remember that these crackers never have your best interest at heart.	1642207668.0	hspckwo	t3_s3qzvz	t3_s3qzvz	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hspckwo/

2n0jbxn	There are many more options to get cheap treatment and medicine, a lot of expenses (even including healthcare) were subsidized for everyone (now it's only poorer families), government treatment of refugees has also been considerably better than what some European countries do, jobs here have a required paid maternity leave.   Current Arab republic of Egypt's roots are socialist in nature, something some westerners would kill for their country to adapt to, but our purchasing power isn't nearly as big as the US (5% of it actually) so we can't do as much as they have the potential to do. If we had more (to simplify, started more businesses ---> paid more taxes) we would do more but relative to the US, but comparing capability, we are doing more effort financially to sustain less fortunate people.  I have had several family members who had terminal illnesses, none of them had to sell their house or work 3 extra jobs for treatment, they paid what they could and the government handled the rest.	1642208399.0	hspe76c	t3_s3qzvz	t1_hsp8rz6	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hspe76c/

Ngl there aint much to do in sharm at all unless you plan on going to dahab/nuwebai for a weekend which sadly i couldnt do. Hurghada is like an actual city.

a5kv4hov	If you share your own images or videos on social media, you are making it public. You don't expect every single member of the public to have the same mindset, culture, education or perception of the other. People are different and not everyone will give you a nice or a satisfying comment. I am not saying that it is right and i know it's depressing but it's just the way it is.  You said there were nice comments, i would focus on that and not pay attention to the negatives or let it get under my skin. My suggestion would be, keep your private moments to yourself and don't make public, social media is full of unsteady people and sociopaths.  Generalizing few comments to the entire country or public is a generalization and biased way of thinking. These people are everywhere. Anywhere you go, there will be people who pick on you because you look different in away.

hx9wxtab	Mansoura is a small city compared to Cairo so anything that's not essential is hard to get here unless you order it online.  The road from Cairo to Mansoura takes around 3 hours more or less so make sure you have a comfortable ride please especially if you have motion sickness.  Hotels in Mansoura aren't really good but they will do. Restaurants and cafes are plenty though. Don't take a taxi here if you don't know the specific fare. You should't pay more than 40 pounds to get from the bus stop in the east quarter to the university gates in the west quarter. Just use uber but pay with your debit/credit card.   Mansoura used to be a beautiful city but sadly it's deteriorating very fast and changing to boxes of concrete,  glass and steel.  I wish you a safe trip and enjoy your stay.	1642216952.0	hspwmwl	t3_s48exh	t3_s48exh	/r/Egypt/comments/s48exh/coming_to_egypt_for_the_first_time_cairo_to/hspwmwl/

5qdq8ed1	I don’t think it’s just Egyptians, it’s more so just coming from Muslims online in general. And by Muslims, I don’t mean all Muslims, it’s usually people who take it way too seriously saying nasty comments to younger Muslims online.   As a revert I can’t even tell you how much confusion this brings to the religion. And it scares people off, if someone was thinking of becoming Muslim or becoming closer to the religion but sees comments like “you might as well not wear a hijab at all since you wear bring colors and makeup” 🤦‍♀️   Everyone is on their own journey, these keyboard warriors gotta take a break.	1642221992.0	hsq6kpj	t3_s3w3wh	t3_s3w3wh	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsq6kpj/

33mt6q09	In the early 2000s a French company called Onyx was contracted by the government to take care of garbage in Alexandria and that their payment would be the recyclables in the garbage they collect.  They put a garbage bin in front of every house. And a street sweeper truck would sweep the streets every night.  For the first couple of months, it was a huge success. I've never seen Alexandria cleaner.  Later, people started complaining that the smell from the bins was going up to their houses and that they don't want them in front of their houses.  Then the bins were stolen and used for god knows what.  Then scavengers appeared and there were no more recyclables in the garbage for Onyx.  Onyx complained, and the government's response was to pay them by adding garbage collection fees to the monthly electricity bill.   After a while Onyx was ike "Fuck this shit, I'm out of here." And they were gone.  I believe a similar scenario happened in Cairo around the same time but with an Italian company,  I guess.	1642224837.0	hsqbte6	t3_s4cc8u	t3_s4cc8u	/r/Egypt/comments/s4cc8u/nonegyptian_here_who_just_visited_i_want_to_get/hsqbte6/

5qdq8ed1	I read an article about Jordan having a similar issue to Egypt and they did a survey to see what motivates people to not throw their trash in the street. The majority said if they are in a clean area, they won’t. But if they’re in an area with trash already on the ground then they will. So do you think that’s the case for Egypt too? People will not throw trash if the streets start fresh and are clean?	1642225243.0	hsqcjt4	t3_s4cc8u	t1_hsq8poo	/r/Egypt/comments/s4cc8u/nonegyptian_here_who_just_visited_i_want_to_get/hsqcjt4/

If there’s no trash bin then I just hold on to it till I find one, it’s not that hard. Maybe the government should install more trash bins, but even then I still see trash surrounding it and when there’s high wind well, you can guess what happens.

Give me concrete examples something that was developed, a project started or whatever, that was a direct result of this forum  >International event with people from all over the world coming and representing their nations and shit.  First, those guests where not paying out of their pocket, else they wouldn't have come. So the cost is basically carried by the forum. Second, those people don't represent their nations, they are coming as individuals.  Meaning that if someone happens to be French, this doesn't mean that he represents France, and what he says is what France thinks.  >You have celebs/influencers from different countries all over the world coming and posting about it to their respective audience  They must have been doing a terrible job then.  >And what are u on about a military coup and what the government system is in this?

hx9wxtab	Well, I'd say consistency is the key here. Where I live we pay around 50 pounds fees for garbage collection but the garbage truck pass only once a week,  so the trash always accumulates. Also, there is no bins or sweepers in a lot of cities and if they existed they get emptied by scavengers.

Human rights is not a global standard in my opinion, it needs to be tailored for each culture and country.  Also people need to realize that countries who attack egypt for human rights dont actually give a shit about us in egypt, you are just dillusional or stupid to think that the USA or germany give a fuck about rights of people in egypt, they just use this card to oressure government to do some shit and then shup up about it.	1642235836.0	hsqs8np	t3_s3qzvz	t3_s3qzvz	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hsqs8np/

1n0mvwjx	I think you should start step by step  Firstly apply for SAT exam and get a Good score for it and then do the same for Toefl or ILETS.  Although it can be alittle expensive for these 2 eamss, but If you have good scores on them you are mostly ready.   Secondly Picking up any online courses for programing will help you greatly in applying as you would seem like a passionate person.  And the third thing is doing charity work which is important to show that you are a contributing person to society.   Given if you have all of the following, you can apply to any exchange program or college abroad easily fully funded.   All of these things seem alot, but can be done parallel to each other in 8 to 9 months if you are serious.   then apply in the last 4 months or 3 to your college or exchange problem, as most of these open for registration around September and October.  For the essays it is really important, so starting on them is pretty important. So for that you have to look for the college you want to go, or the program you want to attend, then see the required essays for it and starting writing on them from now, then start working on them and editing them all year.  You don't have to limit applying yourself to one college or program, but apply for multiple, so that if you don't get accepted into one you will hopefully إن شاء الله get accepted into another.  I have to say again that the essays are the most important, you have to really really really focus on it, as it is the most important part of the application.	1642237341.0	hsqu712	t3_s3ollp	t3_s3ollp	/r/Egypt/comments/s3ollp/شباب_حد_عنده_فكره_لو_حابب_اسافر_اتعلم_برمجه_في/hsqu712/

Many people experience similar struggles, and there are resources available to help. During a crisis, you might feel like things will never change. Contacting a mental health crisis hotline is a good way to begin reaching out for much-needed support. But if you are afraid that you or someone you know might hurt   themselves or someone else, please call 122/123 immediately. If you have, or believe you may have, a mental health problem, it is helpful to talk about these issues with others. Should you call the hotline?  It is normal to feel nervous before calling someone you don’t know on a mental help hotline, but the people staff at mental health hotlines have extensive experience talking to people just like you. Everything you say to them is private and confidential—you don’t even have to give them your name if you don’t want to. Please remember, The strongest people are not those who show strength in front of the world, but it’s those who fight the battle you have no idea about. You are not your illness, you have a  name, a history, and a story to tell. Staying yourself is just a part of the battle. Mental illness doesn’t change you. You are still who you were, you are not alone.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if you manage to clean all the streets in one night, people will still trash the streets and they’ll come back as they were. So it’s actually about educating the people and individual responsibility.  I personally believe it’s also our individual responsibility to educate people around us, cuz I swear I know a lot of “educated people” who still throw trash in the streets. So it’s more about awareness than education.  What the government can do though is to fine the arse off of people if they catch them doing it.

4vao1m4f	People will come now scream about "whataboutism" and what's not. If those countries believe in those same standards they preach us why don't they adhere to it themselves? It's because they *know* they can't completely apply it. France preaches about human rights yet look at how they treat their muslims and look at how their police treats their citizens during protests i.e. The yellow vests protests. I don't even have to speak about the US and its countless grave human rights violations from Guantanamo Bay to their treatment of blacks to committing war crimes and collapsing entire countries for the protecting their interests.   You know what could be great? These countries facing some accountability for their violation of human rights. Otherwise, it's just hot air they say to satisfy their people on our expense. Even the utopic scandinavian countries harass and disrespect their refugees, muslims and Islamic symbols, if they tell us "well, you're no better with the way you treat atheists", will we then have the right of calling this "whataboutism" and avoid accountability like them? Not by any means.  Another dimension to this whole issue is the capability to withstand civil disobedience and crippled public services that results from crowding, if millions of french people did a demonstration, the country could afford it. On the other hand, if Egyptians exercised their right to protest forcibly the whole country will be paralyzed, especially with how dense Cairo is and especially how poor we are. That's without mentioning the whole Muslim Brotherhood issue. I personally know many protestors who organized demonstrations that got their demands met or at least had been listened to. But we don't respect the law of protest (which is taken from the french law by the way).	1642245439.0	hsr4v4q	t3_s3qzvz	t3_s3qzvz	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hsr4v4q/

j8wzn	Short answer: Education and personality. What was said in the comments are right though, people will not throw trash if the street is clean, they will if it's already dirty.  Long(er) answer: People don't believe the country is "theirs" as they have before, or on a more deep level, they don't see any benefit of treating "public" assets well. People treat public places abroad as something that is shared and should be taken care of for the good of the people. This feeling / thought does not extend in Egypt any longer. People see it was a service being given for free (or cheap) that they will use till it is no longer usable then they will move on to the next. People don't see the public domain as "theirs" any more.  Rich areas basically afford to keep their areas clean, and can pay money to make sure it's kept spotless. Poorer ones can't, and one they fall into disarray, it keeps getting worse. A pile of trash only grows from that point.	1642245992.0	hsr5m1h	t3_s4cc8u	t3_s4cc8u	/r/Egypt/comments/s4cc8u/nonegyptian_here_who_just_visited_i_want_to_get/hsr5m1h/

967hfqh2	I agree for Lybia and post 2001 Iraq  Little nuance however. Was the West™️ supposed to let ISIS do as they pleased in Syria and Iraq?  I understand that the Arab world is fed up with Western influence. But you have to be coherent in what you want from us.  If the West™️ intervenes and bombs cities, we are violent narcissistic neocolonialists destroying Arab lives and prosperity   If the West™️ doesn't intervene, everyone goes "nObOdy cArEs aBoUt uS aNd lEtS uS DiE".    Remember when the US retired from Afghanistan only for it to fall to the Talibans again immediately (lmao) ? I saw people from the Afghanistan subreddit wailing that "the world doesn't care about us". Bruh the US literally sank billions in aid to prevent Taliban from taking over again what are you talking about   Same for French intervention in the Sahel region against Boko Haram. Malians are irate at the French military presence as if we were White devils there to colonize them again.   Unironically I believe Trump was right ; we should keep our resources to ourselves instead of interfering with every country as if we were the world police. Ever since the Korean War the West keeps creating even bigger messes each time they want to "fix" a situation by force, but our leaders have yet to learn a lesson...   I also do believe there is a neocolonialist aspect in the idea that the West™️ has a moral obligation to "rescue" other countries ; we should just cut the cord clean and let y'all sort your shit out between yourselves, however bloody it might get. It worked out for ourselves decades ago.   Just to be clear again even if Arab countries do have recurring issues with Human rights on their own soil, I do agree with Sisi in regards to George W. Bush and French Georges W. Bush.	1642246714.0	hsr6lj9	t3_s3qzvz	t3_s3qzvz	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hsr6lj9/

hvtmxybx	I was born in Canada and thank God my father brought us to live in Egypt for our teenage years before moving back. I learned good conservative values and the goodness of our deen. It’s too bad that you moved to the west for those critical years in which you were taught, and believed, that perverted lifestyles are cool and that there’s nothing wrong with them. It’s okay to deviate a little from the straight path and I can accept things like drinking, smoking up and having casual relationships with members of the opposite sex. But accepting full blown rainbow and other perverted lifestyles is where I draw the line. I’m too coolheaded to really speak out about it and so I sometimes appreciate hotheads who do. We need them to defend the faiths and culture of our land. That’s how I see it.	1642249362.0	hsrabmr	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hsniyx1	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsrabmr/

hvtmxybx	Atheists and LGBT deserve to be treated humanely but should not be allowed to be activists for their “cause”. Sometimes we need to take a harsh stance when there are people (enemies of the state) that are trying to spread perverted ideologies and poisoned our society.   Egypt’s religious culture goes way back thousands of years. If you don’t like it I urge you to find somewhere else to live.

1hmd3y1	LGBT and atheists don’t have a cause. They just want to be allowed to exist peacefully without being jailed or attacked. Nobody is trying to spread any ideology. If it was that easy to change people’s minds, why am I still gay after only being exposed to straight people most of my life? Because it doesn’t work that way. Atheists don’t care about converting people either.   It’s ridiculous that you think people with different ideas than you are “enemies of the state” (which I can’t really blame you for because that’s how you were raised) but don’t you think it would be more beneficial for us as a country to focus on improving our healthcare, education, quality of life, there are SO MANY THINGS we can focus and work on instead of what people like to do in their bedrooms and if they believe in God or not.   Just an FYI, ancient Egypt has a few records of gay relationships in royalty. Medieval Islamic Egypt was known to be a lot less strict than other Islamic countries, and they tolerated LGBT more than modern Egypt. Lastly, homoerotic narratives were popular across the Muslim world in the 8th century.

770yha13	Bro this whole sub talking about "if we wuz hooman rites we would b developet and sheeitt" human rights are important, but for me fixing the economy/jobs/ridding of poverty and slums are 100x more important, Tunisia has been a democratic, free country for a decade, India is also free, and they are still flawed as hell, mainly because it is easy for corrupt politicans to take power in developing countries, and Egypt objectively is doing better than the previous 2 I mentioned.  What I am saying that "democracy" doesnt automatically solve our problems, infact it might cause more problems since it is easy to fool people like Egyptians to receive power, and even if we do 'democratic' elections right now then the military/Muslim Brotherhood will 200% win, which both you all hate and despise.  And what the guy said is right, those countries who self proclaim themselves as "human right warriors" dont give 2 shits about you, they are just looking for their interests.	1642257008.0	hsro7m7	t3_s3qzvz	t3_s3qzvz	/r/Egypt/comments/s3qzvz/an_ouch_response_about_the_reality_of_human/hsro7m7/

8t68a	انا كنت جامعة عين شمس بس انا كنت نظام القديم بتاع ٦ سنين و سنة امتياز. دلوقتي النظام اتغير بقي ٥+٢ 'في عين شمس علي الاقل مش متأكد من القصر العيني'. من ناحية الامتحانات عين شمس اصعب من القصر العيني، بس الصعوبة دي جهزتني كويس لمذاكرة الامتحنات بتاعة المعادلة. بس لو هنتكلم بالحق القصر العيني اسم اكبر من عين شمس فليها prestige اكبر شوية صغيرة. بالنسبة لسكن الطلبة بتاع الجامعات الحكومية نصيحة بلاش، اكرملك اجري شقة مع نفسك قريب من الجامعة حتي لو معاكي roommate تعرفيها، سكن الطلبة عاما من صحابي/صحباتي اللي كانوا فيه كلهم طفشوا بعد سنة اولي و اجروا شقق مع نفسهم عشان معفن علي حسب كلامهم.  من الاخر لو بتفكري تكملي تعليم/شغل برا فمش هتفرق شهادة دي او دي مش معترف بيها و لازم تعملي معادلة حتي عشان تسافري الخليج	1642257560.0	hsrpf4o	t3_s4kc12	t3_s4kc12	/r/Egypt/comments/s4kc12/طب_القصر_العيني_و_لا_عين_شمس/hsrpf4o/

hvtmxybx	I was your age once. I was a badass kid who felt trapped in Egypt. Hated the fact that I couldn’t drink, smoke up, grow my hair long, etc and when I came back to Canada I was ecstatic. Finally I can do whatever I want. A year later, when the honeymoon was over I started to look around and realize that this was not what I wanted. We did bad things cuz we were kids with lots of energy and wanted to express ourselves. We realized what we were doing was wrong. That was the real appeal to be honest. It was fun to do because it was rebellious. But when you’re in Canada and all those things are the norm you realize that people are lost, living perverted lifestyles in a perverted society that is rotting and decaying with no structure or morals or ethics.	1642258363.0	hsrr6jv	t3_s3w3wh	t1_hsrpso8	/r/Egypt/comments/s3w3wh/why_do_egyptians_intrude_on_others_lives/hsrr6jv/

They narrow people in one direction repeating over and over same recipe  ( nationalism is bad, whataboutism , Human rights, no hope , Rabaa, Tiran.. ) keep killing hope in every one.   What you say about democracy is to great extent true that it can be easily manipulated. Like those who elected Morsi then stayed the night in tents calling him to resign before Muslim Brotherhood boys storm them killing, beating, robbing, assaulting them in Etehadeya to keep Morsi in chair. They were THE peaceful protesters.

"اعتبر (دكتاتور مسك مصر ٣٠ سنة و عايش في قصور) زي ابوك" كانت جملة غير مفهومة بالنسبالي ، يرددها ناس بتعاني من الفقر شارك فيه هذا الدكتاتور. الخ.   الفردية، زي ما كتبت في كومنت تاني، انه الشوارع تبقي مليانه زبالة و زي الزفت بس البيوت نظيفة. يعني في زل القمع الي احنا عايشين فيه، ممكن النظام يسمح باننا نتكلم علي الموضوع ده، و يكون في جهود شعبية للتخلص من المشكلة دي، بس تحس طز، مادام بيتي تمام. بحس المواضيع دي بتاخد حيز اكتر من اهتمام شعوب تانية.	1642267762.0	hsse71c	t3_s4nszu	t1_hssbvuq	/r/Egypt/comments/s4nszu/اختار_اسوء_خصلة_فينا_كمصرين/hsse71c/

Passed by Mirtimash, Faverin, Effexor, Tegretol and Moodapex, nothing worked for me just suffered from side effects and withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing any med . Brintellix is the the only medication on which I've actually felt an improvement, both physiological and psychological.

bxrt0ux5	النقطة الاولانية مش متفق معاك بصراحة - لأسباب تاريخية موضوعية يطول شرحها بس هحاول اختصر حاجات و اتجاوز غيرها :   اظن اننا مينفعش ننسى اننا ابناء و احفاد مباشرين ل ناس فعلا همومها مكانتش لا ديمقراطيه و لا تمثيل سياسي و لا تداول سلطات و لا احزاب و لا غيره . احنا اباءنا و اجدادنا المباشرين نفسهم ( الاب و الجد المباشر ، يعني الأب و اللي ربوه و الأم و اللى ربوها ) دول ناس عاشوا احتلال أشكال و الوان مرة من ده و مرة من ده و مرة هزيمة ع مرة انتصار ع مرة وعكة سياسية ع محاولة نهضة نجحت ف اولها بعدين اتعطلت على اضطراب مجتمعي و صراع احزاب و جماعات على السلطة و قايمة طويلة . مين ماسك الحكم و احزابنا ايه و توجهاتها ايه دي كانت آخر هموم اللي ربونا - ده لو كانت من همومهم . ف مش مفاجأة انهم ياخدوا المواقف دي ، انت كده بتحكم ع ابناء منظومة من عصر فات لكن بمعايير العصر الحالي ، و دى حسبة مش هتمشي .     >بس انا شخصيا بحس التعريص في مصر فريد من نوعه. الدفاع المستميت عن الحاكم من غير ما يكون في اي مصلحة راجعة للشخص، بتبقى مثيرة للاهتمام  دى برضك مظنش اتفق معك ، فيه بلاد لسه بيبوسوا ايادي الملك و بيقسموا الولاء للحاكم قبل ما يقسموا الولاء للعلم و الوطن ، و مش هقول لك ميقدروش يشتموا الحاكم ف جرنال انما حرفيا ميقدروش ينتقدوا و لو حتى قرار له . احنا بالنسبة لبلاد تانيه ( و مش قليله اوى كمان ) واحة لحرية التعبير و الحريات الفردية ، و اكيد مش هنختلف ان هامش الحرية عندنا ف تناول الشخصيات ذوي المناصب مش اعلى حاجة ف الدنيا يعني مش هتطلع تشتم وزير و لا رئيس ب اهله اه و مش هتعمل عليه كرتون ساخر ، لكن انتقاد القرارات و الاجراءات موجود عادي ف الشارع قبل النت حتى ، الخ .   عن نفسي شخصيا شايف ان ال1% اللى فعلا لهم مصلحة ف التعريص ( عشان لو معرصش هينضر جامد ) و ال1% التانيين اللى لهم مصلحة ف الشتيمة عالفاضي - اللي هو الوجه الآخر للتعريص طبعا و مش هياكلوا عيش من غير الشتيمة عالفاضي - مينفعش يلغوشوا علينا تفكيرنا ف انه فيه 98% من الناس فعلا ملهاش مصلحة عائدة عليهم ف اي رأي يقولوه . و إلا بكده نشتم اي حد معجب بالسيسي مثلا عشان اصل الاعلامي الفولاني كمان معجب بيه ، او نسب لأهالي اي حد مش معجب بيه لأنه اصل مناضل الفيسبوك فولان الفولاني اللى بيقبض من دولة اجنبيه مش معجب بالسيسي ف اكيد هؤلاء و اولئك و كل الناس لهم مصلحة ف انهم يقولوا الرأي س أو الرأي ص .    اللى اقصده : ابسط زيارة للقهاوي البلدي و الشارع العادي و مقابلة الناس العادية تماما اللي بتصحى م النوم تشتغل بعدين يروحوا البيت يناموا عشان يصحوا فايقين للشغل تاني و اراؤهم ملهاش اي توظيف محتمل دي ناس اغلبية كاسحة اكتر مما نتخيل . كل ما فيها ان ال2% المذكورين اعلاه صوتهم عالى و ظهورهم باين عن الناس ال98% العاديين .   أما بخصوص ال30 سنة حكم ، ف هتلاقي برضك ان اباءنا و امهاتنا و اللي ربوهم هم ناس عاشوا فترة كان حاكم مصر فيها بيورث السلطة و نظام الحكم اصلا بيشرعن انه يفضل على العرش لغايه ما يموت . ف دى جزئية مش بقدر اتجاوزها فعلا ، احنا بنتكلم ف امور مكانتش مطروحة اساسا على طاولة اي نقاشات للجيل اللي ربانا ( و ده كان مقبول ايامهم و كل الاعراف و منظومتهم القيمية متماشية مع ده و منسجمة معاه و بتفانكشن ف اطار حياتهم و افكارهم عادي ، مفيش اي عيب ف كده ) .   ف اه ، 30 سنة ف الحكم مش هتمثل لهم اي حاجة مدهشة .   &#x200B;  بخصوص نقطة النضافة اتفق معك ، اعلاء الذات ف ظل تجاهل المصلحة العامة آفة صعبة . بشوف مثال حي على ده ، يعنى مثلا فيه ناس مستاءة م العاصمة الجديدة فقط و **فقط** عشان مشتروش عقار ولا ارض هناك ف هو مش حاسس انه طلع ب فايدة ، و بالمنطق ده احنا بنبرر ان اللى ساكن ف ارقى مناطق العاصمة كذلك يحقد على اللى اخدوا الاقساط الميسرة ف مشاريع الاسكان الاجتماعي : ماهو ايش معنى هو اللى يسكن ببلاش بلابلابلاه و انا بدفع 6000 جنيه قسط او ايجار شقة ؟ سؤال منطقي جدا لو اعتمدنا الطريقة القاصرة دى م التفكير ، و ندخل بقى دايرة مفرغة من ال انا-مركز-المجموعة-الشمسية-كل-الكون-يدور-حواليا .	1642272243.0	hsspspt	t3_s4nszu	t1_hsse71c	/r/Egypt/comments/s4nszu/اختار_اسوء_خصلة_فينا_كمصرين/hsspspt/

16wgj5	Usually, there is no legal issue regarding any of this. The stray Dogs too are very adaptable and know well where to find food.  As for the problem that may actually rise is that those men may report you falsely as harassing people by raising Dogs in this particular area. There may have been problems before regarding rabid dog attacks in that area so in this case, the police may send City Hall to take the dogs away.  The latter scenario may actually come true if one of those men has what we call "wasta" to pull some favors with some officer.  But that's just my grim opinion. In most of the time, you can just be a good person and keep doing what you're doing.	1642438651.0	ht22r4f	t3_s64tuu	t3_s64tuu	/r/Egypt/comments/s64tuu/a_pair_of_egyptians_are_threatening_to_call_the/ht22r4f/

About the area, now I checked it is very close to the Bibliotheca of Alexandria (مكتبة الإسكندرية) so apparently i wont face problems	1642438721.0	ht22xpu	t3_s63d59	t1_ht20rwp	/r/Egypt/comments/s63d59/cant_decide_whether_i_should_go_to_egypt_to/ht22xpu/

11069z	Absolutely my pleasure. Maybe it will be worth it to ask in the Greek Community and maybe you can try to call the [local education administration](https://alex-edu.com/wast.html) (based on the school location I think they follow this administration) (+20 03-3925624) to confirm what will be needed to join high school and if there are any tests needed (this is a longshot tho because they only speak Arabic and they are genuinely stupid (from personal experience) but maybe they can help, just be patient and try to explain as slow as you can).  To confirm if you can go to college in Greece with Thanaweya Amma, I think it would be best to ask the university you're interested in directly and maybe the Egyptian consulate because they might have some students who try the same thing.

crzuln8j	Hey, that's so exciting that you are thinking about traveling to Egypt!  Egypt is a place that is very hospitable to solo travelers, because local people are so kind and friendly, and other travelers usually are keen to meet others during their trip. I think you would enjoy your trip most if you stick to larger cities (Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria, Aswan) or go to smaller cities where there is a large backpacking community (Dahab) and you can meet people by staying in hostels/group hotels.  It does not matter if you do not read or write Arabic at all, and yes, you will definitely meet people in Egypt willing to show you around!  I have a YouTube channel with lots of free resources like how to take public transit in Egypt and where to go. You can check it out at [www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel) if you are interested!

crzuln8j	Hey there, you could continue with your trip as usual, as there have not been any announced restrictions or disruptions. Covid in Egypt is largely ignored (for better or worse), and you should not face any roadblocks to having a great trip in Egypt, unless someone in your group happens to test positive while in Egypt.  Have a wonderful trip!	1642441111.0	ht297kn	t3_s339wj	t3_s339wj	/r/Egypt/comments/s339wj/good_time_to_visit/ht297kn/
crzuln8j	Hey there! I entered Egypt in November, 2021, using just my proof of vaccination with a QR code. You can check out the video of the process here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u56fK2wtHLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u56fK2wtHLY)  I have clients as recently as January 2022 (beginning of this month) enter without a PCR. I still recommend having a PCR \*just in case\*, but if you do not mind taking a small risk, you should be fine to enter without one.	1642441220.0	ht29hyd	t3_s3vvrf	t3_s3vvrf	/r/Egypt/comments/s3vvrf/entry_at_cairo_airport/ht29hyd/

crzuln8j	On a basic level, here is what I recommend. If you have any specific interests, let us know, and then we can make more cogent recommendations for you.  \-Take public transportation (metro, microbuses, public buses)  \-Go to a local ahwa in a local area, away from tourists  \-Go to a lesser-visited city, like Port Said, Damietta, Sohag, or Tanta (or others)  \-Stay at a local apartment instead of renting an Airbnb or doing a hotel  [I have a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel) that has lots of videos on taking public transportation, if you are interested. It saves a ton of money, but I do it mostly for the cultural experience.	1642450672.0	ht2yh9p	t3_s4zifc	t3_s4zifc	/r/Egypt/comments/s4zifc/im_visiting_egypt_this_summer_what_are_those/ht2yh9p/

crzuln8j	Hey, so excited you are going to Egypt! Here are my responses, in italics. Also, I have a YouTube channel with tons of videos on travel to Egypt that you can check out: [www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egyptadventurestravel).   Is Uber reliable in the middle of the night? I will be arriving at Borg El Arab Airport in Alex around 3-4 am. Will I be able to find an Uber ride at this hour of the night? Is it safe?  *Yes it is safe, and yes, you will be able to find one.*   Would it be possible for me to purchase a sim card at the airport? Preferably with a good internet and calling plan. Can you guys suggest what the best plan is out there and by which provider?  *I always use Vodafone, but there is also Etisalat and Orange. I usually get a 30gb data package with some minutes for talking and texting, and it is usually about $20. I always get it at Cairo Airport; not sure about HBE, but they probably have it.*   Is tipping customary in Egypt? If yes, usually how much?  *Yes it is, and it totally depends on the scenario.* [I have a blog post that goes over how much to tip and when to tip (or not)](https://egyptadventurestravel.com/blog/tipping-culture-in-egypt)   Is Uber very safe in Egypt for solo travelers? Anything to look out for?  *Yes, Uber is safe. I would watch out for drivers who just drive around and around, never actually arriving to pick you up. If you wait long for a driver, just cancel the ride, pay the fee, and then dispute the fee to get the money back.*   Is google maps a good app to use for navigation? If not, what navigation apps would you recommend?  *Google maps is good, but it will not have the 100% most accurate data on how to get from place to place, especially in Alexandria. There isn't another good option, though, aside from asking locals for directions, which can sometimes be inaccurate!*   Is it better to exchange currency at the Alex Airport or are there better places to do so? Also, is Egypt a cash-based society? How much would be sufficient for a week and a half? Any examples in terms of cost of meals, etc. would do.  *Totally a cash-based society, and you can exchange a little at the airport and then just pull the rest out at ATMs. How much you should bring depends on your budget and travel style. What type of trip are we talking? Staying in hostels? Eating street food?*   Anyone know of a good place to get a COVID test in Cairo? I will have to receive the results within 1-day of departure back to the US. Preferably a facility with quick turnaround for these tests. They can be antigen or PCR tests. My friend mentioned an antigen test at some University in Cairo but we are not sure if it's only reserved for students.  *I have a great service I use--they come to your hotel or Airbnb, do the test, and hand-deliver the results within 6 hours.* [I talk about it in this YouTube video, and the Whatsapp contact info is there too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhXQBZ891tE)   Any experiences or tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!  *My tip is to enjoy Egypt with an open mind and heart! It is a magical place, but it is very different from anywhere else. Be prepared to have your expectations turned upside down, and get ready for some very friendly local Egyptian people.*	1642451122.0	ht2zms4	t3_s5bs7m	t3_s5bs7m	/r/Egypt/comments/s5bs7m/help_a_traveler_out_please/ht2zms4/

ijx2ux7d	Bro, having harder courses or just the same courses as abroad doesn't mean that the educational system is good. I can give you the very small example of the private tutoring and centers, wtf is going on with this country. Schools became nothing but places to take exams in, other than that, they are just empty buildings that no one goes to students or teacher because they get tutored or give tutors. The whole system is fucked in every way you could imagine. And the fault is on parents, teachers, and the government. No one is not guilty from this crime that the newer generation is paying the price for, and the country will continue paying its price until a person like مماليك kidnap children and send them about to study( I am not historically sure who did this), to come back and remake the whole educational system from inside out.	1642452197.0	ht32ep2	t3_s63d59	t1_ht1txis	/r/Egypt/comments/s63d59/cant_decide_whether_i_should_go_to_egypt_to/ht32ep2/

11069z	It was Muhammed Ali. I don't want to get down that rabbit hole but yes I do think having bigger syllables makes our education better (at least when compared to others in the global work market), in my humble unspecialized point of view most of our education problems are financial, the government can't hire enough teacher or build new schools to compensate for the population increase. Last year students increased by 3.8% while the number of teachers decreased by 1.8%, so having private tutors and teachers working more than 10 hours per day in private was inevitable. Besides this I think education is actually improving, students are asked to think about how to answer problems, they are encouraged to create their own algorithms and their exams are open-book so the whole memorizing = success thing is now almost gone. The same is happening in colleges (we still have to memorize shit tho), as now professors are asking us to figure out ways to implement knowledge with real businesses and create our own and they can even support you with money and connections (yes, national free college). So no, I don't think our education system is bad but just critically underfunded.	1642455233.0	ht3a8wj	t3_s63d59	t1_ht32ep2	/r/Egypt/comments/s63d59/cant_decide_whether_i_should_go_to_egypt_to/ht3a8wj/

I don't consider simping to be a valid term for things you consider to be bad, it's a very harmful word to use since it promotes a toxic environment between men and women. Things you would consider to be bad, others would consider them as being polite or civil, the word simp is too broad to tackle such problems. Just focus on the bad behaviors themselves and don't throw these words around.	1642462901.0	ht3t6zc	t3_s6e71w	t1_ht3qrr5	/r/Egypt/comments/s6e71w/layla_wage_gap_fuschia/ht3t6zc/

Oh and the Quran iand prophet Mohammed عليه الصلاة و السلام was one of the first people to defend animal rights, and if only you did a little search on sex slavery you'd be more educated about how Islam treated this subject and how the west did especially that Islam had laws to deal with this issue as it was prevelent at the time same with slavery and how Islam ended racism and slavery while the west only recently managed to get rid of that problem.	1642463675.0	ht3v073	t3_s67hh1	t1_ht2e962	/r/Egypt/comments/s67hh1/discord_server_for_arab_vegans/ht3v073/

2ata1k25	Maybe something related to the mini coup of central police forces that seized the camps and killes their officers. Upon knowing that the army went in and used heavy machine gun fire tonpacify all those inaurgents.   It happened because of the minister of interior at that time "Zaky Badr" who was so good that major crime mafias were helpless in smuggling drugs, weapons and other contraband. So by the help of multiple officials they spread some rumors that the central police forces conscripts would have to serve an extra 2 years as an obligation to finish their conscription period. So these conscripts went ahead and staged the mini coup I am talking about.   I don't have much more information. I googled it and apparently that happened in 1986 not the 70s. So if that's not what you mean then the only thing left that I know of is "The Bread Revolution" "ثورة الجياع" which happened 1977.   احداث الامن المركزى ١٩٨٦ - انتفاصة الخبز ١٩٧٧	1642464447.0	ht3wsp8	t3_s6i79q	t3_s6i79q	/r/Egypt/comments/s6i79q/can_anyone_help_me_with_what_historical_egyptian/ht3wsp8/

5e2qw79r	Because someone promotes rape doesn’t mean they’re all promoting that.  I believe Incel usually means a man who dislikes women and their behaviour and doesnt get in relationships with them either by choice or not by choice due to women not being interested.  And no I wasn’t defending them.   But I believe being a simp feminist is just really bad.  At least incels have some self respect and have rejected women who don’t treat them kindly.  While I believe simps feminists are doormats who have caused a major social disorder when it comes to the dating world.	1642465639.0	ht3zko7	t3_s6e71w	t1_ht3ynu1	/r/Egypt/comments/s6e71w/layla_wage_gap_fuschia/ht3zko7/

According to her most of them are ma2aleb as you said, most of the money in these companies goes out to ads and getting influencers to promote their products which leads to at most mediocre and at worst shit products.

Wether you choose to ignore it or not the country is getting better. Economic growth doesn't happen spontaneously, and the effects definitely don't begin to show in a country that has been through many challenges in it's formation.

1s6hg7kb	It's very limited and might not be as advanced as other countries. I would recommend going for computer engineering as it will enable you to get the best of both worlds. You will be able to work as a pure software engineer, or you can later shift for robotics if you wish. You will have some background about electronics and electrical systems, which you can extend upon if you want to work in that area in robotics. I believe most of the development currently taking place in the robotics field are directed towards computer vision and human-machine interaction, which are pure computer engineering. You will just miss the part about mechanical design.	1642473466.0	ht4i4hb	t3_s6k38w	t3_s6k38w	/r/Egypt/comments/s6k38w/شغل_هندسة_الروبوتات_والحاسبات_موجود_في_مصر/ht4i4hb/

dmrx3yoe	>التضخم زاد ٣٤٪ عن ٢٠٢٠       يسطا ابوس....ايدك, قلي انت بتجيب معلوماتك دي من فين بس.  دي في تركيا دي مش في مصر. مصر اعلى نسبة تضخم في 2020 كان 5.7 باين. وفي 2021 كان 6.7 لما كانت عالية ونزلت ل 5.6 في نفس السنه وده اصلا في عز ازمات التضخم وازمة الحاويات واسعار النفط في العالم كله الخ ومع ذلك اصلا البلد كانت مستعدة والحكومة خدت احتياطاتها عشان الناس كده كده هتلوم الحكومة على اي حاجه. شوف سبحان الله حتى لو خدوا احتياطاتهم برضو هيلاموا.  &#x200B;  middleeasteye محجوبة في مصر ف مش هفتحها.  المقال بتاع الباحث ده مقال متدني. كنت رايح ارد عليه ف مره بس هكتفي واقولك انه مذكرش ان مصر في ازمة كورونا انقذت قطاع السياحة وانقذت عمالة بانها دفعت مرتباتهم واعطت قروض للقطاع السياحي عشان مينهارش خلال الازمة. ومرة تاني. هو بيتكلم عن قطع الدعم و"رفع تكلفة الخدمات" -مش بتترفع. هي كانت مخفضة والدولة كانت شايلة التكلفة ودلوقتي الدولة بتشيل التخفيض ده- وبيقول ان الدولة بتبني ال "واو بروجكتس" وسايبه المواطن الغلبان ياعيني. وكأن مثلا سياسات الدعم او تموين وتمويل الارانب اللي عندنا في البلد دي, سياسات مستدامة.  زي ما قلت. نمو الصين كان قريب من نمو مصر. السبب ان المصريين لسه في فقر مدقع هو انهم بيخلفوا بغباء ويقولك كل طفل بيجي برزقه.  &#x200B;  وبالمناسبة حتى القطاع الاقتصادي غير الرسمي استفاد من الحكومة خلال كورونا. الحكومة كانت بتدفع فلوس للناس اللي عندها عدم استقرار وظيفي وغيره وجهزت حزم دعم. الناس قدمت عليها ولالا معرفش. بس هي حقيقي واللي كان بيقدم كان بيسلتم.

It has been 6 years since i finished these tests and let me tell you all of this is just a small part of your life.  I'm not trying to give you negative vibes but rather as the kind people above have mentioned, rabna yeyaserlek inshallah and you do amazing in them but even if u didn't, mosh moshkelah it's not the end of the world.

xyx5i	One time a guy called me and insisted that i'm manal (or was it mona?) the guy was always drunk and used to call me over 40 times a day, at first i thought it was a prank played by my friends but the sheer persistence he had told me he wasn't simply a troll.  I've had a pretty deep voice back then and there's no way anyone would confuse me for a woman, as a matter of fact, when i tried to pretend to be a woman for the lolz he'd insult me and ask me to get manal back on the phone, after a week of him being annoying and me costing him hours (i used to answer and leave the phone, he'd never end the call) i had the bright idea of telling him i changed my number, then i gave him the number of a guy i didn't like.  He repeated pretty much the same exact scenario with the guy, always calling, leaving him 40+ missed calls a day, eventually he passed him on to another dude, we have no idea who the hell he was, "true caller" didn't exist back then, he's probably someone who was obsessed with a manal and he just hung onto whomever he thought was "manal", never got closure on that.  Or he was a bored troll with a LOT of money.	1642495309.0	ht5lhfs	t3_s6jy2h	t3_s6jy2h	/r/Egypt/comments/s6jy2h/whats_the_creepiestweirdest_phone_call_or_text/ht5lhfs/

They check the pcr test in the baggage counter and again right before boarding the plane. Also i dont think anyone has tried to fly with a positive test in hand cause that will get you in trouble since you would have been supposed to be isolating and not going to the airport. I think that if you are found to have covid at the airport itself they will isolate you in the airport hotel "le meridien" not sure if you will pay for it or nah.	1642506405.0	ht5zku0	t3_s6vggo	t3_s6vggo	/r/Egypt/comments/s6vggo/what_happens_to_asymptomatic_tourists_who_test/ht5zku0/

It is true that whatever little rain that falls there could be put to better use by the local communities than torrenting the coastal areas, but it won't be enough for planting the desert per se.

VPN  >المقال بتاع الباحث ده مقال متدني. كنت رايح ارد عليه ف مره بس هكتفي واقولك انه مذكرش ان مصر في ازمة كورونا انقذت قطاع السياحة وانقذت عماله بانها دفعت مرتباتهم واعطت قروض للقطاع السياحي عشان مينهارش خلال الازمة. ومرة تاني. هو بيتكلم عن قطع الدعم و"رفع تكلفة الخدمات" -مش بتترفع. هي كانت مخفضة والدولة كانت شايلة التكلفة ودلوقتي الدولة بتشيل التخفيض ده- وبيقول ان الدولة بتبني ال "واو بروجكتس" وسايبه المواطن الغلبان ياعيني. وكأن مثلا سياسات الدعم او تموين وتمويل الارانب اللي عندنا في البلد دي, سياسات مستدامة.   أيوة يعني كذب؟  طيب مش واجب الدولة التخفيف عن المواطنين؟  وتأتي هاتقول ارانب ههاقوللك اليابان.  والدعم ده مش بيروح لمستحقيه بس ويمكن مش كل المستحقين بياخدوه كمان ولا الدعم ده رايح للكل؟  وده من ضرائب الناس ولا من لحم كتاف الريس وبيمن علينا؟  >وبالمناسبة حتى القطاع الاقتصادي غير الرسمي استفاد من الحكومة خلال كورونا. الحكومة كانت بتدفع فلوس للناس اللي عندها عدم استقرار وظيفي وغيره وجهزت حزم دعم. الناس قدمت عليها ولالا معرفش. بس هي حقيقي واللي كان بيقدم كان بيسلتم. https://unsdg.un.org/sites/default/files/2020-08/EGY_Socioeconomic-Response-Plan_2020.pdf  >​  ماتقول كانوا كام وكام واحد استفاد والفائدة كانت تذكر اصلا؟  وراح اخد من مرتبات الموظفين من الناحية التانية عشان كورونا برضو.  وكنت سمعت أن ترامب كان قال إن مصر خدت معونات لكورونا وصرفتها في حاجات تانية.  >فالنهاية احب اقولك ان الحكومة لسه بتقدم حاجات كتير جدا مدعمة زي الاسكان الاجتماعي مثلا واسكان الشباب إلخ. الدولة لسه قدامها مشوار طويل عشان تبقى دولة رأسمالية بجد. الناس بتعيط وخلاص عشان اغلبهم مش عاجبة الوضع السياسي. لكن الحقيقه هي ان مفيش اي حكومة مش هتتخذ اجراءات مماثلة. واللي هيتمن*ك وميعملش كده هيبقى بيعمل سياسات مش مستدامة وبيرفع الديون اكتر كمان كله عشان يعالج اعراض الفقر وميعالجش الفقر نفسه.  ده كده حاجات كتير جدا؟  طيب سكن مبني بفلوس الشعب رايح للشعب.  >ومره تاني من الاسباب الرئيسية للفقر في مصر نمو السكان المتخلف عقليا.  >العدالة الاجتماعية ضعيفة وده حقيقي بس ده مش عشان في فقرا. ده بسبب ان لسه في فساد وابن الباشا يطلع باشا وابن دكتور الجامعة يغش ويطلع زي ابوه برضو -ودي حاجه انا بشوفها بعيني-.  يا ربي على ام الشماعة دي.  وابن رئيس الجمهورية بيبقى في الرقابة الإدارية والمخابرات وصهره مستشار وهشام جنينة يتحبس!	1642512676.0	ht69u3e	t3_s69i6r	t1_ht5dqnc	/r/Egypt/comments/s69i6r/egypts_gdp_is_expected_to_record_54_average/ht69u3e/

dmrx3yoe	>ده كلامي انا ولا الموازنة؟ ومعلش رد ادينا بنتكلم وبنتعلم من بعض  طيب هات الموازنة اللي بتقول كده. لإن احنا لو بندفع 80% من ايراداتنا للديون يبقى احنا كده في فخ الدين والعالم كله هينتظر سقوطنا زي ما كان منتظر سقوط اليونان.  ولو كنت قريت المقال اللي انت نفسك بعته بتاع rober springحاجه ده كنت هتعرف حجم الكارثة اللي العالم هيعيشها لو مصر انهارت لدرجة ان الباحث بيطرح السؤال "Is Egypt too big to fail? Or rather, too big to be allowed to fail?"  الدول العظمي مش هتسمح لمصر انها تنهار اصلا. تبعات حاجه زي دي هتبقى كارثية لدرجة ان احتلالنا ممكن تكون تبعياته للغرب والاتحاد الاوروبي اهون من سقوطنا.  >حاضر احنا نقفل مصانع ونبطل نصرف على صحة أو تعليم ونغلي الاسعار ونرفع الضرائب والرسوم عشان البنية التحتية اللي انا مش شايفها دي يعني اسكندرية لسة غرقانة من شهر والاسمرات برضو ولا ده مش تبع البنية التحتية؟       المصانع بتتبني عادي جدا والصادرات المصرية بتزيد كل سنة. وبتتنوع كمان.   ده غير طبعا الدعم الحكومي للصناعات [https://enterprise.press/stories/2019/12/05/egypt-launches-egp-100-bn-program-to-boost-local-industry-7831/](https://enterprise.press/stories/2019/12/05/egypt-launches-egp-100-bn-program-to-boost-local-industry-7831/)  \+ الدعم اللي الحكومة قدمته في فترة الكورونا وده تقدر تقرأ عنه في المقالات اللي انا بعتها قبل كده عن تجربة التعافي الاقتصادي المصرية.  البنية التحتية اه لازم نستثمر فيها وقلتلك ان الاستثمار في الصحة والتعليم بيزيد. السكان ببساطة كتير فشخ ومحتاجين اكتر من كده بكتير. وانت متقدرش تزود الاستثمارات بالحجم المطلوب ده. اقولك ايه تاني؟ انا لو عليا فانا عاوز الحكومة تخصخص كل الدنيا دي كلها وتشيل الضرايب اللي بتتاخد عشان القطاعات دي وتبقى الحكومة بتبنى الطرق وتدافع عن البلد وبس كده. عشان الناس تريحها شويتين وتبطل ام جو نظريات المؤامرة ده وتتحمل عواقب افعالها. واللي معاه فلوس ياخد خدمة يدفع. اللي ممعهوش ميدفعش ومياخدش. ومش بيدفع للحكومة ضرايب على القطاعات دي عشان يسألها على حاجة.  &#x200B;  >حضرتك مش مستفيد منه انت حر بس في ناس حرفيا عايشة على شوية العيش والتموين وياريتهم كفاية اصلا.   انا مالي بيهم اصلا؟ انا واحد مرتبي مش هيعدي ال3000 جنيه وهدفع مواصلات وتأمين وخرا وهجيب اكلي وشربي ومش عاوز ادفع ضرايب تروح للناس دي في تموين ولا في حاجة. انا مليش دعوة بيهم. انا مرتبي يادوب اد كده. والناس كلها على الحال ده يعتبر والدولة نفسها اصلا كده. وحتى ايام ما كان في تموين ودعم كاملين كان برضو في فقر.  رفع الدعم او التموين مش هم سبب الفقر. في فقرا كتير في مصر عشان ركود اقتصادي وعشان البلد فقيره. تروح انت منطور فلوس البلد على عيش وزيت مجاني؟ طب ما تعمل بنية تحتية وتبني طرق ومدارس وغيرها وتوظف الناس دي وتدفعلهم مرتبات وهم بيبنوها؟ -زي ما بيحصل دلوقتي بالفعل رغم ان لسه التموين والدعم ما اترفعوش-  &#x200B;  >    الصين رجعت شجعت السكان انهم يخلفوا تاني وبعدين ما عندك اليابان مثال. دولة منهارة طالعة من حرب وقنبلتين نوويتين وتعدادها تضاعف ودولة متطورة وده كله في كام سنة بس. دولة عايشة على ٣٪ من مساحتها وعندها كنوز في الأرض عكس اليابان.        شوف لو دول كلهم اتعلموا واشتغلوا ايه اللي هايحصل.  اليابان من اول الستينات كان معدل نمو سكانها اقل من 1.3% لحد السبعينات كان في سنه او سنتين وصل 2% وبعد كده قعد ينزل لحد ما بقى تحت ال 1% سنة 1977 وفضل في النازل كل سنه على اخر التمانينات كان 0.4 واخر التسعينات كان 0.183 وعلى 2009 كان النمو بالسالب. نمو السكان.  الصين رجعت تشجع الناس على الولاده بعد ما كانت خلاص رفعت مستوى معيشتهم. مش اثناء ما كانوا لسه فقراء.  يا سيدي الفاضل انا متفهم موقفك المتفائل من حوار ان عندك سكان كتير وقوة عاملة وبتاع إلخ. بس ده مش حقيقي. ده كله وهم. لازم الناس دي تكون متعلمة وعندها مبادئ وعندها وطنية. مش ناس اصلا متربية على ان البلد سارقاها ومتربية على خدمة اقاربها ولا ناس قريتها وان المواطن التاني ميعرفوهوش. الفساد في البلد دي في كل حارة وشارع وبيت. اي حد عنده منصب يقدر يجامل من خلاله معارفه, بيجاملهم على حساب المواطن التاني الغرب. والاغلبية العظمى من السكان شايفين البلد سارقاهم وده مش حاجه غلط بنسبة 100% لان في فساد ومحسوبية طبعا وناس بتنهب فلوس البلد. لكن ده مش السبب الرئيسي فضياع البلد والسبب ده اصلا الشعب كله مشارك فيه لإن الشعب كله من غير وعي بيمارس نوع من انواع الفساد.  &#x200B;  بالنسبة للهند اللي هي شبهنا جدا جدا جدا, الهند ما طبقتش سياسة فرض اجهاض مثلا زي الصين. ومعدل سكانها فضل زي ما هو طبيعي. وادي الهند النهارده افقر من مصر اصلا. اما الصين لما اجبرت الناس تخلف طفل واحد بس -وده كان غلط على المدى البعيد. المفروض كانوا يبقوا طفلين مع خيار طفل اضافي-, بقى الاباء عندهم وقت فاضي يشتغلوا فيه اكتر او يدرسوا فيه اكتر وبالتالي انتاجية الفرد زادت وعدد الموظفين زادوا.  اما انت هنا في مصر اقل من 40% من الشعب اصلا بيعمل. الباقي عيال او ربات بيوت او عواطلية. انت متخيل ان 40% من الشعب بس بيصرف على بقية الشعب؟ والعجائز نسبتهم قليله وتكاد لا تذكر في مصر. ونسبة البطالة اقل من 10% يعني اقل من نص الشعب بيصرف على الشعب كله.  المانيا عندها بتاع 78% والولايات المتحدة بتاع 60%.  &#x200B;  >    حبيبي؟ طيب        انا قلت لك اللي قاله الوزير للناس والارقام الحقيقية اللي في الموازنة (وايه اللي مش بتتلاعب؟ اجيب لك ارقام كورونا من جوة؟ لما كانوا بيكتبوا وفيات كورونا حاجات تانية)        وأنه إنفاق اللي زاد ما تصلي على النبي الفصول مش فيه تخت والمستشفيات مش فيها سراير ومافيش تعيين يبقى الانفاق رايح فين بقى؟        وجايب فاروق الباز واليوم السابع طيب ما تجيب البرادعي اللي واخد نوبل؟        انا مش كاره بس لنا تجيب كلام متناقض مع الواقع يبقى المشكلة مش عندي  حوار التعيين ده بالاتفاق مع البنك الدولي. ان يتم وقف سياسة التعيين لبعض الوقت. ودي سياسة شابوه جدا الصراحه. موظفين الدولة دول كلهم خرا.  ده مش معناه ان مفيش انفاق زيادة. في مئات المدارس والمستشفيات الجديدة اللي اتبنت وتقدر تشوف كام من دول اتبنوا في محافظتك. انا عندي في حجات كتير جديدة اتبنت وفي مركز بحث علمي كمان بيتبني وانا شايفه بنفسي كل ما اروح الجامعة.  ولما طلع صورة لمدرسة كان فيها تكدس او كده الحكومة تدخلت وشافت حل. ومرة تاني بقولك ان موظفين الحكومة دول اصلا ناس مش كفاءة وزيادة عن اللازم. الحكومة المفروض تسرحهم اصلا وتخصخص الحاجات دي والقطاع الخاص يوظف الناس بناء على الكفاءة واللي يكسل ولا يهمل يتطرد ويجي مكانه واحد يستحق المكان.	1642513728.0	ht6bz0w	t3_s69i6r	t1_ht68biy	/r/Egypt/comments/s69i6r/egypts_gdp_is_expected_to_record_54_average/ht6bz0w/

bks33tex	AFAIK, it's a mix of both. There's a bit of Monopoly when it comes to car importing and distribution.  I don't see why the government should intervene at all with that whole scheme, people are STILL buying cars at ridiculous prices, the government gets taxes/fees on every car sold, and the distributors/importers make money which then the government taxes.   The only losers here imo are the people, but we also lack the willpower to boycott the car market, so nothing will be changed for now.	1642514439.0	ht6dhqf	t3_s6vj3d	t1_ht69xd7	/r/Egypt/comments/s6vj3d/just_crashed_and_this_is_to_all_fellow_drivers/ht6dhqf/

Anyways, I participated in my school's awa el al talaba last year and plan on doing that this year too,you can get national recognition there if you go hard enough.  You could also see if any cultural centers around you host activities for you(I know the french culture center in my city hosts language activities) Also,volunteer work is on the table if you want something for your college cv. So basically: 1-Languge courses by universities near you 2-awa el el talaba 3-activities in your local cultural center 4-volunteer work  Also make sure to generally read high caliber books and mature your personality and social abilities as to generally be able to leave good impressions,I unironically practice my conversation abilities on taxi drivers when I sit with them.	1642515567.0	ht6fyai	t3_s6wt06	t1_ht67qk9	/r/Egypt/comments/s6wt06/i_am_a_first_year_national_highschool_student_and/ht6fyai/

6mwh9adb	As far as I know most 5-4 star hotels do provide local guides so that's your first issue solved.  Trying to find your self a local guide might just result in you being scammed. To be fair that would happen in any country.   Imagine going down the street talking to strangers and asking them to be your local guide might end up good or might end up bad. Its a 50/50 worldwide.  I suggest you can take a cruise over the nile. From Cairo to Luxor. Luxor is the best place if you are looking for visiting ancient artifacts.   Also you should visit the Egyptian museum in Tahrir you will love it.  Then I am sure you will love to visit Sharm El Sheikh or Hurghada the hotels and oceans there are very cool.  Conclusion: 5 - 4 star Hotels are your best supply of local guides and the stay there would be enjoyable than trying to walk around the country finding local businesses and they are much cheaper than most countries.	1642518084.0	ht6ltn4	t3_s6a3t4	t3_s6a3t4	/r/Egypt/comments/s6a3t4/amateur_guidesassistants_in_egypt/ht6ltn4/

 فيييييييييييين اللي بيقول ان 80% من ايراداتنا رايحة للديون؟!  وبالمناسبة ال80% اللي جايه من الضرايب جزء كبير جايه من نشاطات البيزنس والصناعة والشركات والفلوس اللي داخله البلد وخارجه والضرايب عالاستثمارات الخ. مش كلها "فلوسي" اللي بدفعها في الضرايب. نص الشعب اصلا او اكتر من النص شغال في قطاع غير رسمي ومش بيدفعوا ضرايب خالص والحكومة بالمناسبة لسه برضو بتتيح لهم التقديم على مستحقات وظائف غير مستقرة وبتتيح لهم تموين ودعم إلخ. والناس دي برضو يقدروا يقدموا على ديون بفوائد اقل زي اي اسرة مصرية تاني وده اللي الصفحة بتاعتك بتاعت مبادرة الحقوق الشخصية بتقوله   [https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/egypts-informal-economy-ongoing-cause-unrest](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/egypts-informal-economy-ongoing-cause-unrest)  &#x200B;

79ycugng	No im not talking as if we were starving. But we were getting robbed for 40 years and he left the country to rot, slums to flourish, Infrastructure to get destroyed. He just stayed and kept the stability, kept the ppl happy with subsidies and letting ppl do whatever, build whatever wherever, projects would take decades if they even see the light of day. Mubarak days were probably easier than right now after 2 revolutions, and tourism would also be slightly more than in 2019 in terms of number of tourists (tho 2019 reported highest earnings in tourism in our history). But even that peak of mubaraks number of tourists isnt even 10 percent of what Egypt should have. Now so many projects and so much work is on place to get these numbers to where they should be. About debt, i urge you and anyone reading this to learn more about debt and not just take it as some arbitrary number as if bigger is worse. Look at it as a ratio to the gdp and youll see that that ratio is decreasing. If you look at debt in japan or the usa youll think omg theyre the worst economy in the world. Our debt levels are very good and very manageable according to international organizations like fitch.	1642518916.0	ht6nuj8	t3_s69i6r	t1_ht69mtp	/r/Egypt/comments/s69i6r/egypts_gdp_is_expected_to_record_54_average/ht6nuj8/

43t8e3z6	He suddenly implemented a new system that could've been successful had he trained the teachers more, took longer time to prepare for such a leap in education systems, took a slower approach, and generally just thought more about the execution instead of trying to implement good but raw ideas into an environment that's not seen change in a long while  Such huge changes can't just come suddenly. The previous system might've had its flaws but at least it kept the students studying. Now the whole idea of"don't memorise, don't refer to one source, you shouldn't even know what the exam would looks like" made the students believe that completely abandoning the older studying methods is the solution while all that does is make them much less prepared. Keep in mind that I didn't even mention the flaws in the system itself. The servers failing, problems in marking the exam and grades, the utter confusion both students and teachers are in due to lack of information, and the increased rates of cheating, all are huge issues that arised with the new education method but let's just focus on the idea's core for now	1642524295.0	ht71ubk	t3_s6zkij	t1_ht6rf1h	/r/Egypt/comments/s6zkij/inshallah_we_get_a_good_minister_of_education/ht71ubk/

f0eoggcn	The term is offensive not because of its origins but because of its use. Christians call themselves مسيحيين I.e related to Christ. This is how they identify themselves, why would anybody challenge that? Besides the word نصراني and نصارى is used by Salafists and ultra orthodox Muslims as a pejorative term that’s why it’s offensive.  P.S Before 9/11 Muslims were all over the world called Mohammedans (related to Mohamed) but this is not used anymore.	1642526748.0	ht78hjo	t3_s717sr	t3_s717sr	/r/Egypt/comments/s717sr/is_the_term_نصراني_offensive/ht78hjo/

11b8qr	These are such obscenely horrible ideas that you have to be really young. If so, let me help correct your perspective a little. I'll respond to them one by one I guess: 1. "Stop teaching useless facts": what's a useless fact? Who decides what is and isn't a useless fact? Is Egyptian history "useless facts"? Is the pythagorean theorem "useless facts"? What about Geography? There is very little that we can objectively label as "useless facts" and I have a feeling most of what you think is useless is, in fact, not useless.  2. "He forces schools to teach in better ways" how? Does he just flip a switch and schools suddenly get better? Schools being bad is a problem I am not sure the ministry of education can even solve alone even if it tried its absolute hardest. Schools are bad because they are poor as fuck. Schools are bad because teachers have been undertrained for generations. Schools are bad because they are usually overcrowded. These are issues that would take at least a decade (a generation) to solve if schools were a high priority for the entire government.  3. "He removes all the memorizing stuff" I will never understand where the Egyptian myth of memorization being bad and being the opposite of intelligence comes from. This is one of the strongest forms of cope I have ever seen. Memorization is an integral aspect of intelligence and the science we have backs this one up pretty strongly. Memorization just requires effort and it's easier to say it's unintelligent than to admit that people are just lazy. Memorization is good, and it should never go away, and it is natural that memorization is dominant. Is it too dominant? Maybe, but "removing it all" is probably worse.  4. "Teach us how to pay taxes" fam this isn't the U.S., we don't do our own taxes (most of the time). This is straight up you just absorbing American culture without having the slightest idea how your own country works.  Anything I didn't respond to I consider a blatant joke and I HOPE none of them was actually serious.	1642526803.0	ht78mx1	t3_s6zkij	t3_s6zkij	/r/Egypt/comments/s6zkij/inshallah_we_get_a_good_minister_of_education/ht78mx1/

The same goes to the term مسيحي which mostly used as a day to day term. However, both are basically the same thing. So some may find it offensive because of the stereotype o just mentioned earlier, and some won't because they understand that they are the same.	1642527045.0	ht79am6	t3_s717sr	t3_s717sr	/r/Egypt/comments/s717sr/is_the_term_نصراني_offensive/ht79am6/

95jt3ccw	The term is an Arabic word that is used numerous times in the Quran to delineate Christians. Its origins go back to the city of Naserah in Palestine where Isa (pbuh) lived.  Your argument of how a perfectly normal word becomes offensive when used by some people in an offensive way, is just flawed. The term "bitch" is only offensive if you use it to insult a person, however, it's perfectly normal to use when describing a female dog, fox, or wolf).

bks33tex	It's definitely one of the reasons I believe. However, in my humble opinion, it's not a fix. Big egyptian cities are car-centric as the public transportation doesn't cover nearly enough routes nor is it reliable enough (for other reasons) to be a proper car replacement. Increasing taxes on cars without properly fixing the public transportation sector is just draining the middle/lower class citizens even more. It's not an easy issue for sure, and I'm just doing armchair analysis here :)	1642534779.0	ht7ubrl	t3_s6vj3d	t1_ht7rekz	/r/Egypt/comments/s6vj3d/just_crashed_and_this_is_to_all_fellow_drivers/ht7ubrl/

'The Egyptian Kingdom') was the legal form of the Egyptian state during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali dynasty's reign, from the United Kingdom's recognition of Egyptian independence in 1922 until the abolition of the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan in 1953 following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.

8t68a	The first French-medium schools in Egypt were established in 1836. By the end of the nineteenth century it had become the dominant foreign language in Egypt and the lingua franca of foreigners; this was especially the case in Cairo.[12]  French became the primary foreign language in media during the rule of Ibrahim Pasha.[13] During the period of the British influence, French was actually the medium of communication among foreigners and between foreigners and Egyptians;[14] the mixed French-Egyptian civil courts operated in French, and government notices from the Egyptian Sultan, taxi stand information, timetables of trains, and other legal documents were issued in French.[15] In addition the usage of French in the media was at the greatest extent in this period.[13] This was partly because some Egyptians had French education and partly because of cultural influence from France.[14] Despite efforts from British legal personnel, English was never adopted as a language of the Egyptian civil courts during the period of British influence.[16]  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Egypt  Due to social and political reasons, the role of French in Egypt began to decline in the 1920s.[12] There are still two newspapers published in the French language.  You can actually see some remnants of this nowadays with like old street signs in old neighbourhoods written in both arabic and french "rue ....."	1642595536.0	htb6c7a	t3_s7oa2j	t3_s7oa2j	/r/Egypt/comments/s7oa2j/a_question_about_language/htb6c7a/

And what do you mean “pick one”, I’d said before I would go on to say what happens in the west wouldn’t extrapolate to our situation here that we shouldn’t be blindly following in their trail and should stop for a second to diligently weigh out the situation and eventually come to the realization that they just had it different and we’d have to devise up some solution of our own that would work for us.

awgbqiai	In the same way, white ppl are only white cuz it helps them absorb vitamin d in areas that aren't very sunny (Europe and NA). same thing with blonde hair, a light colored hair helps the sun reach through their scalp better than a dark colored hair. Blue eyes are a random mutation tho and has little to do with the environment or the weather.

15890u	If you have the ability to teach, you can easily find a job here, but the salary will depend on the "level" of the school, it can start around 3-4000 to 5x to 10 times more. But you should know and its logic that high paying positions are very rare.  You also have the call center option, if you speak French/German, the salary compared to the average salary is good (7k to 12K), but the shift is hard, and the rotations are crazy. So it's just a position to make some money to start a potential career here.  I also met an Egyptian who had studied in the UK, he was working as an engineer in the new capital, he seems to get a very good salary, so check the construction company, they may be hiring foreign staff.  And about cost of life it will depend on how you lived,  but you should understand that to have quiet and cool life in Cairo, will cost a pretty amount f money, so if you dont get high salary, it will be hard to have decent life.	1642599544.0	htbduoh	t3_s746wi	t3_s746wi	/r/Egypt/comments/s746wi/are_there_any_good_jobs_in_egypt_for_americans/htbduoh/

Mostly Europeans and turks were enslaved.  2) black Americans were used as an expendable farm workers, imported by the millions from thier native land and completely dehumanized.   Slaves in the Arab/ islamic world were mostly house hold slaves, many enjoyed high ranks and good living, and many eventually become sultans and leaders (the mamlukes). They had rights and could buy their own freedom. They mostly didn't work in plantations.	1642602723.0	htbkubp	t3_s7lnir	t1_htbhl8d	/r/Egypt/comments/s7lnir/from_a_three_year_old_social_studies_book_that_i/htbkubp/

c7i7zxae	In my experience, i started with a random therapist off shezlong and she herself recommended me a person more suited to my issue a psychiatrist.      The psychiatrist set a plan for me that I was supposed to follow with therapists and consult the psychiatrist again every now and then.   So just whoever you meet, if they didn't suit you, feel free to ask them for recommendations for a person who is experienced in your particular issue, they'd probably know.   DM me if you wanna discuss the therapists i've contacted, but there is no right answer there. Also, I think the best thing you can do is look for therapists online and copy their names to look up their social media pages and judge for yourself.

h6gthbyq	>It could be a baseless opinion and still counts as an opinion even though it is very likely to be dismissed  Just gonna throw my two cents on the matter here.  The entire point of opinions is to have different takes and offering new perspectives on subjective matters that doesn't have one correct answer.  If you try to apply them to objective matters the word  loses all its value for example if person a said: 1+1=2 and person b said:1+1=3, person b is objectively wrong his opinion doesn't have any value to it.  You can come to two conclusions here:  1 some opinions can be wrong 2 opinions can't be applied to objective matters  And the first conclusion defeats the point of opinions, why have them when some of them is just wrong, meaningless and have no value?  Therefore i see the second conclusion to be the most suitable.	1642604121.0	htbo63q	t3_s7mx2z	t1_htb7qvt	/r/Egypt/comments/s7mx2z/hinduvtas_and_a_late_entry/htbo63q/

7r7lfuwh	Moreover, it used to be a falcon, namely, Quraish's falcon صقر قريش, which is meaningless, since that name was the nickname of Abdulrahman Aldakhel AlOmawi عبدالرحمن الداخل الأموي but there was never in history a falcon motif for him, or for Quraish.  فشكلها كدا افتكاسة واحد مثقف دولة زرطها أما اتسأل و اتزنق، و من ساعتها الناس لبستها و بتكررها كدا و خلاص و بقيت رواية رسمية للجمهورية المهلبية.  Its shape was slightly changed sometime in the seventies, after the change of the name of the state.  On another note, most people now mix up نسر which is "vulture" with عُقاب which is "eagle". For Arabs, the eagle represented daring, fearlessness and strength. Ancient Egyptians also saw falcons as graceful and strong. But the vulture is usually associated with opportunism. The Egyptian Mut was a vulture, and she was scary for different reasons.  Now all the birds and their totemic significance is mixed up. ماحدّش فاهم .حاجة	1642605379.0	htbr8i7	t3_s74u9u	t1_htbh7po	/r/Egypt/comments/s74u9u/egyptian_flag_redesigns_i_made/htbr8i7/

4a6io49j	I see that some people in the comments are discussing whether زنجي is equivalent to the N-word or not. Some even claim that it’s just a term that refers to black people! I understand why this might be confusing for many of us. After all, our education system is so poor when it comes to discussions of race and racism.  What people may not be aware of is that زنجي translates to “negro” or the “negroid race,” both of which are part of the race theory that divides humans into groups based on their phenotypes (physical features). More importantly, this theory argued that those groups were not only different physically, but also differed in their mental and behavioral capabilities. Thus, it entailed a certificate hierarchy among those groups with the Whites (Caucasian race) on top and the Blacks (Negroid race) at the bottom.  This controversial theory was long used by colonial powers and slave traders to justify their activities. By seeing black people as members of a sub-human race, they could get away with whatever they did. In other words, you are not eligible for human rights if you’re not considered as such.  This theory has been long disapproved by the scientific community and social scientists for its obvious lack of scientific evidence. It’s such a shame that it’s still taught in school.	1642605958.0	htbsn1v	t3_s7lnir	t3_s7lnir	/r/Egypt/comments/s7lnir/from_a_three_year_old_social_studies_book_that_i/htbsn1v/

8t68a	Are you asking about the wedding cost only ? Or the mahr+shabka ?   Cause it can depend wildly. Some families dont care about the finances much as long as their daughter is in good hands. Others focus more on the financials. Shabka alone can cost between 10k-200k "can be less or more" according to the gold/diamonds the bride chooses. mahr as well depends on  what the bride's family requires of ya.  Another thing you have to worry about is the engagement venue and the wedding venue. While traditionally the bride's family pays for the engagement venue and the husband pays for the wedding venue. Some families agree to a 50/50 split for both. Now said venues depend you can get a venue for as cheap as 10k or do your wedding on a street, or you can do it at a 5* hotel which can cost up to 100k depending on the location.  Also the furniture and electronics of the house has a traditional split between the bride and groom "bride buys the kitchen and electronics and the husband buys the bedroom furniture, or sth close to that cant remember the exact details" however that can change as well some bride's families ask the groom to buy everything, others want to buy everything themselves.  Now for the rented apartment also depends is it a small apartment or a big one ? Furnished or unfurnished ? Some families flat out refuse their daughters to live in a rented apartment and demand the groom to buy one, others "if you're lucky" actually buy apartments for their brides to marry in. However furnishing a lets say 1 bedroom apartment can cost between 10k to maybe 50k depending on how expensive you want it to be   Gonna need more details to help ya out friend	1642606925.0	htbv2hq	t3_s7s8f3	t3_s7s8f3	/r/Egypt/comments/s7s8f3/askeg/htbv2hq/

ijx2ux7d	Yh, so , it is logical that the probability of finding a corrupt judge who is holding the case is higher. On the other hand, less women commit murder, so the probability of finding a bad judge holding the case is so much lower.  Let's say you bought 10 t-shirts from the men section. Then you bought 10000 t-shirts from the same company from the female section. The probability is that you will find atleast a couple of the 10000 t-shirts have manufacturing defect. But the 10, it's almost impossible to find a defect in them, because you don't have enough t-shirts to find the error of the manufacture.    This argument aside, your comment is actually extremely counter intuitive, and i believe that some common sense can make you think in another, more reasonable way. Believe me, it's super easy, try it.	1642609380.0	htc1c6f	t3_s7pzso	t1_htbvhli	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/htc1c6f/

8t68a	Well depending on where you live but i'll be talking as a cairene/from cairo. Medium wedding party and im gonna assume like maybe 50-100 guests with a set menu and not an open buffet ? There are 4 tiers to wedding venues nowadays   Tier 0 : on the street, cheapest but not the most "pleasant" https://youtu.be/Eu187cwC58w similar to this.  Tier 1 : wedding venues in lower middle class-middle class areas or in like نادي المعلمين/القضاة/الاطباء etc etc, they are a big step above the street  weddings and they are decent but you wont find any luxuries . Probably around 10-35k  Tier 2 : military wedding venues. دار مناسبات المدفعية، المشاة، دار القوات الجوية etc etc. Middle range and good especially if ya have someone in the military in your family they can get ya a big discount . 20k-50k    Tier 3 : hotels now thems the bougie weddings these can cost up to 150k  There are some boats on the nile that do weddings as well but they range from the aforementioned tier 1 to the top bougie tier 3 stuff so i cant give ya an accurate estimate   Of course it depends on the amount of guests and as i said the open buffet/set menu deal you are planning to have   Also how many performers are you planning to bring ? And belly dancers ? Last i checked the top tier belly dancers cost a significant sum "gawhara's wedding performance fee is about 25k-30k " however you can get normal belly dancers for waaay cheaper. A relative of mine got the belly dancer ghazal (RIP) and mahmoud elleithy for about 25k at his wedding.  Now all of this is assuming you're in cairo which is way more expensive than if you were in el fellahin.	1642610786.0	htc50vh	t3_s7s8f3	t1_htbxhtv	/r/Egypt/comments/s7s8f3/askeg/htc50vh/

I'm on my last week of a month long stay here and loving it. Most Hurghada locals don't like sharm because it's just a tourist town. While I agree most of it is, depending on your budget, there are a few bubbles here where you can have an amazing stay and be well insulated from the typical tourist trap. I still venture out into town for some night life, grocery shopping, and eating amazing seafood.

tfy97c8	Hey man, I was in your shoes a few months ago, and I ended up checking my internet usage and was surprised at how much internet one can use just by streaming videos. Especially at 1080p. I understand that you're pretty sure that you're not using so much, just like I was at the time, but here's something to try. If your computer is the only one connected to the internet try checking [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/46877/windows-10-data-usage-limit-very-high.html). Click on your adapter and reset the stats, use it normally for a bit, and see how much usage it shows vs. how the ISP shows.	1642611707.0	htc7ht4	t3_s7jb7j	t3_s7jb7j	/r/Egypt/comments/s7jb7j/we_internet_usage_scam/htc7ht4/

bfpbtdp7	Short answer: no  Long answer:  It largely depends on how big the conflict turns out to be( if there will be a conflict in the first place)  Firstly, my short take on Egypt's (sisi) current foreign policy is that it's trying to increase its influence throughout the middle-east without making any unnecessary enemies out of other regional prowers (Isreal, Iran ,etc..) or superpowers. Egypt has also been very keen on modernizing and bolstering the millitary since sisi took over. This doesn't sit well with the USA who gives everybody in the region nice toys to play with except egypt(QME),  so since then we've expanded our market largely to France ,Russia, China and even Italy. Basically we're playing on all sides but without angering anyone (too much)  Back to the conflict, If it's only scaled to a Russian invasion of Ukraine where the west supplies the Ukrainian millitary and resistance groups with arms and sanctions Russia, which they have hinted will be there move, then there won't be really any effect on egypts foreign policy regarding Russia (business deals,  buying weapons etc...).   However, if this somehow turns into a world conflict between nato and russia ( my bet is China being the reason) then things would be very different.  We still won't join the war but our policy would have to change or atleast be very very cautious because the sides that you are playing on consider themselves enemy's now and will most probably be pissed about you making deals with their enemy   Last time an egyptian president  tried to be friendly and make deals with both USA and Russia during a conflict, it started something we know today as the the suez crisis (العدوان الثلاثي )  Regardless, at the end,  our golden rule will be simple:  [ملناش دعوة يا موهي](https://youtu.be/-sg7IGLUy20)	1642613545.0	htccgw7	t3_s7sqyj	t3_s7sqyj	/r/Egypt/comments/s7sqyj/with_the_current_tensions_going_on_between/htccgw7/

7nyu84jk	You are just getting carried away, that's not in Egypt only it's a male dominant career as i said ,and it's like that cause (if i remember correctly) researchers said that women in general have a tendency to go with their emotions rather than men, so it will probably be male dominant for a longgg time, but there's change and it's for the better, can't forget that this was a couple of months ago so you shouldn't make a fuss about it they just started and didn't finish yet.  Yeah a lot of women need their rights but being extreme just destroys your guy's argument instead of focusing on actual problems you guys jump at the first argument u see to tell literally everyone how this society is sexist and how we should kill all men, and well you guys just look bad with 0 argument. a couple of months ago a bunch of wives killed their husbands and all social media did was to make jokes about it, you didn't see anyone screaming for male rights lol.  Our society is filled with problems but we just complain instead of trying to fix anything and that's really what's holding us back, anyway thx for coming to my ted talk have a nice day :).	1642613610.0	htccn4h	t3_s7pzso	t1_htc6yuc	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/htccn4h/

8eum6oti	When did I say that? This equals here to me saying that men get less death sentences than women and that they're being in an inequality situation. U are the one complaining not me. I am the one saying that it doesn't really matter how many oranges or apples are sold When apples exist, more poeple will be apples, when oranges are less, there are less chances people will be oranges. Therefore I can use ur 'counter' in my favour as well, saying the following There could be a bigger percentage of women sentences to death, because the amount of women participating in crimes are less, and the amount of men in crimes are higher so thats why more men are sentences to death. Basically this is all non sense, it is all about the : 'death sentence/number of suspects ratio. It doesn't come in anyones favour, it is just overwhelming to the whole society rather than targeting one group The difference here is that I am trying to bring them to an equal state while u are trying to create the inequality out of small differences.	1642613841.0	htcd9ic	t3_s7pzso	t1_htcbab6	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/htcd9ic/

Stop being a piece of shit.  &#x200B;  And judges in France, Greece and some other countries are predominantly women.  In USA where it's seen as "not enough" only a third are women.

Literally we're all here talking about general issues not single cases.  And every single time a feminist talks about a case she gets attacked for "talking about a single case".

dmrx3yoe	And to clear it up. You're a misogynist because first of all, you don't see the problem in the fact that only 1% of the judges are women. You think that's totally normal. That it doesn't reflect men privilege or misogyny in this society.  You think I "hate my own gender" because I call men privileged in a society where most women have at least once experienced sexual harassment and most of the time, it goes unpunished.  You keep deflecting and call men "discriminated against in this society actually like in marriage" when we all know how family abuse is rampant in Egypt and how multiple men actually dodge spending on their children after divorce. Which leads us back to the fact that men are paid 12.9% more in wages than men are per the central bureau of statistics in Egypt.     And you deflected the fact that women are very underrepresented in almost anywhere of authority or power like governors or ministers or prime ministers or presidents or mayors etc, by saying "so what? if my professors in a certain section in uni are 90% females does that mean men are oppressed?" When in fact, 3m more women are illiterate than men. Also when it's proven that in Egypt, girls simply study more and get higher marks when boys are typically more "living it" or are given more freedom by their parents.  &#x200B;  You're a terrible misogynist and I hope you change.	1642622819.0	htd1kkd	t3_s7pzso	t1_htczrow	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/htd1kkd/

They follow the IB system which is an internationally recognized system just like IG and American. If you apply through the Egyptian national committee, you can take a full or partial scholarship depending on your family's financial state. Or you can apply through the global system, if you're able to cover all expenses but it can be very expensive. Like thousands of dollars expensive. If you're interested, you should go and apply since the application will close on the 28th of January.	1642628744.0	htdhtbo	t3_s6wt06	t1_htaq68l	/r/Egypt/comments/s6wt06/i_am_a_first_year_national_highschool_student_and/htdhtbo/

5i6objlk	African americans don't claim to have built the pyramids. They simply defend the fact that african people built the pyramids because Americans in general (read white people) generally refuse to believe 1) that Egypt is in Africa now or ever was, 2) that Egypt is or ever was inhabited by african people or people of african descent, and 3) that African people have contributed anything of substance to human history. The history classes taught in American schools tend to treat human history as though Greece, Rome, the European renaissance, and the founding of America are the ONLY significant occurrences, and that no one else ever did anything of note. Hollywood produced a movie called the Gods of Egypt, wherein the gods of egypt were literally depicted as white. Egypt is to black culture as Greece is to white culture. White Americans do not claim to have built the Colosseum and black americans do not claim to have built the pyramids.	1642638988.0	hte6q5k	t3_s7mx2z	t1_htb1h2p	/r/Egypt/comments/s7mx2z/hinduvtas_and_a_late_entry/hte6q5k/

8t68a	Im not alexandrian but i do have a couple of tips for you other than what you asked!   1- Even tho the weather in alexandria is much cooler than in cairo, just remember you are still on the edges of the sahara desert! Our summers can be brutal and the sun is not forgiving so get a large amount of sunscreen with you and hydrate!   2- as a foreigner expect to be ripped off if you are shopping by yourself. So i suggest that when you get to know some of your local classmates and you guys become friends. Ask him/her to come with ya when you are shopping. I have done this with many of my foreign friends and the price difference for items is no joke.  3- the weekend here in egypt is friday/saturday so thursday is our version of friday night. Expect high uber/taxi fares and traffic jams. Expect traffic jams in egypt in general so always try to manage your time and account for the out of left field traffic jam  4- dont drink tap water and always carry a water bottle with you.   5- egyptian food needs some getting used to but you'll love it   6- google maps is your best friend and alexandria isnt that big   7- always carry some cash/change with you. Especially for lets say a taxi ride that has cost ya like 35egp and the only cash you have on ya is a 200egp note. Yeah you're gonna be scrambling for change to pay the taxi driver who 99% will say he doesnt have change haha  8- a lot of egyptians know english or at least a very basic level of english that can help you if you get in a pickle and dont know the right word in arabic in a situation	1642643516.0	htegt8u	t3_s7r1si	t3_s7r1si	/r/Egypt/comments/s7r1si/question_to_people_of_alexandria/htegt8u/

The word "Africa" comes from Avriga, An Amazigh tribe that lived with Carthaginians and they spread the name of the people living there thus the Romans translated to "Africa" in Latin.

35ozlnov	But Egypt isn't an extension of Europe, except for the old "Pharaohnism" movement that wanted to disassociate itself or put some distance between it and Africa. But what kind of idiot would claim Egypt isn't African? It is African and shares history in Africa because surprise surprise it's in Africa.

bm9l28me	True, Egypt's carbon footprint on the world is miniscule compared to China, India, and the West. But we produce some of the highest carbon emissions in Africa.  And just because there are others worse than us, doesn't mean we should continue doing something that's inherently bad. We should try to be better.  There is no excuse for fossil fuels in Egypt. Our efforts should be transitioning QUICKLY to solar and wind power. We should focus on energy efficiency and waste management and sustainability. Our homes and cities can totally run on renewable energy in less than a decade.  Fossil fuels are not profitable or efficient in the long run. We'll eventually collapse economically if we continue down that path. Protecting nature and biodiversity and ushering in a Green Industrial Revolution will bring more value and prosperity in the long run. Not to mention help Egypt become a developed country.	1642697155.0	hth7eyr	t3_s8ioui	t1_hth5v38	/r/Egypt/comments/s8ioui/useless_desert/hth7eyr/

bm9l28me	Look at u/madara707 comments in this post. He literally said "Egyptian history is not African history." Quite surreal that any barely conscious lucid human could say that.  I believe the Pharaohnist movement was to distance Egyptian identity from the Arabs.  Yes Egypt is not an extension of Europe, but many Egyptians have internalised the racism and imperialism we've experienced since the French invaded. There is a lot of self hatred which fuels this idea that Egypt is a European country and Ancient Egypt was a European civilisation. This is why there is still horrific racism towards black people in Egypt.  This idea was imprinted onto Egyptians from European who refused to believe that there was a complex and advanced civilisation outside of Europe older than the Romans and the Greeks.  That is why there are a significant number of Egyptians who become incensed at the idea of there being any association between Egypt and Africa.	1642697620.0	hth8p2y	t3_s8kepd	t1_hth75ll	/r/Egypt/comments/s8kepd/very_interesting_lecture_by_akala_on_ancient/hth8p2y/

How do you think all of the currently developed countries developed hmm?   >There is no excuse for fossil fuels in Egypt.  People that talk like this are usually rich enough to cover their own asses and are quick to judge others. Start thinking about the others that barely have anything to eat some days, sleep on the streets, die from curable diseases, all because of our resilience to mining and reaping the treasures that our land has to offer. This is a weak excuse made by "1st world countries" trying to act all environmentally friendly, when they were the first to ruin the climate. So now we should just not use our fuel reserves when we have a crisis in fuel prices all over the world cause "the climate you know?" and "we will already be at 0 green house gas emissions by 2375." So rather than using the gift you have now when it is worth a lot and is in a very high demand, just keep it in the ground until it's worthless.

bm9l28me	>Been working fine for a very large number of countries.  Clearly you're poorly informed and haven't got the slightest clue what you're talking about. Follow the news and current affairs and the most talked about topics in the world today and you'll see that fossil fuel-based economic activity will lead us to ruin. And please don't take it up with me. Take it up with all temperature records being broken and catastrophic weather events happening worldwide and with climate scientists.  Take it up with the economists and the World Economic Forum and the IMF too. And just about every credible economic think tank in the world.  [https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/future-nature-business-action-agenda-blueprint-climate-change-biodiversity-loss/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/future-nature-business-action-agenda-blueprint-climate-change-biodiversity-loss/)  &#x200B;  >I don't think China and India are going anywhere anytime soon mate.  Again you haven't a clue what you're talking about and clearly don't know anything about climate change and how it works. It's not something sudden. It's something that's happening now and accelerating every year and if we continue business-as-usual, the planet will be uninhabitable by the end of century. That's best case scenario.  >How do you think all of the currently developed countries developed hmm?  Slavery, colonialism, imperialism, and global domination and destruction. Is that what you want Egypt to do? And when nature is destroyed, where are we going to get our food, air, and water from?  As for your last paragraph, I can safely assume you're not really in tune with the real world and instead live inside a small internet bubble. Like study after study and real-life example after real-life example shows, there is much more value from building a sustainable circular green economy. That will lift millions of Egyptians out of poverty. Not polluting our land and oceans. That will make us poorer.  If you're going to be willfully ignorant about something, it's best to keep quiet than say something and just make a fool out of yourself.	1642709183.0	hti4cz5	t3_s8ioui	t1_hti0bg6	/r/Egypt/comments/s8ioui/useless_desert/hti4cz5/

What happens is, between the age of 29 and 30, you will be stuck with an expired passport with no way to renew. You will have two options, either to go back to Egypt and serve (if you cant stay that year wherever you are) OR you can just stay where you are till you reach 30 and go back to the embassy to pay a fine for not serving. After paying the fine, you can then renew your passport normally and be able to visit Egypt with no problems	1642711454.0	hti9bcl	t3_s8rr25	t3_s8rr25	/r/Egypt/comments/s8rr25/passport_renewal_for_an_egyptian_residing_outside/hti9bcl/

14u9g8	It is absolutely no problem since I myself already have many friends around the world,one of my best online friends is a Polish transwoman for example.  I have been drafting about and seeing what sort of approach and light I want to shed on myself but I think i read somewhere that once you pass the first stage of applications you have to go to an interview and discuss a project of yours, I have no idea what this means or entails.   I wanted to ask if you have info about that,and generally a comprehensive view into what exactly the application process is,the criteria besides some creativity and learning jargon,and what I can expect and what I need to know moving forward, It feels like information is rare and they are reliant on me just pulling the trigger and organically applying, which would fit the theme they are going with,which goes against what I prefer for potentially life changing choices.	1642712950.0	htidg27	t3_s6wt06	t1_hthnh4y	/r/Egypt/comments/s6wt06/i_am_a_first_year_national_highschool_student_and/htidg27/

gyknyu8s	2) بعيد عن السياسة، نتكلم بزنس:  القناة لما اتعملت كان تارجت الارباح 13 مليار جنيه في 2023 يعني تزيد بنسبة 145% عن2014,  بعد اول سنة من الافتتاح الارباح نقصت بنسبة 8%  وبعدين رجعت تزيد لحد ما وصلت اعلي عائد في تاريخها في 2021 بزيادة بنسبة 18% عن2014. زي ما حضرتك أكدت فوق ان انخفاض الايراد مرتبط بالتجارة العالميه، فبالتالي الزيادة مرتبطة بالتجارة العالمية (فالقناة الجديدة ملهاش لزمة).. مع التوضيح ان اكبر عدد سفن عبر القناة في 2008 كان 21 الف وحاليا عدد السفن في احسن سنة سجل 20 الف سفينة (المصدر من تقرير عدد السفن العابره من موقع القناه 'pdf')  ،، اذا مفيش احتياج للقناة الجديدة اصلا،   *مشاريع الخدمات اللوجستيه علي القناة وباقي المشاريع ممتازة،، مشكلتي مع حفر قناة جديدة بلا هدف.   3,4) المقرات القديمة ما زالت قائمة ومفيش حاجه اتباعت، تمويل المباني الجديدة جاي منين ؟  حتي بعد ما تتباع، مفيش اي وجه مقارنة بين المباني الوزارية القديمة ومباني الوزارات الفخمه في العاصمة، مستحيل القديمة تكفي ربع تكلفتها حتي.      ده ادعاء غير حقيقي من الحكومة، ولو كان حقيقي كانوا اعلنوا الارقام بالتفاصيل.    التمويل كامل من ميزانية الدوله بالتأكيد. من فلوس ضرايبنا.   5) اتمني, بس مفيش مصدر للكلام ده للاسف.  6) اه القديم في مدينة نصر "ليهم ٣ مقرات هناك" .   ميزانية الجيش هي جزء من ميزانية الدوله، اراضي الجيش هي ملك للدوله، ولو الجيش عنده فلوس زيادة حققها من امتيازاته مقارنة بالقطاع الخاص(عمال عساكر ببلاش، زيرو ضرايب.. الخ) ، يبقي الفائض يتنقل لميزانية الدوله، مش يتعمل بيه كومباوندات ونوادي ليهم للفشخره.  يا راجل يا طيب، بقولك كيان ده يساوي ٢ من حجم التجمع الخامس كله !! انت متخيل!!؟؟    مشاريع كتير مش وقتها اكيد، بس من دواعي الفشخره للاسف :/	1642714193.0	htigwsl	t3_s75sv5	t1_htfz4ta	/r/Egypt/comments/s75sv5/economy_اقتصاد/htigwsl/

11wn8x	For accommodation, I recommend looking through Facebook—there are groups for people offering/looking for flats, rooms, and so on. Try to look through groups where English is used as often, or more than, Arabic to ensure a higher quality and less scammers—something I learned from looking for accommodation here before (not from Alexandria, but currently staying here for college).  Uber can be a way to go around, but I would say you should try to use the tram, and microbuses (مشاريع as Alexandrines like to call them) if you’re with an Egyptian. Also, SWVL is very good too!

It’s getting offensive and rude, white washing celebrities and you getting mad about it? SAME exact frustration happens when you darken the features of our egyptian heritage and make them look like african american.  You even claimed buddha? What’s the goal here?

You can't expect every country in the world to follow the same culture as other countries, and you have to respect that but also call out when you feel something is wrong.

I'm sorry you have to endure the ugly side of humanity as part of your job.   If this is a temp career for you, I hope you'll find another job pursuing your passion soon. If this is what you want to do though, look into ways to get promoted into positions where you won't have as much direct contact with customers.	1642736795.0	htjx816	t3_s90iva	t3_s90iva	/r/Egypt/comments/s90iva/do_we_have_to_be_treated_this_way/htjx816/

6f4r2w0o	I completely understand your frustration. I believe that the main issue here is the policies of these companies. I haven't seen a single store in Egypt with a good customer based policies. This obviously get customers mad, however, it's not your fault, you didn't make these policies.  How about you try this, next time a customer is mad about a policy let them know that you completely understand them and that it's mot fair and that you would love to help them but it's simply not possible for you to go against the policy, and offer them to speak to the manager.  This will take the heat off of you and since your manager doesn't step in on their own, it's now their problem.	1642737508.0	htjyrge	t3_s90iva	t3_s90iva	/r/Egypt/comments/s90iva/do_we_have_to_be_treated_this_way/htjyrge/

My best guess would be that it's both, actually. Overrepresentation of ex-muslims + a stronger inclination to find an online community surrounding that identity since it's hard to do so IRL, which isn't the case for muslims.

p6zos	Solar panels in Sahara desert can generate clean energy. I also read your other comments about climate change and you are right. Yet there is still a way to produce fossil fuels and limit their effect on climate change. This is easier with natural gas than it is with oil. It involves a process that produces “Blue Hydrogen” called “Steam Reforming”. The carbon is then captured and sent back to the oil well in a process called “CCAS - carbon capture and sequestration”. Search the “keywords” on google if you are interested in more info.	1642754617.0	htkr80h	t3_s8ioui	t1_hth499d	/r/Egypt/comments/s8ioui/useless_desert/htkr80h/

ioe9q	All Egyptians are black and no Egyptians are white.  All African Americans come from Egypt. All Egyptians know that. Blanket statements tend to be rediculous.  In all fairness Egypt has loads of black people especially Upper Egypt, in the Delta, in the west like in Siwa, oh yeah and in Cairo. They didn't come here from anywhere. Black Arabs in Egypt are as old as the old testament.  African Americans see black people as a spectrum of color including mixed black people. On the African continent people mix but less often from other cultures. Africa defines blackness differently than the u.s. What America defines as black people is different than how most Egyptians define it. Since we are operating on different understandings of what blackness is, we run into disagreement about whether to the ancient Egyptians were black.   At the end of the day, black identity is a modern political identity that the ancient Egyptians did not have use for, in the way that democracies use it today. Ergo, politically/ ethnically black was not how ancient Egyptians saw themselves. But they sure as hell were not white. They definitely had dark skin. We've all seen the typical upper Egyptians. They're brown. They were not west Africans nor were they Ethiopians, but we know what upper Egyptians look like and we don't need to have this debate.	1642754973.0	htkroqz	t3_s8s0xa	t1_htij0cx	/r/Egypt/comments/s8s0xa/isis_art_work_hope_you_like_it/htkroqz/

bm9l28me	Yes most certainly. One renewable energy expert (can't remember who) said that if you divide Egypt's western desert into hundreds of small squares, a solar farm as big as just one of those squares would generate enough electricity for all of Europe.  I've not seen evidence and it might be far fetched but the potentials for solar energy are limitless.  I am somewhat familiar with blue hydrogen but I know there's an alternative called green hydrogen. I believe blue hydrogen's critics say it is still a fossil fuel, it is still depleting a finite resource, and there's always potential for leakages. Green hydrogen is a completely renewable alternative and doesn't deplete any fossil fuel or finite resource.  CCAS is also a great idea but it's currently still very expensive and requires a lot of energy. It's still not economical but it will eventually become important in the fight to decarbonise the planet.	1642755408.0	htks99b	t3_s8ioui	t1_htkr80h	/r/Egypt/comments/s8ioui/useless_desert/htks99b/

f7l0n	You are beating around the bush, Egyptians were not white, but they were not black either. pretty much as they are today.  and same as today, we know for a fact that Egyptian skin color graded from dark to pale.  when trying to cast doubt on the geneolgy of a population, you shouldn't be speaking in speculation and conjecture. and basing what you're saying on your whims and personal observations.  the fact is that king tut himself was depicted in multiple colors. and Egyptian women were typically depicted pale compared to men, who were depicted reddish to reflect working in the field. this is a PROVEN fact, repeated by Egyptologists who studied Egypt more than you ever will.    There is no trace of doubt that modern Egyptians (ALL OF THEM) are related to Ancient Egyptians. https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/  if you think other wise bring a study supporting your claim or grace us with your silence.	1642759054.0	htkwuse	t3_s8s0xa	t1_htkroqz	/r/Egypt/comments/s8s0xa/isis_art_work_hope_you_like_it/htkwuse/

7re791re	It's true that the Ancient Egyptians had more interaction with Assyrians, Abyssinians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, Hittites and people like than, but at the same time, their gold came from the Land of Punt, which is modern day Somalia, so they must have had control over much of North East Africa, all the way up to the roots of the Nile. It's clear that natural land barriers, such as mountains and desert, prevent them from being accessed by other parts of Africa, as easily as they were accessed by Greeks, Romans, and so on. Yes, we also know that Cleopatra was Greek and part of the Ptolemaic dynasty. She wasn't Ethnically Egyptian. but there was an ancient Egypt before the Greeks and romans arrived and you can know without doubt that they had dark brown skin. Call it what you want, but if you can see paintings in mountain tombs in West Aswan, I saw them myself, and the people were painted dark brown. Egypt was never cut off from immigration, not since they had boats for sure. So we can expect that Egyptians intermarried with other ethnic groups and were not purely anything. The Nubian society was more protected than the other Ancient Egyptians. But we know if we go to Luxor and Aswan today, you'll see a lot of people with dark skin, and they sure didn't come from Sudan. Lets not pretend there's only one Egyptian look when clearly there's so much diversity, from Nubians, to Upper Egyptians, to Berbers, Greeks, Romans, Bedowins, People from el Sham, Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Semites, and some Europeans no doubt, in our gene pool. We have been basically hosting foreign guests since the beginning of time.	1642760134.0	htky60f	t3_s8kepd	t1_htgtca3	/r/Egypt/comments/s8kepd/very_interesting_lecture_by_akala_on_ancient/htky60f/

ioe9q	I already made all the points you are making. I explained that upper Egyptians are the same now as ancient Egyptians. I explained that you can reference ancient Egyptian art, but ancient Egyptian art spans 4000 years, so you're going to find huge differences in how people art depicted depending on the example and the time.      I know more about this than you do. You don't have the temperament to have this discussion with me. you are too immature for this debate. You actually wasted time ridiculing someone's artwork because of your racism. It's pathetic.     I am just explaining that in the states race is defined differently than in Egypt. There for, an American would consider the typical upper Egyptian to be black, but an Arab Egyptian would not. Stop talking about what skin color the Ancient Egyptians were depicted as, as if there's a singular reference. How Ancient Egyptians depict themselves changed with time and tells us nothing. Yes, we can just simply look at upper Egyptians today, and frankly, what you call black is different than what an American calls black that's why I'm trying to say that the debate about race is dumb and it's totally dumb for Egyptians to get all butt hurt every time someone says Ancient Egyptians are black or African. Obviously they're in Africa, so they're African. Obviously, lots of Egyptians are black, get over it. Just because you aren't big deal. and what's defined as black is different here than there, and there was really no meaning to the word 5,000 years ago, so this is just a really stupid conversation.	1642761049.0	htkzak1	t3_s8s0xa	t1_htkwuse	/r/Egypt/comments/s8s0xa/isis_art_work_hope_you_like_it/htkzak1/

bm9l28me	Right but this post doesn't make any of those extremist afrocentric claims. Akala at no point in that lecture says that Ancient Egyptians were a black race. He doesn't for one moment say that modern Egyptians aren't related to ancient Egyptians. He in fact says (and presents evidence researched by other scholars) that ancient Egyptians were mixed race, just like modern Egyptians. He even complains that when western scholars try to create depictions of what ancient Egyptians might have looked like, they make them look western and don't bother to look at how modern Egyptians look to help inform their depictions.  I just find it wild that so many Egyptian redditors are enraged by such a small niche fringe group who make a small minority of African Americans (they're just ignorant internet trolls really) and don't spare a thought for how white people ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY LITERALLY robbed Egyptian heritage	1642767013.0	htl7jah	t3_s8kepd	t1_htl6sid	/r/Egypt/comments/s8kepd/very_interesting_lecture_by_akala_on_ancient/htl7jah/

1n0mvwjx	Suez crisis didn't start due to USA and soviets. It started out because Britain was a little shit head who was that over the canal it had lost, and saw a kind of dictator similar to Hitler and musilini, with that it started waging  war on Egypt.  Egypt was on very good terms with Soviet union at that time, and also a decent term with the USA.  The soviet union even straight out said that if this was to escalate more, then it would use its nuclear option on Britain, and before that Egypt made a large weapon deal with USSR.    USA feared that Egypt's unavoidable loss would make it fall to communism and later the USSR, effectively initiating a domino effect where all the region would fall and be a communist regime.  thus also threatened Britain and its    USA fearing that, starting pressuring Britain, France and Isreal to go back, and under all of that influence, it went retreated.  So in essence, gamal abdelnaser was a good political manipulator, able to get both the support of the USSR and the USA to stop a war, which was unimaginable with all of the stuff happening there.	1642767465.0	htl88py	t3_s7fag2	t1_ht9wjt2	/r/Egypt/comments/s7fag2/russiaukraine_crisis/htl88py/

2dy38dp2	No, this has always been the case. The military conscription is compulsory. Once you become 16, you are required to provide an excuse as to why you cant do the service right away and traveling becomes difficult because every time you want to travel you have to get permission from the military. So usually when you get enrolled in college, your excuse is that you are currently enrolled and studying, so they let you be till you are done. Some guys during that period (as a student) travel out of Egypt and stay out till they hit 30, since that's the only way to escape the service. To kind of stop this, they dont renew your passport after the age of 29 to force you to come back to Egypt and serve your one-year conscription (if you are unable to stay where you are, you are out of options because your passport is expired).	1642767878.0	htl8wrk	t3_s8rr25	t1_htkwy18	/r/Egypt/comments/s8rr25/passport_renewal_for_an_egyptian_residing_outside/htl8wrk/

At the same time, the CIA had knowlage of a revolt that would occur soon, so to stop it, it wanted to pressure king Farouk to do reforms, be it wasn't successful.  With the revolt now being unavoidable, then the best case scenario is for Egypt to not be communist for them.  At the same time they met gamal abdelnasser, they agreed on two main things things  1-the revolt should not make Egypt communist. 2- if the Britains were to interfere, then USA would stop them.

Some are more competent than others but usually there are people who have been in it for years, making them "experts" but even so called experts can be wrong, and your post is a good example of a professor or doctor being arrogant and falling for a common, tribal bias.

We all have noticed, there's nothing wrong with discussing it, and we are talking about black people and what different people define as black.   Upper Egyptians constantly claim they're related to arab tribes, and you provided articles that suggest that they aren't, so who is to decide really. Are you contradicting the article you gave us in Egypt Independent or what?   Black and Brown Egyptians aren't considered black in Egypt, well, sometimes, and sometimes they are discriminated against, called black by lighter skinned Egyptians, called Sudanese, and so on, and again, America defines blackness differently because of political context.

bm9l28me	Big populations and especially dense populations can be a very valuable asset to any country if it's managed right. Overpopulation is largely a classist and racist myth. Capitalism produces far more than what we actually consume and we consume more than what we need. At the same time, we are destroying the environment and gradually making the planet an uninhabitable place for humans.  This is especially the case when you take into account that the world's richest 10% produce more than 50% of the world's carbon emissions, while the poorest 50% produce 10% of all carbon emissions. This is according to an Oxfam study conducted a couple of years ago.  Study after study shows that people aren't poor because they have many children. Poor people have more children because they are poor. All statistics show that when people are economically empowered and have access to social protections and basic services, they tend to have less children. Poor people have more children because it's their only method of social protection. The children grow up to all work low-paying jobs to support the whole family.  In Egypt, the statistics show that the poorer and the more rural the region is, the higher the birth rate. More urban regions with higher numbers of working class and middle class famillies have lower birth rates.	1642769019.0	htlatx5	t3_s998ld	t3_s998ld	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htlatx5/

From the extreme 'black is superior, take back Egypt from the 'Arabs', cut off the African Nile from the non-Africans, kill the 'Arabs' in Egypt...etc. etc.', to the milder versions like this video that try to sound reasonable while adding a little Afrocentric agenda in between. He's saying that early historians were being racists, and yes I also agree, but he's adding some statements like "the Arab invasion and other invasions significantly changed Egypt's demographics" while saying other statements like 'Egyptians were black with flat nose and wholly hair', adding both statements together is indirectly giving the idea to the public that Ancient Egypt was ethnically similar/identical to west Africans (which is what the public usually associates the word "black with").   I have debated this topic for years with dozens of black supremacists, and I'm really not willing to go through the same vortex again...sorry.	1642770191.0	htlcxtp	t3_s8kepd	t1_htl8wxo	/r/Egypt/comments/s8kepd/very_interesting_lecture_by_akala_on_ancient/htlcxtp/

And the government could not offer services to support the people because they are too many. In other words, with how the government is moving towards privatization and more taxes, people with limited income are fucked, so they have kids that can take care of them when they get older which in turn will lead to more privatization and even more taxes.  From my personal experience for example, my father is a retired doctor, retired public hospital doctors make around 2,000 egp per month as pension, which of course isn't enough, So my father in his 70s decided to continue working in his private clinic despite our objections. This work led him to get Corona. He got corona so bad that he has been suffering for the past 6 months and spent the past month in the ICU. The ICU stay alone has cost him all his savings. So all 5 sons and daughters, who are working outside Egypt, are luckily able to send our parents money to make ends meet and make sure he is getting the best treatment and to take care of our mother. I cant even afford to visit them, because of my military status.   Now in Germany, because of the strong social government. My father would have been only working in a public hospital with a very decent salary and a decent pension. And working only 8 hours a day, would have made my father in much better shape and he would have enjoyed his 60s. Treatment to covid would have been excellent and for free. So people here never regret not having 4-5 kids since there is no benefit in that whatsoever.   Culturally it is expected of kids to support their parents in the best way possible because without this support they will be victims of the harsh and inadequate government services.	1642770559.0	htldmj6	t3_s998ld	t3_s998ld	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htldmj6/

But it's not fair the moment I try to calm someone down, and in the process I get scolded or insulted, just because of the bad policies, like, is that what I'm here for? Do I have to accept being humiliated just because I don't want to lose my job? Why don't they work on improving their attitude towards other humans just like them, and have some self-control, just as I try hardly after being humiliated? and if they won't, why is there a law to protect us, just like the one protecting them from fraud and etc. ?	1642771106.0	htleobn	t3_s90iva	t1_htjyrge	/r/Egypt/comments/s90iva/do_we_have_to_be_treated_this_way/htleobn/

Say you're now the leader of a country that just got through multiple social unrest and revolutions, the investors left long ago with their business and your population is growing at a rate of one person being born every 10 seconds... Your country is basically a desert with very small (and declining) agriculture area, and your government basically has no money... You do your statistics and find out that the highest birth rates are in southern Egypt, with poor families giving birth to >4 kids on average, meaning that your growing population will less likely get any form of education...

3ut7x4t3	In my opinion. I would take a brutal approach. Everyone had to pull his weight. Meaning like if he doesn't have a job then assign him a job - forcibly if necessary - , more working shifts, extended if needed. Expand into more basic labor jobs if needed.  When I said good I didn't mean like moral good. I meant it in a way like it would do whatever necessary to raise a country this size.

2dy38dp2	I would really advise against doing the service. I already did it, and wouldnt really recommend it. I do not know what you can do, but if you could stay put where you are till that year passes and then pay the fine, that would be much better, unless you have a wasta. Because if you do go back and you dont have a good enough excuse as to why you did not serve so far, your 14-month service could be extended 6 more months as punishment. So if I were you, I would either contact someone, to make sure it will go smoothly, or just stay put.   You could also stay in Egypt for a year without serving, as long as you don't travel and don't apply for anything related to the government and just stay low. Tamer Hosny tried to do that but someone checked and he got imprisoned for a year. So definitely consider all options.	1642771835.0	htlg4qk	t3_s8rr25	t1_htlemjl	/r/Egypt/comments/s8rr25/passport_renewal_for_an_egyptian_residing_outside/htlg4qk/

bjp2nfcr	I think if you folks had a better population growth it would’ve helped. You guys had a fast population boom and covered a lot of arable land with houses to keep up, and now the government spends quite a bit importing food to keep the population alive. So more farming land could help the country grow, or more industry and business for a higher GDP so you can import food without it being too much of a burden. Less people isn’t really an option unless President Sisi goes full Glorious Leader Xixi…	1642772845.0	htli8jl	t3_s998ld	t3_s998ld	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htli8jl/

5nsbbkmu	Personally, I’m against serving. I view it as modern day slavery because we’re a 100m+ so we’re not exactly lacking in terms of troops since the number of people who willingly work for the military is already high enough. If they want troops, they can expand their capabilities in military universities to take in more people and make military more attractive to work for by providing more pay and benefits.  Now for me personally, as I said, a valid passport in my line of work comes before everything and let’s just say there will be far more career and personal life  consequences to my particular case at the age of 29 than there will be right now so while I’m against the whole idea, I have to serve 🤷🏻‍♂️  As far as wasta is concerned, best I can do is get it to be more like a job where I go back home everyday after finishing the first 6 weeks of bootcamp.	1642773439.0	htljjld	t3_s8rr25	t1_htlg4qk	/r/Egypt/comments/s8rr25/passport_renewal_for_an_egyptian_residing_outside/htljjld/

xwbom	Which I think goes back to the population jump. The government saw the huge population leap and did nothing and when they realized their mistake it was too late. Whatever they do right now will not be enough imo unless they not only do it right but fast and with that it’ll still take time. That is just my opinion on the topic, I’m not an expert.	1642773566.0	htljtnr	t3_s998ld	t1_htlht34	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htljtnr/

Low income families have a lot of children so they can benefit from as a manpower in labour as soon as they physically able rather than investing in their education and wellbeing. Without a lot of kids, they may not be able to live as they age due to their basic type of work that mainly depends on physical ability + those type of jobs don't have security/insurance/pension..etc.  On the other hand, the goverment over the years did nothing to improve the living conditions of these people so they could have better jobs with more security and basic living standards that they would need less kids and focus on their quality of living rather than the number of kids.  This loop took years to form. So let's see how this will work in the next few years after the government started to acknowledge it.	1642773647.0	htlk02g	t3_s998ld	t3_s998ld	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htlk02g/

8umlgdwy	Considering that unemployment rates in 2011-2015 was around 14%, and now it's 7%, I would say that before the current leadership, we didn't have much job opportunities being created, and now it's increasing but, just like you said, not enough to accommodate the increasing manpower.   So that we don't lose track, From what I have seen in your comments, you seem to dislike the fact that the government is raising public awareness for overpopulation, so I think your main argument here is that 'Overpopulation is manageable, and the government/leadership shouldn't be raising public awareness to overpopulation as it's their job to find use for all of those people'.   My argument was, how can you manage all those people with the resources you have now? You ARE increasing your resources, but slowly (as job opportunities are being created since the stabilized Egypt of today attracted investors back again). The economy is getting fixed slowly, but the population is also increasing RAPIDLY. It's increasing way faster than what you can accommodate -right now-. So I think it IS logical to raise public awareness to overpopulation. That was my whole point...	1642774426.0	htllqe8	t3_s998ld	t1_htlht34	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htllqe8/

8umlgdwy	Lydia's current population is 6 million (which is almost the population of the city of Giza), Sudan has 43 million (and has enough agriculture land and water to support them and a few more), Saudi Arabia has a population of 34 million and have enough money from the oil they discovered in the 60s to accommodate the large population of its people and still has enough oil money to burn through to keep its people fed. (note that Saudi Arabia had a population of 4 mil when they jumpstarted their economy with oil)  Turkey has enough water and resources, and was already a major economic hub before they got to become overpopulated (meaning they already had enough infrastructure and wealth to support the coming populations).   Iran's population (83mil) was increasing slowly, meaning that they could prepare easily enough for the coming population of each year. Iran also has a major upstream nation that has multiple rivers (just like Turkey) AND they have enough oil money as well (just like Saudi Arabia).  For Egypt's case:   Current population 100million, unlike Lybia  Doesn't have enough water and agriculture lands, unlike Sudan (+ it has double the population of Sudan)  Doesn't have the riches of oil to burn through, unlike Saudi Arabia.  Isn't an upstream nation, and only has 55b cubic meters of water (poor in water), and its infrastructure wasn't prepared for the coming population, Unlike Turkey.  Has an exponential growth of population that was unpredictable, unlike Iran.	1642776419.0	htlqep6	t3_s998ld	t1_htlnfz7	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htlqep6/

hqskt3bf	The way your making out investors to be only a handful of people that’ve left some while ago, or, people that have got over a billion dollars in liquified cash is completely bullshit, if you will. An investor doesn’t have to be mad rich to contribute to the country’s burgeoning, you know you could build an entire condominium of 2-4 stories with multiple apartments on each floor if you had a million pounds, granted your not gonna be garnishing them with any amenities though, this is just how much money it costs to set up a structure and have it registered. But, still, that’s enough walls to accomodate up to some 70-80 people and get them off the streets. I think what we lack is awareness of entrepreneurial culture and that it doesn’t have to a 9-5 job that has you coming back home with enough money to support your family along with yourself, that it might as well be a business venture that is benefiting you along with the country as a whole, but, people are not that trusting of the government nor are they trusting of one another for there to be that many people establishing their own businesses.	1642777074.0	htls1f6	t3_s998ld	t1_htleshr	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htls1f6/

14u9g8	If its managed right,capitalism,whatever  This is pure bullshit,now, yes it is infact always good to have a big,educated and utilized workforce.  Thing is this is impossible in Egypt's case. Workforce means knowledge,available machinery and capital We have none of those,you are supposed to have a small birthrate as you grow your economy and then have a population boom where your newly acquired wealth can help the new people get education while you start projects that employ them and cause more employments through ripple affects. This is what happened in germany,france,the UK, the US,Japan and China,and Note they spent the last 300 years acquiring resources,knowledge and infrastructure before the economic booms they had.  Lets look at Egypt,by 2019 we had 34 million 0-15 year olds in our country,for the government to educate them fully to highschool,lets say each kid needs 100k EGP(this is by taking each school year as 15k,which is close to what most private schools charge) that is a whopping 3.4 trillion EGP(224,bl USD),which is a payment that has to be done yearly. Not to mention the projects that would need to be done alongside the education to let the students who graduate work on,and this is when they only have a highschool diploma,imagine if we took it up to college level. Now lets compare this number to a developed country with a good education system that is generally accepted as a good example,they have 80million people and a laughably low birthrate yet spend 160bl USD every year on public education to the highschool level,note that they also have a bigger urban population and that lessens education costs and more people go to private schools there.  Do you know how much our government revenue every year is? 86bl USD every year  Now tell me how the fuck the government is supposed to pay 224bl every year just to educate this population,it cant Thats why the correct path is to increase school budget but strategically try to lower it as much as possible,while doing projects that can quickly make money for the government to slowly be able to field the needed education budget.

bm9l28me	You're hearing what you want to hear and interpreting it in a way that suits your agenda and that's intellectually dishonest. You WANT this lecture to be afrocentric and labelling it as such by splitting hairs.  For example:  >saying other statements like 'Egyptians were black with flat nose and wholly hair'  You took this out of context. He said this was what was reported in a primary source written by a traveller and historian who lived during the time of Ancient Egypt and met Egyptians. At no point whatsoever was it said that all ancient Egyptians were black and had sub-saharan African features. All that was said that SOME of them had those features and it was also said that the evidence points to ancient Egyptians being a mix of skin colours and ethnicities, just like today.  I'm doubting you watched the whole video because a huge part of it was dedicated to other complex advanced civilisations that existed in East Africa, West Africa, central Africa and South Africa. Ancient history that's completely missing from popular knowledge. He's challenging the notion that Ancient Egypt was the only advanced civilisation in Africa and the rest of the continent were just barbaric mud hut dwelling nomads and hunter-gatherers.	1642778820.0	htlwhhp	t3_s8kepd	t1_htlcxtp	/r/Egypt/comments/s8kepd/very_interesting_lecture_by_akala_on_ancient/htlwhhp/

bm9l28me	>This is pure bullshit  To start off a response right off the bat by saying this doesn't make for good civilised debate. This immediately makes it steer towards aggressiveness and confrontation. If you disagree then disagree and be polite.  >Thing is this is impossible in Egypt's case. Workforce means    knowledge,available machinery and capital We have none of those,you are    supposed to have a small birthrate as you grow your economy and then    have a population boom where your newly acquired wealth can help the new    people get education while you start projects that employ them and    cause more employments through ripple affects. This is what happened in    germany,france,the UK, the US,Japan and China,and Note they spent the    last 300 years acquiring resources,knowledge and infrastructure before    the economic booms they had.  This is mostly wrong and inaccurate. European countries had slavery and colonialism which helped enriched them. Japan had an empire and was trying to compete with Europe and then got hit with 2 atomic bombs. China became a totalitarian state and nuclear power. The US became an economic and military superpower through WW2. Egypt is none of these. Egypt is a formerly colonised country and so isn't comparable to any of these other examples you mentioned. And neither of them developed along the trajectory you described.  >more people go to private schools there.  No they don't. The vast majority of people in developed countries go to government schools.  As for everything else you've said, I don't think you understand how macroeconomics, public spending, and government budgets work. It's not as simple as the way you described it. There are dozens of other factors to take into account but I honestly don't have the time or the energy to explain all that. I'll just leave with the point that any spending on education and skills and human development is not a cost, it's an investment that reaps very profitable returns in the long run.	1642780471.0	htm0tk1	t3_s998ld	t1_htlwcgl	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htm0tk1/

ic95wmw2	Atheist here  This guy was absolutely right  I'm against him socially/culturally and probably against him.even economically but when it comes to the revolution was absolutely correct  This wasn't about Mubarak being corrupt. It wasn't about one person, it was systemic. It's the military and he knew it was the military   As much as I would hate an Islamic as president I wouldn't have minded having him for the first 4 years as president as he probably would have been more competent in dealing with the فلول and the remains of the regime better than morsi. Morsi was too kind.   After that first 4 years we could have thought about getting a more secular president no problem but you need to stabilize first and make sure you don't give up the revolution and you don't give up your democracy	1642780649.0	htm1aki	t3_s9ct50	t3_s9ct50	/r/Egypt/comments/s9ct50/الشيخ_حازم_صلاح_أبو_أسماعيل_و_كلامه_عن_الجيش/htm1aki/

p6zos	Yes. But there has to be a balance. You need to invest in future generations so you can consider them manpower. This includes a good education, healthcare, food, transportation, energy, and housing. If you get the formula right, those will grow up to be a productive part of the economy. If not, well, The become a liability while they are growing up and they remain a liability in the form of unemployed or under productive grown ups.	1642783282.0	htm8atv	t3_s998ld	t1_htlcggg	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htm8atv/

6f4r2w0o	Try convincing yourself that the policies aren't fair, cause they aren't, not for the customers and not for you as you'll have to deal with angry customers! That way when you're talking to a customer you're not trying to calm them down, you're actually getting angry for them and with them.  You can't control what strangers do, but you can try to change how you deal with them so it wouldn't hurt you as much. Try to have an "I don't give a fuck" attitude with a smile. That's the only way to survive without hurting yourself. And for the law, let's be clear, there's no law that protects you or the customers,even if there's one, it's not being enforced. Try your best not to lose yourself until you can find a better job, or a different career.	1642784122.0	htmalp8	t3_s90iva	t1_htleobn	/r/Egypt/comments/s90iva/do_we_have_to_be_treated_this_way/htmalp8/

17wh1p24	for people who r saying look at china, it's laughable to compare china and Egypt. China has way more water, land, and resources in general. They have the ability to sustain tons of people. Egypt on the other hand is a small green valley in the middle of the desert. Egypt has approximately 53.7 km\^3 of renewable water resources while china has 2,840km\^3. Why i'm focusing on water is because it's the basis of human development, you need it for agriculture, industry, and pretty much all human activities. It's the reason why we as a country relegate ourselves to this small strip of land and why we never properly industrialized.	1642784353.0	htmb8h6	t3_s998ld	t3_s998ld	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htmb8h6/

e5s10s2a	You can't stop a person from aging because he will be less capable  Growth is such a natural thing that you can't fix or sit down and blame your problems on it Like you can't just sit and plame your failure on being in a desert or having bad weather  Personally I think we don't have a problem because we can really use these hands to strengthen our overall system  Egyptian people are willing to work for so little in comparison to other It's a big issue to discuss in a few words but let me give you an example A nurse has 36 hours of official work hours, she/he is most times abused to work over night and all day 12 hour shifts that are over the official hours reaching easily 70 hours and she has no choice but to attend these extra hours which she gets paid some ridiculous amount for like 12 pounds or something for the 12 hour shifts Compare that to a nurse in a normal country and ask why is this happening and why if they do this we don't have a great healthcare system instead there is shortage of nurses in almost every hospital  So why don't we train more nurses instead of abusing them for extra hours and make them end up not giving a shit about patients in the end  There is so many examples like this  Our issue is the lack of management we don't know how to make use of our human resources  Even the simple act of not being in the way without no help doesn't happen every where business suffer from governmental obstacles that is the reason for so many ideas to just not be possible  If you're willing to spend billions in the desert building new cities why didn't you come up with a system that will cultivate a great economy around it and enable so many small businesses to start and maintain itself in the future making construction both affordable and accessible and allowing competitive private market to be porn, Instead you killed all the market and only a few select companies can still remain because they are connected enough and rich enough to still exist in the picture making the sector even less accessible and corrupt  People are the problem because we don't have a capable regime we have bitches who make everything worse	1642784642.0	htmc0q5	t3_s998ld	t3_s998ld	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htmc0q5/

8xzr3d0q	It’s not about population its about bad management, a country with all those resources and still in poverty is just bad management issue. One of the main sources of income is tourism and we have one of the worst reviews. At least 4 out of the top 10 diving spot in the world are Egypt, and my German friends won’t think to come again to Egypt because of the bad experience starting by how the immigration officer treated them.  Bad managers or “ government” will blame anyone but themselves. How difficult is to make the pyramids area tourist friendly and safe without harassment?  But population is the main reason of poverty, they just want us to feel guilty about our poverty.  A president of a poor country “as they want to convince us” won’t buy new presidential airplane and build presidential palaces.

bfpbtdp7	Apart from your first paragraph. I don't disagree with the events you discribed however all this is irrelevant to my statement . I studied the suez crisis and know it in detail.   To understand my statement you have to go back to before the the crisis itself.  The suez crisis started due to nasser nationalizing the canal right.   Why did he nationalize the canal ? To fund the construction of the Aswan dam?    Was the canal initially nassers scource of funding for the dam? No, nassers initial scource of funding was the UK and the US who he was on good terms with till then.   What happened to this funding?The US and UK cut it off and didn't even tell nasser. He had to know from the news like the rest of Egypt which was a national embarrassment for him till his nationalization speech.   What did nasser do to recieve such a harsh response from the west? He made a weapons deals with the Soviet union through Czechoslovakia even though he had initially went to the US first and they refused to give him any arms.  Nasser out of anger of what happened and the way it happened decided to nationalize the suez canal. Hence my point.  Nasser didn't see a problem in dealing with the Soviets since he went to the Americans first however they didn't see it that way and dealing with the Soviets was enough for nasser to be punished in their view . Whether one sees this as a blunder by nasser in calculating the consequences of such actions in a time where the world was heavily divided or whether you see it as bullying by the west where nasser wasn't at fault,  it's not the point. The point is when the world is at war, cold or not, your part of it even if your not fighting so you have to tread carefully.	1642788397.0	htmmbmd	t3_s7fag2	t1_htl88py	/r/Egypt/comments/s7fag2/russiaukraine_crisis/htmmbmd/

2ata1k25	Take care now. The millitant "animal rights" activists are on their way. They would prefer you and your beloved dog to just die than admit that stray dogs are pack animals that are dangerous to everyone.   No kidding, there was a post about a guy who wanted to kill a dog for mutilating his little child and the smooth brains argued that the world does not revolve around the human, their cities or their children and dogs should be left attacking people and that trying to defend your life or your kid's is animal cruelty and humans should be jailed and killed for it.   It reminds me of a case when a hunter who hunts elk for food in a nordic country got attacked by a bear and survived his face being torn out after killing the bear. The millitants wanted death on the hunter as he had no right to defend himself or go hunting for his own food.   Humanity has forgotten its roots. Animals are playing pretend they are not animals.

Agricultural is top field need use power  Even that not true now   For example the new agricultural projects It have a central self irrigation system  Plus using Agricultural machinery  Make it more efficient and use much less numbers of works  Industrial field in the near future will need much less numbers of workers   Even Egypt start to produce CNC machines   Services fields  AI Aalredy replace huge amount of employees For example amazon , Facebook   And that's not something just out of Egypt in near future we wouldn't need accountants soon a cheap software will replace them  Even doctors for the next 10-20 say 30-40 Machines will able to do Diagnosis  So no manpower isn't a thing in future	1642792134.0	htmwb78	t3_s998ld	t1_htmu1q2	/r/Egypt/comments/s998ld/is_overpopulation_a_real_problem/htmwb78/

1n0mvwjx	I don't know how accurate this text was, but it was taken from wiki  '' Although Dulles believed that Nasser was only bluffing and that the USSR would not aid Nasser, he was wrong: the USSR promised Nasser a quantity of arms in exchange for a deferred payment of Egyptian grain and cotton. On 27 September 1955, Nasser announced an arms deal, with Czechoslovakia acting as a middleman for the Soviet support.[9] Instead of attacking Nasser for turning to the Soviets, Dulles sought to improve relations with him. In December 1955, the US and the UK pledged $56 and $14 million, respectively, toward construction of the High Aswan Dam.[10]''  It is said later on, that actually nasser's naturality was the thing that angered the US later on denying him his money.  Also not sure, but I think not anger was the contributing force for the nationalization of the Suez canal, but the fact that he had just made a huge arms deal, and the fact that he knew that the soviets were backing him up.  But I have to agree it wasn't well thought of.	1642793948.0	htn1ahk	t3_s7fag2	t1_htmmbmd	/r/Egypt/comments/s7fag2/russiaukraine_crisis/htn1ahk/

5cas8ngl	This is the most retarded comment I have ever seen, what's keeping us from opening private schools? They do open, and they are expensive as fuck, it's the government responsibility to give better education.  It is not an excuse, it's a fact, when you re becoming a country completely focused on the government, then when something bad happens, the government is to be blamed.  Yeah so because the parents got a child they can't afford, now they have a live in ruins their entire lives.

bm9l28me	Could you describe what you mean by "attack"? Baladi dogs very rarely ever attack humans. It's not in their nature. If you just mean that they bark then that's all they're ever going to do. Just ignore the barking and keep walking on. When a dog is barking at you or growling at you, it's not about to "attack" you. It's only trying to scare you off or tell you to keep your distance. It's based on fear. Since baladis live freely on the streets, 99% of them will run away if you chase them. Biting is an extreme last resort when the dog is cornered and has no way of escaping. When you run away and the pack chases you, it's only ever going to chase you so you can go away. If you were to stop in your tracks, so will they. Baladis are not dangerous dogs.  Also, dogs are never born aggressive. Humans make dogs aggressive. In order for a dog to develop a habit of aggressively biting people, the dog will have had to have been raised by a human that was cruel to it and suppressed the dog's natural warning system. The dog then learns that barking and growling are useless so it will just skip straight to biting.  And dogs, especially baladis, always remember who was an asshole to them. They will remember who threw stones at them. Who kicked them. Who sprayed water at them. That's why the bark at certain people. All you have to be is nice to them. Feed them. Bring them water. Pet them. They will love you instantly and be fiercely loyal to you. Take my word. Everywhere I have lived and stayed in Egypt, even while just walking through, I befriended the local packs and baladis. I even rescued and adopted one myself.  As for your dog, my suggestion would be to avoid the areas where the pack roams to begin with. Go alone to bring them food and befriend them so they can start to associate you with some positive. Slowly start introducing your dog from a distance and gradually reduce that distance while always having food and treats for both your dog and the pack. Over time, eventually they'll become friends or at least just indifferent. They'll no longer perceive your dog as a threat.  And TNR. A million times TNR. See if you have a local TNR programme and help raise funds for them to come in, vaccinate and neuter the dogs so the pack doesn't increase in size. Moving packs away doesn't work because another pack is going to come along anyway. Keeping the pack where it is will ensure that no new packs move in.  Baladi dogs are an asset to any community. They're not pests. I wish pure breed dogs were banned in Egypt anyway and the only dogs people could get are baladis. They're the best dogs!	1642800755.0	htnk773	t3_s9de22	t3_s9de22	/r/Egypt/comments/s9de22/how_can_we_get_rid_of_aggressive_stray_dogs/htnk773/

1je0we86	Well, I have been almost attacked like twice without walking my pet, I was walking around in the compound where I live and I was walking near a dog which had given birth (I didn't know there was a dog or that it had even gave birth), I froze and me and the dog kept looking at each other for like 3 seconds, the dog got up and started running at me, I honestly just ran away and it didn't really chase me but it could still be dangerous for anyone else walking by. And for the second time I've almost been attacked, it's a bit complicated to explain if you don't live where I live since you don't know the layout, there's this empty space in the compound where a group of the dogs stay, me and my friend were going there from the back instead of the front they started barking then running over to us, we didn't want to take any chances since they were a very big group of dogs and just booked it.  My sister was once walking my dog, according to her (I wasn't there), one of the dogs did get onto him and sat on him and was going to bite him, now the same dog and some other almost attacked him again, luckily there were people around who got the dogs away.  My friends have also been almost attacked multiple times by these dogs, I really don't think it's safe to have them around	1642801828.0	htnn6a9	t3_s9de22	t1_htnk773	/r/Egypt/comments/s9de22/how_can_we_get_rid_of_aggressive_stray_dogs/htnn6a9/

By your logic people shouldn't defend themselves, so if someone comes and tries to murder me I should let them murder me because if I fight back that's apparently way more messed up	1642802124.0	htnnzrl	t3_s9de22	t1_htniaam	/r/Egypt/comments/s9de22/how_can_we_get_rid_of_aggressive_stray_dogs/htnnzrl/
bm9l28me	I define "attacking" as literally jumping on top of you and biting you and holding you in a lock jaw. Tearing at your skin and flesh etc. If they're just barking then that's all they're going to do. It's not going to escalate beyond that. Barking and chasing is not attacking. Befriend them like I said. Prove to them you're not an enemy.  If you fail to do that and that ends up in the dogs getting poisoned or captured and dumped in the desert (which will kill them either way), that will be on you and their blood and souls will be on your hands. I'm not religious but if you are, god will hold you to account for that.	1642802153.0	htno2lw	t3_s9de22	t1_htnn6a9	/r/Egypt/comments/s9de22/how_can_we_get_rid_of_aggressive_stray_dogs/htno2lw/

1je0we86	I mean, if they're not aggressive to people they are definitely aggressive to pets, befriending them will work however it won't fix the issue with the rest of the pets. I really do not want to kill them honestly but if my dog does get bit or if anything happens to him, I will do something about it.

a3btm9gy	I am also a footballer and i can relate to what you want. I played in 4th tier and was in Ahly my whole childhood.  Actually your level decides everything.   Were you playing in a professional or semi professional or amateur?  Which tier league were you playing in England?  Do you have videos and that stuff?  Here in Egypt there are four tiers, The First and second are professional tiers and third and fourth are the semi and amateur ones.  If you are professional i think finding an agent is the first step to take and he will do the rest. (please find a good one)  If you are semi or amateur you have to get to know coaches from Facebook Groups of 3rd and 4th tiers. they make trials every now and then. And if you know friends here who can help that would be good.  In 4th tier, 80% of teams there will want you to pay for your expenses the whole season. (Thats the bad part here).  In 3rd tier, like 30% do same thing.  Pm me if you want any time	1642804150.0	htntg8b	t3_s9itx4	t3_s9itx4	/r/Egypt/comments/s9itx4/footballsoccer_team_to_join_in_cairo/htntg8b/

bm9l28me	Well I will call you a disgusting person if you do something to those dogs, even if they were to bite your dog. They're animals. They're following their instincts. It's not like they want to be a dick to your dog. They were there first and their ancestors roamed Egypt for thousands of years. It's their home and their environment. Nobody forced you to get a dog and you'e not entitled to your area being free of baladis.  If you don't want your dog to get bitten then follow my advice or avoid their territory. And contact your closest TNR organisation to at least get them neutered so they don't increase in number.	1642806392.0	htnzd9k	t3_s9de22	t1_htnpcks	/r/Egypt/comments/s9de22/how_can_we_get_rid_of_aggressive_stray_dogs/htnzd9k/

clruloaw	I used to work as a junior orthopedic surgeon at a  governmental hospital and we were told by ours seniors that scans and X-rays done in emergency settings were property of the hospital and were not to be printed or given to the patient on discharge. “If they want a printed scan then they should do it in a different place”. I never asked why or looked for where in the “lay7a” it says so but that is some weird rule imho. My only guess is, given that governmental hospitals do these scans for free, you cannot obtain them (people might want to go to the ER with fake symptoms just to get a printed CT which is very expensive) and they were done for diagnostic purposes and are accessed exclusively by the medical team in that hospital. However, if you paid for them, then legally you have the right to take a print of it. I hope this gives some insight.	1642809351.0	hto6v8i	t3_s9nsxo	t3_s9nsxo	/r/Egypt/comments/s9nsxo/denied_access_to_my_ct_scans_in_cairo/hto6v8i/

e1nqyjmc	الله يفك عنك الهم و الزعل. الله يقويك و يصبرك. I too have gone through a mentally tough time and I felt that the only thing that helped get rid of the black thoughts were 3 main things:  - Trying to focus on the present moment. I stopped thinking about tomorrow completely. Didn’t try to expect anything. I just lived with today in mind and nothing else. It sure lifted a lot of black thoughts and anxiety related to the unknown future. - Trying to focus on the positives. There sure are a lot of negative things in this world, but you can chose to avoid them and navigate your way through them by always staying positive and keeping your focus on what you have, not what you don’t. Be grateful every little thing. - trying to keep myself busy. Often, we find ourselves sad and depressed when we have the time to analyze the situation and think about all the bad. Sometimes even, we overthink to the point where we start to make up negatives that don’t even exist (that’s an extreme). So just keep yourself busy, and don’t let your brain have time to dwell on the difficulties and the sad parts.   Finally, remember that everything is only momentarily present. It all has an end. One day, you’ll look back and realize that it was indeed, all short	1642811426.0	htobz1m	t3_s9oxqy	t3_s9oxqy	/r/Egypt/comments/s9oxqy/i_need_everyone_prays_ادعولي_يا_جماعة/htobz1m/

7yoc00y2	Thank you for your reply.  The emergency was for a suspected heart attack, everything seems to point at that, i had and currently am still having symptoms matching with this condition.  he ordered a CT scan, after finishing the test and waiting for results, he comes to me, telling me i don't have a heart attack and when i and dad ask about the scan, he mentions he "didn't" ask for it, and goes to "see" it and debrief us, he does some things with his hands and stethoscope, then tells me the same thing, adding that i "**probably**" have inflammation in the pleura around the lungs or some muscles.  When we asked to merely see the scan results, he said **no**.  Given me diclofenac, and was sent home.  I took it at night and stayed up for some time, my hands got uncomfortably cold, it is cold in Egypt but my fingers never got this much, and after this long uncomfortable coldness i get a **severe** spike in pain and fingers in my left hand start tingling, like it doesn't have oxygen because of hyperventilating.  I check, and diclofenac increases risk of heart attacks for **normal** people... Let alone me.  I am taking blood tests to confirm this myself today.  What are your thoughts about this whole situation?	1642813863.0	htohw51	t3_s9nsxo	t1_hto6v8i	/r/Egypt/comments/s9nsxo/denied_access_to_my_ct_scans_in_cairo/htohw51/

xwbom	It is just not a good movie. Away from the cast and everything, a really really bad “Netflix” movie just like almost all their originals. I also think they tried going for the “Netflix” vibe and the movie became x10 time worse as it became weirder to watch than sex education. I’m not sure if they thought being open and sexual made the movie international and/or cool but some things just felt like it was pressured.  I was against filtered movies because they don’t properly portray reality but while the movie had a good spark of showing friends realistically on what they’d do together, it just lost it and I’m not an expert to tell you how and why exactly but it just felt pressured in some aspects and is just a bad movie imo.	1642824059.0	htp5t7w	t3_s9q2vi	t3_s9q2vi	/r/Egypt/comments/s9q2vi/لو_حد_اتفرج_عالفيلم_ده_اى_رايكو_فيه/htp5t7w/

clruloaw	Brother, I hope you get well soon. Usually diagnosing a heart attack (and any medical condition) is best done by a physician who has taken your medical history (asked questions about your condition) + examined you + did tests (including labs and imaging).  If you are not comfortable with your doctors management then you have every right to find a different doctor/hospital’s consultation. I really hope you feel better soon.  And please know that the first thing a doctor will try his/her best to exclude in a patient with chest pain is a heart attack, and you are allowed to ask him on what basis was this diagnosis excluded and on what basis did his diagnosis made.  Finally, I want you to know that nearly 100% of doctors working in governmental hospitals are Burned out and are being crushed by the unimaginable amount of patients that they have to care for everyday. So getting time to actually explain what is going on to a patient with all the details of your condition is very difficult.  P.S: I still insist that understanding your condition from your doctor is your right 100%. And your experience in this hospital makes me feel sad for anyone who has to go through this.  Lots of love, brother.	1642847247.0	htq7qwv	t3_s9nsxo	t1_htohw51	/r/Egypt/comments/s9nsxo/denied_access_to_my_ct_scans_in_cairo/htq7qwv/

5wjgs5tu	What kind of improvement layman like me enjoys? Or made his life better?  Since his unblessed coming virtually everything is getting much worse. 1- No opposition to his grand holy commands (i.e there is absolutely no way to correct the path except him deciding otherwise). I liked to follow some highly educated successful mannered businessman called omar elshinqity, but because he had opinions (even tho didn't attack sisi namely, but anyone coming near to government performance must be silenced even tho it's both HIS OWN county and HIS DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE)  2- fuel which is literally everything is dependant upon gets unclear raises in prices with no clear explanation, which makes everything hell more expensive from transportation to food, so any errands or regular commute is now expensive  3- education is well-known for developing countries. I saw and appreciate the initiative that ICT is providing, but they are really limited in numbers and only targeting CS and engineering majors  4- the amount of insane taxes on pretty much everything. I fear that they know that people shit regularly and they well introduce shit tax  Each day passes with me in that country I lose hope, when I see mosg of the brightest minds no longer stand being in that shit hole and it's becoming more and more difficult to get a good education to excel in whatever area you are studying. It saddens me to see that not far from us in the occupied Palestine, a nation with less than 100 year of existence yet they manufacture numerous lucrative high-tech products and here we live in shit just because 3mo alsisi wants to build a facade of a country with his presidential places	1642862720.0	htqx80a	t3_s9fp78	t1_htqbee1	/r/Egypt/comments/s9fp78/hmmm/htqx80a/

bm9l28me	Well in between 15 years and 2050, Alexandria, half the Nile Delta, Port Said, Port Fouad, and many parts of the north coast are going to be under the sea. 40% of Egyptian industry is in the governorate of Alexandria. Over 40 million people live in the Nile Delta which is also home to many industries and has some of the country's most productive arable lands. Many of the coral reefs in Dahab have already died or have bleached. Our winters are getting shorter. Our summers are getting longer and hotter and more humid. Sea temperatures are rising. Bird and insect populations are collapsing (and they're very important for our survival). The mango season in Ismailia last year failed before it even started. Changing climate is already putting many stresses on Egyptian agriculture. More extreme weather events are becoming more frequent.  So sooner or later, the climate is going to force you to "shut the fuck up" whether you like it or not.

51uun1nk	Currency is 1$=15.6 EGPs so nothing really that big and inflation is bad here but not to the point that were dying and political we are politically Excellent we achieved everything we wanted last year except shooting the Ethiopia dam(until now we dunno what's the gov wanting to do with the dam but I trust the gov so it doesn't look that bad) and for enemies our only enemy was always Israel and sometimes turkey and Qatar tho thankfully we are tied with Israel in some gas exports so we are both making money together and we did help with making peace between them so we good and turkey and Qatar as expected fell wanting us to help them as turkey is failing financially and Qatar is failing politically and militarily and overall life here is better than ever getting better everyday and the government launching human rights programs and increasing rightful laws and giving people the freedom of religion finally and ofc overall they are replacing the whole county's rotten infrastructure and replacing with new pipes, cables,internet cables all and all and they are making a data center here to drastically increase internet speeds, ofc we are working in all sides, in health we are spending a lot on health and building new clean modern hospitals for rural areas+adding every basic need and extra need to rural areas, banning unsafe unauthorized vehicles that had been used in the streets and was the cause of death of hundreds of people over the years eg:tuktuks, and overall everything and I mean everything is improving, ofc police and law enforcement only had shitty old Chevrolet and Isuzu trucks and some weird Honda bikes, now upgraded to mercedes vans, Toyota land cruiser 70LX, and jeeps and overall better law enforcement gadgets tools and they are more responsive now and are starting to be more easy going and to become more human and ofc now you have privacy rights and property rights and not anyone could scare you anymore, and unemployment rates dropped Skyfalling from 40% to 6% probably those 6% are unregistered jobs or Uber drivers, taxi drivers and some actual unemployed ppl, anyway if you look at Egypt we are working everywhere to fix everything because centuries of colonials and corrupt leaders have really made this place a mess but everything is being fixed and ofc our army has drastically improved to the point that we are becoming an elite power in every military branch and basically there are no situations in Egypt not many or there is no problem that isn't being improved so if you ask me what is the problem here?

4vao1m4f	>Since his unblessed coming virtually everything is getting much worse. 1- No opposition to his grand holy commands (i.e there is absolutely no way to correct the path except him deciding otherwise). I liked to follow some highly educated successful mannered businessman called omar elshinqity, but because he had opinions (even tho didn't attack sisi namely, but anyone coming near to government performance must be silenced even tho it's both HIS OWN county and HIS DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE)  That's a huge overstatement. If you follow news about the parliament, you'd find MPs trashing ministers in every session and calling them for questioning even Kamel el Wazir. Sisi also has an [advisory council](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A_%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1) made from world renowned experts in each field plus his own personal advisors. Even on media, there was this economics expert who appeared on al qahira w nas who kept trashing government's economic performance even though he was using incorrect metrics out of context (he was later corrected). He wasn't touched. There many like him. Watch MP ضياء الدين داوود on el Hekaya and look how he criticized the government and the parliament with Amr Adeeb trying to swerve the conversation. Look up the video of the youth who disrespected the governor of Aswan of being a liar in front of Sisi and then Sisi took this guy and the governor to check if he's truly being lied to.  I don't know about Omar el Shinqity but if he's anything similar in accomplishments and experience to those then please tell me what he's done to compare. I'd like to learn.  &#x200B;  >2- fuel which is literally everything is dependant upon gets unclear raises in prices with no clear explanation, which makes everything hell more expensive from transportation to food, so any errands or regular commute is now expensive  Fuel is raised [according to](https://www.petroleum.gov.eg/ar-eg/media-center/news/news-pages/Pages/mop_08102021_01.aspx) international oil prices and climate. This is done by using some sort of equation or algorithm that's internationally agreed upon as far as I know.  &#x200B;  >3- education is well-known for developing countries. I saw and appreciate the initiative that ICT is providing, but they are really limited in numbers and only targeting CS and engineering majors        4- the amount of insane taxes on pretty much everything. I fear that they know that people shit regularly and they well introduce shit tax  That's because the ICT sector including CS, Data Science, Engineering, Digital Marketing, etc. is the future and the world is facing a shortage of those majors due to its sudden boom so it's actually a pretty good step especially in preparing independent freelancers since freelancing curriculum is included in the initiative. That will help immensely in job creation especially for those who can't find work.  Taxes aren't out of the ordinary when considering any other country. We're just used to get a service much cheaper than what it's worth and that contributed to the unsustainability of our public services and it's the reason why they're old and dilapidated.  I don't get your comparison with the occupation. Those people although I hate to say but they work hard and smart from the moment they occupied Palestine. They built their economy right. They have the full support of the US. They put aside any internal differences for the sake of their state. The opposite of us. We wanted the state to feed us and educate us, and that's what Mubarak did. We didn't care about how the country was faring as long as we were fed and clothed. That's what brought us to this point in the first place.  Most people lose hope before even checking if what they know are facts or just misinformation. The country is experiencing genuine change. In the end, it's up to you to believe in it or not.	1642867795.0	htr8wks	t3_s9fp78	t1_htqx80a	/r/Egypt/comments/s9fp78/hmmm/htr8wks/

bm9l28me	Will try my best to answer this as simply and as concisely as possible.  So in 1250, the Mamluks (a caste of slave soldiers) overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk Sultanate.  This lasted until 1517 when Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. However, the Mamluks remained a powerful group that still retained control over much of political, social, and cultural life in Egypt.  Then the French invaded in 1789 and occupied the country until 1801. Along the military campaign was also a French scientific expedition who were the ones that rediscovered many of the first ancient Egyptian antiquities, most significantly the Rosetta Stone. It was them who took a particular interest in all the ancient monuments and temples. It was during these years that the field of Egyptology was born. Ancient Egypt was a completely forgotten civilisation before this, even by Egyptians.  Muhammed Ali Pasha was an Albanian-Ottoman general brought in to help expel the French. In 1801, this was achieved with help from the British Empire. This was how the Rosetto Stone (and many other Egyptian antiquities) changed hands from the French to the British and is why it now stands in the British Museum, along with the rest of the Egyptian exhibition.  The French occupation weakened the Mamluks and there was a power vacuum in Egypt. Muhammed Ali Pasha seized this as an opportunity to take Egypt for himself and engaged in a power struggle with the Mamluks. He was appointed as "Wali" (or viceroy) of Egypt in 1805.  Then in 1811, Muhammed Ali Pasha consolidated his power by inviting all the Mamuk leaders to the Cairo Citadel for a celebration dinner and slaughtered them all.  He then pretty much broke Egypt away from the Ottoman Empire and ruled it independently as his own kingdom and established his own hereditary dynasty which lasted until 1952. He is regarded as the founder of Modern Egypt due to the political, economic, and military reforms he pursued. This was when the modern Egyptian military as we know it today was first established. It was also the beginning of military conscription of Egyptian men.  During his rule, he conquered Sudan, the Levant, and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He died in 1848.  The Egyptian military officer corps was restricted to native Egyptians and Sudanese and was only accessible to Egyptians of Turkish and Circassian origins. This changed during the rule of Khedive Ismail Pasha (1863-1879) when he opened the military's ranks to all Egyptians and Sudanese.  This paved the way for Ahmed Orabi, an Egyptian officer of peasant origins, to rise through the ranks to become colonel.  A combination of factors including the Suez Canal, the Egyptian-Ethiopian War, and the massive amounts of debt that Ismail Pasha owed to major European powers led to increasing British and French influence in the country. This culminated in his removal in 1879 by the British, being replaced with Tewfik Pasha.  Orabi opposed this and launched an uprising that became known as the Orabi Revolt which lasted until 1882. This led to the Anglo-Egyptian War which led to the British conquest of Egypt. The British would occupy Egypt in one way or another until 1956.  Actually, I'm kind of tired now. I'll continue this later.	1642868496.0	htralwb	t3_sa1jlq	t3_sa1jlq	/r/Egypt/comments/sa1jlq/what_happend_in_egypt_the_last_few/htralwb/

9piild8n	You should work on not only your physical art but also you should "electronize" it. Learn designing methods on computer and gradually you'll be able to apply your art there. If you master both it will help you find a job. Not only Egypt, but everywhere else this would apply. The future needs this.  My cousin graduated from fine arts. She had incredible drawing skills. But throughout uni she studied a lot of graphic designing and took tens of courses, now she's a senior 3D designer at a social media company. She uses her art skills to brainstorm ideas on paper then applies it to 3D designing program.

7v2k42y6	Best advice I got while spending my military service , especially if the leave policy is shit and you don’t get to see home for a long time ..is to try not to remember anything about your life outside of your unit. What this does is basically get you to find other ways to pass the time, you can go ahead and try to talk to other recruits ( idk if you’re a reserve officer or a conscripted soldier) but I’ll assume you’re a conscript , try to start conversations by lending someone a cigarette or inviting another recruit to enjoy a snack with you get to know where they’re from & what they do for a living and start sharing stories during your free time or when you’re on guard duty.. you’ll build relationships and those can be helpful , let’s say you make friends with a driver and when you  have a long distance walk they can offer you a ride, or let’s say they work in the mess hall (kitchen), they can pick the freshest bread for you when it’s you’re meal break.  Some units allow books and it gets easier to let things pass through inspection the more familiar and senior you get, reading can be a great pass time and an opportunity to learn new skills when you have a lot of free time.  If your unit is large and has agricultural fields you can take a nice walk around and start exploring locations and places where you can find fresh vegetables... my friends and I used to walk around and we discovered some fields that grow tomatoes and peppers we picked some and grabbed some basil leaves from a garden nearby and asked a friend of ours that worked in the mess hall to give us two uncooked chickens and we had nice bbq party in a secluded area away from the eyes of the military police and guards, we used to run across fig trees as well.  Just try to find ways to entertain yourself but whatever you do , don’t start calling your friends, girlfriend/fiancée all the time and be clingy because that way it won’t be fun you’ll just feel and sound lonelier and they will just feel sorry for you.	1642886709.0	htskhpk	t3_sa0zde	t3_sa0zde	/r/Egypt/comments/sa0zde/how_did_you_spend_are_spending_your_military/htskhpk/

bm9l28me	No dude. Don't worry. You have lived in the GCC all your life which means you're not "moqeem" in Egypt. When you go back to Egypt, you can leave again without any military papers for 6 months. All they have to see in your passport when you're departing is the date of the last entry stamp. If it's less than 6 months, they won't ask for ta2geel or izn safar. You can renew your passport and then go back to the GCC. Just remember to take your old passport to the airport. Just do not under any circumstances stay in Egypt for more than 6 months, otherwise you will need to go to the military to process your paperwork.  However, being 28, it's pretty much a 97% chance of you getting another ta2geel anyway. Although, freak incidents do happen. But the 6 month scenario I'm talking about is bullet proof.	1642899904.0	httgqww	t3_sa893o	t3_sa893o	/r/Egypt/comments/sa893o/tagneed/httgqww/

People need to chill lol  Banning things is stupid it doesn’t achieve anything other than bad press which will cost so much in the future when you overcompensate in an attempt to get rid of said bad press. They’re using Russia as an example of a great country that banned Netflix for promoting homosexuality. Wait till they hear how the USSR was atheist, but they don’t look through their argument so they won’t even realize their hypocrisy and flawed arguments.	1642906915.0	httwwkn	t3_sahj37	t3_sahj37	/r/Egypt/comments/sahj37/what_do_you_think/httwwkn/

62hnkuwb	Dude , it's almost impossible to prove martial rape , especially that most women who report it are lying to get revenge or get leverage in divorce . As for harrasment you can't prove it because it depends on witnesses , even if the woman convinced the strangers on the street to come with here to testify in the police station , they can just pay another witness to cancel the others , the same goes for any crime that depends on witnesses . We didn't have these problems before the wave degeneracy hit us in the 70s. , Women are walking around in tight and revealing clothes , sexually provoking men and teens , then they complain when some of them react .	1642907683.0	httymxw	t3_s7pzso	t1_httxmcc	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/httymxw/

Comedy especially has a way of making sexual harrasment  and catcalling a norm and a comedic act.

e1opeaix	صباح الخير ده مقال نشرته امبارح عن الفيلم —/——————————————————- عندما يمد طفلك الصغير يده ليمسك بشئ ملوث أو قذر من على الأرض على الفور تقول له "يع" أو "كخ" وهي بالمناسبة من كلمات اللغة العربية الفصحى وتستخدم لزجر الصبي عن أمر خاطئ ..ويبدو أن الفنانة منى زكى تحتاج حاليا إلى من يقول لها ذلك بعد أن تصاغرت فنيا و قررت أن تشارك فى عمل ملوث من انتاج شبكة "نت فليكس"..الفيلم انطلق يوم 20 يناير الماضى تحت اسم "أصحاب ولا أعز" وكان الاسم المناسب للفيلم هو "أصحاب ولا أع " لأن كل أبطال الفيلم المفترض أنهم أصدقاء العمر يرتكبون أفعال شائنة لا يسعك ألا أن تقول عليها سوى "أع" و "يع" وكل ما نقوله على تلك الأشياء التي تثير الشعور بالقرف من تلك العلاقات الغير سوية التي اجتمعت جميعها بين مجموعة صغيرة من الأصدقاء الذين يعيشون في لبنان ..        منى زكي تخرج علينا بدور زوجة سكيرة تخون زوجها على مواقع التواصل الاجتماعى وصديقهم الآخر يخون زوجته مع زوجة أعز اصدقائه وابنة الصديقة الأخرى ذات الـ18 عاما تكتشف الأم أنها على علاقة جنسية بشاب آخر وعندما تخبر زوجها بالأمر يرفض الأب تعنيف الابنة بدعوى أنها حرة تفعل ما تشاء واخيرا يظهر علينا صديقهم الشاذ جنسيا ويتم تقديمه على أساس أنه ضحية المجتمع العربي الرافض لفكرة شذوذه ويتعرض بسببه للظلم والطرد من عمله وسخرية من حوله أما صديقه المصرى"إياد نصار" فيقف الى جانبه ويدعمه .. بالطبع لايخفى على أحد أن نشر ثقافة الشذوذ الجنسي وتقبله فى المجتمعات البشرية هو أحد الأهداف الواضحة لمنصة "نت فليكس" منذ انطلاقها عام 1997        ..العام الماضى صرحت منى زكى أنها اكتشفت انه لا يوجد ما يسمى بـ سينما نظيفة وسينما «مبقعة» وأن هذا المصطلح أطلقه المنتجون وكانت هى صغيرة وقتها واقتنعت به ولكنها اكتشفت بعد ذلك أنه مفهوم خاطئ مؤكدة أن مصطلح السينما النظيفة عطلها فنيا كثيرا وجعلها ترفض أدوارا جيدة ستكون علامة فارقة في مشوارها..انتهت تصريحات منى زكي وهى فنانة مميزة بلا شك لكن مشاركتها فى هذا العمل لا أعتقد أنه سيكون علامة فارقة فى مشوارها الفنى بل هى وصمة سيئة لتقديمها عملا فنيا فى اعتقادى هو أسوأ من أفلام المقاولات التى كان يتم إنتاجها وتصويرها في لبنان خلال ستينيات القرن الماضى من أجل المال ..        نحن لا ننتقد منى زكي لأنها تجردت من براءتها المعهودة في أعمالها الفنية السابقة و لا لأنها قدمت الشخصية بجرأة في الصورة وفي الألفاظ ولكن لأن الأفكار الخاطئة و المنبوذة في المجتمع العربي مثل الشذوذ الجنسي وحرية ممارسة الجنس خارج إطار الزواج تم تقديمها فى فيلمها بشكل يدعم ويشجع تلك الأفكار بدلا من إنكارها ونبذها وتلك السينما ليس هنا هدفها تقديم فن راقى أو حل مشكلة ما أو طرح الواقع ولكنها هنا سينما لتغيير الأفكار حول أمور هى مدمرة فى الأساس للمجتمعات البشرية ..        بالطبع لمنى زكى الحق فى تقديم سينما نظيفة أو "مبقعة" لكن عندما تشارك فى أعمال فنية هدفها تمرير عادات ملوثة وسيئة والدفاع عنها تحت باب الحرية الفنية هنا يجب أن نقف أمامها ونقول لها "كخ" يا منى و "يع" يا منى.        خارج المقال        ما يحدث من نقاش وجدال يحقق نجاح شبكة نت فليكس فى تحقيق اهدافها وهو جعل المجتمعات تتقبل اشياء لم تكن تتقبلها        نزّلها بكثافة في الأفلام والمسلسلات،        هيحصل normalization للشئ ده،        وشوية المجتمع هيقل رفضه للشئ ده وهيبدأ يتقبّله،        الأفلام والمسلسلات مش بتعكس الواقع،        الأفلام والمسلسلات بتشكّل الواقع،	1642923677.0	htut6px	t3_sanuv3	t1_htusf87	/r/Egypt/comments/sanuv3/يع_منى_زكى_فى_أصحاب_ولا_أعز/htut6px/

6ywx4ogg	I once got some oranges from a grocery store near our home. Everything was fine, we ate all of them like they were normal oranges. I ate 1, but my mom loved them; so she ate 2 or 3.  The day after, my dad was hungry, and he went to eat. He saw the oranges in the kitchen, and because my mom thought they were great, my dad got them. He was eating his first one, when he saw random holes on the inside of the orange.  My dad paused, and looked inside it. He saw tens of very fat and disgusting, yellowish-white worms. My sad instantly threw the oranges in the trash, and warned everyone not to eat them again. He told my mom why (she instantly went tp the bathroom) but he didn't want to tell me.  I found out myself when I looked in the trash that the oranges were in, and saw hundreds of worms crawling on the oranges and the left over food that's in there.   That happend in 2010; its 2022 now, and I haven't had an orange since then.	1642924493.0	htuuahc	t3_sa9lda	t1_htsigws	/r/Egypt/comments/sa9lda/let_him_cook/htuuahc/

I have a healthy BMI, on the skinny side of things, but otherwise i am okay.  I have ADHD next to all of this, my doctor said the medication for ADHD can't do this much damage, which makes sense since the medication is supposed to increase heart rate a little bit, not go from resting heart rate of 60~ to 115~  Taking Ivabradine, and at the very least i now don't wake up feeling like someone is stabbing me with a hot needle.	1642929118.0	htv0dgc	t3_s9nsxo	t1_htuzyfp	/r/Egypt/comments/s9nsxo/denied_access_to_my_ct_scans_in_cairo/htv0dgc/

l84e04d	إجابة من واحد مش مصري (لكن هذا لا يعني الحياد):  مصر الآن قاعدة تطبق في برامج ومقترحات صندوق النقد الدولي، الي هي عادة تتمثل في تحرير المبادرة الاقتصادية الخاصة وتنقيص حجم القطاع العمومي، سواء كان هذا القطاع اجتماعي (يعني الدولة تصرف أقل على الحماية الاجتماعية للمواطنين) أو اقتصادي (يعني الدولة تخصخص شركاتها الأهلية).  عادة هذي البرامج تنتج نمو اقتصادي خاصة بفضل المستثمرين الأجانب (وهذا الي نشوفوه في مصر حاليا) ولكن في نفس الوقت تتسبب (على الأقل وقتيا) في تفقير المواطنين بسبب غلاء المعيشة وتناقص الحماية الاجتماعية. الفكر الاقتصادي الغالب يعتبر أن هذا الفقر مؤقت وأن النمو الاقتصادي هو الذي سيوفر الثراء للأمة.  يعني بهذه الرؤية مصر في الطريق الصحيح.   لكن بعض علماء الاقتصاد (خاصة التركي دارون آجام أغلو Daron Acemoglu) يعتبرون أن نموا اقتصاديا بهذا الشكل لا يمكن أن يتواصل مدة طويلة في ظل الإطار السياسي الحالي في مصر: حيث يؤدي التوزيع الغير عادل القوة السياسية لتوزيع غير عادل للقوة الاقتصادية، وتتكون طبقة قليلة من الفاعلين الاقتصاديين الذين يمنعون أي توزيع للثروة ويتنهون إلى تحاصص الاقتصاد ومقاومة أي تجديد فيه، وهو ما سينتهي بتعطيل عجلة النمو الاقتصادي. يعني لتلخيص الفكرة: الدكتاتورية يمكن تدفع وقتيا الاقتصاد في الاتجاه الصحيح، لكن الديموقراطيات هي وحدها التي تستطيع المحافظة على نموها على مدى العقود.  يعني بهذه الرؤية لن تواصل مصر في الطريق الصحيح إلا إذا تغير النظام السياسي في مصر.   Check out "why nations fail" and "the narrow corridor", two books by Daron Acemoglu.  You can check what the IMF and the World Bank think of Egypt on the internet, but in general: they are satisfied.	1642931920.0	htv3wur	t3_sadago	t3_sadago	/r/Egypt/comments/sadago/بدون_أى_تحيز_وياريت_الرد_يكون_منطقى_وبلاش_خناقه/htv3wur/

59gvqr69	Well You can call it tetra pentapolar. So an average egyptian wants :- 1- Sharia law and an all muslim society where people can only live with our “standards and values”. BUT not like taliban or saudi arabia because this will prevent him from doing in the dark his usual sins.  2- He profoundly despise minority groups in Egypt like gays, non theists (or basically anyone who is not muslim except christians with certain conditions) and sometimes even immigrants. BUT when he goes to live in the west he demands respect and appreciation for his culture and religion.  3- He doesn’t want to see on TV acts that insult the modesty and the morality of the arab culture. BUT He beats his dick 5 times a day instead of even praying.  4- He wants a democratic country and freedom of speech. BUT no one can criticize his religion, political direction and traditions. And no freewill for his children especially if he has girls.  5- He claims that we “arabs” are not great as in the middle ages because we are less muslim than before. BUT little does he know that in the islamic golden age it was much more secular than even now and people focused more on sciences and research and translation and cared less about who fucks who and which is the right way to pour the boiling water in a sink without demons coming out.  And so on.. infinite examples Maybe we as (most) egyptians we feel that we don’t have many achievements from our country and neither ourselves. So only religion and traditions that can give us a sense of identity that’s why when you criticize them you’re basically criticizing the whole identity.	1642933120.0	htv5gfz	t3_sapqiz	t3_sapqiz	/r/Egypt/comments/sapqiz/egyptians_and_bipolarity/htv5gfz/

2i585n6a	I don't think that is what medical Bipolarity would look like. I'd say this is a product of bad education though. So you're raised with double standards as a kid, not fully religious and not fully irrelegious. I thank Allah that my Mother raised me with an understanding of both sides and why being religious is the right way in life. She even made me do my own research when it came to religion in order to find evidence based proof and all. So when it comes to my morality and my standards I derive those from Allah. And one of his verses in the Quran say بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم { ثُمَّ أَنتُمۡ هَـٰۤؤُلَاۤءِ تَقۡتُلُونَ أَنفُسَكُمۡ وَتُخۡرِجُونَ فَرِیقࣰا مِّنكُم مِّن دِیَـٰرِهِمۡ تَظَـٰهَرُونَ عَلَیۡهِم بِٱلۡإِثۡمِ وَٱلۡعُدۡوَ ٰ⁠نِ وَإِن یَأۡتُوكُمۡ أُسَـٰرَىٰ تُفَـٰدُوهُمۡ وَهُوَ مُحَرَّمٌ عَلَیۡكُمۡ إِخۡرَاجُهُمۡۚ أَفَتُؤۡمِنُونَ بِبَعۡضِ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبِ وَتَكۡفُرُونَ بِبَعۡضࣲۚ فَمَا جَزَاۤءُ مَن یَفۡعَلُ ذَ ٰ⁠لِكَ مِنكُمۡ إِلَّا خِزۡیࣱ فِی ٱلۡحَیَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنۡیَاۖ وَیَوۡمَ ٱلۡقِیَـٰمَةِ یُرَدُّونَ إِلَىٰۤ أَشَدِّ ٱلۡعَذَابِۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا تَعۡمَلُونَ } [Surah Al-Baqarah: 85]. So Egyptians tend to cherry pick whatever they want from religion whenever it suits their current agenda. Which as you can see is treated just like being a hypocrite. This is not a product of religion though, rather the lack of good education when it comes to religion.	1642934567.0	htv7buh	t3_sapqiz	t3_sapqiz	/r/Egypt/comments/sapqiz/egyptians_and_bipolarity/htv7buh/

6k5keq6r	Alcohol (wine) is taken in Christian rituals, so completely criminalizing it will be discriminatory. Putting a provisions for sacramental wine and medicinal alcohol will create a loophole to acquire it. Making it illegal will make it a desired commodity that will be traded untaxed in the black markets. It also means no regulation or control over distribution, so underaged kids could acquire it easily if they could get a dealer, and it will cause endemic addiction as people will more easily find it outside legal bounds, since black markets have no legal oversights and could sprout out anywhere.  Alcohol is here to stay, unfortunately, best thing we could do is make sure consuming it becomes socially unacceptable, arrest public drunkards and drunk drivers with harsh sentences, and advertise its bad effects on society like we do tobacco.  With all said, hasheesh is a much less dangerous drug and less addictive than alcohol, it makes no sense to keep alcohol perfectly legal while thousands of tons of hasheesh go untaxed. I seriously predict billions of pounds of income and reduced illegal use if hasheesh is legalized.	1642944608.0	htvlk1i	t3_sas3oo	t3_sas3oo	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htvlk1i/

An idea that does not hold up against scrutiny is no valid idea, but a brittle one that is based on its followers not questioning it (along with many methods of manipulation such as saying that if you don’t believe in a certain claim you’ll burn forever and ever and ever.)  >respect those who share the land with you  For people idk, I do respect Muslims as much as I respect cow worshippers as much as I respect atheists. I do not care about your beliefs as long as they are personal and that you do not try (for example) to impose them upon the film industry.   >I hope one of those strict values is not insulting someone’s intellect for believing  I absolutely do not. Faith is not a matter of intellect, but emotion. Fear of hellfire is a matter of emotion. Being scared of admitting that you on this floating earth know no more about your purpose than fungus on a rotten piece of bread rolling down a hill is a matter of emotion.  The sun is way way way bigger than all planets combined, the solar system is way way way bigger than the sun, the galaxy is way way way bigger than the solar system and there are more galaxies than your mind can comprehend.

coscn9zv	Options 1 and 2 are very expensive, exhausting and I don't recommend them. Idk what desert are planning to explore tbh.   Option 3 is doable.. but you will end up spending more money than the night train. I'd recommend exploring Al-Menia governorate.   The night train is what I'd recommend. Nile cruise is a great option as well. Might be a little bit expensive but it's worth it.  Finally, it's illegal to pay unlicensed tour guide. This will get them in trouble.

3lpx6rj2	The idea isn't brittle, and it isn't based on its followers, it's a independent system of belief that will last as long as universe exists.  >impose them upon the film industry.  People have all the right to impose what they believe in on any type of media or content, because that type of media can be clashing with the fundamental ideas said people believe in. They're not stopping the content from being produced, they're stopping said content from being shown to the public because it's indecent.  >I absolutely do not. Faith is not a matter of intellect, but emotion.  That has to be one of the most wild claims I ever heard. One doesn't have faith in something just because one feels like it, your intellect has a main role in deciding whether something is logical and worthy of believing in or not. Your intellect judged something to be not worthy to believe in, someone else did, so by insulting what they believe in with such disturbing words, you are indirectly insulting their intellect, by which, you're putting yourself superior while you're no better than the one you're speaking to.  >The sun is way way way bigger than all planets combined, the solar system is way way way bigger than the sun, the galaxy is way way way bigger than the solar system and there are more galaxies than your mind can comprehend.  Looking at all this, one can only look an wonder how such vast and wide universe came to be, once you establish how and why, we can then speak about the narratives circling around the world. Until then, don't disrespect the belief, and never use such words to describe a prophet again.

18wu8jtt	this is so wrong. get your facts straight instead of having uneducated takes.  British and French colonialism led to the increase of homophobia and misogyny. they came to Africa and the Levant to see women having rights and gays being accepted, so they thought we were "uncivilized" and they needed to civilize us.   if you had the bare amount of curiosity or respect for the fight against colonialism you could've at the very least opened the [wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Egypt) and read about LGBT history in Egypt, which is very vague in itself but still leads you to the direction that colonialism introduced extreme homophobia, the one you're practicing, in Egypt.   anyway, if you're denying the existence of homosexuality historically in Egypt pre-colonialism, you are wrong. Ever since the 17th century some of the British and French orientalists visiting Egypt and surrounding countries recorded their surprise and shock of the normality of homosexual occurances. i share with you the screenshots [(1/2)](https://ibb.co/1ZGmbHQ) and [(2/2)](https://ibb.co/X7DP70h) from the academic article [Homosexuality in the Middle East: An Agenda for Historical Research by Bruce W. Dunne](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41857885). these screenshots include commentary on homosexuality in our region by westerners who later colonized us, encouraged and instilled extreme homophobia in our culture. the screenshots represent less than a page of the whole article, which i recommend reading for understanding our history and struggle against colonialism better.  if you bothered to do further research and understood how Africans had their queer sexualities suppressed by colonialist forces, you will understand how the westerners viewed us.  you sound very ignorant "fighting" colonialism with the same justifications colonialists made. i hope this aggressive but educational critique encourages you and others to do your own research beyond what you see on social media and biased articles.  if you need more resources, let me know i am more than happy to share papers i've read and liked.	1642950698.0	htvxqpi	t3_sarjnt	t1_htvjay6	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/htvxqpi/

That said, we shouldn't interfere in people's liberty, even if what they are doing is dumb or sinful. Additionally, I think people will seek these no matter what, so that will create an underground black market, which will engage in criminal activity and will be a gateway to even more dangerous drugs. I propose to discourage these behaviors and not allow them to openly advertise, but still acceptable for those, who want them.	1642950775.0	htvxwvg	t3_sas3oo	t1_htvlk1i	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htvxwvg/

hqskt3bf	Actually, people have ever been in dismay of what the show bizz portrays to be an average citizen’s daily life, but, they haven’t had a means to voice that sense of discontentment up until social media rolled about. Now, you’ve got a whole lot of people saying all sorts of things with people in charge of law making sneakily watching former people through their screens buying into their bullshit and making laws as such. While there might be one thing in the show I’m not fully in approval of—nor will I ever be on a personal level that is anything remotely having to do with LGBT— I don’t think it should have been this much talked about.	1642950936.0	htvya8q	t3_sarjnt	t3_sarjnt	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/htvya8q/

6k5keq6r	No, you missed the point. Taxes are a sweet side effect, but the real benefit is regulation.  I am talking from several historical precedents, when prohibition (outlawing) alcohol was attempted in the US, every single person including the police, bribed or not, tried to completely ignore the law and drinking levels became much higher than before.  After the prohibition was lifted, regulations were put in place, you can't drink in public, you can't act drunk, you can't drive while drunk, you can't drink under the age of 21, you can't sell alcohol above a certain level in regular stores, you can't sell alcohol without a license which puts you under constant inspection, etc.   Same goes for child labor, which is also legal, but now children are forbidden from working in lung destroying collapse hazard coal mines. They have to work in less dangerous clerk jobs, have limited work time with a minimum wage, and they must not skip school or stay out at night. It wasn't made completely illegal since poor families rely on working family members of all ages, and making it illegal would doom them to hunger. But with regulation, you can at least guarantee your children won't get stuck in chimneys.  Even heroin and cocaine are legal as pain killers, which share the exact same chemical composition as the street drugs, but instead of people getting addicted while relieving pain with unregulated street drug, they could get a prescription that says they actually need pain killers, and go get legal drugs with a certain dosage and amounts that are less likely to result in addiction.   I won't go to marriage since it is not a commodity and it does not share the same characteristics that produce detectable income.	1642952230.0	htw1buw	t3_sas3oo	t1_htvq38u	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htw1buw/

By legalizing it's use under conditions like: no driving and only home use it's going to be safer for every one that already uses it. plus it'll be safer to purchase the substance without any bad chemicals that may cause even more problems and it'll bring a whole lot of tax money.  add this to that and the fact that [marijuana is safer than tobacco](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/01/98519/marijuana-shown-be-less-damaging-lungs-tobacco#:~:text=A%20large%2Dscale%20national%20study,many%20of%20the%20same%20components)  and boom the only thing preventing this is bad perception of an already existing business. lol	1642953429.0	htw4bep	t3_sas3oo	t1_htvxwvg	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htw4bep/

c9puvak6	We live in a family house, no rent, my husband runs his car, I walk almost all of the time every where every now and then I'll take a cab or urber. His petrol money doesn't come out of the house money. We have 2 grown daughters, a small son my mother who is on a very small pension less than 1000le so we help her and my mother in law, who is on a much larger pension 6000le a month but we feed them both and neither contribute to the house. So basically 6 adults and one child, all food, bills, and phone recharging, internet, the kid's picket money and we do not eat out ,maybe once a month and I shop around for the best prices. We live on 10,000le a month. It's really getting difficult to make it to the end of the month and he thinks I am being extravagant.	1642955299.0	htw8zqe	t3_sas8fn	t1_htvs77v	/r/Egypt/comments/sas8fn/how_much_is_enough/htw8zqe/

2n0jbxn	Question is why would you hypothetically speak Japanese as a first language? Were you raised in Japan your entire life? Do you have any connection to Egypt? At that point you'd be ethnically Egyptian. For example like some Pakistanis in England who had only been there for 2-3 generations but almost have no ties to Pakistan.  And that's just when the Japanese starts with you or your parents.  In reality it's like our parents (and the generations before them) spoke Japanese, developed Japanese culture, immigrated to and from Japan for 1200+ years, dominated Japanese media from music to movies and shows, and became the biggest Japanese speaking country. That when mentioned to citizens of other Japanese speaking countries is recognized as the biggest one and even bigger and more relevant than Japan itself.	1642958627.0	htwhnf9	t3_s9va1n	t1_htw74y6	/r/Egypt/comments/s9va1n/bruh/htwhnf9/

c26nmqc6	السينما المصرية لحد قبل الثورة كانت سينما منفتحة (بغض النظر عن المشهد اللي في الصورة) و كانت اشبه بالسينما الغربية متحررة الافكار و الرؤى بس برضه كان فيه جانب اجتماعي مصري مشترك في اغلب الافلام  السينما من ٥٢ ل ٧٠ كانت اعظم فترات السينما المصرية الافلام كانت منوعة و كل حاجة حاجة كانت محترمة و ليها هدف حتى الكوميديا وراها هدف يا اما اجتماعي يا وطني حتى البوس مكنش مبتذل و السينما كانت خالية من الإيحاءات  السينما في السبعينات كانت اسوء مراحل السينما تقنيا و اجتماعيا ، بدأنا نشوف افلام كتير مالهاش لازمة حرفيا و اعتقد لولا يوسف شاهين كان من باب أولى نلغي الفترة دي من تاريخ السينما في مصر ، و شفنا انقلاب مش بس على الذوق العام لا على القيم كمان  السينما من ٨٠ ل ٢٠٠٠ كانت سينما اغلبها محافظ و اغلبها ناقش قضايا اجتماعية و شفنا افلام بنكهة سياسية كويسة اوي  السينما في الالفينات كانت اكثر تحررا لحد ما السينما بعد ٢٠١٥ تقريبا و السينما و التلفزيون اللي كان طول عمره محافظ بقوا فجأة لا يشبهون المجتمع المصري تماما ، بقت سينما كل همها مناقشة التابوهات عشان تكسر فكرة مناقشة او عرض حاجة غير مألوفة و خلاص مش عشان هدف او مورال معين.  بغض النظر عن مصطفى بكري اللي بيعر* على نفسه  فعلا احنا بقى عندنا كارثة اجتماعية اسمها سينما و تلفزيون و اعلانات كمان	1642963537.0	htwugix	t3_sarjnt	t3_sarjnt	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/htwugix/

That is not to say that they should get ostracized or shunned but don’t expect of people to be that much nice to them either. Actually this is the very kind of disposition that gets people repulsed away from even considering to embrace them in and have em be less looked down upon, they need to understand that this notion of same sex relationship is so foreign to them and had actually been regarded as freak behavior for the better part of humanity’s recorded history—that is putting religion aside, so for you to pop up and suddenly expect of them to be not only accepting and approving of your preference but also like and be afond of you is a bit of a reach, you have to compromise a bit to find common ground, unless you don’t and this is some personal vandetta and you deliberately are trying to make them out to be the worse party in this engagement.	1642965439.0	htwzbot	t3_sarjnt	t1_htwuvnd	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/htwzbot/

hqskt3bf	Now that is a completely different topic from what i’m talking about right now and quite the abrupt transition on your side of this conversation but i’ll tag along, this is of course savage behavior that should be shunned and severely stricken off what we regard as normal, and while there are a lot of people doing this wicked practice, i don’t think they constitute as many as half the women. See, this sort of demeanor where you go on to throw in a gauge that is not even close to what is real is what gets people not wanting to do anything with you people, because you keep on antagonizing them and setting yourselves further apart over fear of being attributed with them when they could really use your take on other cruicial pressing issues but you’ve made yourself out to be this inaccessible imbecile who won’t offer up tangibe solution but go on and on and whine about every other thing to veneer your lack of worthy input, in due respect.	1642966045.0	htx0uyq	t3_sarjnt	t1_htwzv4i	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/htx0uyq/

2i585n6a	What do you believe if I may ask, hmm? Cause I can tell you that there are thousands upon thousands that accept Islam as the true religion of God everyday, and they're not specific to one race/region. So you're basically saying that these people are stupid, since they believe in what you believe to be stupid mythical old shit. And do you know why they accept it as the truth. Because the people that convey Islam to them are 1000x better at explaining it than any Islamic studies teacher we have in our "Islamic countries", and because they *seek* the truth. These people convey Islam with rationale and not with blind faith like most people in our own countries do, they answer any questions or criticism with evidence based knowledge. They do not oppose criticism, because if you are one to oppose criticism then you know that what you are conveying is already false. So tell me please, what do you believe in?	1642966112.0	htx1121	t3_sacqt5	t1_htwyhoe	/r/Egypt/comments/sacqt5/two_sessions_and_sixteen_hours_of_pain_later/htx1121/

4vao1m4f	First of all, I'd like to apologize. I didn't know how much of ill reputation that Doctor had, he's an antivaxxer and downright scammer, now I know.  With that out of the way, I'd like to say that him being the the scammer he is, doesn't change the fact that Alcoholism does have those exact harmful effects. When comparing cancer rates in areas where Alcohol does most harm, Alcohol drinkers are much more likely to get cancer in the liver and the oropharynx (back of the throat).  I disagree with it being because of poor screening at all since it'll still show cancer rates metrics and studies (which it doesn't) unless you want to imply that both screening of Cancer and Alcoholism are both poor. My point still stands.  I'm not trying to prove a niche point or an unpopular opinion here. Alcohol is harmful period. What's harmful must be criminalized even if it has some "good uses". The harm drastically outweighs the good. We don't need a problem of drunkards in our country.	1642966199.0	htx1902	t3_sas3oo	t1_htwp2wa	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htx1902/

8t68a	Legalising weed :   1- drug smugglers will go out of business   2- taxing said weed industry will get egypt millions in revenue  3- said revenue can be used to better the healthcare system or the education system  4- less people doing time and ruining their lives due to petty possession of hash/weed charges that will turn them into criminals later  5-police can focus more on the not talked about heroin epidemic we are in the middle in   6- medicinal marijuana has been shown to be very effective in combating certain long term diseases "under a doctor's strict supervision" like glaucoma , PTSD , an analgesic that is a better alternative than opioids     Just as it is with the alcohol industry, if ya dont want it dont buy it. But even if it's criminalised people will find a way to get it even if it carries the death penalty "like thailand" so if its already being consumed by everyone the government might as well just supervise the whole thing and make money off of it	1642966647.0	htx2dwi	t3_sas3oo	t1_htwvgpu	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htx2dwi/
rbyrbfj	A cloud engineer is basically an engineer who has knowledge of AWS (Amazon Web Services), Azure or GCP (there are other providers like IBM and Oracle but they are not as popular). You can be a solution architect, devop, system admin, network and security, or a data scientist; you have to figure out where to start based on your preference. I’m an advocate for AWS, so you can explore their certs, I’d recommend solution architecture to know your way around their services before going for a specialty like machine learning or data science. On the other hand, tech support vacancies depend on how knowledgeable you are to be able to make some big bucks but you won’t go above 15k net, at least as far as I’ve seen.	1642966706.0	htx2j6a	t3_saqcyj	t1_htvl310	/r/Egypt/comments/saqcyj/what_jobs_in_egypt_earn_you_a_salary_of_10k_le/htx2j6a/

68awe	Oh I don't disagree with you that alcoholism does have harmful effects. I don't know the details but I'd assume cancer metric reporting isn't as accurate in somewhere like Egypt, and I'd wager a lot dying before getting definitively diagnosed (e.g. Vomiting blood to death as someone with chronic liver failure with liver cancer). And I think we're discounting the other variables that contribute to cancer formation in our countries such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, smoking, obesity, etc. which are much higher compared to other countries in western Europe for example.   As for your other point I doubt criminalising alcohol will lead to lower usage. The only reason a lot of Egyptians aren't alcoholics is because they can't consistently get their hands on good alcohol because it's heavily taxed to death and is relatively expensive. Drinking a few beers in Egypt as a working class person would be financially unattainable. And I seriously have problems with criminalising substances because they're "harmful" as that could relatively grow to form an umbrella of substances that are relatively harmful.	1642967814.0	htx5c9d	t3_sas3oo	t1_htx1902	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htx5c9d/

It's pretty hypocritical for the same men who watch two women having sex to claim that homosexuality or any scenes portraying homosexuality as "haram", "immoral", or "an attack on Egyptian morals".  I just find it ironic that the same homophobes attacking the film have probably watched lesbian porn and took pleasure in it at some point.	1642968356.0	htx6q41	t3_sarjnt	t3_sarjnt	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/htx6q41/

2n0jbxn	Do African Americans call themselves Nigerian/Kenyan/Congolese?  Do Irish Americans call themselves Celtic?  It's already a given that we're Egyptian.   Arabic as a culture was developed far more by Egypt/Levant/Iraq/Maghreb than in the peninsula. Even culturally most of the terms we use and traditions we have today are very much localized (as is with the rest of the Arab world) so what exactly is there to change? Go back to Coptic? which was Egyptian localized Greek?  I can't find any reason for running from the word "Arab" other than to cave in for smooth brained idiots who claim Egyptians today aren't descendants from the ancient Egyptians. Even then, if enough idiots run the government and we change to "Coptic" identity, that'd still be Greek. They won't care no matter how much we change branding. They don't actually care about that.  And if you're upset that greasy brained Americans can't differentiate between you and an Iraqi or a Palestinian Arab then the fault's on them. But that doesn't mean we aren't Egyptian Arabs. The two terms aren't mutually exclusive.	1642969712.0	htxa6yi	t3_s9va1n	t1_htwkymt	/r/Egypt/comments/s9va1n/bruh/htxa6yi/

4vao1m4f	> I'd assume cancer metric reporting isn't as accurate in somewhere like Egypt, and I'd wager a lot dying before getting definitively diagnosed (e.g. Vomiting blood to death as someone with chronic liver failure with liver cancer). And I think we're discounting the other variables that contribute to cancer formation in our countries such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, smoking, obesity, etc. which are much higher compared to other countries in western Europe for example.  The cases you mention are oddly specific and the huge difference in cancer rates between both regions can't only be justified on cancer reporting metrics. Having the Heptatitis family of viruses is all the more reason to consider criminalizing Alcohol we don't need more problems, even then it's such a small margin that can't offset the huge difference in cancer cases. We're talking about a difference of around x20 more excluding oropharynx cases iirc.   Criminalizing alcohol will definitely lead to lower usage. Assuming that a lot of Egyptians would like to get their hand on cheap liquor is quite the bold assumption. Don't underestimate the psychological factor when considering religion and the peer pressure the Egyptian society will place on someone who just started drinking alcohol especially if he's a Muslim.  Last, harmful substances should be criminalized regardless of how its consumers respond. If being taxed to death helped in averting alcoholism then criminalizing it would surely help as well. There are mechanisms that the state can put into place to curb consumption of such substances, coupled with raising public awareness and proper regulations of course.	1642971246.0	htxe9wi	t3_sas3oo	t1_htx5c9d	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/htxe9wi/

Also, you are thinking in linguistic and cultural terms, we are not getting to a point of understanding. You see, an Egyptian who's first language is English, French, Chinese, Arabic, is still Egyptian. Because of his blood and genes. Our origins are all the same, no matter if we are called in the Greek or Arabic way. Egyptian = Copt = Masri = Kemetic. For example, is a German person Deutsch or Allemand?

That means that movies should be allowed to deal with the issue of homosexuality without people getting up in arms.

Listen, a 30+ year of corruption will not be fixed overnight so while the government is fixing all that trauma of years and years of corruption, can we all just shut the fuck up and wait it out? There is literally no other option and trolling on an Egyptian reddit where people who grew up here and the others who are over 40 are eagerly waiting for Egypt to get back on it’s feet, you’re REALLY not helping.

They failed to stop people from watching the movies and eventually gave up so the only solution for who considers it a problem is to either watch everything before thier kids to make sure it's safe or just stop using the platform because you know they'll represent things that are against our culture and morals , Alcohol , dating , homosexuality, دياثة   All these things are immoral here but there's almost zero movies on Netflix that doesn't contain every single one if those things i don't if they're trying to force a culture that isn't ours or they don't really care about the watcher as long as they get paid	1642977493.0	htxum49	t3_sahj37	t1_htxgmyi	/r/Egypt/comments/sahj37/what_do_you_think/htxum49/

The government punish any films that they consider anti-culture , but they do not reward or give attention to the masterpieces that the Egyptian cinema brought out . This affects the collective outlook of films and art in our community the be seen as just entertainment material   I don't say that to have great art you have to put any thing that may seen as imprudence but if the government gonna "ban" bad art it has to give some attention to good art as making film analyitcs and discussions be more on TV and internet and somehow make art appreciation part of the culture	1642980950.0	hty3t93	t3_sb46jn	t3_sb46jn	/r/Egypt/comments/sb46jn/why_are_people_triggered/hty3t93/

Economy is a social science, culture matters.   It occurs to me that maybe what you meant is Turkish = Erdogan = supports MB = critical towards Sisi = biased. If this i she case than let me tell you you are way off and you've been watching too much Egyptian television. Acemoglu is critical towards all types of autocratic government, especially the Turkish government.	1642983300.0	hty9j1l	t3_sadago	t1_hty6v2t	/r/Egypt/comments/sadago/بدون_أى_تحيز_وياريت_الرد_يكون_منطقى_وبلاش_خناقه/hty9j1l/

I wonder what he thought about Turkish economy. Both countries, very ironically, are somewhat under the same authoritarian model.   And listen, there is definitely another way to do things in Egypt, and it’s natural to have other opposing opinions. However, you always need to consider underlying motives or even only biases of those who argue different opinions.

62hnkuwb	> People can wear what they want and u have no right to touch anyone  Bullshit , that logic was debunked repeatedly by psychology , the primal reason for women wanting to expose flesh is to ask for sex , you can reframe it all you want , but that's your subconscious reason why you want to dress like that is that you want to seduce men , but you get made mad when harrased because this is not the type of attention you were looking for , basically they wear exposing clothes to seduce men on their terms , it's selfish and disrespectful , in a way it's also a subtle harrasment for men , not so different from a man trying to seduce a woman on his terms (both of them are not seduction by the way , both make them uncomfortable and annoyed)  Harrasment and rape are not the same , harrasment is a social issue , rap is a mental illness , any man can harras , but very few men can rape .The west is screaming from the rooftops about harrasment and rape , they are calling it rape culture , and also you are comparing a society where fornication is the norm with a religious society where poverty made the youth lost hope in marriage , despite that harrasment and rape is spread in the west way more in Egypt , add to that most of our harrasment is catcalling , the west doesn't even consider this harrasment , the comparison is not valid in anyway .	1642988290.0	htylha6	t3_s7pzso	t1_htx5ea7	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/htylha6/

General rape is really hard to prove , doesn't help that they have an established consent (the marriage contract ) , they are already having sex , almost impossible to prove that she didn't consent in a specific time .	1642988863.0	htymwdm	t3_s7pzso	t1_htx57j9	/r/Egypt/comments/s7pzso/this/htymwdm/

j96q2aa	Just cause most 20 year olds now have exes doesn't mean you're missing out, I'm not a professional but what would be fun about just dating anyone for the sake of just wanting to date only to breakup soon after, in my opinion you're better off taking it slow, no need to rush into it just cause everyone else is, get to know some guys maybe be friends first and see how things go from there, you could always initiate the conversation or to ask to hang out if they're interested, lots of things you can do and figure out but don't just jump into it cause you feel like you're missing out it most likely won't end well	1642990920.0	htyrt8p	t3_sb9w6y	t3_sb9w6y	/r/Egypt/comments/sb9w6y/how_do_you_girls_date_in_egypt/htyrt8p/

38bo8wr8	Good luck. I think it's just about taking a step out of the comfort zone and socializing. It's really hard and scary but that's possibly the only way to get a date. Or you can just wait for someone to approach you, but you gotta show people that you're approachable. Many can be very scared and worried of rejection or society looking down on them for doing such a thing.  That's really all I can say, not very experienced myself if you hadn't noticed lol.	1642991186.0	htysh10	t3_sb9w6y	t1_htyrlx5	/r/Egypt/comments/sb9w6y/how_do_you_girls_date_in_egypt/htysh10/

8pued	Right, I'll be frank, 10k isn't enough for 6 adults and one child.  from what I understand, that's the whole sum that you use for everything.  I live with 3 other adults, utilities alone cost about 1.1k which is split between us 4. (and 2 of us aren't home almost at all!)  if we talk about grocories, for myself, I spend about 800egp.  transportation (I don't go out much unless exams/work emergencies) ~240egp.  my phone bill is exetremly cheap (again, don't go out much) ~50egp   add in ~150 egp for god know's what cause that's how life is.  without rent, I'm paying about 1600egp a month for an exetremly low maintence needs.  So this is my barebones budget, I didn't count in anything extra that would usually be done on a whim.

Socializing, however, have greatly increased my access to girls. I got to know a lot of girls just by the mere act of approaching people. Not that I managed to achieve my main goal, namely finding a partner, but I guess I am on the right path. It may take some time, but it will happen eventually. Even if it didn't, I will know then that I did my best.

I don’t want to send a morning text everyday for 3 years until I graduate.   Tho I’ve only lived in Egypt for 6 months, I can tell at least 85% of the men are LVM (Low-Value male). If your standards are as high as r/FemaleDatingStrategy, you’ll realize lots of men are pure trash. At least half of my past male friends and classmates were trash and I feel sorry for their future wives.

ioe9q	Maybe you don't have the sex education you need to understand HIV. Being gay doesn't cause AIDS. Straight people can get AIDS. HIV is transmitted during sex, so people have to use condoms to prevent it. Any person can transmit AIDS to another. HIV has nothing to do with morality, frequency of sexual activity, and it has nothing to do with Human rights for gay people.   You don't really understand statistics. You are misinterpreting the data to suit your narrative. You are ignoring large segments of the LGBT population who don't have high transmission rates, and the data shows higher transmission in minorities than in whites. Are you going to use the data to say that other races are more at risk because of their identity? of course not. Where in people are using protection, HIV transmission is low. Wherein people do not use protection, HIV is transmission is high. Only a fool would use the data to suggest that gays get aids and straight people don't.   And besides. So what. If a population segment is at risk of disease, does that mean they should be persecuted? Is that what you are arguing?   What about Lesbians? Are you advocating for Lesbians then? because HIV transmission among lesbians is practically unheard of. So go do more research maybe, but this time, in humanity and human rights rather than picking one statistic about vulnerability and using it to argue bigotry.	1643014155.0	htzxwwz	t3_sb46jn	t1_htyfxqu	/r/Egypt/comments/sb46jn/why_are_people_triggered/htzxwwz/

d8n0u3pl	not a girl but, 19 year old here, my advice is simply as some others said; don't feel like it's a thing you 'must' do, whether it was out of FOMO or thinking you have shortcomings or so on. it's natural to get this feeling regarding the matter obviously, when you see so many surrounding you linking themselves to a particular experience like relationships or other things that they find joy within, but it shouldn't be the main deciding factor for you regarding anything   good relationships are bound on strong, mutual understanding of eachother. others may have a relationship for the fun of it, and others desire it just for the sake of it whether it was for reasons like self-worth, identity, status, so on--but a successful and long lasting relationship as far i know is when you can truly accept, know, and love a person on most facets they have for as long as you stay with them. this is why i think beginning a friendship and strengthening it is the most important thing before thinking of committing to a relationship; because there's a better chance of knowing if you want something deeper and closer with that person or not, while avoiding the risks that come with such commitments  i want you to also know that not all seemingly good relationships necessarily work entirely; started as online friends at first, i had an intiminate and loving bond with someone myself, but over time we knew it wouldn't work out due reasons we eventually accepted, and even if it did stung at first, we managed it without much hassle because we truly respected and understood eachother. she and i remained as close and good friends to this day who enjoy eachothers' company regardless. this is what i find is valuable; that even if such relationship didn't stick for you, you still have someone important in your life; a friend that you treasure.  so all in all, don't think it's some big task you necessarily have to do at this point in life just because you saw others doing it. focus on your growth and other priorities, expand your circle of friends, get to know the bads and goods in people, don't submit to expectations that might get pushed to you, and all should come in its time without forcing anything	1643016399.0	hu00ncb	t3_sb9w6y	t3_sb9w6y	/r/Egypt/comments/sb9w6y/how_do_you_girls_date_in_egypt/hu00ncb/

However, when I lived in Europe, things happened much more naturally, and I never understood why it was so easy there, but almost impossible in Egypt.  Don't let it bother you. You do you. You have your entire life ahead of you that is packed with so many experiences and adventures.	1643018187.0	hu02rvh	t3_sb9w6y	t3_sb9w6y	/r/Egypt/comments/sb9w6y/how_do_you_girls_date_in_egypt/hu02rvh/
46jdelil	Your entire post is written under the assumption that societal acceptance to homosexuality is not harmful. Others argue that it is. If the latter is true then it is in the public's interest not to allow for our movies to push for the agenda of acceptance, especially since there's pressure from Western media already.  Now onto the "we'll keep being backwards as long as we think like this" idea. I think that's complete BS to be honest. Acceptance of homosexuality has absolutely nothing to do with how successful a country is. You can see that across history and you have a literal case in point of that in China. The number 2 strongest economy in the world which is literally pushing for more "masculine" men in television because feminine looking ones "will harm society".  People seem to confuse the west's success with the rise in homosexual acceptance. Nope. Such acceptance happened long after the west has established itself. It is a byproduct, not a source. America has been a super power for all but 50 years and it's already going downhill fast. So don't try to tell me that a country's progress is reliant on a "I don't care as long as it's not me" attitude.	1643018265.0	hu02v86	t3_sbhxkm	t3_sbhxkm	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu02v86/

8151p6d8	You missed the entire point of my post. First of all, I was not talking about the country's progress. I'm talking about us as humans, and the way we treat each other. You can criticize homosexuality if you want, which is what I said, but don't attack them and say that Ahmed Helmy should get a divorce because of a role in a movie. If you don't want to accept homosexuality then dont watch a movie on NETFLIX, which preaches it in all their content.   As for China, imagine being the number 2 strongest economy in the world, yet people yearn to leave due to lack of freedom and basic human rights, and this is speaking from experience, as I lived there for 5 years. One of the biggest reasons people migrate to Europe and America, because humans are actually valued there, and given the freedom to be happy.  I really hope that one day you find out that one of your children is gay and see what you do then, and no I am not part of the LGBTQ+ community, but I am human, and we are all born equal and deserve to be treated with respect when it is reciprocated.   Take a good look at yourself and really think before judging someone for trying to be happy	1643019528.0	hu04d0f	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu02v86	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu04d0f/

46jdelil	Again, the idea that secularism is key to success is misguided at best. Israel is the polar opposite of secularism, can you say it isn't a successful country? There were empires that lasted for hundreds of years which were centered around religion. The idea that religion is the source of all that is bad is an overreaction to bad things that happened in the name of religion. Guess what? Bad things happen in the name of ANY ideogy, and the more widespread the ideology the more likely it is to be used as an excuse to do bad things. There's a growing number of academics that strongly argue against secularism as a result of what has happened in the last 50 years, they're actually starting to become a majority in their fields.  As for equality for all. It sounds good but the question is how equal is too equal? Surely there's a limit. I mean no one would ever push for equality for a murderer or a pedo. Now you're going to say "Ok but those people harm others". To which I'll reply "who says that harm can only be physical?". After all, the natural progression of homosexual acceptance is marriage and children (not allowing that goes against equality). Is it really fair on a child to cause them abandonment issues and identity crises due to not knowing why their biological parents didn't want them? Or even know who their biological parents are? And by the way, this is very real and every adoptee experiences it. Isn't it incredibly harmful and selfish to knowingly put a human being through that just because of your desires?   And no this is not why the west is more progressive than the east. I strongly disagree with that. The west you see today is built on an industrial revolution that enslaved their own poor in coal mines and colonised other countries for resources. The west you see today is built on a Christian foundation that was abandoned AFTER they became who they are. And Donald Trump is a symptom of a much larger societal problem, not the source of it.	1643021428.0	hu06qii	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu048mh	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu06qii/

It's either they're human and accepted or they're not. It is not someone's choice of who they find to be sexually appealing. I don't understand why its so hard to just let someone be. If you have your beliefs then stick to it man, dont shit on someone else, and if you tell me oh but the kids, then if you raised them properly they wouldnt do such "horrible" things right?   Take Adel Emam, in most of his movies he's shown touching women inappropriately and sexualizing them, and yet he's called "El Za3eem." Why don't people say something then.

One may be more prevalent in one society over an other, but the inherent ideas are not the exclusive property of any one country, culture or geolocation.

Find the beliefs that suit *you* the most, and embrace them.

3h0p33b9	Forget about مجلس النواب. They are just a bunch of corrupt money grabbing power hungry thieves. But when you talk about الأمر بالمعروف و النهي عن المنكر you gotta understand that this is an important part of the religion that 90% of the population follow. Also LGBT, alcohol, cheating and premarital sex are major sins in that religion. If you have a problem with Islam or you are not Muslim yourself then that’s another story and I totally respect you. But don’t blame Muslims (90% of the society) for getting mad at a movie that promotes all those majors sins. They have every right to get mad. In the end we live in a Muslim society whether you like it or not and we can’t just go disrespecting our beliefs and act like it’s nothing. We don’t need some minorities to push their corrupt beliefs on us. If minorities want us to respect them, they also have to respect the majority.

It’s true, if someone isn’t doing anything to you, then leave them the fuck alone- but not 100%, because the lgbtq views for example is against the Islamic believes, thus “we” won’t leave them alone. And so on. And this applies to everything.	1643026879.0	hu0e9z0	t3_sbhxkm	t3_sbhxkm	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0e9z0/

46jdelil	That is not their identity dude, they make it their identity. There's a difference. Your sexual preference shouldn't be your main source of being, and if it is then there's something deeply wrong with you sorry. People can live and die without doing lots of things, including sex.   I really empathise with those dealing with such desires. But I don't think the solution is to say that acting on those desires is ok. People develop desires for animals, inanimate objects, and even children. Does that mean that they should act on these desires? No, because you're not taking into account how that will play out down the road. I ultimately believe that allowing for that leads to allowing for marriages and children (otherwise it wouldn't be equality, right?). The last part is where it becomes really harmful, especially in a world where babies can be brought into the world not knowing who their biological parents are or why didn't want them, all just so these two people could feel normal. Isn't it cruel to doom someone with an existential crisis just because you want to feel normal?   To me this is all similar to the idea of communism in the 20th century. It sounded like a fantastic idea, the solution to all suffering, and you weren't considered a "muthaqaf" if you didn't adopt it. Until it was tried out, and everyone realised that to accomplish it you have to bend society and sacrifice so much more than it's worth.	1643029667.0	hu0iymf	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0bhwb	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0iymf/

3h0p33b9	Us muslims believe that God the creator of the universe and life knows best what is best for us. God told us that alcohol, premarital sex and LGBT is bad therefore we listen. If we have to choose between you and what God told us then we won’t choose you. I’m sorry if that puts you at unease but it is what it is. Islam preaches freedom and you are completely free to believe and practice what you want. We respect you and your decision. You are the one who fails to respect us by keeping promoting your ideas on us and wanting to force us to accept them. Hell you just called me a scumbag. No wonder you are hated and get shat on.

What you are talking about here is about the narrow-minded people, who wouldn't give themselves and their brain any freedom to think logically or sometime to think at all..   You just need to accept that those people exist, and maybe they even outnumbered the ones that do use their brains, logic and common sense and give themselves and their minds enough freedom to think.	1643030273.0	hu0k29y	t3_sblpg0	t3_sblpg0	/r/Egypt/comments/sblpg0/a_muslim_wouldnt_want_a_christian_to_try_to/hu0k29y/

If one gonna accept probably every haram aspect why wouldn’t they accept lgbt?  The answer is they don’t care about the haram and halal concept, they only care what will further their fucked up agenda so drop the moral mask about not accepting the lgbt because it haram and against the nature when you accepted other things against that are haram and against the nature.

But I'd rather have someone who is 50/50 than someone who's accepting of everything haram.

18wu8jtt	that was absolutely what they were doing! they were pointing out stuff that weren't similar in their culture and religion and they perceived them as uncivil, since they are white people, who are from their perspective always more civilized than us.  i can argue that historically homosexuality was less of a taboo in Islamic empires by telling you about figures like [Abu Nuwas](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1292664774?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&imgSeq=1) or [Ibn al-Rumi](https://www.diwanalarab.com/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87), but going on r/AskHistorians would be more accurate than i can ever be.  what is more important to note is that the colonizers didn't just point out the acceptance of homosexuality, but also other stuff like how indigenous peoples ate with their hands, believe in a false God, live in the desert, etc. for more details on how they thought we were less developed and uncivilized i would suggest reading *Orientalism* by Edward Said, and also *Colonizing Egypt* by Timothy Mitchell. for a brief overview, you can also read the [wikipedia page on the 'Civilizing Mission'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilizing_mission).	1643031779.0	hu0myq7	t3_sarjnt	t1_hu0hmm9	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/hu0myq7/

8151p6d8	Your sexual preference shouldn't be your main source of being, but its a big part of who you are and you can't deny that. Many people find happiness in others and there's nothing wrong with that. Same way many people here I know work their asses off just so that they can get married. These people are born that way same way you were born to like women. You cannot change it, you simply cant, try being gay and see how that works. And again you are going for extremes just to make point. Are you really comparing pedophelia to homosexuality?   >babies can be brought into the world not knowing who their biological parents are or why didn't want them  That is literally how adoption works. Its the same for everyone irregardless, and nowadays people use surrogacy, which makes them the biological parents of the children. And are you saying that every single child of same sex parents is doomed? Yes you can view same sex marriage as wrong, but I don't see how that hurts society. I told you before, if you believe its wrong then it shouldn't damage you in anyway because you simply wont do it. Everyone can't escape it because it exists everywhere in a world of social media. You don't want your children to look at that stuff and follow it, then make them, because its about how you raise them.   It all comes down to whether or not you believe its "mental illness," so we will never agree on this topic. I asked you to give me a solution on what society should do. Oust them, jail them, kill them? What should they do.	1643033983.0	hu0rj9b	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0iymf	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0rj9b/

3z0nkr4	Explanation:  • Alexandrians: هو كده and it is also due to the spotlight turning towards them lately in the past couple of years for many various cases and reasons. Alexandria is also already becoming Cairo's main competitor for the label of Egypt's modern "media hub" or "cultural hotspot".   • Cairenes (including Gizans and Middle Egyptians): Live in/by the capital, near their ancestors' artifacts and many historical places, are considered the "typical" or "average" Egyptians, are greatly nationalistic and involved in the country's politics.  • Mansourians: Have a stereotypical reputation of them having the most beautiful women in the republic, with different explanations that range in accuracy from minute to none. My older side of the family mention mixing with the French as their personal explanation for the case, likely due to the Seventh Crusade occurring there resulting in the defeat of Louis IX of France in the Battle of Mansoura, hence its name "the victorious = mansoura". In reality, their beauty isn't higher or lower than that of any other Egyptian woman.  • Aswanians: Have an outdoors-type of lifestyle and work environment, causing them to acquire a fine tan. Their geographical closeness to Nubians and Africans has generally and historically caused them to acquire relatively moderate-to-high levels of Sub-Saharan African genes compared to any other governorate.  • Luxorians: Considered the pinnacle of "Upper Egyptianess" and their rich ancient cultural heritage directly derived from their Egyptian ancestors with the addition of their location which is filled with their ancient egyptian ancestors' temples and artifacts, gaining them heavy interest and respect both nation-wide and internationally.  • Sinaians: Nationally-Egyptian Arabs/Bedouins that have inhabited the region since ancient times, their culture and dialect is closest to that of Gulf Arabs.  • Menoufians: Similar to Mansourians' case. A heavy nation-wide stereotype about them is that they're very greedy, money-aware and stingy. Which - if you haven't concluded it yet - is symbolized by Jews that carry this stereotype and anti-Semitic reputation with them since ancient, medieval and modern times till this day.  • Sharqians: (???) (Seems to be unrelated to any common stereotype and likely added to fuel the shitpost)  • Ismailians: (???) (Could be football-related or a stereotype that I'm not aware of)	1643034356.0	hu0scmk	t3_sb7yxr	t3_sb7yxr	/r/Egypt/comments/sb7yxr/where_are_you_from/hu0scmk/

I mean lgbtq community/people have existed since day 1- and I bet some Egyptian politicians may be gay as well. But obviously it’s not the norm to be gay. But I think it’s a big topic to be solved in few Reddit comments.	1643034485.0	hu0sn05	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0qiu4	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0sn05/

If what you are saying is true, then all the Jews and Christian’s who lived in the Islamic era/territories should of been forced to pray in mosques, which is not what happened/not true.	1643034976.0	hu0tqb2	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0sz2t	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0tqb2/

Second one there are two factors 1-asshole bosses and 2-the country is poor. It is logical for companies to have more profit cause this is THEIR business yup you work but without their machines and their materials you wouldn’t be able to do anything.   I understand how assholes bosses can be but at the end of the day the give people opportunities to work yeah few pennies but few pennies are better than no pennies.

Again, it must be said they're a small laughable minority of African Americans whose words don't affect Egypt and Egyptians in any way whatsoever.  Yet the same redditors don't have a word to say about how European empires (and white people in general) have literally and physically robbed and looted ancient Egyptian artefacts and antiquities.

4vao1m4f	>Source? I haven't seen actual numbers until now, we were just talking about a hypothetical  In the US, the lifetime risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is: about 1 in 60 (1.7%) for men and 1 in 140 (0.71%) for women.  While they don't elaborate on Alcohol use, they report that alcohol increases risks of developing that specific kind of cancer. Moreover, The risk of these cancers in people who drink and smoke heavily is about 30 times higher than the risk in people who don’t smoke or drink.  Source: [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html)  Given how much of our population smokes already, drinking alcohol on top of it will make it a complete disaster.  That's for Oropharyngeal Carcinoma. Something you'd never hear about in Egypt but rarely.  >It's one of the common causes of death here in public hospitals, as endoscopes aren't readily available.  Hepatitis (especially C type) has been nearly eradicated from Egypt as a result from the Virus C Initiative. As for obesity, tobacco consumption, and the like, those cases overlap with other countries so they offset each other. Even people dying from Hepatitis C are properly diagnosed with cancer unless they are on the very edge of death.  Generally speaking, Alcohol is devastating to the liver. That fact is undeniable and indisputable for doctors around the world. I believe it's common sense that the difference in cancer rates between Egypt and the US for example lies with Alcohol consumption (as one of its decisive factors).   You're talking about a society that consumes alcohol on a regular basis (and consumes a lot) as opposed to a society that rarely consumes it on the national scale.      Males Ages 12 and Over  Current Drinkers: 55.3 percent (72,286 survey respondents)  Binge Drinkers: 28.9 percent (37,789 survey respondents)  Heavy Drinkers: 8.3 percent (10,894 survey respondents)  Females Ages 12 and Over  Current Drinkers: 46.4 percent (64,449 survey respondents)  Binge Drinkers: 19.8 percent (27,538 survey respondents)  Heavy Drinkers: 3.9 percent (5,394 survey respondents)  [Source here](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-many-people-drink-alcohol-in-the-us-67305)  How you never draw a correlation here is beyond me. Justifying it as just poor screening, and whatnot doesn't make for a a strong argument at all.  That's not all. I'm just using the states as an example but there are much worse countries as for alcohol consumption. We're also talking about its direct harms until now and we never got to [its disastrous indirect harms.](https://www.verywellmind.com/crime-and-alcohol-statistics-from-1998-62821)  &#x200B;  >Do you think criminalising weed has been stopping people? People in Egypt smoke weed a lot more commonly compared to alcohol, especially in the lower classes. It's more readily available and cheaper.  It didn't completely stop people from consuming it for sure but I'm pretty confident that the number of weed smokers are *dramatically less* than what they would be if it wasn't criminalized. It will be even less when incorporating effective mechanisms in combating their spread.	1643036599.0	hu0xh34	t3_sas3oo	t1_htxfz5t	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/hu0xh34/

One of the earliest examples were white rock n roll musicians in the 50s and 60s plagiarising the music of African American blues and jazz musicians without giving credit. While the white rockstars became legends and made millions, the black musicians remained unknown and poor.  Cancel culture is largely a myth that is blown out of proportion by right wingers and conservatives.	1643036752.0	hu0xtwy	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu0x3iz	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu0xtwy/

46jdelil	First of all, there's no evidence that they're born that way. It's highly likely that environmental factors are what cause the change (genetically identical twins have been shown to develop different sexual orientations). Second, I actually believe that if you put someone in a certain environment and push the right buttons they can absolutely start developing gay tendencies. That's how a lot of grooming works. As for going for extremes, I'm not (at least I'm not trying to), I'm just showing you what you sound like by giving behavioural examples that I know you would disapprove of.  By the way, I wasn't referring to adoption, I was mainly referring to sperm donations and IVF. Even if one of the parents is the biological parent of the child, they would still face the same existential questions.   As for harm/damage, it does happen. You just can't see it yet because it's a very recent change. Wait until the next few generations grow up under those circumstances then we'll talk. So many countries are now literally giving pre-teen children the complete authority to decide what they are, and no one is allowed to contest what they decide. I couldn't imagine how this could cause any harm... Oh wait, it did! A few years ago, multiple teenagers and young adults sued the NHS because their bodies were permanently changed as per their word when they really didn't know any better, now they regret it and can't go back.  You may think this is a separate issue but it really isn't. Once you instil the philosophy of "if it doesn't directly affect me then it's totally fine" you just open the floodgates wide open and completely ignore any long-term effects this would cause on the individual and on society. Any resistance will make you an enemy of happiness and freedom, no matter how much evidence you may have.   And guess what? You can't even study many of those cases because studies are "demeaning" and would mean that you see those people as abnormal.   So, ironically, you reach a point where you strongly stomp on the freedom of expression in order to allow for freedom of expression (which is starting to happen).  &#x200B;  What should we do then? Look for the causes and search for the root of the issue, allow for objective long-term studies to take place and act accordingly.	1643037143.0	hu0yrc9	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0rj9b	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0yrc9/

2rrsswlc	Can we stop with the same western tap?? Accepting others was never a western thing 🤷🏻‍♀️ and also spreading acceptance is not a western thing, because guess what, Christianity in the west also fought the LGBTQ for a long while till they got accepted, but unlike here, they don't have a death penalty stuck to them!! In fact, if you looked at it with your eyes, no need for any type of lens, you will find that gays are the ones who are harmed here, not you or any religious guy, they're abused and harassed, in prisons, by their families, friends, killed!! When it would have been way easier to just let them be 🤷🏻‍♀️ if he's or she is minding their business how is it your right to tell them how to live?

4vao1m4f	It's the reverse. LGBT is just an ideology for enabling what's not normal and what's not natural. Having the intrinsic feeling to do something doesn't give you the justification to do it. I'm curious as to where you are going to draw the lines. Are you going to allow bestiality because humans can be born with such tendency? Incest too?   Does anything can be met with reciprocity from another partner be allowed just because it's consensual? Can we allow assisted suicide/homicide since it operates on the same exact logic of consent and reciprocity?  Remember that it's your only opinion that it should be a basic human right. You're just forcing it to the point of normalization then arguing that it was a basic human right all along. The original argument for LGBT is fallacious in itself and circular.	1643037297.0	hu0z4l5	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0i7ic	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu0z4l5/

8jmiokrw	It's really ironic for me to see the comments saying how this is disgusting and how this is degrading the society, but forget how much our society is obsessed with pornography and watch worst things online.  We love to show an "image". In secret and behind closed doors, our society does so much more "disgusting" things, from rape, to sexual assault, to child marriages, to female circumcision and the list goes on. I'm not advocating or saying that I believe this depiction/image from the cinema is right or wrong. But the fact that we go nuts over images like these and not over real tragedies that happen, is quite frankly, sad.	1643037586.0	hu0ztso	t3_sarjnt	t3_sarjnt	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/hu0ztso/

68awe	>In the US, the lifetime risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer is: about 1 in 60 (1.7%) for men and 1 in 140 (0.71%) for women.  We were talking about cancer rates in general. And I hope you know that smoking actually causes most of oropharyngeal carcinomas. Please stay on topic.   >Something you'd never hear about in Egypt but rarely.  I'm curious how you reached that conclusion?  >Given how much of our population smokes already, drinking alcohol on top of it will make it a complete disaster.  I feel like you've gone on a completely unrelated tangent to what we were talking about. I never once claimed alcohol was not harmful or non-carcinogenic. I was simply trying to explain the differences in cancer statistics in both regions and how we don't necessarily lead a better lifestyle, regardless of the alcohol.  >Justifying it as just poor screening, and whatnot doesn't make for a a strong argument at all.   Again, I was talking about all cancers in general. And yes poor screening and records does play a part in Egypt. If you've ever been to hospitals you'd know we barely have a proper filing and record system. Just because you don't think it's a good reason intuitively doesn't make it a bad reason. Cancer can lie dormant for many years until symptomatic. And by the way read again about the possible discrepancies I mentioned, screening isn't the only thing I said.      >I'm pretty confident that the number of weed smokers are dramatically less than what they would be if it wasn't criminalized  Okay, since you're pretty sure it's definitely true I guess	1643038479.0	hu121vn	t3_sas3oo	t1_hu0xh34	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/hu121vn/

2zvjwt40	How is not a western thing exactly? You just admitted that even Christianity fought it until people in the west legalised it. Now, before you go pointing fingers and accusing me of things I never said, I did not say kill the gays because they are gays. Islam's ruling on this is very clear on this. Only the act of sodomy is punishable by death. But before you say that's not fair either, do you have any idea how hard it is to convict a case of sodomy or zina according to Islamic law? You need 4 honest Muslim men. That is practically impossible unless they're having sex in public. So like you said, if they keep it to themselves, it's fine. But no, I won't tolerate rainbow flags and gay parades everywhere and all that shit that happens in the west. That's way too much. Why should we use this law I hear you ask. Because Egypt is a Muslim majority country. Article two of the Egyptian constitution states that Egypt is an Islamic country and all laws stem from the Shari'a. This is not a secular country. The overwhelming people here don't accept homosexuality that's a fact. The will of the people and the majority are what decide what happens at the end of the day. After all, even western countries had referendums before they legalised gay marriage. So it's really simple, keep it in the bedroom and no one will complain.	1643038627.0	hu12fa1	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0z0zf	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu12fa1/

Its a group of people identified by gender deviations(man&woman) and attraction to it,as in transgender people,gay men,lesbian women,etc.   And its not something of their choice ,I know LGBT people myself both online and IRL, and its not a choice, not to mention that although there are no proven gay genes,being trans or intersexual are both highly accepted medically, I even read a study about scientists turning a rat trans by disrupting hormones in the mother carrying the rat and causing its gender to deviate,like human trans people.   this is why many informed people I know generally support trans rights as its a genuine medical condition that can only be cured by transition(we dont have the tech and ability to rewire human brains).     Anyways, tangent aside,human rights against discrimination in Egypt are lacking(specifically against discrimination), and its a right in my personal opinion to not have to worry about being kicked out of your family,discriminated against,not allowed medical help(happens with trans people),etc.	1643038731.0	hu12onx	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu0q61c	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu12onx/

5l9a2krg	Wow, you really do have two brain cells don’t you? I literally said it’s WAY WORSE if you’re egyptian? But keep trying.  Every nationality talks shit about Egyptians? La2 you’re a joke ba2a😂 you’re embarrassing yourself at this point and while i admit it is fun to watch, it’s incredibly sad. I’d love LOVE to come across someone who talks shit about Egypt in my presence or in any Egyptian’s presence for that matter. I guess the difference between us is that people (in real life, you know? Outside the internet) respect me enough to not talk shit about my country ESPECIALLY when they are not from here. So i guess that’s the difference between me and you. I’m actually respected, while you’re a joke and sadly dragged all of us into your weak ass personality that gets shat on by other nationalities, grow up bb 😘   I mean i tried to be the bigger person and call you “wrong in the head” while you replied with “you’re fucked in the head”  Listen ya habibi, if you don’t like the country fuck off to another that you like, and if you’re not financially stable for it then stfu, you crossed a big line and you knew exactly what THAT exact topic does to us, and how offensive it is, so you’re literally asking to be paraded as  “العبيط اهو العبيط اهو" So suck it the fuck up, and take the L.  Also educate yourself, we never said we’re okay with napoleon robbing the shit out of us, or the rosetta stone along with many other ancient egyptian pieces being in the british meuseum, but guess what in both the Louvre AND the british meuseum they’re in a section of their own. Called, THE EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES made of two floors in the louvre. so while yes we got robbed by white people we still have credit, our name ALL OVER each department.  While african americans are no smarter than you are, you piece of uneducated shit and look at pharaohs and say “mama…papa” so there we go, appropriate AND appreciation. That’s the difference.  Educate yourself and stop embarrassing yourself.  Also, have some self respect and make a new circle of friends since this one already has zero respect for you, too late.	1643039343.0	hu148lc	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu12i31	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu148lc/

If you have a problem with the delivery time, contact the supplier, it might be their fault, or there's just (I don't know) other people like you who ordered from the same place, so that caused the orders to be late beacuse, y'know, there were too many orders just like yours that need also to be delivered, that's why your order is late, maybe.  Why don't you consider looking at it from the other side and think about the real reasons food orders are late, and try to be respectful about the delivery service itself being existent, rather than not appreciating the delivery guy by paying his fee, because mainly, it's not his problem?  Heck, what if that deliverer himself while on his way to you made an accident for goodness sake, will it still be a problem that your order is late? Will you ignore the fact that this guy was injured while doing his work, and rather focus on being hungry?

4vao1m4f	>We were talking about cancer rates in general.  The original topic was how cancer rates that relates to alcohol consumption is drastically less in our region more than any other region. The overarching topic is the criminalization of Alcohol usage. For that, I believe my words are pretty much on topic. Especially with regards to oropharyngeal cancer and liver cancer rates. I didn't get too much into other harms such as Pancreatitis and related diseases although it serves the overarching point.   >And I hope you know that smoking actually causes most of oropharyngeal carcinomas  If you read carefully what I wrote you'd know that the combination of smoking plus alcohol raises such cases by 30 times. And a combination of both especially in our country will be disastrous.  >I'm curious how you reached that conclusion?  You'd know if you checked the multiple sources I provided across our conversation.  Intuitively, alcohol doesn't cause cancers in every part of the body so I'm definitely not talking about all kinds of cancers in general.  >I never once claimed alcohol was not harmful or non-carcinogenic.   If that's the case, given our low consumption of alcohol does mean that we have significantly lower cancer rates (that relates to alcohol consumption) and are spared of a lot of its harms. That's kind of logic 101.   >I was simply trying to explain the differences in cancer statistics in both regions and how we don't necessarily lead a better lifestyle, regardless of the alcohol.  Our conversation is with regards to alcohol. Our low consumption of alcohol makes us lead better lives when it comes to this case in particular.  I've answered the many discrepancies point. Obesity, Tobacco, Hepatitis, all of which I responded to. It's up to you to be convinced or not. Keeping a proper record system maybe a valid point overall but it's, again, not enough. If you want to tell me that there is definitely discrepancies then I perfectly agree. But it's not that large as you make it to be and is being significantly offset by multiple factors I've mentioned before.  >Okay, since you're pretty sure it's definitely true I guess  I don't know about you but let's argue for the reverse. Decriminalizing weed will make it spread faster, no? Then it's common sense for the opposite to happen. It doesn't need to be overly complicated.  In the end, I don't think I went into a tangent but it's more like I was focusing on the main idea while you were concentrating on one specific subpoint and nitpicking on it.	1643040515.0	hu179t3	t3_sas3oo	t1_hu121vn	/r/Egypt/comments/sas3oo/go_big_or_go_home_stop_with_that_half_was_bs/hu179t3/

8m8q3ery	Oh damn. Let me explain this:  Netflix is NOT one of your constitutional rights.  It’s a private corporation that offers a subscription based service. It also makes films and it can make whatever films it wants to make.  You, as a consumer, have a right to just not subscribe if you don’t like their content.  There are people in the Middle East who believe women should not appear on TV and on film. Should Netflix be agreeable and only make films with male actors? Moreover, there are people in the US who believe Arabs and Muslims are terr*r*sts and that they should not be represented in the media. Should Netflix stop investing in Arab films and casting Arab actors?  Your “values” mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to anyone else but you. Grow up.  The world is a big place and if you think Netflix should stop making films because YOU find them offensive, I suggest you cancel your membership now.	1643041134.0	hu18uy4	t3_sarjnt	t1_hu14k62	/r/Egypt/comments/sarjnt/قيم_الاسره_المصريه_سنه_١٩٥٠/hu18uy4/

14u9g8	Please refer to my other reply on the Ideology wording,and read what follows fully.     Regarding the nature argument:  LGBT people have been recorded in ancient Greece,Egypt(literally widely practiced here until the 1850s),mesopotamia,india,etc.\[ask and I will give source\]   even in isolated islands in the pacific they have third genders and common beliefs of homosexuality. This pours into that human societies naturally observe LGBT behavior and without a specifically Abrahamic religion they wouldn't negatively perceive it.         You are fully correct in regards to intrinsic action,one should consider how his actions affect people and society at large,yet,most people can very well judge and use their own human nature to act against harmful actions.   How come a very talented,productive,and,very philosophically developed country of ancient Egypt had Laws against murder,rape,incest(barred for most non royals,)\[I should provide sources on this claim\] and bestiality yet none against homosexuality?   When humans make rules on their own we see that homosexuality is never a problem unless deep social conditioning specifically done by abrahamic religions is responsible.   This is also more confirmed by how other mammals have homosexual tendencies similar to humans\[ask for source\].   \>Does anything can be met with reciprocity from another partner be allowed just because it's consensual? Can we allow assisted suicide/homicide since it operates on the same exact logic of consent and reciprocity?     Let's add a bit of nuance, two adults having sex in an isolated room in secret have objectively harmed no one and have sanely enjoyed a human act. if it was a murderer killing a suicidal person we know both people have insanely enjoyed the act and harmed themselves, society and many other people.     Consent,harm,and sanity are needed.   Fucking and raping a goat?   No consent,most likely insane--->thus it doesnt matter if it doesnt harm or if its natural or whatever.     Fucking a child who consents?   Harmful ---->pedophilia is bad(not-to-mention most pedophiles do it for the power and ego trip not for genuine attraction to young kids,so it alot of timesis under insanity)\[sources available\]     Assisted suicide?   Harmful,most likely insane ---->bad(although in some cases argument can be made,specifically about old people who are basically just bed ridden and wont live more than a year)\[can give you links about this\]     A gay couple?   Consensual,not harmful,and sane as its similar to any heterosexual relationship.     \>Remember that it's your only opinion that it should be a basic human right. You're just forcing it to the point of normalization then arguing that it was a basic human right all along. The original argument for LGBT is fallacious in itself and circular.   by all standards of scientific and natural and historic knowledge Homosexuality has always been a sane human trait of people,Only recently in human history has it been suppressed in the name of abrahamic religion,actually only in the last 300\~400 years did anti deviation/LGBT rhetoric appear,due to multitude of factors I can discuss.   It is my informed opinion that expressing yourself naturally sanely and without harming others is acceptable in all regards and one must acknowledge actual human nature without bias,and many medical and professionally educated people hold similar opinions to me\[sources available\].   I am not forcing anyone,that wording is more appropiate to people forcing people to hide their sane human selves to disallow "deviation"\[Why LGBT people are political,I can tell you more about that if you want\].   And yes LGBT people deserve human rights.     \>The original argument for LGBT is fallacious in itself and circular.

Please explain to me how telling people (and showing primary evidence) that there were other complex and advanced civilisations in Africa OTHER than Ancient Egypt is afrocentric? Let me spell that out for you in case you didn't understand. Ancient Egypt wasn't the only civilisation on the African continent in the age of antiquity. There were others in west Africa, central Africa and south Africa. There MAY (as in not confirmed or ruled out) that there was contact between those civilisations and Ancient Egypt.

4vao1m4f	It'd be pretty nonsensical to believe alcohol causes every kind of cancer. I'm definitely talking about alcohol consumption and its carcinogenic effect. That's why I specified the liver and the oropharynx (although it extends to more than that as I've said previously).  &#x200B;  >Do you realize I never said alcohol was non-carcinogenic?  Then we are not in disagreement. From here, by logic, you can come to the conclusion that a country that has more than 80% of its population drink and more than 10% a heavy drinker, suffers tremendously more from alcohol's carcinogenic harm than a country like Egypt. That is my main point.  From my original post  >us having the lowest cancer rates in the world is because we as Muslims are prohibited from drinking Alcohol **and thus are spared of its carcinogenic harm.**  Although it's ill-worded, you can clearly see I meant the carcinogenic harm of alcohol which is mainly in the liver and the oropharynx, which is a point I made too many times now. However, on that note, it does bring down the average cancer rate overall.  I see you're more focused about the minutiae of obtaining that kind of information rather than the overall point. I perfectly illustrated the points I wish to discuss if you're not interested in that then you're free to not respond.

bm9l28me	Well they stole ancient Egyptian artefacts instead.  And yes, when the French invaded and discovered all these ancient monuments, it was a shock to Europe. They were shocked that there was an advanced civilisation outside of Europe older than the Romans and the Greeks. It's important to remember that eugenics and white supremacy was popular at the time. Europeans believed they were a superior race to the rest of the world and simply couldn't accept that non-whites could have had a civilisation as rich and as sophisticated as Ancient Egypt. So in the very early days of Egyptology, Europeans were pushing the idea that Ancient Egypt was a white civilisation.  A British astronomer named Charles Piazzi Smyth even claimed that the ancient Scottish were the ones who built the pyramids.	1643043204.0	hu1ec1n	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu1d89l	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu1ec1n/

If you have already done that, then you both have to figure out how to increase your income!

We are no less than Japan to see whole business models gets altered when they are demographically targeting there  "There are some people" does not constitute nor include all people. Arab world has diversity of views that you intentionally ignoring which is disrespectful  What do you mean by "there are people the US..... Should not be represented in the media"? So why bidan congratulates Muslims in their celebration doesn't that indicate that there is some voter base he is trying to appeal to? It's even ridiculous for me to have to prove that your views is totally distorted and doesn't reflect reality  My values must be respected on my land anyone trying to target us as an audience must respect that. If you think your VALUES is worthless for you. It's up to you.

ge2vybdx	Yeah, basically our own colonial troops. And the nubian "pharaoh" was hated by Egyptian society. I have nothing in common with all subsaharans. The Tombos Stela describes King Thutmose I on his victory against the nubians, which he basically genocided them.  "After he overthrew the chief of the Nubians, the despoiled Nubian belongs to his grip. After he had gathered the border markers of both sides, no escape existed among the evil-of-character; those who had come to support him---not one thereof remained. As the Nubian have fallen to terror and are laid aside throughout their lands, their stench, it floods their wadis, their blood is like a rainstorm. The carrion-eating birds over it are numerous, those birds were picking and carrying the flesh to another (desert) place."  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombos_Stela	1643044407.0	hu1hksi	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu1b4bo	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu1hksi/

4vao1m4f	I don't think you said something new, all of your points I encountered them many times before so I won't ask for your sources, I already know.  >LGBT people have been recorded in ancient Greece,Egypt(literally widely practiced here until the 1850s),mesopotamia,india,etc.\[ask and I will give source\]   >   >    even in isolated islands in the pacific they have third genders and common beliefs of homosexuality. This pours into that human societies naturally observe LGBT behavior and without a specifically Abrahamic religion they wouldn't negatively perceive it.   >   >    You are fully correct in regards to intrinsic action,one should consider how his actions affect people and society at large,yet,most people can very well judge and use their own human nature to act against harmful actions.    How come a very talented,productive,and,very philosophically developed country of ancient Egypt had Laws against murder,rape,incest(barred for most non royals,)\[I should provide sources on this claim\] and bestiality yet none against homosexuality?  LGBT people being recorded in ancient history is not something new or surprising. I fail to see how it relates to it being a normal behavior as it was still practiced by a small minority of tribes and esoteric groups that have perished. You'd find many of those same or similar tribes that also offer human sacrifices and rituals that involve grotesque acts to please some pagan god of theirs. I'd rather not use them as a model example for homosexuality.  Even Ancient Egypt is not spared from this and I fail to see how their revolutionary and pioneering role in civilization relate to old tradition of theirs which drastically differed from their image of being advanced. Ancient Egyptians did disgusting things like cutting the genitals of their enemies as humiliation and despite their scientific and medical breakthroughs, they practiced pharaonic FGM (the kind of FGM that's most fatal to girls and for which Islam's blamed instead), those are just some examples out of many others.  Even Ancient Greeks thinktanks like Aristotle defended slavery and opposed the notion of human equality. He also thought women are incapable of making their own decisions and are just subjects for men, a little higher than slaves.  So are you going to use those as your shining example of morality? If it's just you making a point that homosexuality always existed then we already know but that doesn't make it natural just like those other ideas of past civilizations.  >This is also more confirmed by how other mammals have homosexual tendencies similar to humans  You want to argue about animals, then you must also know that their acts of homosexuality is mostly aggressive to prove a male's dominance over the other. They don't experience homosexuality the way you think they do. Even then homosexuality is observed in a minority of a very few amount of species that can't be compared to the entirety of the animal kingdom.  There are also mammals who also eat their own children. This isn't an argument. In fact, if you want to talk about Biology, then I can only tell you that Biology views homosexuals as fault in a species. Redundant individuals that can't contribute to the continuation of that species.  >Let's add a bit of nuance, two adults having sex in an isolated room in secret have objectively harmed no one and have sanely enjoyed a human act. if it was a murderer killing a suicidal person we know both people have insanely enjoyed the act and harmed themselves, society and many other people.  That's the idea. Where do we draw the line of insane vs sane. Where do we draw the line overall? Homosexuality at most times were considered insane  If a suicidal person who wanted to die was killed by a murderer then who to blame? Isn't the suicidal person has a right to his own life? If he decided to forfeit it then it's his own choice and the murderer is just someone who helped him do that. The only person affected here are just those two. Then what about the families? It's none of their own business, right?  Years ago, when homosexuality was considered a taboo and families would cry and grieve if they found out that their son was gay, now it's changed to acceptance by the family and the society. Why can't those same families accept that their son wanted to die and respect that wish just like how they learned to accept homosexuality? Why can't the society learn to accept that as well?  The lines are getting blurred and shifted.  &#x200B;  >Fucking and raping a goat?    No consent,most likely insane  Yeah, cows didn't ask to be milked and animals didn't ask to be domesticated and bred to our own liking. You can train a dog or a goat or a mare whatever animal you want to enjoy that kind of sick act. I swear I saw one day a person rubbing off his *own dog.* So what insanity and what consent are you speaking of? Insanity is subjective as homosexuality was classified as mental disorder once and consent doesn't work with animals the way it works with humans.  &#x200B;  >Fucking a child who consents?    Harmful ---->pedophilia is bad(not-to-mention most pedophiles do it for the power and ego trip not for genuine attraction to young kids,so it alot of timesis under insanity)\[sources available\]   >   >A gay couple?    Consensual,not harmful,and sane as its similar to any heterosexual relationship.  Blankly saying "Pedophilia is bad" is not an argument. Why is it bad then? Does your source prove that every pedophile is just a person on ego trip and not someone who's genuinely feel attracted to kids? What if he's genuinely attracted to kids and her parents agreed to such relationship under their supervision? There are many what-ifs here that can destroy the whole argument of "pedophilia is bad". In fact what decides the age of consent? Both body and maturity argument can be disputed. The west doesn't even know why the age of consent is the way it is.  A gay couple which is a couple who can't procreate is in itself harmful to the society unless they get outside help. Especially in Europe with their low birth rates which is basically relying on the immigrants at the moment. Then there's the AIDS argument. A gay male couple is multiple times more likely to be infected with AIDS and other STDs due to how gay sex works, unless they take various precautions of course. As opposed to normal male/female relationship where the vagina normally lubricates itself and disinfects itself to receive the male penis, which happens, you know, *naturally.*  In fact, the HIV virus emerged in sub-Saharan Africa where prostitution was running rampant. Let alone homosexuality. Source's available as you'd say.  &#x200B;  >by all standards of scientific and natural and historic knowledge Homosexuality has always been a sane human trait of people   >   >I am not forcing anyone,that wording is more appropiate to people forcing people to hide their sane human selves to disallow "deviation"\[Why LGBT people are political,I can tell you more about that if you want\].    And yes LGBT people deserve human rights.  As I've refuted, the historic context is of no value. Also what doctors? Ideologically driven doctors who face persecution or cancelling if they didn't conform to that agenda? Because I'm sure there are many doctors that are against than pro- and I'm pretty sure they study in the same field of medicine.  About that forcing, don't make me laugh, the west imprison people who refuse to accept homosexuality under the pretext of "hate speech", in the US, you cancel people and put others under peer pressure to boycott them if that certain someone casually disagreed with LGBT agenda without harming or hurting anyone. Canada was on its way to enact a law that criminalizes a person who misgenders someone else. You made some freak thing called deadnaming and you're lynching people who do it under the name of transphobia. You reversed it and made that anyone who don't accept homosexuality is actually the "deviant"  even if it's his own opinion and of course he gets bullied and lynched for it.  You can argue for whatever you want but this certain point is just wrong.	1643047051.0	hu1ottt	t3_sbhxkm	t1_hu1a1t9	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/hu1ottt/

With that said, all drugs should be highly regulated and a few of them should only be consumed in predetermined safe spaces.

Honestly, I envy him, at least he’s much more focused on his studies and career beside having way more fun in life.

gihjmxb1	The haram police actually doesn’t care about the halal and haram concept. All they care about is furthering their patriarch agenda. They want women to wear hijab and follow allah but most of them watch porn at night. They want everyone, even Christians to fast ramadan (or not drink infront of them) but they themselves curse 24/7. They are okay with sexual assault and thugs movies because it furthers their patriarch agenda and sympathizes with sex offenders but series *against* sex offenders ? They try to ban it (الطاووس ramadan 2021 was threatened a ban but ونوس and ملوك الجدعنة wasn’t)  The problem I have mostly is the blunt hypocrisy and brutality. We aren’t the only country where most men are assholes but we are a country that bluntly says “majority whether it is right or wrong wins fuck minority” no logic no religious backup just pure bullshit they get away with because they are the majority and they are proud of this. I once got into an argument with someone saying Abdullah rushdy said “كلمة كافر يعني غير مومن انا كافر عن المسيحين و هما كفار عندي" I told this person Abdullah got away with saying this **publicly** because he is a Muslim, what if a Christian person says this publicly? The person bluntly told me "احنا الاغلبية احنا بس الحقنا نقول كده" see? But he fail to understand that this saying gives france a pass for trying to ban hijab cause well muslims are minority in france and minorities got no right.  obviously not everyone is like this but if the shoe fits wear it	1643049840.0	hu1wc9m	t3_sbs49s	t3_sbs49s	/r/Egypt/comments/sbs49s/important/hu1wc9m/

The findings show that the mummies’ closest kin were ancient farmers from a region that includes present-day Israel and Jordan. Modern Egyptians, by contrast, have inherited more of their DNA from central Africans."  Modern Egyptians inherited more of their DNA from central Africans???????????

Don't like something? Ignore it. That "was" the prevalent idea in the West.  I am personally glad many Egyptians are pro freedom of thought. Enough with the Nasserist controls. This, however, means that you are free to criticize. I am talking about calls to ban.

Hardly "popular media". Yeh sure the ancient Egyptian characters are too sub-saharan African looking and sounding but it's hardly a crime against humanity and white people have done worse.  >https://twitter.com/janeandersoncdg/status/1479506410992017416?s=21  Sorry could you tell me what was wrong here? Nothing about Egypt was mentioned in that interview.  Since you get so triggered by ancient Egyptians being depicted as black, how do you feel about them being depicted as white Europeans? Here are some huge hollywood movies of that example:  Cleopatra  Exodus: Gods and Kings  Gods of Egypt  The Mummy  The Mummy Returns  The Ten Commandmants  There's also the upcoming movie with Gal Gadot starring as Cleopatra. Now Cleopatra was of Greek descent but the other native Egyptian characters are going to be white actors too.	1643052484.0	hu23f4v	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu1s2df	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu23f4v/

If you are willing to accept any delay, and you don’t want to deduct the cost of such delay then its up to you, but if I am not willing to, then by no means I am the bad guy here.

bm9l28me	>You just try to deviate away cause your argument is weak.  I didn't deviate from anything actually. If my argument is weak then prove it. You haven't shown any evidence to show my argument is weak. Akala literally says that according to the latest evidence, ancient Egyptians were mixed race just like Egyptians are today. And he even asks why Hollywood don't use Egyptian actors or actors who look like modern Egyptians to play ancient Egyptian characters.  Not responding to my other points means that you are deviating because your own argument is weak. I keep proving how Akala was not saying ancient Egyptians were black and telling you about the other things he talks about in that lecture. You keep circling back to the point I made that the lecture is literally not afrocentrist. Arguing with you is a waste of time because you obviously did not watch the video and you're just arguing from a literally ignorant point of view.

( تلك أمة قد خلت لها ما كسبت ولكم ما كسبتم ولا تسألون عما كانوا يعملون )  لو هنصحك بحاجة ممكن اقولك ١- غيري من صحبتك و اتجهي اني تصاحبي ناس يحسنو منك و تتطورو مع بعض. بدل مصاحبة التافهين الي بيجرو ورا تريندات. Show me your friends I show you your future.  ٢- مفيش بديل لقراية الكتب، مفيش فيديو في الدنيا يعوض الكتب الملموسة و قرايتها ولو مقريتيش كتب انسي انك تنجحي نجاح كويس لمجرد ان معاكي شهادة مثلا. و نوعية الكتب هي الي بتفرق يعني كتب الروايات و الخيال العلمي ممتعة، لكن ملهاش فايدة عملية في الحياة عكس كتب التنمية البشرية و البزنس الخ.  ٣- الرياضة و النوم المظبوط و الاكل الصحي بيحسنو من حياة الانسان و يخلوه اسعد مية مرة من حاله الحالية.  ٤- التلفزيون المصري و السوشيال الميديا بشكل عام مليانة افكار سلبية بتحبط و الحاجات دي بتنتشر زي العدوى و الاحباط هيصيبك، استغلي ال algorithms لصالحك؛ يعني مثلا من كتر فيديوهات البزنس الي بشوفها و التنمية للبشرية دا بقى كل الي بيطلعلي لما افتح اليوتيوب لان البرنامج معمول بالطريقة دي. ما تركز عليه يزداد و يكثر. تركزي في السلبيات السلبيات في حياتك هتزيد. تركزي في الايجابيات الايجابيات في حياتك هتزيد. الموضوع بسيط جدا.   ٥- الحاجة الوحيدة المهمة في الوضع الحالي في مصر هي الحاجات الي ممكن تأثر على شغلك او هدفك الي بتطمحي ليه، زي تغيير في القوانين و الكلام دا. اكتر من كدة كسمه و مش مهم.   ٦- حاجة حلوة انك مش بتفكري في السفر زي الناس التانية، مصر فيها خير كتير جدا و فلوس على قفا من يشيل بس للي فاهم و مجتهد و ال mindset  بتاعته مظبوطة. الموضوع بسيط، لكن مش سهل و عايز مجهود جبار و اجتهاد. و الي قدها عملها.    شكرا بس كدة يمكن في حاجات تانية غابت عني دلوقتي بس عشان مشغول حبتين و قاعد بقرا و مش فاضي. بالتوفيق ليكي و لكل الناس الي عايزة تبقى حاجة. و الي محبط و مش عايز يبقى حاجة كسمه لحد ما ميبقاش محبط و يعوز يبقى حاجة.   زياد اوت	1643053084.0	hu24ztg	t3_sbotzr	t3_sbotzr	/r/Egypt/comments/sbotzr/هو_ايه_اللي_المفروض_أعرفهأعمله/hu24ztg/

Some African American musicians moved to Egypt in the 1920s because it was a place where they were just normal to look at and they suffered no discrimination.	1643054166.0	hu27tyz	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu1fdbn	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu27tyz/

bm3a72f7	We weren’t colonized by the just the British. Most empires to ever exist on the face of the earth colonized Egypt one way or the other. Greeks, Romans, Persians, Arabs, and many more. To say that modern colonialism, the past maybe 200 years, had the greatest effect on Egyptian society is laughable. The colonial effects on Egypt go beyond British imperialism. It’s a hasty generalization to cherry pick British imperialism and relate Egypt to the way it affected the rest of Africa.   It’s a logical fallacy alright, however after I gave evidence (the tone) to support my claim it’s Afrocentrist.	1643054380.0	hu28e66	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu26xzk	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu28e66/

bm9l28me	>Its just fucking beyond me as to why the FUCK you defend these people  I'm not defending afrocentrics at all. If you read through all my comments I actually have nothing nice to say about them. I'm just deliberately rattling the cage to show how silly and pathetic your outrage is at them.  >yes white people have done worse but they aren't claiming to be Egyptians  Ah so it is relatively kinda bad for white people to invade, occupy, colonise, rape, pillage, plunder, and loot Egypt but that's fine, at least they're not claiming to be Egyptians. Thank god for that. (Actually, in the beginning of Egyptology, Europeans believed the ancient Egyptians were Europeans who moved there)  >actively stealing our culture  Ah so all those Egyptian artefacts in European and American museums were just borrowed politely?  >STOP DEFENDING AFROCENTRICS, you shill for them for some fucking reason  Again I never defended them. It's actually Egyptian redditors like you who are totally obsessed with them. Looks like they live in your head rent free.  >About the interview, it's largely the same sentiment being used with    Egypt, its happening to north Africans as well I was just too lazy to    get any other sources  They said African emperor and that he was from North Africa. North Africa is in Africa last time I checked. You're too lazy about getting other sources because there aren't any. Please tell me how enraged you are at white people being cast as ancient Egyptians.

2go7m2nd	This is the best advice. Use the languages you know - Arabic, English, French, whatever - to find new perspective. Try to read news and analysis that comes from people and institutions who have a good reputation, but also be aware of their biases. Reading news from more than one county will give you an excellent understanding of how implicit bias works. Eventually you will realize that even journalists/historians/bloggers with the best intention will have some kind of bias. That’s just human.   For the existential crisis part, I recommend reading literature and philosophy. Dostoevsky, Plato, Camus, and Descartes’ meditations are all great starts. There’s also a really great novel written in English by an Egyptian called “Beer in the Snooker Club” that beautifully describes some existential struggles.	1643054967.0	hu29wp5	t3_sbotzr	t1_hu18u00	/r/Egypt/comments/sbotzr/هو_ايه_اللي_المفروض_أعرفهأعمله/hu29wp5/

 و من حقك هنا مثلا تسأليني : طب فين الكتب اللي عن 25 يناير ؟ و هنا اتمنى متاخديش كلامي على انه بنبرة الحكيم اللي جايلك من سابع سماء و كده لأني لا حكيم و لا غيره و زايي زايك زي اللي بيردوا عليكي ، مجرد واحد بيحاول يعرف اكتر ، لكن انا كنت اه شاب بس كبير نسبيا ايام 2011 و بقولهالك بضمير مستريح تماما : اغلبية كاسحة من الكتب اللي عنها عايزة تاخد القارئ إما يمين إما شمال .   يعني مثلا اقدر اقول لك اقري أليس الصبح بقريب؟ لبلال فضل عشان تشوفي الموضوع نضال نبيل و كفاح شباب من اجل لقمة العيش و الحرية و كل البطولات دى و اننا قاومنا مبارك اللى مفيش شعب ف الدنيا يقدر يقاوم رئيس بنصف قوته ، و اقدر اقول لك اقري كتاب الاحتلال المدني لعمرو عمّار (الشهير بـ اسرار 25 يناير) عشان تشوفي ان الموضوع كان صراع مصالح داخلي و خارجي و ان مصر كانت ضحية من ضحايا مخطط الشرق الأوسط الجديد و اننا لبسنا مسرحية كبرى ؛ اقدر برضك اقول لك اقرى 25 يناير و الصراع حول السلطة بتاع طارق البشري و شوفي احنا ازاي استندلنا مع الاخوان و رمينا الديمقراطية في الزبالة ، و اقدر اقول لك اقري الكتاب الجديد بتاع ياسر رزق اللى اسمه "سنوات الخماسين" عشان تشوفي اننا كنا ف كارثة كبيرة و خرجنا من قبضة الاخوان بأعجوبة من أعاجيب الزمن . و أجزِم لك انك هتنبهري من الانفصال بينهم ف رؤية الأمر . الحقايق تقريبا واحدة ، و الاحداث متطابقة ، بس ده شايفها ب شكل و التاني شايفها بشكل تاني خالص و كل واحد بيدعم كلامه من خلال وجهة نظره و مجالات تخصصه و التفاصيل اللى تهمه و الاهداف اللى بيعليها على حساب غيرها م الاهداف ، و مفيش سبيل خالص لتوحيد الاولويات بينهم - و دى طبيعة البشر عموما .    ف انتي احسن حاجة ليكي اقري السياق العام خالص و كوّني الصورة الكبيرة عن خط سير الاحداث قبلها بشوية (و قبلها بكتير شويتين كمان) و حللي الأمر و اتأكدي من صحة المعلومات و مصادرها و قوّي منهجك ف التفكير النقدي ، و هتلاقي الصورة بتوضح لك مع الوقت .   &#x200B;  و لو ميالة للسمع و المشاهدة ف ده مش وحش خالص لكن لن يغنيك عن القراءة اظن ، لكن عموما يوتيوب مليان ، اتفرجي عالبرامج ف الفترة بتاعت 2005-2013 ، اتفرجي و اتفرجي و اتفرجي بغض النظر عن مين المذيع و سيبك من اي افكار مسبقة او شتايم و سخرية من المذيع ده مهما كان ، باسم يوسف و ماله بل كمان شوفي احمد موسى بعد باسم يوسف كله هيفيدك طول ما الواحد مش بينقاد ورا حد و مش راسم لنفسه جدول سياسي لازم يلبّي خاناته و طلباته ، و توفيق عكاشة حتى ميضرش (اه والله متستهتريش بحد مهما قال اي عبط ، اللى بيقول اى هبل ف اى اتجاه غالبا بيبقى له رسائل ضمنية مبطنة يقصدها كويس - و دى خطورة الإعلام و النشر عموما ) ، او احمد خميس كذلك مهما ضحكك ، او ابراهيم عيسى مهما قال و مهما كان بيجيب بعض الضيوف المنفصلين عن الواقع من ايام حتشبسوت ، او قناة الناس و الحافظ و خالد عبد الله (بتاع يا واد مؤمن) مهما جاب ضيوف محرضين و ارهابيين بالسمنة البلدي ، و احمد سبايدر مهما اتكلم ف الماسونية العالمية و استهداف سكان كوكب المريخ للرئيس مبارك ، و غيره و غيره و غيره و اتطمني انك هتعرفي كتير عن السياق العام للوضع ايامها و كمان هتضحكي كتير و مش هتزهقي ( الفرفشة مهمة ) ، و متقوليش لأ لأي معلومة تيجي ف طريقك عموما . وثائقي مؤيد من هنا على وثائقي معارض من هنا و الدنيا هتبان شوية شوية ، اتفرجي فقط من باب توثيق الحالة و ادراك الظروف وقتها و عشان تعرفي السياق بشكل افضل ليس إلا ، مش عشان حد يعجبك او ميعجبكيش . متفترضيش وجود نهاية واحدة لأن الطرق كتير و متشابكة و متقاطعة بل كمان منها المتعارضة ، احنا نقرأ و نتابع و نعرف اكتر فوق اي اعتبار ، و كفى .      ف ده الأهم دلوقتى ، جمعي اكبر قدر من المعلومات عن السياق و الصورة الكبيرة ، و فى النهاية خلي ف دماغك دايما ان **تكوين معرفة حقيقية و ربط الخيوط ببعضها عملية تراكمية و بتاخد وقت و مالهاش طريق مختصر .**   &#x200B;

ioe9q	Because the pharaohs during the Roman era were from Palestine and Jordan? That makes perfect sense. At this time, the Pharaohs were placed by the Roman empire, legitimized by the priesthood. The Egyptian Civilization had numerous pharaohs that were born outside Egypt, and were not really Egyptians. This is certainly true during the Greek and roman empires. The throne of Egypt was more like a game of thrones, where any ruler who defeated Egypt's armies in battle would then become pharaoh by ceremony of the preisthood. When looking for Pharaohs who were pure Egyptians, you have to look to before 500 BC, and have to focus on Upper Egypt, not Lower Egypt, after the capital moved to Lower Egypt, The Pharaohs were less and less Egyptian.	1643055353.0	hu2awrx	t3_s8s0xa	t1_hu29xi0	/r/Egypt/comments/s8s0xa/isis_art_work_hope_you_like_it/hu2awrx/

And the fact that he’s a settler colonialist himself justifying and propagating that absurd logic speaks volumes on its own.	1643055716.0	hu2buyh	t3_sbfzm5	t1_htzz48p	/r/Egypt/comments/sbfzm5/ايه_افضل_كتاب_قرأته_سواء_كان_عربى_او_انجليزى_غير/hu2buyh/

So to access it you have to literally connect your device to a server in Europe or UAE via old underground caples. I would say the analogy still holds, since in both cases you literally have to spend money and time to access said services. and while both will be happy to serve you they aren't primarily targeting the Egyptian people.  It's literally a service that you pay for.	1643056019.0	hu2cnli	t3_sbq5ra	t1_hu1ycv6	/r/Egypt/comments/sbq5ra/netflix_is_not_one_of_your_constitutional_rights/hu2cnli/

Egypt's most Iconic pharaoh, who lived way before 500 bc was from Lower Egypt, Ramsis the 2nd.   and you can cry about Nubians all you like. but Egyptians listed them multiple times as one of Egypt's enemies. in fact the ancient Nubians helped the Hyksos when Egypt was weak, not to mention they stole our culture. so no. try again.	1643056169.0	hu2d1my	t3_s8s0xa	t1_hu2awrx	/r/Egypt/comments/s8s0xa/isis_art_work_hope_you_like_it/hu2d1my/

I'm inclined to disagree since the 19th and 20th centuries were the fastest paced and most radically changing the world has ever seen. But again, I don't know enough to form a strong opinion about that. That doesn't mean that Egyptian historians seeking to reclaim their history and retell the story of the Egyptian people under European colonialism can't be regarded as taking part in post-colonial history. Many of the history books published by AUC Press fall under this category.	1643056674.0	hu2ecp4	t3_sbn3mx	t1_hu2dcjs	/r/Egypt/comments/sbn3mx/seriously_guys/hu2ecp4/

6wki75rl	Well I think that your logic is flawed. You didn’t get the analogy right as well.   Everyone knows quite well that whatever’s on Netflix might collide with whatever values or beliefs we have and that’s ok. What was really surprising and hence anomalous about the movie (and hence the hype) was that this is first Egyptian movie on Netflix that discusses these problems which aren’t really rampant (almost non existent) in our societies in comparison to the west. I think that was the reason for the outcry.  Back to your strip club analogy, it was simply like: let’s build a strip club in a place without strip clubs. In this case, I’d say the  protest was perfectly valid.	1643056760.0	hu2eksm	t3_sbq5ra	t3_sbq5ra	/r/Egypt/comments/sbq5ra/netflix_is_not_one_of_your_constitutional_rights/hu2eksm/

What I liked about the book was its interesting approach at examining human history. The book’s combination between biology, history, and anthropology offers the reader a wider perspective to the evolution of human history, thus provide a better understanding to how we came to be. For that only, I recommend the book!	1643057429.0	hu2gcsc	t3_sbfzm5	t1_hu2buyh	/r/Egypt/comments/sbfzm5/ايه_افضل_كتاب_قرأته_سواء_كان_عربى_او_انجليزى_غير/hu2gcsc/

Ok seriously though, I don't think there would've been a better version of me: a bit poorer, and I would've been the evil incarnate, a bit richer and I would've been swimming in the pool of desire.   Ok, maybe too poetic. I grew up in a poor suburban industrial zone, in Egypt ofc. My family is, compared to the rest of the people around us, well off. My education, and that's the best part, was in public schools till prep, and my highschool was an international institute, it was boys only, and it taught us discipline, like too much discipline.

8m8q3ery	I think assuming something doesn’t exist because it’s not visible to you (because, mind you, society really ostracises members of that group and prosecutes them) IS THE FALLACY.  I want to gently remind you that once upon a time in the United States of America in the 1970s, Americans were convinced that LGBT+ people were a tiny insignificant minority that didn’t really exist in the US. In the 1960s Americans and the British were even convinced that gay people were Soviet spies..  …that they could not possibly know someone who was gay.  Now imagine how shocked they were when some of their friends, family and favourite celebrities all started dying during the AIDS crisis.  Interestingly, something very similar is happening in Egypt rn. Where LGBT+ Egyptians are labelled as heretics, traitors and western agents and the media wants you to believe that only a handful exists in our society.  I’ll now leave you to make up your mind.	1643060454.0	hu2oeuz	t3_sbq5ra	t1_hu2kxnc	/r/Egypt/comments/sbq5ra/netflix_is_not_one_of_your_constitutional_rights/hu2oeuz/

I have been there mate, I am old enough to remember "الميدان" I was naive back then and I chanted along thinking Mubarak's 77 billion dollars will be split equally between all Egyptians but i quickly sobered up when the bearded ones showed up, and I woke up to the reality of how much of a fool I was when the brotherhood appointed their halfwit as president. I accepted that I bought into a lie based on naive immature collective wishful thinking.

is3otqix	So I was a pretty sheltered kid, little tv and no internet till I was maybe 12. So I'd spend most of my time plotting out novels: setting, character arcs etc. One of them was about this little planet that verged off its solar orbit and  started aimlessly floating through space (I was 10 so this made sense). The civilization however was advanced enough to extract heat from the core of the planet to sustain agriculture and all that.   Now why am I telling you this? Because the name I'd put for this little novel was none other but Akira, also the name of probably the most influential sci-fi animated movie there is, released decades before I was even born, unknowingly to me. I have only found this out a few months ago, imagine how haywire I went.	1643063102.0	hu2vbz7	t3_sbvu7i	t3_sbvu7i	/r/Egypt/comments/sbvu7i/is_there_like_a_place_where_you_can_find/hu2vbz7/

h1klkmag	That's an interesting twist you wrote about there, the planet you spoken about since you said it doesn't make much sense that it started to float off. It could be a case of a Pluto or a body that was never a planet to begin with. Which would make somewhat some sense, but i love the idea regardless. Regarding naming your works look. It is a very very long process or researching and name finding, i suggest you take your time and do google searches whenever you come up with a name. At least that's how I do it, If the name you came up with didn't return any results most likely its only you who made it depending on how complex or common combinations used.	1643063443.0	hu2w7o8	t3_sbvu7i	t1_hu2vbz7	/r/Egypt/comments/sbvu7i/is_there_like_a_place_where_you_can_find/hu2w7o8/

61t0a12x	My message is for anyone here in this sub-reddit is being pro-government (because I saw a guy typing if they were anti-government prisioners ) , this video is a proof that our country is an embarrassing country and IT HASN'T CHANGED A BIT FOR THE AVERAGE EGYPTIAN , look at how they are treated  in addition the outside world ( basically other Egyptians ) keep saying that those people are MB , for f sake at the end of the day they are damn HUMAN BEINGS !  Oh boy in the next couple of years to a decade , I wouldn't be surprised if there was mass migration to the west, and those for anyone who is going to defend the governments action, I am just going to respond to you in a response no matter your age or career field or whatever, don't get shocked , when you find women's from our own country running to impress mens from other countries for the sole purpose of not coming back to Egypt.  Don't get flabbergasted when the future generation feel embarrassed to even call themselves Egyptians, Its enough already that the average Egyptian is not even living  A HUMANE LIFE!!!.  DON'T GET SHOCKED WHEN YOU FIND IN THE COMING YEARS , MASS MIGRATION OF ALL AGES WHO ARE CAPABLE TO MIGRATE , TO END UP IN THE WEST , because I can assure you , from many people I spoke too , they all have the same mindset of leaving , to the point some want to leave with no return!!!  Anyone who justifies the actions of the government , Please go f yourself!!!!
