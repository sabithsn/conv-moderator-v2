9f513x5h	When I meet a guy who is overweight and his profile pictures are NOT, it tells me that 1) maybe he's dishonest, and 2) it is medically possible for him to be a healthy weight but for some reason he has not made his health a priority.  Both of these are reasons not to date... no matter how charming their personality.	1640862203.0	hqj7vxl	t3_rrjgbd	t1_hqh91w5	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrjgbd/nope_im_gonna_keep_dating_men_that_im_actually/hqj7vxl/

qi5i5	Thank you for this break down! I’ve always hated Issa and Lawrence’s dynamic because it reminded me of toxic relationships I’ve been in or witnessed firsthand. I was proud of Issa initially for walking away from Lawrence and the baby situation but when they ended up getting back together? It just seemed childish and immature. After making so many strides with her professional life, Issa backpedaled on herself so hard. It was disappointing.  And even in regards to Nathan I cringed when she was trying to get him to say he loved her. Like girl! What are you doing?! Issa needed more quality time with herself being single.	1640862884.0	hqj8s0f	t3_rrdgzf	t3_rrdgzf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrdgzf/insecure_has_a_lot_of_examples_of_lvm_hvm_and_the/hqj8s0f/
9f513x5h	They will also defend your ra pist in court. They will also "not choose sides" if your soon to be ex-husband is violently abusive towards you and you are trying to leave the relationship. They will act distrustful of you if you are single/separated/divorced and you are invited to any event where "their man" is present. They will brag about how they were "good" because they did all the housework and baby care right after giving birth, thus setting impossible standards for women who experienced complicated recoveries after childbirth. They will snoop in your bathroom cabinets when they come to your house to get your beauty secrets. They will also dump you for people they think are "cooler". They will act competitive about their children, because their children are ALWAYS better than yours. They think it's cute to post on social media that their husbands are "the 4th child"... and include photos of their husbands sitting on a couch looking at his phone while all around him are unfolded clothes and unwashed cups.  They will lie to get the men they want. They will take up str\*pping, s\*x work, or amateur p\*rn to impress men. They will discover that it is dangerous and say that they do not want their daughters to do that sort of work... but walking around without a bra on in front of their 23-year-old male co-workers is totally fine.	1640862886.0	hqj8s56	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqj8s56/

3pbgrnpq	Honestly I learned this very early on at 19. I had a crush on my friend who was mildly chubby. Like overweight BMI but he had a cute face. There were garbage insecurities that he would never grow out of.   He did not improve. He never learned to take care of himself or his surroundings. He perpetuated incel ideology more the fatter he got. And he absolutely tried to neg me, because I was young pretty and rejected him when he tried to touch my thigh while we were hanging out.  He idealized our shorter friend as his manic pixie dream girl. He was the pornsick epitome of a future redpiller.	1640863564.0	hqj9ow5	t3_rrjgbd	t1_hqh6hpx	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrjgbd/nope_im_gonna_keep_dating_men_that_im_actually/hqj9ow5/

8r15jxb0	Yeah I suspect she married him as she wanted to get married and think it'll be pretty much impossible to find another guy with a disfigured face so saw him as "the best choice available". There's a reason why she tried to break up with him but got back together with him after being disfigured. Yes, some women cannot stand the thought of never finding love, but seriously, given how this guy (and other men) are extremely dangerous, it's much better to stay single.   I highly suspect the guy is now pursuing her in the hopes of persuading her to stop filing police complaints against him so that he can escape from being jailed. Unfortunately he did succeed.

8r15jxb0	She's sending the message that even if a guy is extremely violent and dangerous towards women, women may still forgive them. This isn't a good thing.

czlxwnft	This is so untrue.... all my LV exes had both parents.   It just depends if the mum was a pickme or an enabler.   If the mum is single, independent and fierce refusing to settle in a bad relationship, well I think the son will ultimately see that and respect women even more so for it.   What children look at and bring with them into adulthood is the dynamic between the 2 parents...   if he sees his dad abusing his mum, he'll be more likely to abuse women. If he sees his mum no standing up for herself, he'll later take advantage of women as well.  If the dad was absent for travelling or whatever and coming home as he pleases and the mum was still lingering for the relationship, this is what he'll see too...  The all single mum generalisation is so untrue and very narrow minded	1640864398.0	hqjata6	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjata6/
8chnorsd	All right, I was gonna just scroll on by without comment but since you’ve specifically asked for opinions here it is.   Your post strikes me as naive. I understand how you got to here, but it honestly just screams that you’re young and have limited experience of single mothers as a whole and not just the common tropes. Which, I will admit, do exist but aren’t indicative of the whole.   It reads as the same tired argument I hear from men all the time. LV ones at that. “Single mothers are good for fun but don’t keep one.” “If you raise another man’s child you’re a beta.” And other general “they’re failed as women” comments. This is the next logical step to they’re failed as mothers.   Yet again it’s the idea that the woman who stayed to be a parent is to blame for the actions of the man that leaves. Now, with that said, there are certainly points to be made about being more careful about who you procreate with. Granted.   Here’s the thing though;  - Men can seem high value for a long long time. May not even start to show traits until you’re years in and potentially already married with kids. - People do die. Widows exist.  - People are allowed to realise they made a mistake and course correct, in fact lots of abused women do leave when children enter the picture or they become pregnant - It’s possible to be a good Mum alone and a bad Mum with a partner.   Etc etc   Basically, it reads as immature, a little cruel, a continuation of lots of lower value societal nonsense, a lack of nuance, and generally made me eyeroll.   With all that said; if this is a boundary for you, have at it. It doesn’t personally affect me one way or the other what your red flags are, and your reasons are sound (even if I personally find them misapplied).   Not my area, I don’t really have to take offence to this and it doesn’t change my life in any material way.	1640864667.0	hqjb6c5	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqhwudk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjb6c5/

8r15jxb0	I guess some women want to gold dig as as think they can go "from rags to riches", but you need to remember at the end of the day, it's his money not your money. Most men are not dumb enough to shower a women with luxurious gifts without expecting something in return. A lot of these rich men not only want a trophy SO but someone he can control.  Don't forget if your SO comes from a wealthy family and you do not, they may look down upon you for being born poor. Many rich families are classist as fuck and want nothing to do with the poor (except donating money, establishing charities, and volunteering to boost their public image). Maybe they'll like you if you look like a supermodel as many rich families want their sons to have a hot wife, but many will expect you to always listen to them simply because they are the wealthier ones.	1640864906.0	hqjbi05	t3_rrlubb	t3_rrlubb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrlubb/another_post_about_golddiggingsugarbabying/hqjbi05/
cw1rizx2	Just no, OP. You keep saying everyone's not that black and white and that good people can do shit things. No. I've been there before as the cheater. There's nothing glorious about it, and I was being a shit person. It didn't matter how shitty my partner was or how good the next one was.  To make matters worse, apparently the partner of your romantic isn't that bad of a person. Cheating is cheating. It's the easy option for when you want to have it all and cower in fear of the consequences. Honestly, people will say anything to talk good what they've done, and you never can until you can accept that what you've done has made you into a liar and a person who hurts others in their favour.	1640865004.0	hqjbmwz	t3_rrwdke	t3_rrwdke	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjbmwz/

These men label these women as superficial yet they want an extremely hot SO so it's not like they are any less superficial. A lot of these men who hate "gold diggers" are broke themselves so I guess they resent the idea of women picking men based on wealth (as it doesn't work in their favour).	1640865352.0	hqjc4av	t3_rrbvkk	t3_rrbvkk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrbvkk/golddigers_are_not_shallow_they_are_smart_women/hqjc4av/
4974ugy9	Pickmes have deep-rooted, pathological amounts of jealousy. I understand being a teenager/early twenties woman who gives a man too many chances because she's inexperienced. After all, all women have been socialized to be pickmes.   But I don't understand the women who are sycophantic slaves to men. That pickmeism isn't about naivety. That's a choice. Once you start endangering other women, you can't be redeemed  My mother defends every rapist in the family: her father, her husband, every fucking man she ever met. She's the first to cancel women for non-issues like having standards. But wax poetic about giving men leniency. I had a friend 2 years ago who got involved with a porn addict that admitted to taking secret videos of people. While she's begging for him to make her oFfiCial🙄🤡, me (and 2 other women) were trying to explain that he's a fucking predator	1640865404.0	hqjc6zi	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjc6zi/

Please research and exhaust all the supports provided by the government, agencies, search for grants, if possible enrol in a study with an inbuilt co-op opportunity, it will take a huge pressure from job hunting, and you will know real people of an industry.

I asked him point blank how I was supposed to know if he wouldn't to the same to me after a decade of being together, and he said he was sure it wouldn't be the same because he had never felt the way he feels for me for his gf.

5ffusqdz	I agree that there is an attack on HVM and HVW by the media, and I don't care about your love for the 2002 Spiderman either.   All I'm trying to show you is that the majority who read your post aren't taking you seriously because you presented a poor argument since you haven't even watched the movies and you're basing everything you're writing on superficial first impressions of compilation clips on YouTube.  I honestly wish you wrote up an analysis of movies or TV shows you have actually watched. We would have all enjoyed the critique.  For example, I would have compared the early 2000s Spidermans to other popular LVM TV shows that came about in the late 2000s like Mad Men, Californication, Shameless, Sons of Anarchy. Shows that appeal to LVM and implant in their minds images that successful rich men are cheaters and that women should put up with LV broke scrotes.  The recent Spiderman movies are TAME compared to the filth being promoted to men on TV in the late 2000s.   Tbh, Peter and MJ in the 2020s Spiderman are really awkward and cute (as they should be, they're kids in the middle of highschool) and I think Tom Holland is a positive example to young boys of how to be a HVM when you're just 15-16. He respects and treats MJ really well, he is attentive, a good listener, cares about her interests, respectful of her boundaries and looked for a good moment to get to know her better, and made a huge effort to make sure that he can confess that he likes her properly. It's all very age appropriate, and their relationship is only *just* beginning at the end of the second film.	1640865775.0	hqjcpte	t3_rrc214	t1_hqgxvs2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrc214/the_change_in_spiderman_films_reveals_how_men/hqjcpte/

yx4bq	Even single pick mes can be dangerous as their need to get a man is above the friendship. But yes regardless we should just keep HV people around us and avoid pick mes at all cost. I think it's ok to try and help a pick me friend to see the wrong in her ways and be there for her when her pickeism is still on a non damaging state and if they show to genuinely be your friend but if they don't want to listen or if her pickeism goes up and up then it's time to let that pick me go.	1640866962.0	hqjefwp	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqix1lf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjefwp/
15f5s8	He was aware that he was being entirely selfish. He also said there's no way he could start his new career homeless.   His partner is awesome. He said that, too. She's always been a great girlfriend as far as I know, and he always tried to be the best boyfriend he could be to her. When we just became friends, he talked about how they just made sense. I thought it was cute. I actually usually only have friendships with taken men, and in those cases know their girlfriends as well. I met this guy through a mutual friend of ours.   I really didn't expect to fall for him, but our friendship seemed to naturally progress that way. I could've saved myself a world of hurt had I stuck to my guns the first time of no contact.	1640866965.0	hqjeg27	t3_rrwdke	t1_hqjbmwz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjeg27/

8zttver0	If you're living with my alternative - debilitating cramps every month that often are debilitating even with a double dose pain killers - then giving birth is not that bad. And I tore all around, one tear definitely went to the outskirts of my clit, too... Another one through my right inner labia - and with that one, the stitches couldn't keep it together. But even a split labia doesn't really bother me at all.  Saying birth isn't that bad (with proper medical care) is like saying traffic isn't all that dangerous (if you adhere to all the rules): Most of us go through it with no (lasting) issues, and a very low percentage gets it really bad.	1640867046.0	hqjekbl	t3_rr88l6	t1_hqh2f0e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rr88l6/forced_female_bonding_over_kids_though_childfree/hqjekbl/

9p6f6ftv	I’m sure he felt the exact same way for his girlfriend at some point, but he was **grooming you by making you feel special**. I’m not saying you’re not special, I’m saying that the way a man feels about a woman is often way more about the type of man he is than about the type of woman she is. Any woman who’s fresh pussy pining for him outside of his relationship would be “special”,  because it makes him feel desired. It’s not about you, it’s about his ego. I’m sorry this is harsh, but it’s the truth. It doesn’t take much to get along with a man, especially if he’s using you.  As long as you believe you are somehow much more special than other women (or you desperately want to believe you are better or desperately want to be better), you will fall prey to grooming and lovebombing.  To reiterate: you are special and deserving of love, but no more than his girlfriend (unless she is somehow a really LVW and a total pickme, but she’s not the one getting involved with a committed man and hoping he leaves his girlfriend…).  You are a victim of a misogynistic culture, raised to believe that a man saying you’re special is some kind of prize. Everything from music to movies to proverbs grooms women to this type of behaviour.  Who needs to be special is him, sis. You already are, and so is his girlfriend most likely. He’s proven to be the opposite of special. He’s ordinary, a LVM.  This is a simple case of… you don’t need to be picked by a man and told you’re special. You need to pick a special man (not a committed cheater, for starters).  Don’t ask him to pick you over his girlfriend. You know what that makes you.  You will get over this, and hopefully spread the gospel of With An HVM, You Don’t Need To Compete With Another Woman.  HVM do not put you in a position to root and count the days until another woman’s life gets uprooted, her heart broken being left in shambles, betrayed and abused, facing possibly losing her house.	1640867702.0	hqjfjy7	t3_rrwdke	t1_hqjcnfn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjfjy7/

wyjia	A guy I had been dating for maybe 3 months said if we were still together after a year I could move in with him. He talked about how his rent was fixed at about half of what I was paying for my rent, and I’d save so much money splitting with him. He eventually planned to buy the house he was renting. I said nope, I’ll never move into a man’s house and pay into his mortgage. Why put equity into his house especially if we break up, he keeps all that and I get nothing? Plus his house was shittier than my nice apartment and it was in an area of the city I was not interested in moving to. It would’ve been a total downgrade. If I’m gonna move anywhere with a man, it’s gonna be a place we both decided on, after dating for multiple years (I don’t want marriage) and an upgrade from my current living space.	1640867908.0	hqjfv9t	t3_rqm1t1	t1_hqclmkj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rqm1t1/why_you_shouldnt_live_together_before_marriage_2/hqjfv9t/

15f5s8	He didn't get closer, we started wondering about whether our feelings were appropriate for each other around the same time - we were grabbing coffee/lunches together, going to the movies. We were just curious about each other as we seemed to have a lot in common. He initiated the talk about his possibly inappropriate feelings for me, and that not seeing each other again might be the best option, to which I agreed. That should have been the end of it of course. Instead.. this is where several months of emotional investment got me.	1640868410.0	hqjgnoz	t3_rrwdke	t1_hqjep1r	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqjgnoz/

410o4mj2	I'll agree with you that there was a total lack of quality TV in the mid 2000s, however, I am not even talking about the extreme examples of misogyny that we saw then, and instead, a more insidious kind that tends to prevent itself as empowerment.     And a lot of less intelligent, IMO, women fall for it.  I felt like the post got the kind of feedback I was expecting, with a lot of gullible women disagreeing and a lot of smart/older women confirming me and saying theyd observed the same thing. I think it takes some life experience and more deep knowledge to pick up on what I was explaining, and presumably the Marvel set is extremely young and more prone for falling for the "It's empowerment"! tropes that Hollywood sets out.  That's fine.  Water seeks its level, and it doesnt bother me.  I just wish there was a space on FDS where you could sort out the younger, more naive types, and really talk to only HVF.  But, I think most online spaces become kind of congested with less "woke" people as time goes on.  It's the nature of the internet, and FDS has blown up over the past year, so definitely to be expected.  A lot of the new women are genuinely immature and need the knowledge FDS provides a lot more than me, so it's fine that they have come into this space.  But yeah, that's how I feel.  My post really wasnt supposed to be "gotten" by everyone, and if there was a way for me to have tagged it as something like "deep analysis and discourse for vetted HVF only" i definitely would have.  Oh well. Like I said, water seeks its level.	1640868835.0	hqjhcej	t3_rrc214	t1_hqjcpte	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrc214/the_change_in_spiderman_films_reveals_how_men/hqjhcej/

tfi8qd	You’re so right about the hot and cold behaviour, and this is quote apparent in texting conversations with these kinds of men.  I feel like there’s a lot of cross over with narcissistic tendencies and avoidants. They’ll love bomb you and chase you in the beginning, and then pull away and start with the hot and cold behaviour. They’ll be unresponsive to your texts but weeks later, they’ll pop out of nowhere and text you like nothing ever happened.   Avoidants have a hard time maintaining friendships as well, so watch out for men who cycle through friendships quickly and try to escape any mess they’ve made by moving away.   If someone is not giving you the attention you deserve and is not consistent with it, leave.	1640869211.0	hqjhybt	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjhybt/

8zttver0	My last ex clearly exhibited your #1 and #4 issues. Also some covert #3 whenever he was expected to do something, like \*gasp\* being a parent to our daughter. I'm not sure about #2, but he sure partook in their (shitty) investments - or at least followed their example.  However, he grew up as the (single) child of married parents. And, yes, the parents were married until death parted them.  I think these issues are much more prominent in families with a narc mother, where everything has to be just about herself. In other words: A LVW and (most likely) pickme (for all the attention and validation). It's also more common in only sons than in sons with brothers, albeit the latter is not unheard of. With the man being one of several brothers with a narc mom, it's most often the "golden child" that gets the special mommy treatment, as far as my anecdotal evidence shows.	1640869372.0	hqji7ur	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqji7ur/

dqicycba	This is a great post. The only thing I will add here is that it isn't always the "less attractive" friend that is a pick me. The "pick me" woman is also a woman who is attractive sometimes and is obsessed with her own appearance and the appearance of other women. I have had pick me friends around who were more beautiful than me and they would act very insecure and angry and as if they were slighted if they seen a man they wanted give any attention to a woman they thought was not as "attractive". Insecurity is sadly something that can affect any woman regardless of how beautiful or not attractive they may be.	1640869434.0	hqjibn8	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjibn8/

cw7827nc	It’s not that the Pick Me is less attractive is that she *feels* less attractive. For some women, them being beautiful isn’t enough, you have to be ugly, too. They aren’t satisfied unless all male focus is exclusively on them. And like I said men are about control. The attention they give and their obsession is rarely just about attraction, it’s about who they feel is outside their influence. If you’re an FDS women, you’re actually going to attract that obsession and jealousy because they’re going to want to bring you down, and the pick me, not caring that this kind of “attention” is toxic and meant to hurt you, is going to be jealous because the men are pathologically focused on you.

My only relationships that were good or at least not horrible were with men from a stable family.  For me it is like short men. Not all short men are terrible but it improves the odds that they will be terrible if they are short.  Not all men from broken families are terrible but majority of them end up with no positive role model because pickme moms and lvm fathers, ending up with bad behaviors or emotional baggage they never work through.	1640870817.0	hqjkpfw	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjiuvz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjkpfw/

6nqo3j94	Yup. My ex had a deadbeat dad who popped up once in a blue moon (he was a community dick that had a whole other family, classy) and was raised by his mom. Guess who hated his mom and idolized his cheating scrote dad? Guess who grew up to treat women *the exact same way?*  I don't know why people are taking this personally and raging at you in the comments, OP. We all know that 99% of men lack introspection and while a woman can come from a broken home and do the inner work to overcome childhood wounds, *the vast majority of men are never going to bother.* They'll treat women like garbage because they've learned that a man can be a cheating, absent, deadbeat scrote and yet will still get showered with unconditional love by a pickme.	1640871229.0	hqjlg3p	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjlg3p/
b2fueeui	I've heard a lot of talk about friends from my last ex, yet I've never met them. When I moved in with him, he never went to see said friends. Turns out all his social interaction was with colleagues and his mom. Maybe brothers if they needed something from him.  So if a man talks about friends, not only could those relationships be superficial, in some cases they might be nonexistent. I'll definitely be paying more attention to this if I ever date a man again.	1640871233.0	hqjlgc6	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjkdo0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjlgc6/

She bitches about other colleagues and is the only adult woman I work with who tries to form 'cliques'. Everything to her is about getting that sweet, sweet male validation.   I can tell that she *really* doesn't like me (probably because I conduct myself with FDS standards) and would just love the opportunity to knock me down a peg or two.

9f513x5h	It's hard to know, I think. I guess if someone just isn't into you and isn't willing to communicate, you have to move on.   I struggle with getting close to people because in the past, I used to become attached (anxious attachment) and this attracted an abusive narcissist. So now I have over-corrected by being very reserved about my affection, especially in the early stages. It is hard for me to trust people because of my experiences. But it does weed out anyone impatient who is trying to love bomb me. I suppose some people might call this "avoidant".	1640872348.0	hqjnk9n	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjnk9n/
6330th43	There’s rarely an easy and immediate sign but someone over the age of 30 who’s never had a long term relationship is definitely a red flag. Another one is if they come on really strong and pull away shortly after (hot cold like everyone else has said). People may also be temporarily avoidant/emotionally unavailable following a breakup or something traumatic, so don’t date anyone who hasn’t been single for at least a year. Also just listen to the way they talk about themselves - do they say they’re very independent? Do they say they have trust issues?

5eyjl40e	My first husband was avoidant. I've read a lot about it, and it still baffles me overall. However, I understand how he got that way: physical, verbal, emotional abuse as a child; his father died before he was born; his mother married an Appalachian coal miner back in the late 50s. P had three step-brothers, and was treated like a step-child. He also had orthopedic problems (pin in hip at a very young age, teens, I think). He got immersed early in toxic masculinity, and left home around age 17. Never went back or saw his parents again so far as I know.   What I remember:  \-- wanting love, but feeling easily overwhelmed and flooded;  \-- wanting someone around for company, mostly, but giving each other lots of space;  \-- avoiding emotional connection, usually in his case with jokes designed to push me away (which angered and frustrated me);   \-- avoiding in-depth conversation which creates mental and emotional connection;  \-- solitary hobbies, or if social at all, very limited, superficial interaction. He was "hail fellow well met" with guy buddies, who just didn't demand very much;  \-- not a lot of eye contact, smiles, or positive body language; very closed off;   \-- very, very negative feelings toward other people, saying people can't be trusted;   \-- creating a life where they don't have to interact much with people or at any depth.  Hope this helps. I just know that P would have been an acceptable partner for far longer had I had the money and knowledge of living apart together but I was in my young 20s when we met. I wanted marriage and cohabitation, intimacy, sex, all the basic things one associates with romance and relationships. He \*thought\* he wanted that, but no.	1640872494.0	hqjnuea	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjnuea/

6bu8qams	Another thing I remembered - total inability to offer support.  Example 1: I was upset and crying as my beat friends father received a terminal diagnosis and I didn't know how to help her. He sat next to me cold as a stone patting me on the back with all the empathy of a statue, then left. And this is a supposedly sensitive introspective guy! By contrast, a female friend even just via WhatsApp empathised, gave sensitive advice, and later inquired on how it was going.  Example 2: I was wrecked by period cramps. He chilled on the hammock completely ignoring me. Not a sympathetic word, a hug, god forbid an act of service. By contrast, a female friend sympathised, offered to make me tea, inquired how I was doing, etc.	1640872640.0	hqjo4n6	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjo4n6/

cej81zn3	my younger brother was raised by all women and my mom who was single her whole life after leaving my father. he is definitely more emotionally intelligent and sensitive than the average scrote, and he has healthy boundaries with our mom and myself. he provides even at 18 with a job and is always trying to better himself and ensure he can help my mom when needed. I think OP’s list is a good checklist of things to watch out for if a guy has only a mom on his life but it’s not a red flag in itself that he was raised by a single mom.	1640872722.0	hqjoad5	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqia9cj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjoad5/

Especially when the scrote looks physically attractive and you're cornered.  But now I just think it's so pathetic and hilarious of them to try THAT hard to become manipulative and get laid. 🤣  As a FDS sister once said, my vagina makes a "Windows shutdown noise" and I don't even find these LVMs physically and mentally attractive anymore.

bvnm37an	This gave me chills.. such an excellent post. I've been reluctant to share my story about two of my ex-friends who were ultra pickmes. They have been the reason I'm terrified of making friends or getting super close to other women in real life.   These two people literally went to extreme measures to ruin my reputation and tore me down to everyone they could because I ended the "friendship". One of them even began dressing like me, talking like me, got the same haircut and dye.. and even went out and got similar tattoos as me.. and went for guys who she thought I would be 'into'...   It's a really long story, but it's creepy and I still sometimes worry that they have their flying monkeys watching me, so I've now developed agoraphobia from it.. so that's fun. 😑	1640872832.0	hqjoi9c	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqjoi9c/

7djs5tcj	Cosigning /u/sermuonielis's comment. Adding a few more:  * Love bombing. Coming on super hot, way more than is appropriate. You don't even know each other!  * Commitment shy. They can't even take the lead on initiating dates, and when they do, it's half-assed.  * Mixed messages of any kind. Don't try to rationalize it, that's your cue to dip.  [This list is accurate, ime.](https://psychcentral.com/blog/love-matters/2018/07/16-signs-of-an-avoidant-or-unavailable-partner#4)  I got in a situationship 2 years ago with a guy who was fearful-avoidant. He came on strong and sweet, but the mixed messages were always there, and he told me red flag stories upfront about his history: He had no friends, he had a history of burning bridges, he had a savior complex and was attracted to "crazy" women, he was indecisive and didn't know what he wanted out of life in general. This is verbatim what he told me. From the beginning, he also had bizarre preferences that he forced on other people and got shitty about if other people didn't cater to him. Like, he hated soup and found the thumbs up emoji offensive.   I ignored all of this to my peril, thinking his good traits made up for it.  Nope, the mask eventually dropped. He became sullen, passive-aggressive, and had explosive anger over the dumbest shit. Absolutely could not control his emotions or his feelings like a rational adult. Couldn't have a 30-second conversation about minor issues, just ghosted me. The 2nd time he ghosted me, I gave up and stopped trying.  When I took a step back, I realized the problems had always been there. He'd always been unreasonable and self-centered. He didn't know how to get along with others and pissed off absolutely everyone around him.  You can memorize the list of red flags til the cows come home. Honestly, your best way of recognizing one of these people is paying attention to YOU and YOUR feelings. When you start feeling confused, anxious, ignored, or held at arm's length, you need to look at the cause. I felt all of these things when I first met him and ignored my gut. Don't be me.	1640873016.0	hqjoveg	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjkdo0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjoveg/

6bu8qams	I think my problem was that I couldn't really see the distance for what it was because I'm also very independent and enjoy my private time. He just seemed like a very reserved, solitary guy, happily independent. It took a few months to realise that this behaviour was masking a deep inability to bond. The normal distance at the beginning of the relationship masked it well. It became evident once I started growing closer, we started spending more time together and the relationship was supposed to move forward, which is when it ended instead. Fortunately I wasn't particularly invested yet though of course I cared for him.	1640873334.0	hqjping	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjoveg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjping/

6bu8qams	I noticed a depressive tendency, as well as an eagerness to distract himself with novelties. His mood fluctuated wildly between "child excited by new toy" and "despondent and negative when bored". This second phase only relatively affected me as I left him to stew in his own juices while I went off doing my thing. Only when we spent a week away together it started to impact me and make me feel down and depressed too.

en8tould	There is no benefit to women when it comes to tiptoeing around men's feelings in a relationship when we are speaking about our needs. A HVM will take criticism thoughtfully, and change what you feel is an issue, because he values you and your feelings and wants you to be happy. A LVM will not.   Tell him ONCE, and tell him directly. For example: "What you did is unacceptable to me", and opposed to "I think what you did was unacceptable." Leave no room for arguments or gaslighting. Put his behaviour on him and his choices, not your perceptions of it. If he acts like a tantruming child or ignores you, then that is when you know you have a LVM on your hands, and it's time to exit his life.	1640874705.0	hqjsdbo	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqjsdbo/
6bu8qams	I see your point. My ex was an acceptable partner as long as we lived in the place where we were, in a sort of bubble away from real life. But we were moving (we're both travellers) and continuing the relationship would have required to organise the next trip together.  This is a man who can't even plan tomorrow's dinner as it's too much "commitment". So he just cut everything off as it was too daunting and he "didn't have enough feelings to make the effort to organise to meet again". I never bothered speaking to him again.  But that's another huge red flag - inability to commit to even small plans, both in his life and for the couple.	1640874821.0	hqjsm4v	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjnuea	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjsm4v/

It's not helpful, especially insulting me calling me a pickme and implying I don't have hobbies, friends or a job, this is very poor behaviour coming from a so-called 'coach.'  My strategy of having a phone call before a date is so that I can avoid going on a first date. It's worked well for me, I've avoided lots of dates with men after I had a phone call with them first and realised that I didn't want to date them. I'd much rather a longer phone call, rather than a short phone call and an in person date.  Someone recommended this sub to me. I used to be in this, but had left. Now I remember why.

8bscg3mc	I did say that if it worked for OP then that was perfectly fine, I have no qualms about their own personal preference on how they choose a mate. I did also state that it would make sense when learning of that familial situation to vet harder, so perhaps to consider it an orange flag and continue to look for the reasonings that are the actual red flags stated in the post.  Again, here is my issue with this: Having a single mother does not necessarily dictate the way in which you are raised and the values that are instilled in you, as is mentioned many times throughout the comments here. It's rather short sighted to think so. Yes! It should definitely be considered as a possibility, but not a guarantee or an assumption that having a single mother has screwed you up for life. And if anything is being considered at all, it should actually BE the way in which the man was raised and the morals and values he holds, not his mother's marital status.  Would you rather your son be judged for his own merits, or be judged solely based on your choice of who fathered him, and whether or not you saw fit to stay in a relationship with that man?	1640875590.0	hqju9kh	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqjm821	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqju9kh/

10fuzrmb	I think the issues that men raised by single mothers have are largely due to the father who left. I used to work under the supervision of a woman who was an attachment therapist, and she said when you hate a parent, you hate part of yourself. Her goal was to get people to feel neutral towards parents they hated. It really messes with your self concept and self esteem if a parent leaves, **especially** if it’s the same-sex parent. It’s a rejection on the deepest level. Women who become mothers don’t tend to leave, but men who become fathers do so men are almost always the ones dealing with these issues.	1640875743.0	hqjulky	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqjulky/

dzvrbovn	They want to take all the credit for female pleasure and none of the blame for the lack of satisfaction that males provide to females. I wish I had done this. I was convinced I could never orgasm because men and society constantly made me feel as though I was the problem. I didn’t even understand what an orgasm was or felt like. Men would act like I had one even though I didn’t because their ego hurt, they’d try to say I’m lying when I straight up said no - I don’t think I had an orgasm. Then I got a vibrator and had my first real climax ever. I was so upset about how many women fake it and how many men gaslight women into pretending like they had a mutual climax. It’s such bs. A HVM will try to either make you cum first or keep pleasuring you after he cums until you reach the same amount of relief.  Lmfao this guy should probably learn how to give her head too, women orgasm well if you learn how to eat it right. A lot of women feel so terrible after sex because we don’t orgasm and they do, but a lot of women don’t even recognize it because they haven’t ever came. The happy women I know who experience orgasms have this standard with men that the man has to be able to make her cum and so do I. No more pity sex. I’m not worried about intimidating any one because I’m no longer interested in lazy male partners. The guy I’m with now loves to pleasure me 🙏	1640876171.0	hqjvjmk	t3_rs3cw1	t3_rs3cw1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs3cw1/this_should_be_how_women_approach_sex_if_he_cant/hqjvjmk/
ckuhxjgw	Complaining about having no close friends: it's because they push people away, and they'll begin doing the same to you too once you get too close.

40on2lwh	Thank you for this post! I will repeat myself- we should not look at each other as competition, that does not benefit us. Tearing a woman down does not add value to you. Have each other’s back. I had a friend who would tell my most personal problems to her boyfriend (whom I didn’t like at all). I cut her off and never looked back. What’s the circle of this? She tells him, he tells his bros, his bros spread it to their bros, and everyone ends up knowing.

jyy92	When they’re sick, or emotional, they disappear or they “need time to be alone” and you’re left distraught for days or maybe even weeks. They can’t handle the emotional effects of a relationship.   They won’t have many if any past relationships. They won’t have many friends. They will chase you more when they feel they are losing you, and when you chase them, they’ll run as well. It might take a while but usually the dopamine jump will wear off and you’ll see the behaviors more readily.   They aren’t consistent in showing you love/attention. They will have serious doubts early on and make up things just to have alone time, but will come back hard if you ignore them too. It’s an unhealthy cycle of neglect.	1640876421.0	hqjw379	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqjw379/

b6zdp8f8	You need to drop him. He is like a drug you're addicted to and like any addiction, all he does is ruin you. He brings nothing positive yo your life, only rot.  >He had been with his girlfriend for 9 years at that point, and they own a house and pets together.  He was happy to string her along for nearly a decade, keeping her as a forever gf, wringing all manners of benefits of her while keeping a foot out in case someone "better" came along.  >Cue two months of an emotional affair  He is a cheater. If you were with him, he would cheat on you too.  >pretty serious talks about what being together entailed and what breaking up with his gf entailed - selling the house and deciding who takes the pets, they have mutual friends  Excuses to keep you on the hook so he has the thrill of an affair while he keeps a backup (girlfriend) at home.  >Because of how the first time of breaking up went around, he wanted to wait until his assessments were done. He got his results right before christmas, and celebrated christmas with his gf and their families. He texted me how much he wanted to be with me.   He has no problem lying to everyone, playing happy couple in front of her family while cheating on his girlfriend. Again, this would be your life if you were with him. He would cheat on you with no second thought, and only do things that benefit him, not you. He doesn't want to be with you, it's just a fun fantasy for him, because he likes female attention. It could be anyone, it makes no difference to him.  >He called me on monday after christmas and said he was breaking up with his gf. I told him rather than tell me, just do it, i want the decision to be made independent of me. He also just wanted to hear my voice.  He was checking he still had you in his snare, he doesn't care about hearing your voice itself, he just wanted to hear the emotions in your voice.  >I had a near psychotic breakdown. I have dealt with mental health issues in the past (C-PTSD) and haven't experienced a fallback like this in many years. I felt like I was going insane. I was.   He is poison. He is not even with you and yet he is ruining your health. Compare how you feel with him in your life and how you felt before knowing him. You know deep down it was better without him.  >He loves his girlfriend, they've always had a great relationship.  No, he doesn't, and no, they don't. When you love someone you don't cheat on them and great relationships do not involve cheating and stringing someone along for a decade while you look for someone else.  >He is 100% an equal partner, though I suspect actually he was carrying more of the emotional labour in the relationhip.  I highly doubt it. In fact, I know it's not the case, since he was emotionally investing into you, so he's definitely not an equal partner and probably does very little emotional labour in his relationship.  I think you been giving him the benefit of the doubt way too much, and it sounds like you projected qualities onto him and built an imaginary version of him in your head which you fell in love with. You are a complete person, as you say. You have built a good life for yourself. Don't let someone in who doesn't add value to it, and especially not someone who cheats with you, will cheat on you and makes you feel miserable. He's been putting up a facade because he needed entertainment in his life, it was all a con. But the good thing is that you now know. So you can block him and delete him from your life. It will be hard at first, but when you realise how much better your life his without him in it, you'll realise it was worth making the effort. You can do this.	1640878328.0	hqk0gga	t3_rrwdke	t3_rrwdke	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrwdke/in_need_of_queenly_support/hqk0gga/

6bu8qams	It can definitely change! I was secure, turned extremely anxious after being cheated on, but after discovering attachment theory I started working hard at it and several years later, I am nearly back to secure (with anxious tendemcies still).  One year ago, being involved with an avoidant would have wrecked me with anxiety, self blame, absolutely triggering me. The breakup would have destroyed my self esteem. This time, I was so centered I barely even noticed and got over it in no time, fully clear on the fact that it's his problem and he's an unsuitable partner.

ayt8m0x9	My son will be judged on how he behaves, things he says, what his job is, how tall he is, how well he looks after himself and his home, if he is bald, etc etc etc.  Depending on the woman he may be judged for much more. That's normal and expected.  If a woman thinks it is a red flag that his parents split up and he may have some potential issues as a result, that is fair and often the case.  I try extremely hard to guide my son to be high value and I hope he is.  Might he have some emotional baggage attached because his dad is a dick, maybe. A woman interested on him gets to make that decision, not me.  I might differ from OP in the sense that I think most the problems from a broken home is going to come from the dad.  (I seriously do not know any men from split families that are high value and it is the fathers influence mostly that has created these monsters, many of their mothers seem to have been lovely, but some have been as low value as the fathers)  You could be right that it might be more of an orange flag, but I believe it is something to consider for sure.	1640878765.0	hqk1i1e	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqju9kh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqk1i1e/

dqicycba	I have sadly seen the lengths some women will go to sabotage at work. I myself have dealt with it at every job I have had with a woman that was a pick me type. It gets really bad when they have influence over most of the other women or the other women at the job fear the woman and her capabilities in manipulation and sabotage.  I had to leave my last job over such a woman. My new job is mostly males, but there is one "pick me" woman there who was furious that I was hired . She loved being the only woman there and she has tried little things already to try and get me in trouble. We are in our 30's.  Last week a beautiful young 23 year old woman was hired and she is now beyond furious. She is angry that me and the beautiful young woman get along very well. She has begun to make little snide remarks out of nowhere about the young woman. Then she tried yesterday to invite the young woman out to party with her. I plan on warning the young woman today at work . This pick me woman does not mean well. She often talks about her woman friends in ways no one should talk about a friend. She seems to like making sure they all get wasted and then reporting embarrassing stories about them to the males at our job🙄 .	1640878911.0	hqk1umr	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqjlesj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqk1umr/

It’s like the car dealership quoting me $2500 to replace my breaks, while the indie mechanic (referred by friends; I could not be happier!) completed it for $600.

Then when I met my bf, I worried he’d get bored so tried hard to keep him interested. He doesn’t get bored of me, which took a few months to get adjusted to.

h57msag5	I have to feel good about the relationship in the here-and-now, AND be confident in its long-term potential to feel secure and stay invested.  Why would I waste my time dating someone who won't be compatible with me in the long-run? If a partner DEFINITELY wants to live abroad later, and I absolutely DON'T, but it's fun dating them right now... Why bother if it sets us both up for heartbreak in the future?

h57msag5	Interesting. If you don't mind sharing, do you have a  certain timeline in your vetting strategy?  FDS does promote not being a *forever girlfriend*, which to me implies an aspect of long-term view in vetting: dating with the end goal to find a HVM or HVW life partner, and nexting those who refuse to commit.  I know people who 'date' the same commitmophobe for months, without any perspective of getting a relationship. I know people who date expats who'll certainly move back abroad within two years.

It was a calculated method to wear me down to the point that I would rather just do everything myself than deal with the fallout of saying something to him.

h57msag5	I'm WLW, as are many of my friends, and I still see a similar pattern emerge. It seems to me the more emotionally unavailable person takes on the 'male archetype': low-effort, avoiding commitment and real intimacy. While the other either starts showing PickMe behaviour in an effort to 'earn' love and attention, or lowers their standards and convinces herself she's a Cool Girl to accommodate the low-effort partner.  The end result is always: situationship limbo with the female archetype (secretly) hoping for romance and commitment, while the male archetype keeps feeding crumbs of effort and/or future faking to receive sex.	1640881088.0	hqk76tr	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqilp2g	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqk76tr/

1r5fcjrr	Oh God. How awful. You see, as a bi without a ton of WLW serious relationship experience, I have an issue with idealizing WLW, that it will all shake out just fine if I stick to that. Granted, sexual risk drops dramatically with WLW. But as far as the emotional, it’s like this social sickness of avoidant detachment is so deeply engrained now, there is no escaping it. And for those not wired for it, they become anxious, with all sorts of bullshit like what you describe in the OP used to paint over that desire for connection and pretend it does not exist.

h57msag5	Ah I see you too have read up on Attachment Theory! Great, then I can provide you with the lingo version: the anxious-avoidant trap is real across all genders. And let me assure you, WLW relationships aren't the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. ...though we do have the most orgasms during sex, lower divorce rates, no unwanted pregnancies, etc.  I've also noticed hook-up culture caters to avoidant attached individuals. And it seems to have been romanticized in a way among most millennials. The YOLO culture, live in the moment, forever young, bla bla. So much so that the anxious- or even securely attached partners emulate these 'preferred behaviours'. Being anything but a Chill Girl who goes with the flow, will get you strange looks unless you're in a heavily religious social circle (at least in my observations).	1640883462.0	hqkda3x	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqk8djy	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqkda3x/

mr2s2	This absolutely wouldn't work on me. 😂  1. I don't know what "vibing" means when we've never met in person and absolutely hate the word. How do you even vibe with someone over a dating profile, a photo, or a few text exchange? It's over used and completely meaningless. It's like they are telling you upfront they don't know how to connect with people and only know how to have superficial relationships. 2. I don't drink. At all. So drink dates are a no-go for me. Just asking me that would turn me off instantly as it's low effort bullshit. But it's always funny to see what they say about it or what they try to come up with afterwards. 3. I don't use social media anywhere, and even if I did, I wouldn't add someone to my social network that I don't know well. We could be friends for several months before I would even think to add you. I have also declined to add people I just met and got along with. Never had a SnapChat account. So you'd never get anything other than my Google Voice number, which I can promptly delete along with anyone attached to it.	1640883698.0	hqkdw3n	t3_rrupmg	t3_rrupmg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrupmg/basically_they_admit_to_everything_fds_warns_us/hqkdw3n/
dla9qnb	I let the men worry about timelines and how to lock me down. My only goal is to show up with queen energy and enjoy myself on dates with men who meet my vetting standards. When I'm exuding hedonistic, take-it-or-leave-it energy, and the men are investing time/resources/effort into me without sex, they naturally ask for commitment within 1.5-2 months or they filter themselves out of the running. The combo of being a ruthless vetter and strategic hedonist makes dating fun and carefree because it sets up a natural dynamic of the man being the 'planner'.   > I know people who 'date' the same commitmophobe for months, without any perspective of getting a relationship. I know people who date expats who'll certainly move back abroad within two years.  This guys wouldn't get through a basic fds filter. Men are either planning with you or playing with you, and their actions will reflect that.	1640883724.0	hqkdyof	t3_rreyrl	t1_hqk56ka	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqkdyof/

6nqo3j94	I've looked through your post history. I mean this in the kindest possible way, but I strongly suggest that you take a break from dating/trying to meet men. This sub deals in tough love - we don't sugarcoat, we don't coddle and we don't enable self-destructive behaviors, but we DO strongly support women who take accountability and are actively working on overcoming negative patterns of behavior.   I felt defensive and called out when I first started reading this sub - but it was the kickstart I needed to stop making excuses for the crap men I let into my life and start making real positive changes. I'm sorry to hear that you left FDS before: it sounds as though you're not yet ready for the self-work that we recommend here.

5ffusqdz	Saying "water seeks its level" and "not everyone is supposed to get it" is a massive cop out for the fact that you forced a conclusion onto everyone using weak evidence that doesn't stand under deeper scrutiny and FDS principles.  The women who agreed with you were women who also never had seen the movies, hate and avoid Marvel in general or didn't mind the holes in your logic.  A lot of us come here to enjoy intelligent women writing well-argued and backed-up FDS strategy posts, as has been the standard that I've personally seen since I joined FDS 3 years ago when only a few of us were here.  Many had an issue with your analysis because it did not live up to these standards. You wrote it without fully understanding the characters or watching the movies and it makes it hard to take your points seriously when you used unverified assumptions and misinformed character information.	1640883966.0	hqkelf9	t3_rrc214	t1_hqjhcej	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrc214/the_change_in_spiderman_films_reveals_how_men/hqkelf9/

It’s truly as if the avoidant are the best self-advocates (as masculine energy tends to be), and unilaterally decided on the hookup dynamic for all, with little protest from the other two groups whose interests are not well-represented in such a dynamic.  Any ideas on what we can do for a culture shift? My counter strategy is to reject casual encounters, have high standards, be single indefinitely, and build up other women or the rare man (who tend to be gay) discontent with hookups, to encourage them that they need not settle. And I put content on my social media that rejects the culture (in moderation, so it is not perceived as my entire online personality).

2ngg36dl	I'm not remotely conservative,  but current culture's focus on immediate gratification and unwillingness to recognize the responsibilities we innately have toward others when engaging with them socially or intimately is wildly unhealthy and untenable.  Everything in OP is an expression of that imo.  "Can't force it" is just a way of shrugging off people's agency in relationships - when things go bad it's because someone decided to take them in that direction or decided not to course correct.  Relationships are not the weather - own your actions.   And the ethic of "I don't owe them anything..." is antisocial trash. We owe some people some things in virtually every situation where we engage with other people,  and they owe us, too. Where sex is involved,  the bulk of responsibility toward a partner,  especially a female partner in male- female relationships,  begins with sex because that's where the acute risk lies. It does not begin with formal commitment, it's not something you can avoid by refusing to label things lol.  I devote a lot of time to polemic on this but it's needed. I'm borderline convinced I need to start writing a collection of essays on sexual ethics because popular contemporary thinking about these things is such a garbage fire.	1640884422.0	hqkfsp8	t3_rreyrl	t3_rreyrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rreyrl/just_live_in_the_moment/hqkfsp8/

7osmnunj	Historically it’s always been dangerous for women to criticize men. Always. So, for forever, women have coddled men to avert danger. If a criticism HAS to be made, a woman can’t just tell a man this information and expect a neutral reaction. She has to deliver the news gently otherwise she’ll be perceived as aggressive or argumentative. Even if she phrases her critique warmly she’ll still be seen as nagging or nit picking. All this is because, like i mentioned, generations of men have been handled with kid gloves by women. So they recoil at criticism when it comes from a woman. They are not used to it and feels is inherently aggressive. Hard to even wrap my head around but that’s how they are.

5587k26c	This is why you don't try to correct guys like this. He doesn't care that you aren't into the idea. His focus now is to "debate" and wear down your boundaries so that you'll accept something you don't want to do to make him happy. Walk dates are shit tests for this reason: it's an opening for him to see how little you'll accept for the privilege of being seen in public with him.  If he were actually interested in doing something you'd enjoy, there would be no mention of a walk date.  The ultimate "low risk" situation is no date with him at all.	1640885157.0	hqkhrnf	t3_rs5nro	t3_rs5nro	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqkhrnf/

4nwjez7b	I think you can usually get rid of an avoidant with time. Don’t think that avoidants live the hermit lifestyle and have no friends as some of the comments here are saying - I met and even unfortunately dated many avoidants who had flourishing careers, had a solid group of male friends, and were close with their family.   In my opinion, the defining attribute of avoidants is love bombing you at the beginning and then pulling away once they have you/realize that you have fallen for them. Sometimes you don’t need to even fall for them, they naturally pull away after dating for a month because going on more than 5 dates is too serious for them and they feel trapped 🙄  My advice would be to keep your guard up and don’t get too attached too quickly. You’ll see their mask fall off within a month.	1640885311.0	hqki6iy	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqki6iy/

5ffusqdz	Trapped in a restaurant booth. 🤨  If the man is lukewarm about a woman, he shouldn't be asking her out on a date in the first place. Perhaps these types of men should learn to be patient, and get to know a woman a bit more before booking her time for a date?  You go on walks with friends. You go on walks to commute.

All the tiktok girls make it seem like it’s so easy to find wealthy men who will give you money platonically, but they don’t mention that 100% of them want sex and are essentially pedos/abusers (whether sexually, physically, or through power). They’re not some type of feminist altruists who only want to help young women through the goodness of their hearts.   Her an her friend have definitely seen some shit, so they have to put up that dead eyed front to pretend everything is okay.

85wa1d0h	Saying something difficult or odd to start a fight at a time when it would make sense for you be closer e.g. on your birthday or some other celebration or on a romantic weekend away. Or if you’ve been having a lovey dovey few days together. One way to do this is to triangulate you with other women. Anything to squash any ‘closeness’. Always saying ‘what are your plans this weekend’ even though you’re an established couple. There’s no ‘what are our plans this weekend’. Look at what their default is at the beginning of the relationship in terms of wanting to connect with you. That is their preference. They may change when you ask them but they show you who they are at the beginning. E.g. like you say, hot and cold or never calling you on the phone - just texting - when you’re both trying to establish a relationship. Will drag their feet in introducing you to their family. Will keep their friends and you compartmentalised. Will be single - they are constantly recycled back into dating because they cannot form proper relationships.

eo34pdbz	And this may cause a scene, which is uncomfortable    But this is still a way less dangerous situation than going on a walk with a male stranger who could easily overpower you (e.g. drag you into a car, house or the bushes... and bring friends) or outrun you. And that's not even mentioning actually having a comfortable environment to get to know each other.  Imagine they got the chance to ask their absolute dream girl (let's say someone like a superfamous actress, singer or even fictional character)out on a date. Would they offer "going for a walk" to her? No. They'd pull out all the stops to impress her and win her over.

cunf5ap7	Thank you for this post. FDS works. The people it protects us from are at the least time wasters, and at the worst predatory, dangerous, fatal. It’s a big span, imagine like a solid color fading into a different solid color on the other end. If being treated with respect and a loving, healthy relationship is one end/color, and at the other end/color are men who don’t consider your humanity whatsoever and take joy in your suffering, somewhere in the mixed colors is a man who wants a submissive and obeying life manager, baby incubator, maid, therapist, money source, sex machine, who never questions him, is grateful for nothing, and sacrifices everything about who she is to benefit him. FDS teaches us these colors, this scale, how to get for generous, competent, respectful, committed men, and REMOVE men who show detrimental quantities and what those are in tangible terms. DOES THIS SEEM WILD YET? FDS is teaching us how to have standards and why it benefits us. This same phrase is repeated over and over on this site FOR GOOD REASON, because that IS the reason we are successful and why they are mad.	1640888302.0	hqkq43f	t3_rs7ii2	t3_rs7ii2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7ii2/fds_angers_reddit_at_large_and_thats_how_you_know/hqkq43f/

dsz5cs6w	Monkey branching. He has “long term relationships” that last about 2-3 years. His history of partners bleed into one another with almost no breaks in between. Often cheats on current partner, then jumps right in with the affair partner , with no break in between . Even worse, ALL of his “relationships” start and end this way. Another sign is serial monogamy. Only taking a few days/weeks/months to be single. Emotional cheating .physical cheating. Excessive need of alone time, yet needs excessive validation from the opposite sex.  Avoidents will do awful things to you to make you feel insecure, then gaslight you about it.  They are big fans of using “dread game”They will call you “needy”.

I’m on Lexapro and foolishly tried to wean myself off of it to increase my libido for a guy (yes, I was a 🤡 of the highest order) and not only did it obviously not work but I magically figured that I could actually orgasm without him—he was just an asshat.	1640888690.0	hqkr4yk	t3_rs3cw1	t1_hqk8cp8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs3cw1/this_should_be_how_women_approach_sex_if_he_cant/hqkr4yk/

mr2s2	According to male logic, you can't criticize a man because men don't do anything wrong. And if he did do something wrong, it was because the woman in his life *made him do it*. Men are allergic to responsibility and are incapable of accepting accountability for their actions.   You can't criticize a LVM because they don't know how to self reflect, analyze, or respond appropriately. They just react. And usually poorly as a defense mechanism.	1640889027.0	hqks10g	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqks10g/

86ugvp1g	Just last year, my best friend of 30 years and I broke up. I had had enough of her bullying. FDS taught me the red flags. I never knew what negging was. I knew she had bullied me when we were younger and I cut her off for several years as a result. I thought she changed with maturity. I was very attached to other parts of her personality. She was fun. The impetus for this most recent break up was her attempting to relive her bullying me when we were in our late teens, when she and her brother thought it would be funny to hit me in the head with a phallic shaped balloon yelling SUCK IT. I would run out of the room crying.   So she says, giggling, “remember when me and my brother used to hit you (it was multiple occasions) with the ballon yelling s…?” I stopped her and said, “l never like that, it was horribly not funny at all!” She tried to back track with, “I thought you liked it.”   I started having nightmares. I told her this. I told her I needed a break from the friendship to sort it out and to be sure that I don’t unfairly look at her through the lens of the past. She didn’t respond. A week later, I got an email from her (bc she swore I blocked her from other forms of communication) to ask me if she could use a my “coupon code”. I said I wasn’t comfortable with that bc we’d have to discuss the details so she didn’t get caught using a code she wasn’t supposed to. Well, that set her off, cue the bullying.   I could write a book on all the ways she’s mistreated me, but that is not the point. The point is that I missed every single red flag waved in my direction. My gut felt it, but because she’s otherwise a “good friend” for 30 years, I convinced myself that I was overreacting.   She never missed an opportunity to hate on women. She never missed an opportunity to have a group of women at a party hate her because she behaved like she was looking for sex. Her ex husband was an abuser in prison, for life, but she sneaks him burner phones. She has sons, and she hangs out with them and their friends, buying them “goodies”, while hating their moms and girlfriends. She LOVES her alcoholic Dad who abandoned her, and hates her mom who worked 3 jobs to feed her. I was never comforted with any of this. I just shrugged it off as, well yeah, she’s a bit desperate for male attention, but she’s such a good friend because she…because she…she’s just so much fun to be around…that’s all I could come up with.   She would have been the girl in the video pushing me, breaking me, to make the guys would think she was so cool. Then apologize with some bullshit that somehow made her the victim. That girl could have died or spent the rest of her life paralyzed.   These women are the right arm of the patriarchy. If you find yourself in a situation where you’re wondering if you’re dealing with Ms.Scrote, you probably are.

I suggest you take some time out and work on yourself and why you're so angry, before calling yourself a coach and potentially causing harm to the women you claim you are helping.

I don't know what women say on their profiles because I don't look at them and don't discuss dating profile strategies with other women.

5qgi7cue	One of my first sexual assault examinations was done on a patient from a “walking date.”  She met him on OLD, got in his car wearing a cute dress and heels, and he drove her to the woods 20 miles outside of town for a “sunset hike.” She tried to object because it was getting cold and dark, and she wasn’t dressed appropriately for a hike, but he ignored her objections and kept driving. She was effectively trapped in his car.  She said she had to be as pleasant and accommodating as possible so he wouldn’t murder her in the woods, or get angry with her and abandon her in the forest. He raped her in the woods.   This is why we don’t do walking dates with a stranger.	1640891814.0	hqkzb08	t3_rs5nro	t1_hqkf2tx	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqkzb08/

And even then, how can someone being nice to you have such a grating effect rather than be pleasant?  Fortunately this time around I was so centered and busy that I barely even noticed when he retreated.

dsz5cs6w	I mentioned the most dangerous pick me I knew in the “oversharing post”. Before I met her she set up a 20 year old and an 18 year old with her abusive “best friend”. He was in his early 30’s. 20 year old tried to tell pickme supreme off because she was still hanging out with him, even though he had abused COUNTLESS women. The youngest being 17. To this day, pick me supreme sticks up for the serial abuser. She also sends him nudes when he is in relationships. She sends him nudes when she is in relationships. My friends and I nicknamed them Paul Bernardo, and Carla Holmolka. They are not in our friend group for obvious reasons, but for the time that I knew them, I was miserable.

mr2s2	>LVM would literally rather emotionally abuse you than make efforts to become better men.  Because they can't accept that they are the problem. You bringing up that they are indeed the problem, hurt their feelings/ego/whatever, and now they have to hurt you back because they don't know how to process their hurt feelings and turn into an infant who throws a spiteful tantrum to get even.  It doesn't even need to be outright criticism for you to see this in action. I told my ex (when we were still married at the time) that I didn't feel loved. That's it. I just made a factual statement of my own feelings. I didn't criticize him outright. I didn't even ask him for anything. I just stated my thoughts and feelings into one simple sentence: "I don't feel loved."  Well, that surely pissed him off internally. How could I, after 13 years together, not feel loved?! I must be crazy, right? Never for a moment did he sit and think about what I said and what it might mean to him as my husband. Nope. He just blamed outwardly and concluded that if I didn't feel loved after so many years together, that that was somehow my own fault. Ok. And then he did what all male logic would make him do. He did nothing. And made pretty damn sure he was going to continue to do nothing to change that unloved feeling I had. It's like when abusive parents say, "If you're going to cry, I'll give you something to cry about." It runs along that same mentality. *If you're going to feel nothing, I'll give you nothing to feel about.*	1640892232.0	hql0eow	t3_rs1gt7	t1_hqku233	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hql0eow/

9zlwye6c	I found FDS on posts like you have mentioned OP and I’m so thankful for that 😂  People on here can tolerate r*pe subs, borderline pedo subs and zoophilia but draw the line at a subreddit that promotes women wanting better themselves. They only see women as f*ckholes that they can abuse and use. Redditors hate female people except when we’re being sufficiently abused, humiliated and exploited by men.  And this is why men (and sadly many women) feel so threatened - because we talk about it. We motivate and help each other. We criticize the patrichary and how liberal feminism only benefits men.

However, a Secure person is confident in communicating their needs and boundaries. Whereas an Avoidant will avoid communication and tends to withdraw / shut down.  As a recovering Anxious attached, I'm running as soon as I spot Avoidant behaviour. The most important thing to recognise here is that the Avoidant feels most at ease with a partner at arm's length, because they feel suffocation easily. Whereas the Anxious fears neglect and will thus feel the urge to chase, to receive the affection they crave. This is the anxious-avoidant trap, and it is HELL ON EARTH for Anxious attached folks.

dtznrnwq	I don't understand this because I have seen many successful, long marriages where the men and women all out fight and then kiss and make-up. There is an acceptance that conflict and fighting is a part of life. But it seems like in the west, anything remotely close to conflict is seen as terrifying and men totally shut down.	1640893447.0	hql3ks5	t3_rs1gt7	t1_hqkgf6w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hql3ks5/

They're doubling down on this nonsense out of pure stubbornness because it's actually taking *more* effort for him to be a cheap scrote than to just... plan a date.   Imagine taking all that time to match with a woman then spend all your energy arguing with her why she's not worth a proper date. Way to cockblock yourself, my dude, but you do you, I guess.	1640893506.0	hql3qcu	t3_rs5nro	t3_rs5nro	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hql3qcu/

7vijlezo	Wow. I could have written this except some minor differences in who this person became as an adult. I realize now why I kept flocking to narcissist abusive men as an adult—my “BFF” of 30 years set the stage.   I haven’t yet blocked and deleted—I don’t know why. I’m trying to grey rock her, but with her hoovering just amping up, I know that I need to cut the chord—I know it’s the only way.   After I found FDS, and took a long look at the men in my life, I realized I needed to take an even harder look at the single woman who had been treating me like shit since we were kids. It’s a rough pill to swallow, but the continued ignorance could have literally killed me.

He should pay rent, probably either market rent or prorated to their incomes. None of this “I pay utilities she pays mortgage”  weaselly workaround, supposedly so it doesn’t look like he’s paying the mortgage and owning—no landlord thinks they’re getting a co-owner when they lease a property and the money they get in rent pays the mortgage. He should just give her a check/Venmo every month.   Just figure out a number and stick to it.

Then we leave and divert all of that energy back into ourselves. And you're right, no one levels up like a woman leaving a bad relationship.

cw7827nc	That’s not really what happened in Medea. She was basically Barbara the builder, she gave up everything for Jason, made him wealthy, made him famous, was with him for years. But when he took her back home and they had two sons together, then he had a chance to upgrade and marry the king’s young daughter. Medea was older than Jason and though he was glad to take advantage of her magic to get ahead in life, in his hometown, he joined everyone else in calling her an old witch and treating her terribly. It was very Betty Broderick. Jason had left her and was planning this elaborate wedding to the princess and he was taking the sons with him into his new life with a new mother. Medea was basically a prisoner being forced to watch this. So she poisons her sons because that will hurt Jason more than anything. She does it even though it’s going to hurt her, too. As she explains in the end, anything else, killing Jason, his fiancé, etc would only leave her more vulnerable. You also have to take the story with a grain of salt, because it’s written by man. I’ll say this, it’s my favorite Greek play. None of that whiny shit. Medea isn’t sitting around waiting for a man to rescue her or give her purpose. And she’s not shaking her hand at the heavens like most people who get dealt a bad hand.	1640898197.0	hqlfmwv	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hqkvpcj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqlfmwv/

Usually an absent or unreliable parent that put them through the hope-abandonment-hope cycle. They become walled off to protect themselves. Hoping hurts.  They're alone for a while, feel the normal need for connection, start up some shit with a woman, go overboard with love-bombing because they don't know how to grow a relationship naturally, and don't want to put effort in for too long anyway.  Then the relationship progresses, they panic and pull away to feel safe again. They start to blame the woman for their own feelings. She's overbearing, smothering, controlling, hampering his freedom. He feels better, then lonely, he reaches out again. Completely self-absorbed and uncaring as to the effect he's having on the woman he just put on a shelf.  They usually activate a woman's anxious attachment, so then she *does* become clingy and needy, trying to get normal levels of communication, openness and intimacy. The idea of being wanted by a woman seems like a trick so he panics again.	1640898318.0	hqlfy1y	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqjnk9n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlfy1y/

h57msag5	 I've been at both ends of the spectrum (higher and lower libido) in WLW relationships, and the best strategy for the higher libido is, in my opinion:   Either do everything within your power to become more sexually attractive, accept the situation and don't bother your partner about it, or break up if it really is a deal breaker. Resent never helped anyone, and begging/pleading never gave any woman the hots.  That said... If I had a wife who was pregnant with our child for 9 months and gave birth, you bet I'd be taking care of every single chore and pampering her like the gem she is. While ofcourse also helping out with at least half of the childcare, or paying for a babysitter if my job doesn't allow me to be present myself. Why are men such selfish entitled pigs?	1640899805.0	hqljq5t	t3_rs4y2c	t1_hqlbehd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs4y2c/first_your_wife_had_a_baby_not_you_second_youre/hqljq5t/

9znu3j26	It sucks, but it happens. An alt really is the only solution. As the other ladies have said, a lot of subs **require** a very watered down version of feminism because they are ran by men who obviously do not like getting their feelings hurt at the truth 😔 and with FDS in your history it's just an easy target to hopefully dismiss you before other women look too hard at it.   I've actually had success saying the exact same things I feel on my main, but ultimately I'm not sure it makes a difference. I think a lot of women are waking up to the collective gaslighting we get on here and are pushing back because I've seen it a lot more frequently, but with men in charge they just do their best to bury it.	1640900711.0	hqlm15w	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqlm15w/

3kh4c	i've learned that if i find myself criticizing the guy i'm dating, then that's a good indication i'm not compatible with them. i can only observe their behavior and then choose to accept them or move on. my best relationships have been with guys who i admired and respected through and through *despite* what i perceived to be as their flaws.   i've only dated 1 guy who i criticized heavily, and it only started bc he was constantly criticizing and trying to change me. nothing about me was right, at best i was 'good enough'. in turn i criticized him back to try and show him that there were things about *him* that *i* would like to change too. it was such an un-sexy dynamic and it killed all of the romance/sexual attraction that we had bc it doesn't feel safe to be vulnerable with someone who thinks they settled for you.   he was shook when i left him. SHOOK. my self confidence was too high to be with someone who didn't cherish me. i think he got the idea that this was how couples acted from his very stereotypical boomer parents who never had anything nice to say about each other. and unfortunately i think this kind of relationship modeling is endemic to people who were raised by boomer parents, which is why so many of us experience this same kind of shitty treatment from the guys we date (or worse, marry).	1640900819.0	hqlmavf	t3_rs1gt7	t3_rs1gt7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1gt7/criticism_men/hqlmavf/
7r96naxj	LVM only know how to escalate and dominate to re-establish themselves as the top of the hierarchy to soothe their bruised ego.  If you 'attack' them, they need to lash out to get back on top.  Hence, the majority of cops being rubbish and needing to be fired and replaced with people who don't flip their shit when they're not immediately obeyed.  If you're with a man who has displeased you or fucked up and you make a direct statement, eg. "I don't like that, don't do it again" or "You did this, I'd rather you do that", and they don't acknowledge what you said and agree to do better, but instead they start to JADE (justify argue defend explain), cut him off. Even worse, reacting emotionally and explosively. Get out.  Do this ONE TIME. If they escalate instead of calming down, get rid of them immediately. It will save you years of pointless coMmuNiCaTion.

167ebmzu	I personally struggle with avoidant behaviors sometimes and from my perspective, I don't invest in a relationship emotionally at all until I know the other person will reciprocate, and even then I am watchful for waning interest so I can break and run faster.   I wouldn't use small gestures of affection as a measure because it's so easy to drop a few compliments/how was your days/remember a few details etc. Test their willingness to put in actual work in the relationship- be it communication, conflict resolution etc. You just have to keep in mind "if he wanted to, he would".  In my experience and understanding as a psych related scientist, avoidants learned that their parents weren't reliable sources of comfort, and into adulthood, they probably won't rely on their partner for comfort either. They can still provide comfort, but look at where they go to get it, if that makes sense.	1640902642.0	hqlqvto	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqlqvto/

She didn't like it and tried to message me from different accounts until she gave up. Today I met a friend who told me that she keeps harassing our other friends in the exact same way.

bm4ou80p	The comments are a shitshow as expected. Some scrote whining about:  >”the way you women are currently acting is red flags for all men. look how hysterical you are”  >“that why divorce rates are so high and when the man is asked, he thought the relationship was fine. women file for divorce far more to boot?”  So women are “hysterical” and emotional, but also secretive and impossible to read to the point where we hide our marital issues from our spouse until the moment of divorce? You’d think hubby would get the hint once his wife started getting “hysterical” ?

3yz8979y	Let me share a story that perfectly illustrates my thoughts on this.   A man that I met at mutual friends’ party messaged me saying that it was nice to meet me and we began messaging back and forth. This was before I started really applying FDS to my life and before I started leveling up. I used to binge drink and I honestly have very little memory of meeting this man because I was very drunk at the party. Not sloppy falling over drunk, but very silly carefree super friendly drunk and enough so where some of my memory was impaired (I quit drinking for many reasons, the way I acted around men being one of them). I know for a fact that nothing sinister happened, as we were at a friends home surrounded by old friends, and when he messaged me when I was sober I was interested in getting to know him and didn’t have any lingering negative emotions or gut feelings from the night.   Within the first day of us messaging he offered a drink date. Like I mentioned, this was before I truly started following FDS principles so I accepted. Our schedules didn’t line up so the date ended up being set for about a week out. During this time we were still messaging with me being sober throughout every exchange. Looking back there were multiple red flags that warranted a block and delete but I wasn’t in that mentality yet.  FDS was on my mind though, and the way that I was presenting myself was different than the carefree drunk me that he initially met. For example, he sent me a sexual meme and I asked him why he would send that to me, that it was lame and not funny. Now this would be a immediate block and delete for me. He changed his tune and apologized for sending it. The next day he asked if I would prefer dinner instead of just drinks.   I think this is such a good example of how LV men think. They want to do just enough to get you to sleep with them. From my perspective, it seems as though he thought that drunk me was how I normally am and that I would be so down for a drink date to get wasted and have sex with him. When he realized that that wasn’t actually me, he offered dinner to try to impress me and make me think that he was serious about getting to know me.   I said yes, and of course he didn’t follow up with a time until the afternoon of the dinner date (yikes). I still went though, and boy was that date a field of red flags in itself. That was our first and only date.   Moral of the story is, men know exactly what they’re doing. Men know that it’ll take more than drinks for a first date to impress you WITHOUT you telling them. If he is dating, he should be more than capable of making dinner the initial date offer.   I hate to say this because it’s incredibly unfair and stupid, but the majority of LV men look at us and label us as easy or hard to sleep with. It’s all about how much effort they think it’ll take to have sex with you and has NOTHING to do with your worth as a person. This guy thought I was “worth” dinner without me having to ask to change the offer, and he still treated me poorly and was trash. LV men show LV effort.   Someone who is genuine, has their shit together and wants to get to know you as a whole and complete individual will offer dinner or an equally HV date. These are the only men who are worth your time.	1640906104.0	hqlzf7z	t3_rs5nro	t1_hqlm1tp	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs5nro/man_tries_to_challenge_my_standards_when_i_say/hqlzf7z/

Get mad. Sometimes I want them to just strike me up for a conversation instead of banning me or judging me for FDS, but then I remember they're all brainwashed by the idea that we've 'achieved equality'.	1640906306.0	hqlzx0g	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqlzx0g/

psdyfxu	I think we need to start teaching “emotional well-being” classes in high school, to help people start looking at behavior in their own lives and realizing that some of it is not acceptable - and setting boundaries. So many people go through life just trying to fit in to whatever horrible things are going on around them. This would help them step back and realize that some of it is just unacceptable. And maybe we could begin to finally break the cycle of misery that so many people keep perpetuating.	1640907645.0	hqm363j	t3_rs7vtt	t3_rs7vtt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqm363j/

bpbux1pi	This exact line of thinking is what led me to researching and meeting with estate planners recently to set up a living will and revocable trust. Since I'm divorced with no kids, my estranged parents would get 100% of my assets if I didn't do anything. I had always thought estate planning and trusts were for the super wealthy but I was wrong. I really only have my 401k and life insurance through work at this point (totalling well under $1m) and the firm I went with was lovely and nonjudgmental and understood my situation without question. I can also make any changes I'd like in the future as my financial and family situation changes.   I'd really recommend everyone look into this even if you have good family relationships because people can turn nasty when money is involved. My will and trust covers the obvious things like beneficiaries and charities and who gets specific items but also everything I hadn't thought about like naming a caretaker for my pets (with money set aside for their care) to who has access to my medical info if I'm incapacitated and (content warning) how long I'm willing to be on life support so no one else has to make that decision.  It was a weird conversation and it's hard to think about (especially when you're young and healthy) but I feel so much peace of mind having all of that legally covered.	1640908014.0	hqm422k	t3_rseqn2	t3_rseqn2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rseqn2/vet_rigorously_not_just_for_present_you_but/hqm422k/

I also made a point to wear normal pants a few times a week... or a dress. If I had lived in sweat pants and not adjusted my lifestyle, I would have gained more weight.

All of these preferences are valid and we have the right to hold any standard we want. Hell, if I said that I refused to date men who grew up eating meat and preferred men from vegan households, that would be valid, too.	1640910270.0	hqm9iph	t3_rrq9nw	t1_hqly8yy	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqm9iph/

If he can't grasp that it's unsafe and scary for women to be out walking in a secluded area with a stranger, what other simple things does he struggle to wrap his head around?

87jjfums	I remember being 14 and a freshman in high school. A junior boy was interested in me. He had been held back I think because he was 17 soon turning 18. I remember being so flattered and all the girls in my class being a mixture of jealous/excited for me because I had an older boy’s attention very early into the start of the school year.   We texted, and he would meet me outside of my classes to escort me to the next one.   I thought things were great. But then he asked me to prom which was a whole year away basically. We weren’t even officially bf/gf. So I asked him about that. I don’t remember exactly bc it’s been so long, but he basically said we were already together despite having never been on a real date or having a conversation about it prior to that one.   I gently told him going to prom sounded wonderful, but we needed to get to know each other more first before committing.   He then told me he had lost his virginity at 13 at a church function. Wtf?! I freaked out because 13 is incredibly young for that. He told me it was one of his biggest regrets and tried to get sympathy from me. Soon after he was asking for inappropriate photos. Thankfully I had the sense to break things off with him and avoid him.  But the boy I dated afterwards wasn’t too much better. Dating in HS is a joke.	1640912549.0	hqmevzn	t3_kwe52m	t1_gj4c1m3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/kwe52m/keep_it_real_out_there/hqmevzn/

Otherwise as long as he keeps current with child support and isn't a flake about when he takes his kids, doesn't haul her to court all the time for power issues, and just tries to be a good man who realizes they didn't work out and owns his own part in that, yep...

h57msag5	That is *intense*. Happy you are alive and well!  My spidey senses tingled when on the first week of uni, a guy insisted on escorting (extremely drunk and naive) young me home "just to make sure I was safe". I told him that wasn't necessary, but he insisted. I thought "how chivalrous, what a gentleman".  He escorted me to my street. I said "Thank you, I can find it from here." He insisted to take my to my building. We reached my building, I thanked him again, said he should go now. He then insisted to escort me to my room "Just to make sure I reach it safely".  What started as a feeling of unease, instantly became Red Alert survival mode. Even in my drunken stupor, I managed to RUN to my dorm, unlock the door in one swift motion, and slam it shut just in time because he had already followed me to my doorstep.	1640914417.0	hqmj2yx	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqmj2yx/

amm3tygb	A few months ago, I was meeting a friend at a restaurant with a small parking lot. The lot was full that evening, so I went to go park in the dimly lit residential area a block away. As I was driving by the restaurant, I saw a very drunk man walking along the sidewalk. It took me a minute to find parking, and as I pulled into a spot I saw that the man had turned the corner onto the block that I was now on. I got out of the car for a second, glanced at him, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Thankfully, I also forgot my phone, so I got back into the car after only a few steps. I looked out the rear view mirror, and saw the man was leaning against a fence, next to an alley, maybe two car lengths from me. Just standing there. I locked my doors and decided to sit tight for a few minutes, watching him out of my rear view.   This man did. Not. Move. I sat there for ten, fifteen minutes. Finally, I decided to start my car again and see if any spaces in the lot had opened up. The way the streets were set up, I had to drive a bit and then go back the way I came, and I saw that after I drove away he started walking again.   I’m sorry this happened to you. Our instincts are so important.	1640915512.0	hqmliip	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqmliip/

I’ve witnessed PickMes defend child predators and blame the woman for trying to “seduce” them. 🤢🤮 I’ve also witnessed PickMes throw their own female family members under the bus just to desperately flirt with any man they think might be interested in the women around them and try to take the attention off of their more attractive and successful friends or family members. They get very upset when they’re not the center of attention. It’s disgusting the way they behave.	1640915745.0	hqmm0yw	t3_rrut8f	t1_hqiolqf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqmm0yw/

dsz5cs6w	This read as icky to me too. Divorced coparents  usually get gifts for the child to give, but the breakfast making is excessive. It feels like a boundary cross. Like as a single mama, it would be weird for him to be in my home making me breakfast(even if it’s for the kid)  Also: would you really date a man that goes to his ex’s to cook for them?  From both sides, id never let my ex do that, and would dump a man if he was that excessive with his ex.	1640916331.0	hqmnc7j	t3_rsgt37	t1_hqmjvvt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsgt37/date_men_who_think_like_this/hqmnc7j/

d503g	To me, a huge red/green flag is how men talk about their exes. I once dated a guy who was going through a brutal divorce with a woman who had just horribly abused him and fucked him over, and he still never said anything unkind about her. He was over it and moving on and all, but when he’d talk about it, he’d never call her names or say anything disrespectful, and I was always impressed at how much he took the higher ground. (I personally wouldn’t have been so kind). He was a really HVM.	1640916654.0	hqmo1kt	t3_rsgt37	t3_rsgt37	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsgt37/date_men_who_think_like_this/hqmo1kt/

cw7827nc	I see people are mad, but this is the gospel truth. It’s just an uncomfortable truth. Just like the truth most m.en are hot garb.age. We all had to grow up and get over that, in spite of the fact that we all have fathers and brothers and other male relatives that we love. I’ve dated LV sons of single moms and LV sons of two parent homes and the difference is night and day. You’re right about the anger. There is a vitriol, a forcefulness that just doesn’t exist for other men. My first bf was crazy emeshed with his mother. His parents have been divorced since he was a little boy and his mom had him working to pay her mortgage as a teen! He started off sweet as pie to me. Getting me extravagant gifts, talking till dawn, scads of what seemed like emotional support. I think he wanted to be the ideal man his mom talked about. But years under her tutelage had taught him to be a master manipulator by 18. He began trying to isolate me, said horrible things about my parents and tried to convince me to cut them off, just because we had a normal parent child relationship where they paid the bills. He was straight emotionally abusive, encouraged by his mother, who hated me for taking her husband surrogate away. She was angry in the beginning when he treated me so well and she was thrilled when he tried to break my spirit. Literally once I went over at his invitation and he was in the kitchen with another girl, triangulating. I went on the porch to cry and his mother came outside and smiled at the sight of me weeping. Just stood there. I broke it off after that, realizing that whole dynamic was insane. But it wasn’t unique. I’ve seen it over and over. I used to think my mother was just being classist when she told me to date boys from intact homes, but I had to learn for myself. The rules are the rules. And yes, maybe there’s an exception to the rule, but that’s an exception. It’s rare. And people don’t like the rules because they seem skewed or classist, this-ist or that-ist. But this is your life, not a charity. You don’t owe men a chance and you don’t have to be equal opportunity. You do what’s right for you.	1640918668.0	hqmshar	t3_rrq9nw	t3_rrq9nw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrq9nw/sons_of_single_mothers_a_huge_red_flag/hqmshar/

cw7827nc	Listen, I’m a BW, you can check my post history. And yes sons of single mothers are disproportionately bla.ck. And they’re disproportionately useless as well. Check our r@pe and homicide stats-double everyone else’s or higher. BW as a whole are unprotected and preyed on by these men. There’s a reason so many BW are divesting. I don’t think that she saying that women can’t raise sons alone. The blame is on their absent fathers. But whatever the cause, no one can deny the effect. And I think part of being an HV woman is learning how to make better choices.

feq968si	Why should higher earning women “pay up” to a man when studies show breadwinner women spend more time taking care of kids AND spend more money on their kids than higher earning men.   Studies also show men who receive child support are more likely to spend it on themselves compared to women. Men don’t deserve a penny from women.   Also why simp for a deadbeat dad? He should be spending the money he would use to leave the country on paying his ex back.	1640919352.0	hqmtyk5	t3_rses1k	t1_hqmrnwm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rses1k/an_israeli_queen_is_making_her_kids_dad_support/hqmtyk5/

h57msag5	My father used to be "unable to wake up", unless pestered/begged by his wife. After they divorced, teenage me took over this task.  He'd have ten or so alarms set, shut them all off one by one, and rolled back into bed each time. This started at 6 a.m. and they always woke me up, one hour before my alarm clock, so I could never sleep in. It took me half an hour each morning to drag him out of bed. He'd never thank me. In fact, he was moody as hell when I woke him.  Eventually I, fifteen years of age, told him: "You are a grown man. I'm not waking you up anymore."  **Ladies, the mantrum was**  ***u n r e a l***.  *"Go ahead. I'll lose my job if you do."* Your problem, it's not my job. *"We'll see how you like living in poverty. You're living off of my income, you're screwed if I lose my job."* No I'm not, I'll just become an orphan, you will be homeless though. 💅  He set his alarm clocks to start at 5 a.m. on full volume as revenge. This stopped after two weeks, because I ignored it. He overslept *twice* before he was suddenly perfectly capable of waking up, probably because his boss got pissed.	1640920489.0	hqmwcp0	t3_rsih6h	t3_rsih6h	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqmwcp0/
14cl27	Oh no I am so sorry you experienced this. I had a flashback to the one time a man cut me off by pulled out in front of me and I honked, I drove an suv at the time and was on my way to work. The man proceeded to drive erratically after I honked, sped up slowed down swerving brake checks. I was like oh wow huh. We get to a 4 way stop sign and this crazed maniac puts his car in park and gets out of his car! I was like oh shit, windows up doors locked. He starts screaming and I just stared and then made the decision to go on the sidewalk around him through the intersection, no one else was there it was empty	1640920532.0	hqmwfyc	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqmwfyc/

u9mr7	Yeah yeah this is hilarious but you know what's even better?   Walking away from such relationships and not looking back.    Here's why:     My time on this planet is very limited.   I can be:   1) happily single   2) happily in a relationship with an adequate, mature, and fully capable man who knows how to take care of stuff.   If these are my options, why waste my time one educating, teaching, training, and ultimately patronizing a man who is actually a child on the inside?   I ain't got time for that. And neither do you.     Just W A L K away. Don't waste your time. You deserve better. Let him learn Adulting 101 on his own. You are not his mom. You are not his babysitter.

fv6ar7ce	Reading  this I recalled Ted Bundy's tactic pretending to need help/ask questions. Yikes.   Once I was getting fuel at night (in this place people put the fuel in for you, you don't have to get out of the car) and I noticed a car parked with a man inside. I started to drive away and noticed the car moving following me. From the gas station I got on to the highway, because I was not going to go straight home and let that person know where I lived; I managed to at the very last minute grab an exit and lose him, then drive back home. Otherwise I would have driven straight to the police.   Always be aware of your surroundings, many victimis of crimes are victims of opportunity; lock your doors the minute you get into the car; keep windows up, especially the back ones. Never park in a lonely dark far away spot ever; If you can't get out of your car, drive away or call someone.   Trust your instincts.	1640922369.0	hqn0c6a	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqn0c6a/

fv6ar7ce	No. Don't mention your savings to any dates. Your financial status and mortgage status is on a need to know basis. One thing is being honest and another being transparent (i.e. blurting out  all about you)  You don't need to mention you live in a house that you own or whether it is paid in full. Just say "I live in Throwaway District or or in a one-storey house. How about you?" and divert the topic away from home ownership unless they have facilitated that information first **and** they own their place **and** their mortgage is paid in full. I.E. if they are renting I am not going to say *oh I own my home*, instead I'd ask if they like the area and why and take the topic away from home ownership.  Take a while to work on your self esteem, see a therapist, and enjoy life with yourself. When the time comes and you are strong and confident, then you need to strongly vet a man who has it together in life.   Since this takes time, before any serious commitments you should know if he is responsible with his finances. Only then I'd disclose that mine are healthy etc.  If you think of marriage, make sure you have a prenup.	1640924402.0	hqn4hdk	t3_rsl0l8	t3_rsl0l8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqn4hdk/

5d2k45wp	Ah thank you for the advice, that all makes sense. Yeah I have a tendency to overshare / blurt things out (but I'm working on that) and am typically a bad liar but yeah I guess steering the conversation away is the best bet.  There have been several times where people have directly asked me (not dates nescesarily) 'oh do you rent?' And I usually just say yeah, but that can be tricky if I get closer to them and they realise I don't or if they find out. I don't want to seem untrustworthy but I also need to be careful.  Thank you, I do plan to use the next 6 months / year to focus solely on myself and recover from all my past relationships.   That's a good point though if a guy is in the same situation as me financially there's not as much need to hide it as he can't really take advantage compared to a jobless or broke guy. And good advice on the prenup I would definitely get one for marriage.	1640925312.0	hqn69r6	t3_rsl0l8	t1_hqn4hdk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqn69r6/
a500fd6w	Don't tell a date anything about your finances, family or sexual history. All of these are things are potentially "sensitive topics" that can put you in a vulnerable position with manipulating LVM.   It's not relevant to dating at all, and only once you're in a position where money is truly relevant to your committed relationship, like preparing a prenup or moving in together prior to marriage, should you discuss it.	1640925402.0	hqn6g6a	t3_rsl0l8	t3_rsl0l8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqn6g6a/

5cp1c9w0	I know, I agree. I feel like, after the latest maybe 25ish (but realistically younger than that), the sex with as many people as possible should get kind of old… I just don’t understand this new “thrill” that even cheaters talk of. Want some excitement in your life? Try something new! Go travelling to a new place, study for a new career, open a business, sky dive, become a sky dive teacher, learn to scuba dive, go trekking somewhere, go to a theme park, paragliding, swim with sharks, ANYTHING! But their obsession with conning as many women into sex to dominate and prove their manliness, is kind of psychopathic imo.	1640926027.0	hqn7nlj	t3_rrupmg	t1_hqn5x90	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrupmg/basically_they_admit_to_everything_fds_warns_us/hqn7nlj/

5cp1c9w0	My gosh, this is so scary. Good on your for trusting your instincts and I’m so glad you’re ok! I feel like a lot of people would fall for his tactic and it’s a common one for people to leave things on the windows so the driver gets out to check it out, then they rob them or steal their car.  It’s terrifying out there.  I was in a car park in broad daylight around the corner from my home a few weeks ago, chilling in my car after I had been to the shop, which I often do. A guy walked super close to my drivers window and looked in and then kept walking past, and while he did that, another guy went to the passenger seat and tried to get into my car! Luckily the doors were locked. One of my friends said “maybe he thought I was an Uber driver” but no way. This guy was really dishevelled and had a Suspicious look on his face, plus he didn’t have his phone out (which most people do when waiting for an Uber).	1640927943.0	hqnb8hm	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqnb8hm/

5cp1c9w0	Terrifying! Good on you for listening to your instincts.

atoamyeg	These kinds of interactions are terrifying. My first encounter was the turning point to realize that there are RANDOM men out there who are 100% willing and capable of hurting you.   Mine happened when I was going home from work. As I was turning down the street to where I was staying (it was a street that had one entrance/exit and it was circular. Can’t spell what these kind of streets are at the moment lol) and as I was turning onto my street I noticed this man walking down the road (he was facing me and we made eye contact before I turned). I immediately had a horrible gut feeling as my street was dark and very rural with very few houses with people living in them. As I was pulling up to my house I looked in my mirrors and noticed this man running and dodging lights and ducking behind buildings. He walks in front of my car on the sidewalk as I park and just stand there. Staring at me. I immediately call 911 and he stays out and pulls out his phone before pretending to play on it. He realizes that I’m on my phone and says “I’m not going to do anything, I’m just on my phone come see” (mind you it was like 7/8 PM. I was so frozen with fear that Dispatch is asking me for his description and I hesitate before telling them “I’m putting my car in reverse and leaving”. As soon as I do this, the man runs off into a field behind the houses.   I can only imagine what this evil person was planning on doing. Caution and gut feelings will always save your life. The next day I went and bought my first gun and took concealed carry classes afterwards.   Also I have found that if you are unable to escape, a good method of deterrence is to act at least 10 levels crazier than the creep. This also has saved me in another incident. If you do not show fear or hesitation it will deter them. Most scrotes are looking for an easy target. Do not let it be east for them.	1640923809.0	hqn3adn	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqn3adn/
5f3urblc	Unfortunately too another point I’d like to add (unless I missed it) but never stay in your car for extended periods especially to text or to finish up a song. Men prey on this and watch for this because you become more vulnerable as you’re distracted and sitting in one place. It’s best to be in and out as fast and alert as possible.   I would have been too scared to get the food but good instinct to not go and roll down your windows. I would have ran the man over tbh	1640923903.0	hqn3hcy	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqn3hcy/
b13e8k0q	This was the right way to handle this situation! You did excellently, sis, and I'm very sorry he made you go through that when you were just minding your own business.  It's really disgusting that we as women have to have about 1000 things to worry about whenever we go out. Hell, just staying at home we have to worry about whether men will break in and/or violate our place and/or ourselves. Otherwise, we get victim blamed: why did you go to that place at night?? Why did you need that thing at that moment?? Why did you talk to him?? Why were you wearing that?? Etc. etc. etc.  But when we do all the things to avoid all the situations, suddenly we're "paranoid" or "over-dramatic" and made into these crazy people.  Men and women really do live in different worlds, but it's all 100% due to the mass actions of men.	1640928235.0	hqnbrgy	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqnbrgy/

10fuzrmb	Love there’s absolutely no reason to let anyone know how much money you’ve saved. It’s not going to just “come out”. You need to be discreet about your savings in order to protect them. Accounts like a Roth IRA are a great option because you’re not able to access that money until later in life and you don’t need to pay taxes on it until then. Standard bank accounts hardly give you interest, so if your money is in there I’d take the cash out and get a safe deposit box at a bank. Just say you have jewelry in it or something if he asks. That way you can keep your savings private. If you’re close with your parents and have a trustworthy relationship, you can add their name to your account and say that all of the money in the account isn’t yours and that you are sharing it. I agree with the comment above saying there’s a difference between honestly and transparency. I consider myself to be a mentally healthy and happy woman and I admit that I am not fully transparent with a single person in my life because there’s simply no reason for it. If a man is truly high value, he will not consider secret savings a dealbreaker if they ever come to his awareness. He will understand why you have them. A man that doesn’t plan on f*****g you over has no reason to be upset about such a thing. It’s noble of you to want to be honest to that degree, but it’s not a move in your best interest.	1640929679.0	hqneaz2	t3_rsl0l8	t3_rsl0l8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqneaz2/

So practically speaking, dating is high risk and low reward for you. There's tangible nothing to gain, and you also are mentally healthy enough that you aren't emotionally dependent on them.

If you’re in/near a city you can join University Clubs - lots of them don’t even require you be an alumni. Wine tastings, lecture series, fundraising committees, events etc.   My next thing I might do is join a racquetball club near me - it’s a bit of a scene/has a members lounge and at least I’ll learn a new sport.	1640930262.0	hqnfas1	t3_rsiyez	t1_hqn1av4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsiyez/anyone_else_experiencing_the_desperation_going_on/hqnfas1/

5cp1c9w0	Yes! 💯!!! I spent years with various LVM and was scared to be alone and cut off all contact with any. As soon as I did, I did have to do some grieving and I was alone, so I had to build my life and friends back up. But suddenly after a few months, I had energy! I had brain space at work and I was motivated and excited to learn new things (and learned things faster and easier), I needed less sleep, wasn’t constantly in a daze or headachy, I didn’t want to drink so much, i wanted to eat better and had energy to exercise, i felt light… and carefree and dare I say, happy! And things just started to feel easier.  I realised it’s because with the relationships, I was constantly worried and stressed in the back of my mind.

o03co	Thanks for these comments - I’m currently vetting a divorced dad (divorce finalized just before the pandemic and it seems I’m the first he’s dated in 20 years)  He speaks well of his ex and casually mentioned how helpful therapy has been.   But… eyes wide open lol	1640930601.0	hqnfvj3	t3_rsgt37	t1_hqmvb2v	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsgt37/date_men_who_think_like_this/hqnfvj3/
10fuzrmb	When I was practicing therapy, I had a client who had two children and an ex husband with a very serious drug problem. His brother was also an addict and died due to same drug he was abusing. He was just in a horrible, horrible place. This woman would still go with the kids to get cards and gifts for their father for holidays and special days and mail them to him when he was at treatment (that was the only time he’d have an accessible address). She would bake his favorite things with her children and send them to him because that’s what they wanted to do. She’d still call and FaceTime him so the kids could talk to him. Even though he’d forgot” and didn’t answer, she’d still do it. I ended up tearing up in one of our sessions *(note: my belief is that if the emotions you are showing promote a corrective, positive experience for your client, it’s okay to show them)* and told her I’ve never seen such selflessness and that the way her love for her children trumped all the BS was one of the most moving things I’ve ever seen in my life (which also made her cry lol).    It takes A LOT to do this. I love my mom, and she’s the best, but she couldn’t do this. She crapped on my dad every chance she got (and I don’t blame her) but when you hate a parent, you hate a part of yourself. And there is parts of myself I hate. I hope I’m never in the position where I need to this, because it requires otherworldly strength.	1640930692.0	hqng18m	t3_rsgt37	t3_rsgt37	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsgt37/date_men_who_think_like_this/hqng18m/

And next to the effect of the illness, there were tons of other problems. Fights with her insurance, pension, you name it. After her first treatments all she could do was sleep. My father managed everything for her, especially a nasty fight with the insurance company.

10fuzrmb	If you want children, you’re vetting rigorously for them as well as your future self. Can he admit that he’s wrong and apologize to a child? Does he care about meeting their higher level needs and not just then basic ones like food and shelter? Does he make them feel like a burden, or does he express to them that he is delighted they are part of his life?	1640931509.0	hqnhdxt	t3_rseqn2	t3_rseqn2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rseqn2/vet_rigorously_not_just_for_present_you_but/hqnhdxt/

He was laughing when he said it like he couldn't believe my sister believed he didn't hear the baby crying.   They're devout Southern Baptists and actually the example above is probably one of the least abusive and asinine things he's don't in their marriage. I've tried to get my sister to kick his worthless ass to the curb but she won't ever consider it because she doesn't want Jesus to be upset with her.	1640931653.0	hqnhmfc	t3_rsih6h	t1_hqmwcp0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqnhmfc/

No mention that he never used weaponized incompetence again, so I assume this obviously solved nothing.  This is a pseudo-victory. A cute comeback that punches up at the man, but does nothing to solve the actual problem, it just provides temporary and empty satisfaction.

f4fr272a	Having sex to avoid dangerous and painful retribution from the man is called rape.   Marital rape is perhaps the most pervasive form of rape, be it physically forceful or coercive, which is why it's often legal and has been legal until the 21st century in many first world countries. It almost never is reported or even acknowledged as rape, even though it is. Victims not calling it rape of course contributes in this.	1640933222.0	hqnk366	t3_rs4y2c	t1_hqmclyh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs4y2c/first_your_wife_had_a_baby_not_you_second_youre/hqnk366/

ai3mkngd	This is so 💯 true! I had an (ex)friend in highschool who is a pick me girl who bullied me. When I became top 1 in class, she gets jealous and turned me into an outcast. I was naive at that time, I should've noticed the red flags when she told me that she doesn't believe in female friendships and she only talks about boys. Social bullying is hard like any other bullying, what's worse is that most adults don't notice this kind of things because there is no physical evidence. She manipulated all the friends that I made at that time and sabotage all my group projects. She insults everything about me behind my back, you know what's even harder? My classmates who are bystanders who doesn't do anything to stop it. Most stereotypes revolve that only people who are timid only get bullied but that's not true. I'm aware of my capabilities, I'm above average in looks, personality, and intelligence in my class. Never thought in my life that my optimism shattered and I will have suicidal thoughts. Thank God, I'm rational and never acted on it.   That's why vetting even on friends is very important, they will affect you in some aspects of your life whether you are young or old. They can have positive or negative influence in your mental, spiritual, and physical health.	1640933414.0	hqnkdsv	t3_rs7vtt	t3_rs7vtt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqnkdsv/

2swlbfjo	One of my exes was absolutely helpless when it came to general health checkups because, for 18 years, his mom or aunts would schedule them all for him. After he turned 18 and was out of the house, he managed to date a number of women back-to-back who took on that responsibility. When him and I dated, he revealed that he had never once scheduled a single doctor’s or dentist’s visit in over 30 years! 💀 My biggest regret was not leaving at that major red flag. When I told him I refused to mother him and that he needed to learn to take care for himself, he sulked but said he would.  Guess who never visited the doctor or dentist despite having cause to visit both? Him. Guess who still sulked and wanted to be babied when he had constant stomach aches or toothaches or even loss of sensation in a hand for TWO DAYS? Him.

5v2tflaa	I didn’t like the video for women - since all of the traits were related to men somehow, as if everything is about how it will make your boyfriends feel.  And it felt less like a list to help women understand their flaws and become better, than it felt like a list a man made for women to do what he likes.  Things like “don’t be a drama queen” and “don’t try to take control” feels like a man saying “don’t talk too much and always smile”   And it wanted women to not care about their appearance but at the same time always look presentable for their man. That reeks of “I like women with no make up, you know, like Kendall Jenner”	1640936772.0	hqnp602	t3_rse7y6	t1_hqmq13m	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rse7y6/8_signs_of_a_low_value_man/hqnp602/
4lajsip1	This in general is what always bothered me about this show, even outside of the sex scenes. These women's entire lives were centered around dick and men. I never thought this show was avant garde in any way. They were all mostly completely neurotic over men.  As far as the sex scenes and media in general, unless it's what most would consider a steamy hot actress performing like you said, people don't want to see it.   It's Hollywood. Sex sells but only a certain type of sex that caters to men and mimics porn. I've noticed this crap since I was small. It needs to be top tier good looking women doing what men think they should be doing, or it doesn't make the big screen.   Kind of like how men don't care what opinion a female has in any setting at all, unless he thinks she is hot and wants to sleep with her.   The patriarchy (and all the machines that fuel it) is not just centered on men, but rather centered on their dicks and their sexual pleasure and their gaze.	1640936881.0	hqnpbdz	t3_rsnr2u	t3_rsnr2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsnr2u/whats_considered_good_or_bad_when_it_comes_to_sex/hqnpbdz/

g7exg	There was that woman who put dinner onto the dirty dishes her SO incompetently did.  He was appalled.  She also wore a black dress he purposefully bleached out to his work event and she offered to fill in the bleach spots with a black sharpie.  > On another occasion, he loaded their dishwasher incorrectly, resulting in several cups and bowls coming out of the wash dirty. Rather than wash them again, the woman served food in them. He told her the dishes were "dirty" and serving food in them was "disgusting" but the woman told him it was "really no biggie" and she was getting over her "impossibly high cleanliness standards.  > She also shared another example in which she asked her boyfriend to refrigerate some leftovers from a meal served the night before. He failed to do so, with the dish left out overnight. When she suggested the food would "probably be fine to eat" he apparently got "frustrated" and told her "you can't serve meat left out overnight."  > "If he really didn't know he was doing it wrong, he would have been fine with using them," they said.	1640938039.0	hqnqvvy	t3_rsih6h	t1_hqn04nt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqnqvvy/

d0gwrccn	Not exactly bad job related but it was the period when I wasn’t in school (pre occupied by graduating) and haven’t started my job yet that I participated in my most toxic hook up phase and relations with men. This idle time was bad for me because of the notion/culture that young women SHOULD be dating and sleep around - so since I didn’t do that in college I took that time gap to do it, because I thought it was the “fun/liberating” thing to do... a mistake. Once I started working and found new hobbies I stopped this.   I see why so many men work as hard as the devil in trying to make women feel insecure and aren’t preoccupied with things that bring them joy. Because then we lower our standards and they get an easy in 😒 why would we search for joy in ourselves, our career, our hobbies and our community when we can get it from their backhanded validation /s	1640930413.0	hqnfk3m	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqnfk3m/
fzaszs22	Dating will definetly jeopardize my life in more ways than one. Getting married to a NVM (and divorced) ruined any potential career I could have had. I have my own small business and I'll be able to live off of other streams of income, but it's still a bummer. Even if I found a man who wanted to pay for everything, they often pressure you to not work and not have your own finances, or just interrupt your work life constantly with their emotional bs.  I can't stress this enough: build up your own world so fully that you notice immediately when a date wouldn't fit into it.	1640932998.0	hqnjqum	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqnjqum/

I'm right there with you with this pandemic depression. It sucks big time. I've taken an optimist nihilistic approach on this; take joy in which enriches you, as long as it doesn't harm others. Add maximum value to your life, with or without a man. 2022 is your year.

7vgrv1od	Yep absolutely! After becoming financially stable and getting an amazing penthouse I see every date through a “risk” lens. I decline a lot more date offers and only go on dates that I know will have substantial benefit in some way - like giving me a new experience or a luxurious one. Because a) I will not abandon enjoying the incredible views in my home for some lowly scrote so they would need to be spoiling me for me to even date them and b) learned to enjoy my own company immensely and also take myself out to really nice and awesome places too and enjoy that experience way more than I ever did when I did that with toxic people. So I am not going to settle for any less when it comes to dating. Plus eating my favorite food or watching my fave kdrama or drinking champagne + enjoying penthouse views at home > going out with some scrote with a high risk of emotional distress tenfold.   I definitely wasn’t as secure as this years ago. I think many women experience this shift after becoming financially stable because they no longer require an escape from their circumstances. They create an amazing environment and life around them they have no wish to escape from, so it takes a high value man to even get them to think about taking on the risks involved in dating.	1640939192.0	hqnseiy	t3_rsmsac	t3_rsmsac	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsmsac/was_wondering_if_any_fds_ladies_on_here_have_lost/hqnseiy/

4ecrr915	As a gen Xer, I feel almost obligated to give this show a try. While there are moments of SATC-like satire, it's pretty cringey. Charlotte and Carrie are sooooo uptight and conservative. I couldn't stand Carrie's behavior following the sex scene. In general, she seems very needy which I get after losing her partner unexpectedly, but it's almost pathological her need not to be alone. Her friends just seem able to drop their lives for her and then she starts screeching at Miranda cuz of HER insecurities.   I digress. Personally, I found this sex scene hot. The chemistry was excellent and Sara/Che was and is 🔥. (I ignored Miranda and inserted myself.) I swerve hetero but good lawd. The light sheen of sweat on Che's forehead after their afternoon delite made me warm. I could not care less what any man might think of that scene. I give it four out four paws up.	1640940073.0	hqntjq6	t3_rsnr2u	t3_rsnr2u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsnr2u/whats_considered_good_or_bad_when_it_comes_to_sex/hqntjq6/

86ugvp1g	I too was very attractive to narc-friends. They all were very similar- very very funny, and very very fun to hang out with. But, mean mean mean. Oddly, this didn’t extend to people I dated. I always went for the safe men. Lol, I needed some balance from the abuse. Looking back, my Mom had girlfriends who treated her like shit. She was such a sweet woman, I mean she literally would take the shirt off her back in a thunderstorm. And, those bitches took full advantage. As a child, I hated those women and could not figure out why my mom put up with it. Later, I discovered it was guilt. She was taught to value all relationships regardless of how she felt, and to forgive and forget;that her boundaries were selfish. She grew a spine out of nowhere and got rid of every last friend and did some leveling up. She also canned my Dad. She found like 2 solid friends that loved and admired her, as well as an awesome boyfriend. When she died, those mean bitches didn’t show their faces. Probably a good thing because I would have kicked them out…lol. So, I followed in my moms steps,leveled up, divorced my husband (he was LVM, but I wasn’t in love) and found a LVM that I’m crazy about. Today, I do not ignore red flags. If I get a feeling in my gut, I don’t question it bc my old body knows to run.	1640946522.0	hqo1i8x	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hql7k86	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqo1i8x/

8r15jxb0	Oh I didn't know a lot of Dutch women are into foreign men. Anyway, I think the idea of meeting men who live abroad via OLD is a bad idea regardless of where you're from. It's really hard to vet a guy who doesn't live in the same country (or even continent) as you. And honestly the men who look for love abroad are probably extremely LV. Most people have zero interest in long distance relationships if they can find an SO locally. Those who look for an SO abroad via OLD do this for a reason. They either struggle to find women locally due to having extremely undesirable traits such as looking very unattractive or having a criminal record, want to sexually assault foreign women by luring them to visit them when they travel to their countries, want to marry for foreign citizenship, or plan to find women to scam.	1640947379.0	hqo2jpd	t3_rqmwig	t1_hqefm26	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rqmwig/frauds_on_datingsitesapps/hqo2jpd/

eo34pdbz	Simple shit test if their "you are my one true love blabla" is actually serious (which it never is):  Tell them that nothing whatsoever will happen (not even messaging, a date or a meeting) until they can present you with actual proof that their divorce is finalized and ties have been cut with their ex (so no "divorced but still living together" or anything) and to come back when they can show you that. Even if it takes a year or two. And if you are still available then, you will agree to a date.  If they truly love you as much as they pretend they do and are actually serious (which is absolutely never the case), they will move mountains to be able to be with you. They will initiate the divorce immediately and wait however long it takes. If he wanted to, he would. The problem is that they don't. They just want to cheat on their wives while keeping them around as cheap housekeepers and nannies.	1640949093.0	hqo4pbb	t3_rsr680	t3_rsr680	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo4pbb/

8r15jxb0	Yes. And going to a place you're not familiar with to visit some guy you've only talked to online is dangerous. He's familiar with the local surroundings when you're not. It's harder for you to flee if the chooses to sexually assault you. Things are even more complicated if the guy doesn't live in the same country as you. You're probably not familiar with the local law and unable to communicate fluently in the local language so even filing a police/legal complaint against him is tough if he sexually assaults you.	1640949466.0	hqo568w	t3_rqmwig	t1_hqo3elj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rqmwig/frauds_on_datingsitesapps/hqo568w/

8uuz5573	To add to the pictures without our knowledge thing: no matter how much you trust a guy, if you ever plan on being naked in his place, CHECK FOR CAMERAS. Check the bathroom, the toilet, the bedroom, and anywhere else that he seems to *really* be trying to get hot and heavy in.  Turn all the lights off, look for obvious camera lights. There are also apps you can install on yout phone that help you scan the wifi network for devices like IP cameras, if you have their wifi password. You can also use the camera on your phone aimed around the room to detect (infrared, or like night vision?) cameras. You'll see a weird looking light that you can only see on your phone screen, you can do this with the lights on or off.    Some of these men are absolute degenerates and literally get off on secret recordings. You never know what man has purposely chosen not to mention this to you.	1640949889.0	hqo5phq	t3_rsr4b2	t1_hqo2dls	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr4b2/is_your_boyfriend_part_of_the_secret_nude_trading/hqo5phq/
8r15jxb0	I have a question to ask. Can a guy who falls in love when they're still married (while their marriage is falling apart) ever be HV despite how they only start to pursue the other woman after the divorcement is finalised? At the end of the day, they're still leaving their SOs for someone they like more. If they truly hated their wives that much, why did they only decide to get divorced *after* a woman they liked more appeared in their lives?	1640949973.0	hqo5t9t	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo4pbb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo5t9t/

boazij7d	in my opinion, no. A HV person will be responsible and only start a new relationship after one has ended officially, and not leave any room for ambiguity (marital status). falling in love while still married blaming it on a "failing marriage" is just an excuse. his mental energy could be spent on fixing the marriage or finalizing the divorce instead of finding a new person	1640950452.0	hqo6f3y	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo6f3y/
9p6f6ftv	A kink: getting turned on by feet, or a glamorous woman littering, or food fights, or ballerinas being lifted, or clown make up.  If it involves degradation, pain, violence, humiliation, or any harm, it becomes impossible to practice those acts with love and respect, even if there is “consent”. Violent acts are not kinks, you just got trained to sexualize abuse.	1640950607.0	hqo6m3n	t3_rss00i	t3_rss00i	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rss00i/reminder_bdsm_is_more_than_a_kink_its_indicative/hqo6m3n/

eo34pdbz	I think it depends and life is complicated.   I could imagine very rare cases (actual abuse, their partner having developed heavy substance abuse, addiction or mental health issues during the marriage etc.) where I would accept it, depending on the timing and behaviour. I would absolutely leave a partner like that, even if we were married with kids and I won't judge someone for doing the same. If you are stuck in a situation like that and already feeling guilty for thinking about leaving your partner, no matter how terrible the situation is, and then meet someone new you just instantly feel a connection with and that gives you the final push to get out of there and save yourself because you see that there might be a happier future possible for you after all...  I would never condone cheating (even emotionally) or getting together with someone else while still married.	1640950991.0	hqo73yo	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo73yo/
8wa6gkov	Yeah it’s more like monkey branching, I knew of a guy who was separated from his wife for 15(!) years - don’t know how many girls he got with that ‘separation’ clause, he got his divorce finalized after meeting me- but I kind of lost my respect for him with the idea of only finalizing divorce when you get another person to hop on right away. A good example I saw ( but in a series, Good Girls Revolt), that the HVM hubby gets attracted to another girl, also the lifestyle he was leading was frustrating his wife, he does not say anything to that girl he is attracted to, but he goes to his wife and mentions he would like to get a divorce , it clearly shows he identified their marriage was not working for them anymore, he would like to close this chapter and only then bring forward a new commitment. It clearly showed how respectful he was to himself, his choices and also to the people who are and will be in his life.	1640951138.0	hqo7aqq	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqo7aqq/

a19i2ivx	1. If she is the only one taking care of y'alls baby, cleaning, cooking, being the family secretary, etc... she is TOO TIRED TO FUCK. And that's if no complications in healing arose.  2. Let me fix his wording "my wife forced a melon through a hole that is typically the size of my urethra, but it's been 6 months and she STILL won't put my dick first!"  3. If you aren't willing to wait until she is healed and mentally ready (most births are EXTREMELY traumatic and can create a temporary or permanent fear of sex and getting knocked up again), don't get her pregnant. Selfish cow.  4. Your dick is NOT the most important thing in your life and relationship. The brand new tiny cute precious babu is the priority now, and will be at least until they grow up and move out.  5. Even if everything went perfectly, sex can be painful after childbirth because it can effect the vaginal feel. Even more so if the doctor pulled the "husband stitch" bullshit. It can take years or even life for stuff to get sorted out properly down there.  I had 2 c sections. The first time my husband was bitter because I couldn't have sex for 6 weeks. The second time he wasn't so harsh. But these goofy ass men need to realize RELATIONSHIP DYNAMIC Z CHANGE KNCEA BABY IS INVOLVED. The child is more important than the 4 in biohazard in your pants.	1640951588.0	hqo7w73	t3_rs4y2c	t3_rs4y2c	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs4y2c/first_your_wife_had_a_baby_not_you_second_youre/hqo7w73/

8zttver0	There's only one true part in that answer (aka "best comment"):  >people watch porn, and the porn they watch can **sometimes** be more extreme than the things they do in real life.  (Edited for spelling; emphasis mine)  Also, BDSM =/= gore and/or snuff  Saying "gore and/or snuff is healthy and completely acceptable because it's just BDSM" is like saying pedophilia is just as healthy and acceptable because, this, too, can be considered BDSM.

8zttver0	Considering that I once found myself in this very situation, only I wasn't married and I was the one suddenly falling for someone else while still in that relationship: It really depends.  In my case, I was just realizing that my then BF was showing some red flags and abusive tendencies after the one year mark. It was less than a month after that realization - and me thinking about how to get out of this as well as possible - when I met someone else and had that terrible love-at-first-sight syndrome. (Didn't end well, either.) Which gave me ample motivation to end my relationship pretty much the very next time we met before pursuing the next one.	1640953268.0	hqoa6ep	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo5t9t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqoa6ep/

8zttver0	Well, it would probably come out really soon where you live. But you can always not tell your date that the house is actually yours. If need be, say "I pay xxx for it every month" - xxx should include your mortgage, monthly average of your taxes (and whatever else there is) and utilities. That should be close enough to normal rent that it's not even suspicious. If you pay less than it would be for rent, just say you're lucky you got a great deal or some such. If you pay more, just say that it came furnished, which costs extra. Or... don't say it directly, hint at it instead.  Anything else regarding your financial situation: "I'm doing okay." That can mean literally anything from "I live paycheck to paycheck with no savings" to "I'm actually a millionaire, but don't want to boast." After that non-statement, change the topic.	1640954355.0	hqobq7p	t3_rsl0l8	t1_hqn351n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqobq7p/

86ugvp1g	No worries, it’s a good question. There are Quaker (private) schools all over the US, mostly east coast, and England, where Quakerism was founded. It is technically a religion, but there’s no authoritative literature (like a bible), hierarchy, or dogma. And, they operate on consensus, not majority. Not all Quakers will have the same philosophical thoughts or ideas, but they do all believe that our relationship with G-d is between you and G-d and not something that can be preached into you. They also believe that there’s is that of light and G-d inside all of us, and that we should seek it out, particularly with our enemies. Most Quakers are pacifists. Quaker Meeting for Worship (their services) are done in silence to encourage your individual relationship with G-d. If someone feels compelled to share their testimony, they stand up and share. Quakers do not proselytize, and that’s why you likely haven’t heard of them, but most social justice movements in the US were started by Quakers.	1640954533.0	hqobzow	t3_rs7vtt	t1_hqo5tok	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs7vtt/this_is_why_vetting_everyone_you_spend_time_with/hqobzow/

I was at his house a few times, and he had security camera in his living room. I spotted it the first time and asked him to turn it away from the couch we were sitting. He had no problem with that. We had sex in his living room a few times, tv was on, camera was turned away. Last time I was over, I forgot about it until afterwards, and I saw camera wasn’t turned away. I still get paranoid thinking about it. I try to convince myself that he wouldn’t keep/share it because it ended up he was actually engaged with someone else at the time and he wouldn’t want his fiancé to catch him cheating.	1640954963.0	hqocn2v	t3_rsr4b2	t1_hqo5phq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr4b2/is_your_boyfriend_part_of_the_secret_nude_trading/hqocn2v/

There is no way to completely erase a picture that has been posted online!  There is no excuse for a guy sharing your nudes with anybody without your consent. You should immediately contact the police and make screenshots of it, to save these proofs.   Even if you send nudes without your face he might send another harmless pic with your face so still everybody might know who the nude shows.

7osmnunj	This might be controversial but i actually think most women eventually reach this headspace. The only difference between you and them is that you figured it out early while it takes most of us an entire lifetime. Because of social conditioning it seems like most women don't snap out of it until they're like 50+. I'm in my late 20s and I'm struggling with letting go (of limerence). But I've come to learn that happiness is a fleeting emotion, (and if men are involved you have to sacrifice a lot just to get small scraps of it) so it's not really worth it once you discover a much more appealing sensation: peace.

5cp1c9w0	Holy crap. I am so glad you got out of there. Sometimes they don’t threaten. But when they do, it can be paralysing. I stayed in a relationship for 5 years because I was terrified of the guy and his were more veiled threats and psychological manipulation. I would have been paralysed if he said what yours said to you. I’m so sorry! And I’m so proud you still left.

9f513x5h	It is not love if you don't get to know the other person on a deep level. It is just lust and maybe familiarity. But why would a person who is married allow themselves to become familiar with someone who isn't their spouse? If the other person is a friend, you basically have shifted your mindset to see them as a friend, like the way a sibling is a "friend". If they see you as a potential date, they are already looking outside their marriage to fulfill something that they think their marriage is lacking, and because they don't know you that well, they are just chasing figments. In the end, if they get together with you after having made you the cause of their marriage breaking down (by saying that they fell in love with you) it is likely that they will become equally as dissatisfied with you and look elsewhere. Usually the issue is not the person they are with, the issue is they are deeply dissatisfied with themselves and are looking for external validation.  There are very rare cases, I am sure, where a marriage breaks down without animosity and the man leaves the wife for a woman that he spends the rest of his life with and the second marriage is happy. But this depends on circumstances. Some people marry very young and have children but are unable to grow together, instead they grow apart and stay together for the children... and then while they are doing this (with the best intentions) they meet someone else. It's possible.  Being married is a state of being. When you uncouple, it takes a year or two for your mindset to change. You take time to rediscover yourself outside of the marriage. So anyone that is still in a marriage or fresh out of a marriage comes with the baggage of the ex or soon-to-be ex. If you get into a relationship with someone like this, you are also getting into a relationship with the ex.  That's my opinion anyway.

5cp1c9w0	You’re 100% right. I’ve mentioned a few times about my exes best friend constantly abusing his gf saying nobody else would want her as a single mother in her 30s. He’s terribly abusive to her psychologically and emotionally - talks to her like she is absolute dirt, as well as her child. And will then post on social media about how much he loves her. Sh runs to my ex (her partners best mate) for solace, but she doesn’t realise he’s just as bad - he just plays the part to get extra information that he feeds back to his mate. Even my ex talked about how he wanted to smash her in the face because of her music choices. And that she brings the abuse from his mate on herself because she’s “crazy” when she’s drunk.  I feel so bad. She has been mentally, emotionally and even now physically beaten down so much, with some occasions pops of what seems like love from him (intermittent reinforcement)… but he’s constantly hitting on other women, then gaslights her that he has to delete everything because she snoops and if she didn’t snoop then he wouldn’t need to delete everything…  I wish I could’ve told her she’s smart, and he IS a liar and a cheat, and there’s a reason she snoops -  because her gut knows. But she wouldn’t listen. She’s too downtrodden and invested and just hangs off everyone word that the group of guys say to her.  It’s really disgusting and honestly I do worry that she will end up dead also.	1640958066.0	hqohtfg	t3_rr5d5d	t1_hqf2jjt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rr5d5d/turkish_woman_marries_boyfriend_who_threw_acid_in/hqohtfg/

9f513x5h	Yeah the terrible love-at-first-sight syndrome. It's like a Trojan horse. When people go on first or second dates and insist to know if there's chemistry, I don't understand. You need to know a person more than 1 or 2 dates to get that. If it's love-at-first-sight, it could be your body reacting to danger signals and you mistaking the nervous discomfort for "falling in love".  I think love should be like a gentle afternoon rain, not a lightening storm.	1640958166.0	hqoi00i	t3_rsr680	t1_hqoa6ep	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqoi00i/

4g75gbb4	It's interesting, a lot of times when I make comments and someone engages I can tell the think I'm a man. Why? My username. "Dr" makes people assume, both men AND women, that I'm male. Usually if I'm going back and forth with someone they eventually look at my comment history and realize I'm a woman. If I'm talking to a man I can usually tell when he checks if he doesn't outright say that he did. It's wild. Irl, I have an extremely feminine name (which as a tomboy I loathed, but as an adult tomboy I've embraced... people who know my name before I meet them (say a work function) are always kind of like "oh, okay..." or outright say "I expected you to look different" ...simply because of my name... lol) I'm glad this guy saw the light and is hopefully working on himself to change his way of thinking, as well as spread this newfound information to his friends and family!	1640958501.0	hqoilrj	t3_rssu7e	t3_rssu7e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hqoilrj/

That’s why I don’t like it when people pressure women to leave - she knows the danger she could be in, and it’s better to create a solid safety plan to get out alive. But even then, it’s not foolproof because unfortunately these daytime attacks happen also and it’s literally the kind of situation where she has to leave her entire life behind to get away. It’s sickening.

5q9e9eii	OMGOSH THANK YOU FOR THIS! I've been waiting to talk about this season finale with someone who shares the same opinion. I am so shocked by everyone is happy that Lawrence and Issa are back together. They've been toxic from the beginning. I agree with all your sentiments. I really would've loved to see how Issa could have found love within herself and kept scaling her business. You don't always NEED a man. It's okay just being a woman in the world. That is enough.   I went back and forth with someone over how Lawrence is trash and it just appalls me how no one is seeing the signs. He's done nothing to even earn Issa's love all season. All they have done is play phone tag and at the end settle for one another saying "If you believe it will work, it will work". I'm tired. I'm tired of these messages being shown to black women about trusting in struggle love. Love isn't that hard.   Hell, Nate isn't all that either but at least he is self aware, supported Issa in her business ventures, and tried to open up to the possibility of healthy relationship but could see she was still stuck over Lawrence. I'm glad he got away from Issa and her toxic web.   Kelli is the star of the show. She really does need her own spinoff.

One would be rather aggressive about it ("Stop copying me! Stop trying to be me!") and the other more on-guard ("You don't have to like everything I like, you know?").  They'd compartmentalise 'me' and 'them' as two completely separate entities. Any perceived 'fusion', however small, was cause for alarm.  Ordering the same food? ALARM. Using the same catchphrase? ALARM. Picking up a solo hobby they also enjoy doing solo? ALARM.  As if I'm plotting to absorb them, fuse with them, *become them* because I also got the Pepperoni Special. Their sense of self seems rigid and they're overly protective of it. They also seemed to look down on me in a way, as if *I* had no sense of self because I wasn't as rigidly defined by arbitrary interests as them.

It helps to make it known that you don't have financial problems, but that's easy; you just don't mention the problems and carry yourself with confidence and the knowledge that you have options and financial security.

I remember getting peer pressured into dating a guy that I was not attracted to and it was truly awful. He was overweight, jealous and was just gross in general. We would go out and all he’d do is have his arms around me the whole night as if he was mate guarding. One time he followed me to the bathroom in a club just to wait outside for me because he was so insecure.

56wh84mz	I left out the best part, he said this confidently in front of a group of my really beautiful and intelligent girlfriends expecting us to fawn at his sexual prowess like men would. But instead we all went “EWW THATS DISGUSTING “ and started making jokes about him. This man was so embarrassed, and never tried flirting with us again. Shit, he could barely look us in the eyes 😂	1640960006.0	hqolhlh	t3_rrupmg	t1_hqojyrk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrupmg/basically_they_admit_to_everything_fds_warns_us/hqolhlh/

When you do begin driving, also be very very careful about honking and other signifiers of aggressive driving. I never honk at people except very lightly in extreme cases (ex. drifting into my lane or backing out into me, etc.) because of the amount of road rage incidents in the US. You always have to let it go and just be cautious that most men can become aggressive out of the blue.

b2js99lw	I agree strongly with all of this!! OP, I think you’ve spent enough time being financially abused that your conceptual norms have been screwed with. At least in the US, which I’m guessing you are, it would be SO bizarre for someone you were just getting to know to pry into really anything about your finances. “I own my home” can mean anything from living paycheck to paycheck with the mortgage, to having it completely paid off. Being financially stable is a badass accomplishment… but also not anyone’s business but yours.  Anyone you might date has absolutely no business knowing about your savings or financial setup overall until you were perhaps discussing getting engaged, I’d say. There’s so much vetting you would do along the way, and if someone starts to try to pry into your private information, that’s a flag.  Even if I’m bragging a little with close long-term friends, I’m only going to say things like “yeah, my retirement savings are on track, that’s pretty cool” or “I’m paying some extra principal on my mortgage, happy about that”.	1640960290.0	hqom1fx	t3_rsl0l8	t1_hqn4hdk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsl0l8/advice_on_finances/hqom1fx/

1vajgfgc	A very fine example of reddit misogyny in mod teams that we discuss from time to time. I said something a little too feminist and it got me banned from some political sub can't remember which. It's annoying, this is the exact problem I have with men in general is they often simply refuse to listen. If it doesn't fit their narrative, if it challenges how they view the world then we're lying, we're being dramatic, they don't want to hear it/can't handle hearing it and thinking about it a little too hard. Might pop a blood vessel from too much critical thinking. Gaslighting assholes. The Pickmeishas who enable it are gaslighting assholes just the same too.	1641104728.0	hqwmynx	t3_ru3fxu	t3_ru3fxu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3fxu/just_got_banned_from_relationship_advice_for_my/hqwmynx/

f4fr272a	Women are trained to think that being beautiful in itself is valuable, while men only view increasing their attractiveness as a practical tool to lure in women, a tool that becomes worthless once they have secured a woman, or in a society where women have little to no autonomy.  This is also why a lot of them are ugly, unkempt and disgusting. They're too entitled to want to change for the sake of appealing to women, so they just boil in their anger instead.   If the message that being beautiful defines their value and is important in itself was instilled in the heads of little boys, in the same way it has been instilled in little girls, then we'd have way fewer eyesores walking around, married or otherwise.  Personally I think both men and women would be much happier if we valued female physical beauty less and men's beauty more.

Incels equate their delusional entitlement to use our bodies to masturbate with as the same thing as women demanding to be respected in a relationship.   If respecting women is asking too much of the dumb fucks maybe they should go date men who feel the same way they do then they can masturbate all night with each other's holes and leave ours alone.	1641110475.0	hqwv47v	t3_ru3fxu	t1_hqwqxyk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3fxu/just_got_banned_from_relationship_advice_for_my/hqwv47v/

7xkpkrcd	It amuses me that they try to equate women who refuse to engage with this type of men to the men that go on to commit violence because they cannot get laid because they secretly and not so secretly hate women.   That is a problem. That is a huge problem that the patriarchal society refuses to acknowledge it has created and encouraged. First of all, it encouraged misogyny. Secondly, it always treated women as 2nd class citizens.  And it's the same society that encouraged some mouthbreader as they grew up into thinking they deserve a woman, that they are owed one, that they're even entitled to one.   1. We don't hate men  2. Sir, it's not like we can't get any. We just vet out the selfish, substandard, hobosexual community dick.	1641110879.0	hqwvnav	t3_ru3fxu	t1_hqwqxyk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3fxu/just_got_banned_from_relationship_advice_for_my/hqwvnav/

But perhaps, it’s part of the culture *because* it allows so many to get away with it. Getting away with doing the bare minimum. Getting away with being an abuse prick. My heart goes out to all the women there.

It's either:  - Posts that no longer seem to exist, possibly never existed (shopped image), or has been otherwise removed.   - More extreme posts with very little interaction, that clearly isn't indicative of the majority of our views. They're convinced that every one of us agree with every post.   - Posts that come from accounts that, when looked up, are suspicious looking (low activity, low effort engagement within the sub, questionable comment history)  - Posts that are still around, popular, and from legitimate accounts, but just really piss them off. Usually these are the ones about expecting men paying on dates, which they never fail to screech about.   These last ones are just straight up booty bothered. Perfect example of them assuming we need their permission to have our own standards.   They don't measure up, and instead of moving on and looking for somebody more compatible, they throw a tantrum and tell us we can't do that.

Met someone through a hobby (online because of pandemic) and asked me out but struggling to set a date because of covid uncertainty (it’s more me being reluctant / concerned). He is very understanding and shows continuous interest but not at all pushy so maybe in your situation I would look at similar markers? Is he expressing the same level of interest? Is he understanding? To me, the fact he is covid-responsible is a good sign. I think we need to adapt to this uncertainty for now sadly, hoping that if there is a good potential for relationship, it will happen despite the difficulties.

I worked with a woman recently who told me the following in different conversations: her husband often needs to have meetings after work, they never have sex and he often declines her when she initiates, he’s desperate for kids though and got angry at her for thinking about taking another job which paid double what her current role does… my first thought was that he’s cheating. And controlling. She won’t leave though as their friend groups are so intermingled.   I also had a GM try and hit on me at a work Party. He’s married with kids. He told one of the other managers at work that he was going to f me that night… wrong on so many levels.

Had a creepy guy invade my space while I was waiting for an Uber (daytime afternoon on New Year’s Eve) he basically snuck up from behind and was so close he could’ve made bodily contact in fact I am 💯 that was what he was about to do and tried speaking to me. My instincts kicked in and I shouted at him to get the fuck away from me loud enough for people on the sidewalk to hear, become alert to what was happening and walked away swiftly while I got my key ready as a weapon. He did try to follow me and say shit (which I didn’t even listen to and couldn’t even decipher what was being said) but the damage was already done because all eyes were on him from other strangers on the sidewalk who were staring at him and he knew he couldn’t do anything else as he had just been humiliated and exposed as a predator in public and broad daylight. 🤣 I love it when predators get a taste of their own medicine.

5cp1c9w0	This. This is what I was going to say. I think BPD presents in men differently and is perhaps misdiagnosed, because they are more likely to be narcissists or sociopaths, as you said. Because not only do they not have the excessive empathy (which can often be present in women with BPD) but they actually have a clearly obvious lack of empathy.	1641119468.0	hqx65c7	t3_qyn4jf	t1_hljfpn3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/qyn4jf/i_havent_seen_a_disgusting_serial_dater_like_pete/hqx65c7/

5t7fl	I would say because sometimes there are posts on here that are rather nasty, and those can be the ones that get the most attention. There have been some comments or posts that I have seen that make me quite sad. I don't like to be nasty to anyone for no reason but there are some things here that get posted and if you question it you get banned which has happened to me already.  People believe we most likely hate all men.  So many of us came from abusive or unfulfilling relationships so its understandable to be wary of men and want to change our outlook and approach to prevent that from happening again, but there shouldn't be blind hatred for anyone. Maybe I'm just naive though, it doesn't seem to be how the world works.  I believe in the principles here, they have helped me after an extremely abusive relationship but much like any community there are those who post things that are more extreme.	1641120081.0	hqx6w2w	t3_ru3fxu	t1_hqwqxyk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3fxu/just_got_banned_from_relationship_advice_for_my/hqx6w2w/

3b0da7w4	Yep old/older men are just as tight as the young ones. My ex next door neighbour is 61. She told me of two men she dated who were her age. The first one came round for dinner nearly every night and never took her out. The second one complained about spending fuel on the 10 mile round trip to eat her food nearly every night. He took her out just once, to a pub round the corner and only bought her one drink! Her ex husband was a wealthy stockbroker and he was tight fisted as well. Fortunately she quickly saw the light and ditched both men. She was beautiful, had a nice home and everything.	1641120214.0	hqx71wh	t3_rs1zle	t3_rs1zle	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs1zle/men_of_all_ages_will_take_advantage_of_women_when/hqx71wh/
8wa6gkov	I have a cringey story here, met a guy when I was looking for other solo parent to date, he was in the divorce process-during our 3hr ‘coffee’ date all he did was bad mouthing his wife, and already he and his mom were day dreaming of the next Muslim bride, there were absolutely zero reflection on his behaviour. He just wanted to get married as soon as he can right after the divorce so that he can show his ex wife that she meant nothing.	1641120403.0	hqx7a13	t3_rsr680	t1_hqpdu7p	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqx7a13/

5cp1c9w0	This is SO true. Happened with my last ex. He had put on a lot of weight when we reconnected. Anyway, he ended up losing a lot when he was with me, and look, I liked him either way tbh. BUT he kept bragging about how much he lost every day, and it was like his attitude changed over night. He became so contemptuous and condescending toward me. We only dated for 4-5 months (and half of that he was away). People used to constantly say that I was way out of his league, but his sudden weight loss, made him feel like he could get a 14/15 year old girl. Gross. He probably could have to be honest, if she had “daddy issues” which I think this particular girl did. He literally stared her down at dinner all night, it was super creepy. He was old enough to be her father (he was 37). And she was not the type that looked anywhere near older/ mature for her age.  I ended up leaving him for many reasons. And even now, of course he keeps trying to weasel his way back in.	1641120899.0	hqx7vmv	t3_qls9yb	t1_hj6dfup	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/qls9yb/prime_example_that_having_money_does_not/hqx7vmv/

5cp1c9w0	I’m so sorry you felt that way. Just goes to show how much he brought your self esteem down too. And even as someone who you see as “more beautiful” than you, that he did the same to her. I do think we also tend to put the exes or women who we question, on a pedestal and think they are “better” than us, than they really are.  Good on you for being so brave and thank you for sharing your experience!  I had a similar experience lately - a woman contacted me, as she heard rumours I was dating her boyfriend (unbeknownst to me)… and we had a great chat. She validated all the red flags that I thought were there but doubted myself (as I had only been on one date with him and knew him previously).  I would love to reach out to the ex of one of my exes. He apparently has her blocked, but I get the feeling SHE blocked him, considering he’s popped back up after it being over a year and is harassing me again now. When I don’t respond to his texts, he turns up to events and bars he knows I frequent  with his mates, I guess in an attempt to intimidate me…he also made up this convoluted story about why they broke up - but I think it was because he was a cheater. He’s definitely a narcissist I can see that much now.	1641123160.0	hqxalfr	t3_q7qnu3	t1_hglu534	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/q7qnu3/talk_to_your_exs_ex/hqxalfr/

Even though my mom came to a western country at a young age, it was still a different time, too. I will say, though, I had it pretty good growing up compared to other women. Part of me is happy I never had a brother; I only had an older sister. I am confident he would’ve been treated better and his thoughts would’ve been taken more seriously, particularly by my dad. Would’ve made me resentful for that.  And of course, I know you’re saying it doesn’t diminish the struggles women face in western countries, too.

Women are expected to look extra hot even while their partners just could not bother. Meanwhile, a semi-attractive man can get literally anyone.	1641113127.0	hqwygvb	t3_ru3tku	t3_ru3tku	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3tku/what_happens_to_mens_physical_appearance_when/hqwygvb/

931g7cu0	I’m from an indigenous culture where younger women were promised (arranged marriage) to a much older man. Since recent times it’s becoming rare with the women in my tribe graduating and obtaining stable careers, removing the need to settle for old dusty men 😂   It’s funny how men can have high standards in women that they themselves don’t hold.   I’ve come across men who are offended that my standards in men is that he is healthy and takes pride in his appearance. I’ve even had men who’ve told me lower my standards and give chances to men because I’m missing out , but I throw their double standards right back at them.   Some foreign men when they are in western countries do experience a culture shock when younger women don’t find them attractive or will tolerate their controlling behaviour. Many end up going back to their home countries and marry a younger woman instead.   On my social I often get foreign men in my DM’s, who have the audacity to think I will marry their unattractive selves 😂	1641124850.0	hqxcpba	t3_ru3tku	t3_ru3tku	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3tku/what_happens_to_mens_physical_appearance_when/hqxcpba/

I’d honestly advise letting this go until April or so, I wouldn’t count this against him even.  With hospitalisations about to soar it’s just not going to be possible for him to be properly available to schedule dates etc as he will be working short notice overtime or catching Covid himself very likely.	1641124942.0	hqxcthk	t3_ru5tgu	t3_ru5tgu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru5tgu/dating_during_this_omicron_phase/hqxcthk/

I shit you not. They work at the same company and met when she was hired.  when i read he made faces at you, I thought he was a 15 year old pimply kid. I am sorry. It was a real shock to read he is actually 45. he acts like one of those preteen kids (yeah!):  \- obnoxious behaviour with the waitress  \- rude  \- overt dislike of you  \- and I bet he's a John  I have seen this type of behavior in men that are insecurely attached. He is really jealous and possessive of her and if he could, he would interdict all interaction between you two (because he's jealous duh). he also reads like he's a clown and a liar (history buff?) and I think he plays your friend and uses her only because she is younger than him. a woman his age would not even look his way, she wills ee him for who he really is: a failure.	1641124959.0	hqxcu9j	t3_ru6gg1	t3_ru6gg1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru6gg1/i_met_my_friends_lvm_during_the_holidays/hqxcu9j/

9mbii546	Personal story, but 6 months ago I reconnected with an old friends of mine, who happened to be a huge pick me. I went to her place a few times, because she invites me all the time just to listen about men 24/7 . It was all she could talk about, as of her whole existence on this Earth is only worth the attention she gets from different men. The desperation was off limits, she would continue the thing over text whenever she wants. Long story short, at the beginning of summer she invited me again , because we have a very close birthday dates. Planned to celebrate both of our birthdays that said week. She is like a couple of days earlier than me. I help her out with the cake, decorations, carrying stuff, taking pictures, EVEN SPLITTING THE COST OF EVERYTHING. Fast forward to the actual date and place, lots of her acquaintances and friends come, some of them I know of, some of them I don’t. I am the type of person, who could easily hold various of different conversations with almost everyone without any malicious intentions, I was just really in a mood for meeting potential new friends. Guys would talk to me, offer cigs , but nothing more then that. I have a few male acquaintances that I semi-trust you could say, they do know their place and never cross a boundary. I guess that made her insanely jealous and resentful of me, because few days passed after her birthday and now it’s my turn. Let me tell you- no present, no happy birthday, no nothing. She is suddenly super busy , ignoring me completely in the apartment (Mind you I was still at her place) , even giving me tasks without acknowledging my feelings of disappointment and regret. The moment I decided to express my feelings she tells me to pack my stuff and leave, basically telling me how ungrateful I am , completely intentionally trying to put me into a dangerous situation- alone in a big city with many dangerous people. Thank God, I have other friends and relatives to rescue me and I moved in like 15 minutes to my aunts place. To this day, I still check if I have enough money and available alternative places to stay, whenever I visit friends or relatives. Shortly after that I cut off ALL of those picke mes, even the ones that show the tiniest signs.	1641125748.0	hqxdv26	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqxdv26/

As for meeting new friends, I’ve had a lot of success meeting and making new friends by volunteering in my community. My favorites include being a behind the scenes volunteer for events related to the dramatic arts or environmental conservation (i.e., ushering, breaking down a set, picking up litter, planting marsh grasses, organizing events). Maybe pick 2 passions, see what’s in your community and reach out. You might need to try on a couple of organizations to find the right fit. I’ve found people who donate their time to a local nonprofit are community-centered and, generally, higher value people. And fun!

11bqox	>The majority of women are pickmes/LV. Imagine these women as mothers: she doesn't value her time, her effort. She spoils a child and expects no consideration or effort in return.

cemyr2ea	I had a gut feeling he wasn’t attracted to you and that’s why he treated you lie sh*t. What a prick!!! Men really have no respect for women who they aren’t actively trying to fk. And what a shame!!! So many good women turn to the dark side for these male “friends”.   That age gap is HORRIFIC. I’ve vowed never to have any male friends but especially if they are THAT OLD.

v5kf4	I'm thinking of doing a part 2 next week when the last 2 episodes drop.   So far, for the men, the one who looks the most 'high value' would be Hyun Joong. I think he has the best strategy by being attentive whilst not being clingy and needy like some other men.  Jin Taek is a fboy who's just in it for the 'game' and exposure.   Sehoon and Sihun are the worst seducers with Sehoon being downright bad.  Junsik is just here to promote his business and gave up when he saw the competition for his favorite girl.	1641136283.0	hqxviwh	t3_ru8uny	t1_hqxppgk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru8uny/singles_inferno_on_netflix_what_we_can_learn_from/hqxviwh/
v5kf4	Korean variety shows usually have a panel commentating the events so I'm used to it.

v5kf4	Yeah I've noticed that they heavily used her body to promote the show while barely putting her in it. Very disgusting. I don't think HS will go for her tbh. He strikes me as the type of guys who like to win and who likes competition so he'll probably stick to Jia and strives to be the 'chosen one'. I also feel like she's more his type, aka the inaccessible high maintenance gal.   OK I'll do a part 2 next week when the last episodes drop!	1641136554.0	hqxw34n	t3_ru8uny	t1_hqxrbaz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru8uny/singles_inferno_on_netflix_what_we_can_learn_from/hqxw34n/

7djs5tcj	My jaw dropped at "45." I thought he was a frat boy who'd just graduated college.  They've been friends for 6 years = They met when she was 22 and he was 39. That's disgusting.   Also, were they co-workers or was he her boss? Either's bad. The former means he was a 39-year old in an entry-level position (loser), the latter means he's a boss mingling with subordinates (also bad).   I only mention this because it's another red flag for ladies here to look out for. It's not just the obvious age gap but what it means about his immaturity and predation.   I know we live in a patriarchy, but my mind's always blown by how many stories I hear of men behaving THIS badly yet get pass after pass for it. Unbelievable.   Good for you blocking her.

He'd roll his eyes then pretend to be interested in what I was saying. Or say he was joking right after a passive comment.   I definitely think he's preying on her.

I personally would have made it clear to her why she was cut off for her edification and urged her to stop that loser. My blood boiled reading this. I couldn’t have finished the night.

3z87uwbx	I'm glad you said something.  Too many men paint their exes as evil harpies who are keeping them away from their kids. Of course, some women eat that up and feel sorry for their men who just want to be involved dads.   Similar to what we say in dating, when it comes to being a more active father, if he wanted to, he would. At a minimum, even if he did have zero contact with his kids, he'd be working with a family attorney and consistently tracking attempts to see them to improve his chances in court. Most men just give up and don't even bother, though. The only HVM single dad I know has 50/50 custody and is extremely involved in his kids' lives.	1641140921.0	hqy65au	t3_rub2qv	t3_rub2qv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rub2qv/tell_me_a_pickme_runs_a_page_without_telling_me/hqy65au/

65er21t3	I have definitely noticed this. I'm sorry you had to deal with these nasty people. I feel like it comes from insecure pickme energy. It's likely she saw him check you out or felt paranoid that he might find you attractive, so she was trying to take you down a peg. He knew he could never get with you,  so he wanted to take a chance to insult you as LVM often do. People who are happy in their lives and with themselves would not go around doing this.

4qvw4na4	Your story dragged up a distant memory for me, one about a situation that happened when I was a young girl at university.   I was on my way to see my friend at her dorm. The university I was attending had dorms scattered all around the city (it wasn't an enclosed campus) so members of the public could wander near areas of student accommodation or the lecture halls.   Now it was dark and I could see the security gates to my friend's dorm up ahead of me when suddenly I noticed a man walking towards me on my right. I locked eyes with him and I don't know what it was but in that split millisecond of decision making I decided to RUN. It wasn't a conscious decision, it was like if you touch something hot and reflexively take your hand off it. I booked it towards the security gates, getting inside just in time to lock the guy out. It was then that I realised he had been running after me and would have caught me if I hadn't of made it inside just in time.   Well, he started SCREAMING at me through the bars of the gate, accusing me of all sorts of things, calling me a bitch, demanding I come outside of the gates etc.. I think they know they're guilty and will scream at you to project the blame onto you.	1641141354.0	hqy77m8	t3_rsfyq4	t3_rsfyq4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsfyq4/storytime_parking_lot_peril_safety_tips_i_always/hqy77m8/

tfi8qd	Yes. It’s called jealousy and insecurity from other people.  Pretty privilege is a thing but there’s a negative side to it, whether we like it or not. People who aren’t secure in themselves love to talk negatively about others who they don’t even know.  The more attractive/put together you look, the more of a threat you are to people who are teeming with insecurities. They want what you possess, but are so caught up in their heads and worrying about other’s business that they can’t achieve it themselves.  Yes you’re right, low value couples are guilty of this and it’s usually initiated by the woman and then the man chimes in to “please his woman”. The man usually won’t have these thoughts about others, but is on a ball and chain and needs to partake in hostility.	1641141965.0	hqy8qud	t3_rubxro	t3_rubxro	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rubxro/attractive_fdsers_are_low_value_couples_hostile/hqy8qud/

16qjfo	I've posted this before and I'll post it again.    > In just over 51% of custody decisions, both parents agree that the mother should become the custodial parent. In roughly 29% of custody decisions, this is made without any assistance from the court or from a mediator. 11% are determined with the assistance of a mediator, and 5% are determined following a custody evaluation. By comparison, only 4% of custody cases require going to trial before primary custody is decided. Overall, 91% of custody decisions do not require the family court to decide.    I know FDS largely advises against dating single fathers (and since I'm child free, I would never myself) but if for some reason you are considering it, remember that whatever custodial arrangement he has, he likely did not get 'screwed over by the courts' and you should take anything they say with a grain of salt until you vet.	1641142159.0	hqy98i9	t3_rub2qv	t3_rub2qv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rub2qv/tell_me_a_pickme_runs_a_page_without_telling_me/hqy98i9/

10fuzrmb	This conflicts with other advice you’ve received, but I’m sharing my thoughts anyway *(so you can make a decision seeing as many sides as possible.)* I would not like it if a man made this choice for me… It seems way too paternal? Especially for a man who’s only been on one date with you. I don’t know how to word it exactly, but I’d feel like he sees himself as strong and resistant enough to work in a hospital, but thinks I’m so fragile that I shouldn’t even be going out to dinner. I can choose to be anything… if I wanted to be a healthcare provider would be give me trouble because he thinks it’s too risky for me?  I just don’t like this. Men should be asking what you’re comfortable doing, not telling you what they think is safest for you to do.    *(Note: I am not sure of your age or health. I am a young woman in good health who chose to get fully (and recently) vaccinated. My opinion is influenced by working as a bartender and waitress this whole time in a place where masks and vaccines are not required for any employees or customers.

8w9ask4b	That's so interesting (and disgusting).  I never heard of a language exchange website.  I can totally see men using it as a means to access women otherwise out of reach.  When I learned about the history of waves of immigration (decades ago, in Asia, but I wonder if this is more universal?), a common theme was that the women, including middle-aged and older women (and wives) integrated and assimilated much easier and quicker into the culture and society, than their male counterparts (and husbands).   Actually, many men who were of the middle-aged and older generations never assimilated.  Back in their home countries, these men may have been doctors, successful businessmen, higher-status tradesmen, and/or community leaders, but now they were immigrants, stripped of their statuses, with limited (or no) relevant language skills.   Now in their new country, men had difficulty with the reality that they may have to work in physically laborious jobs, to earn money (if they worked at all), because they didn't have the language skills to hold a comparable type of job (if it existed), in their new country/area.  Their dependence on physical labor jobs further isolated themselves from assimilating (e.g., no time to learn, exhaustion, and limited exposure to the new language).  Meanwhile, women already had plenty of "social capital" and invested in improving their language skills, and moving up where they could.  Sounds like these guys are playing the numbers game, which will (likely) never prove fruitful (unless they BS some lady in thinking that their in love or something).	1641143742.0	hqydbka	t3_rssu7e	t1_hqxced1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hqydbka/

So technically there are no women’s rights subs on Reddit.  I do post on TwoXX and TrollXX but I use an Alt account. I send a lot of links to confused or hurting women on there to FDS.

7s6kgtwd	I don’t know how I feel about attachment theory to be honest.  I feel like there are probably A LOT of women walking around right now that have been told they have an anxious attachment for daring to ask for the bare minimum from their partners and rightfully developing anxiety and worry when he refused to meet that.   In reality these women have a healthy attachment style but repeatedly get paired time and time again with men that have an avoidant style, that can make you *feel like* you have an anxious style when you don’t.  I also don’t think these men have an avoidant style, because they attach perfectly fine to family, to friends, to jobs, etc. it’s to women who they enjoy manipulating and using that they refuse to commit to that they can’t attach to. It’s not that they have an unhealthy attachment style, it’s that they don’t like women *as people*.	1641144243.0	hqyenph	t3_rs11ta	t3_rs11ta	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqyenph/

hi21eq0b	Yes! Pretty frequently. Usually initiated by the woman and echoed by her LVM partner who is only too pleased for a chance at “negging” an attractive woman he would never get to talk to. I’ve had this all my life so now I just grey rock them, walk past unseeing or have headphones in.   What DOES get tiresome though is the women who will not let their men work with me or be hired on a project supervised by me even though it would benefit said LVM’s career. I’m very successful in my field and working with me would be levelling up. The loss is entirely theirs of course.	1641143226.0	hqybze5	t3_rubxro	t3_rubxro	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rubxro/attractive_fdsers_are_low_value_couples_hostile/hqybze5/

8w9ask4b	It's sad that I feel so relieved at the moment a guy switches from "Hey baby" to "F-you, you ain't even hot. You ugly." Because then I know I'm free.   Even his crew members (when applicable) appear to back off once that first guy gives up, because "I'm ugly" 😂  It's so ironic that no one ever gave these "nice guys" the memo that they're showing their hand the second that they claim to be "nice."  Side note:  Knowing when enough is enough, and this guy will not let up, really depends on the context.  I've completed both a self-defense and concealed carry course. Both taught me that at some point, I may need to speak up (which is weird to think about, because usually the instinct is no not feed the street troll).  I haven't said it (yet and hope I won't need to), but if someone follows me and didn't act like this guy, then it may need to go from walking faster to a curt, "Stop! [Hand motion, and an adverse consequence]."  I'd have to be prepared with my key chain alarm and/or pepper spray.

7s6kgtwd	Pick me’s aren’t just sad and pathetic, *they’re dangerous.*  When I was 19 and living with my sister she began dating a felon. She constantly had this giant terrifying man over who had recently been released from prison. I immediately had to move out. I had to break the lease. It cost my parents a fortune. Sure enough he beat the shit out of her not much later.  These women will excuse and overlook violent tendencies in their “men” and then bring them around you. The easiest way you can avoid ending up a statistic is to avoid LVM but you can’t do that if your pick me friends are always bringing their loser violent scrotes around.	1641144792.0	hqyg3nf	t3_rrut8f	t3_rrut8f	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rrut8f/the_dangers_pick_mes_pose_to_fds_women/hqyg3nf/

6bu8qams	Well, in my specific case, I used to just say that my guy was "weird" because he can't attach to anything - family, friends, jobs, locations. He can't even "commit" to planning tomorrow's dinner because that's too much. He makes travel decisions and reservations at the last possible moment and ignores problems until he literally is forced to confront them. He just spent a year and a half living recluse on a small island avoiding the whole world and his entire life. Without deep human connections, without a job, without working on any projects, just... Surfing and walking around and passing the time. An empty life like that would drive me insane within weeks.   I thought he was just a chill hermit type, and it took me a while to realise just how dysfunctional he actually is.  But I agree with you - strangely enough I only get anxious with people who are objectively behaving like shit, so no wonder. I'm now taking the anxiety as a bright signal that I'm involved with someone unsuitable. And "avoidant" traits can also easily be the hallmark signs of the abuse cycle.  To me it's just a name for a behavioural pattern I wasn't aware of and am now determined to avoid.	1641144859.0	hqyga81	t3_rs11ta	t1_hqyenph	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs11ta/early_warning_signs_to_spot_avoidants_and_avoid/hqyga81/

I understand wanting to be careful when you're working with vulnerable individuals during a pandemic, but if we wanted to, he would. He'd videocall, plan something distanced outside (I once played lasertag with walkie-talkies 😅), write letters, whatever.  I know there is a knee-jerk reaction to give him the benefit of the doubt. As someone in the field, I really appreciate it. We've been working ourselves senseless to cope with the consequences of a poorly-funded healthcare system.   But I'd actually like to offer another perspective, which although slightly less forgiving, may be more prudent: this dude probably isn't interested, and even if he is interested (in stringing you along somehow), a *lot* of male doctors are *low-value af*. Like seriously disordered, narcissistic types. If you meet a lovely man and he happens to be a physician but treats you very well and *continues to make consistent effort throughout your entire relationship*, congrats, you've found a gem, keep spending time with him. If he starts with the excuses and *also doesn't text you for 5 days*, keep moving.	1641147570.0	hqyngdw	t3_ru5tgu	t1_hqy8isb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru5tgu/dating_during_this_omicron_phase/hqyngdw/

He even framed it in a way that made me look weird for enjoying it, and made it sound like most women don’t like it.  I couldn’t believe my ears lol.  I’ve never even met a guy who was turned off by giving oral.  He also added it’s because he “doesn’t like the taste”.  As if we like the taste of theirs.  He’s also the type to brag about how good he is in bed, and how many women he’s had.  Which is supposedly a lot.  Another thing I don’t buy.  (I know it’s common for men to brag about how amazing they are in bed, but I personally avoid those types so I didn’t have to deal with those.  It took me by surprise especially since he’s one of those balding nerdy guys that I thought would treat me like a queen for giving him a chance LOL).	1641148286.0	hqypfu1	t3_rsvjbs	t1_hqsbzao	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsvjbs/as_funny_as_this_sounds_its_really_hard_to_find/hqypfu1/

I know, there is nothing ethical about it; it's named such because the proponents (usually male) wanted to justify the unethical nature of it. Men dangling the carrots in my face: "oh, you can't ask your one partner to fulfill all your needs. You need multiple", or "our capacity to love is unlimited!" or "there are different types of love and relationships!" or "don't take it so seriously. Be PLAYFUL!". I was afraid of losing them so I kept compromising, and compromises are a form of chasing men. But the truth is if a man values their partner, they'd never ask to open the relationship up. They'd be thinking about you, texting you, making it known that they're thinking about you - the wide-shared wisdom that "if he left you confused and in pain, then he's not into you" cannot be more true and real.	1641147336.0	hqymtt3	t3_rudjb7	t3_rudjb7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rudjb7/say_no_to_breaks_and_open_relationships/hqymtt3/
dsz5cs6w	Yes, all of the time. It usually starts when the scrote leers at me for too long. Pick me notices. She rolls her eyes, and starts LOUDLY saying things about me. He joins in.  I just think. “Dump him. I would never date such a disrespectful, leering loser”	1641148393.0	hqypqqx	t3_rubxro	t3_rubxro	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rubxro/attractive_fdsers_are_low_value_couples_hostile/hqypqqx/

The contestant who followed her around like a puppy eventually accepted that she wasn’t interested back and she didn’t even have to break it down for him further when he asked her to talk alone. It’s proof that men understand more non verbal communication than they let on and that no one has to over explain or defend themselves to a man to be understood. A lot of relationship subs promote cOmmUniCaTioN even when the negative circumstances and outcomes are obvious and predictable.   Soyeon tried to talk about her feelings with the tailor guy and he gave her vague answers which she accepted. He knew she was feeling confused so he took advantage of that. Then she tried to communicate with the dark triad guy and he somehow made himself out to be a huge victim when all she wanted was to ask him if he would be open to learning more about her. Having long convos with people who won’t reciprocate doesn’t work and people severely overestimate how effective it is.	1641148456.0	hqypx8i	t3_ru8uny	t3_ru8uny	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru8uny/singles_inferno_on_netflix_what_we_can_learn_from/hqypx8i/

I was watching a drama show with my bf and suddenly this side character goes "Let's have a break cause Im not looking for a relationship rn but let's see where this goes" aka "Let me treat you like a wh0re but for free!"

em2vh4f	>I usually don't really enjoy Western dating show because it's mostly about who slept with whom rather than each person trying to seduce the other. In Single's Inferno, due to Korea's conservative values, they're not sleeping with each other or kissing or cuddling. So to seduce each other, they have to rely on words and non-sexual actions. It's very refreshing for me but also very interesting to watch the strategies that they use.  This but applied more broadly to movies/series ( and other Asian countries like China).

3mcgi	Many a time ago, one of my relatives was an affair partner.  He swore up and down to my relative that his "wife is crazy/withholding the kids/we're separated/I'm going to make her sign divorce papers tomorrow!"  All of this in a two year time period. He told my relative that he was having his "soon-to-be ex wife served with divorce papers so many times".  That was, until, my relative asked for the actual proof before a weekend away that the two of them planned.  He couldn't produce the proof and ended up telling my relative "me and my wife are going to work on things".  This is why I will never date someone who is "in the process" or is divorced because they are greatly embellishing the truth.	1641148659.0	hqyqhk1	t3_rsr680	t1_hqo4pbb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqyqhk1/

I think there was a post made a while ago on another subreddit that showed the same handful of men being mods for a LARGE number of women’a subreddits.  It’s gotten even worse since the WSB subreddit situation with the stock market stuff way back then.  Reddit is slowly moving towards increased disregard to the needs of the women who make up their user base and it’s one of the reasons I no longer purchase Reddit gold to award anything with.  💔	1641148704.0	hqyqm0p	t3_rs2fs0	t3_rs2fs0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rs2fs0/not_supposed_to_represent_feminism_on_a_feminist/hqyqm0p/

3mcgi	My boyfriend's dad did the first one to my boyfriend's stepmom.  His dad cheated on my boyfriend's mom, but he didn't stay with the affair partner.  More than a year later, his dad met who would become my boyfriend's stepmom.  Getting together with someone else so soon is what he considered his "post-divorce work".  Oof.  They were married for close to 16 years until 2016 when it was discovered that his dad had been cheating for the last two years.  His dad took up with the affair partner until recently, but this woman is a drug addict through and through.  We were just talking about this the other night because he receives this group text that his dad decided that he wants to be baptized again.  He revealed to me that up until recently, his dad was telling everyone that he was going to be marrying the affair partner.  Now that it isn't happening - for today, at least - there is much skepticism to be had.  My boyfriend is calling BS since his dad has embarked on "self-improvement" before only to completely screw it up.  His dad expects others to take responsibility for his mistakes when the reality is that his three children *combined* are further in their lives and relationships than he is at 64 years old.	1641149265.0	hqys713	t3_rsr680	t1_hqpdu7p	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsr680/happy_new_year_lasses_and_remember/hqys713/

There’s a certain type of HV man I’ve noticed, that actually do listen and make efforts to let a woman know he wants to hear what she has to say, good eye contact, pauses between speaking so that you can say what you want, *respectful* etc, but men like this?

He's texted me several times and called a few times. I have initiated texting twice but never called except to return his.   The week after our first date was when Omicron hit and we were both concerned about it. I'm taking it as a positive that he hasn't used this opportunity to try for a a house date or something else LV. Also seeing whether he follows up with an idea to get together when the Covid situation improves / we get some good weather days to do something cute outside is a good vetting opportunity and a way to gauge how interested he is.   With your guy being in healthcare during this surge, and the holidays, I wouldn't take the lack of a second date personally just yet. If he tries to turn you into a penpal or phonecall buddy long-term then it's definitely good to cut him off.	1641151987.0	hqyznnd	t3_ru5tgu	t3_ru5tgu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru5tgu/dating_during_this_omicron_phase/hqyznnd/
d7oax4lp	I’m so sorry, Op! What a crappy way to start off the new year. But you did the right thing in blocking them out of your life. Don’t worry, they won’t change and it’s get worse if you stuck around. Believe me.  The age gap is not surprising, but I think the way he behaved with you (and her) fascinates me. Not only is he grooming her in hopes that she will become his, but even before they’re an official couple, he is already doing the typical abusive tactic of isolating her from everyone around her. He is showing her how much other people… especially, other WOMEN… suck compared to himself and herself, as a way to create a bubble of just them inside of it. “It’s you and me against the world.” type of shit.  He found you threatening because you made your ex friend happy. He wanted you to disappear so that she could focus solely on him. He didn’t wanted her to have friends, much less female friends, who would question her as to why she, a 28 year old woman, is hanging around a creepy ass 45 year old. He can’t have that happen. He won’t allow it. But it’s not like he can just outright tell everyone to stop talking to your ex friend. Too hard on the nose.  So, he shows her that other women are shit, via bullying and making faces and putting them in their places with the historical buff crap. This is the show the 28 year old that she should “keep her standards high and don’t just befriend any women”, that other women are stupid and annoying, unlike him, who is oh so smart and awesome. 🙄  If she gets with him, it’s years of domestic abuse waiting for her. She will wake up one day, shocked that she no longer has any friends or family in her life to talk to her. Why should they? They would have to deal with the 45 yr old man child if they wanted to have a word with her or spend time with her.

1r5fcjrr	Wow, I love this summary as a mirror of dating realities (esp how men value the women that other men want) and especially this comment. It really is a breakdown for single men I see out in the wild:  20% HV  20% LVM who are attractive and smooth but just looking to chase and play around, aren’t interested in women as people (this is the demo that the next category likes to fixate on as the one they claim “women want” so they have an excuse to be a dirtbag, bc being HV is too hard). bamboozling pickmes for all time, and even fooling some of the rest of us.   40% LVM who have no idea what they’re doing- also maybe uninterested in who women are as people/don’t even like them that much. for the Barb the Builder in you!   20% dabblers, who would like a woman for the social status upgrade (also does not value them as people), but don’t want to do the work or take the risk, preferring to do so for their job as that feels less personal of a risk, while still being able to frame themselves as hardworking and successful. Have to be in the right place at the right time- and available/not too much work- for them to be “wow’d” enough to  pursue. Often end up chased by pickme’s.

Observe and learn how if he makes you confused, something is off. Walk away and don’t look back.	1641152219.0	hqz09yx	t3_ru8uny	t3_ru8uny	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru8uny/singles_inferno_on_netflix_what_we_can_learn_from/hqz09yx/

4jjb2aqh	Yea unavailability for a date is one thing but taking 5 days to text back is way too long in my opinion. People always make time for their priorities, and dating you isn’t a priority to him. I am in a field where 12-hour days and all-nighters are routine, but I text back within a day. Sure maybe it’s due to omicron but this probably isn’t the time for him to be dating if that’s the case. I’d let him go.	1641152616.0	hqz1clo	t3_ru5tgu	t1_hqy8isb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru5tgu/dating_during_this_omicron_phase/hqz1clo/

88zmpwbq	Masked dependency is a common trait in the most lethal ab.users so it's not always easy to just leave. It's not commonly recognized that victims of cheating frequently suffer from Stockholm syndrome and terror paralysis but it makes sense the closer you look at the dynamics.   According to dv researcher Donald Dutton, who spent decades studying ba.tterers like bugs in prison settings, identified some common if not entirely universal traits in ab.users such as "masked dependency."   When I first read the research, it caused my brain to implode. There's a saying that "facts cluster around a good theory" and facts definitely cluster around this one in my experience. I repeat it often to share that blast of clarity. I think it could keep women safer to understand this.    Ab.users misrepresent and lie about everything, particularly their own MOs. Ba.tterers, whose childhoods are typically marked with ab.use or witnessing ab.use (which we called "ba.tterer boot camp" to make it clear that acknowledging early trauma is *not* a bid to sympathize with ab.users, just data to "know thy enemy"), grow up with crippling shame over their own vulnerability because of being reared in a k.ill-or-be-ki.lled environment. Because ba.ttered women are often too injured and terrorized to properly bond with infants, these infants who often grow into ab.users as adults have tendency to form infantile dependence on intimate partners. Basically they're 200 LB two year olds eternally raging because mommy can't meet their needs-- and too ashamed of that dependence to process it.   It's a lethal combo. Consequently ab.users, though they may display vulnerability at first in the courtship stage, commonly begin to deny and conceal jealousy, dependence and fears of abandonment as these feelings escalate with increasing intimacy. Instead they externalize these feelings to partners, falsely blaming the partner for "knowingly" triggering uncomfortable emotions then attempting to transfer that fraught, broken, betrayed, terrified state to victims ("reenactment compulsion"-- recreating past traumas but this time as a perp) and fabricating alternate explanations for their rage, fear and misery that obscure the real, internally generated causes.  It's why ab.users and cheaters bafflingly seem to operate as if "justifiably" taking revenge on victims. In ab.users'  twisted perceptions, they believe this is warranted and that their victims have deliberately "unmanned" them.  Since a lot of ab.users operate on a beat-by-need basis, if they can "transfer" the broken, fucked up state to victims through less athletic, less legally risky means like cheating, they will. That's why the current media trend of minimizing and normalizing cheating as some kind of free-love choicy-choice lifestyle or groovy rebellion against repressive constrcts is so dangerous. It's minimizing a major red flag for worsening ab.use and potential violence.   Plus cheating can also serve as triangulation to gain support from enablers who will help boost ab.users' carefully constructed rationales (called "neutralization" in psych-speak) and false hateful narratives (again, to conceal and dilute dependence) against primary victims. Cheating is an effective dog whistle to gather ready-made proxy-abusers since studies show that those willing to knowingly get involved with someone in a committed relationship have high rates of "dark triad" traits themselves and tend to support "rape myths." Part of the attraction to participating in cheating isn't so much due to the "desireability" of married or committed individuals but likely a subconscious attraction to bullying and punishing a designated victim or easy mark. This is why affairs rarely last once the primary victim escapes. Affairs are three-legged stools that collapse when the "victim legs" remove themselves.   The fact that cheating doesn't really serve-- as hoped-- to "dilute" the ab.user's shameful feeling of infantile dependence on primary partners is obvious by the fact most cheaters become progressively more vicious or even violent towards victims as the cheating continues. Only when an ab.user is assured their victims are too broken to ever move on do most ab.users attempt to move on themselves. At most they might form a secondary dependence on the secondary partner but tend to circle back around to haunt (or wirse) primary victims if the primary victims show signs of recovery. It's a frequent lament of side dishes that once the fun bonding ritual of creating and punishing a mutual enemy-ogre (primary partner) fades, cheaters continue to obsess about the partners they cheated on. A frequent complaint of former victims that their exes won't leave them alone but keep showing up like bad pennies.  This is why it's often not so easy to leave a cheater-- because cheating is rarely "just cheating" but is part of a spectrum of classic ab.use. Even if a cheater never becomes overtly violent (statistically they're more likely to), the victim is boiling like a frog in soul-chilling proximity to someone who, if actions were taken to logical extremes, is bent on their annihilation.   Acknowledging that component of "just cheating" can help victims process and assess risk and their own reactions to genuine danger with more clarity. It's an important first step to escaping, saying, "I'm not crazy or weak, I'm paralyzed with terror for good reason." By the same token, media and social minimizations of cheating are cultural gaslighting that undercut victims' clarity and ability to escape. That's why I'm not a fan of material that minimizes, normalizes, glorifies or romanticizes infidelity.   I'm noticing a recent trickle of films which are getting the subject right these days. The recent Pablo Larrain film *Spencer* on the last horrifying weeks of Princess Di's marriage to Prince Charles is a chilling study of infidelity as ab.use. Most of Larrain's films-- from *Fugue* to *Post Mortem* to *The Club*--explore the role of rape in political tyranny, usually using Pinochet's dictatorship as the backdrop (Larrain is Chilean). The theme is subtler in *Jackie*, *No* and *Spenser* but still there if you know the roles of the UK and US in Pinochet's coup and other western-backed reigns of terror in Latin America. Basically I think Larrain posits that average Joes support or fail to effectively fight the very tyrannies that consume them because the conditions of tyranny provide average Joes the tempting opportunity to sexually control women to the extent that tryanny *is* rape. Larrain seems to be on a spree of exploring how this impacts women caught in proximity to power.	1641153098.0	hqz2nu2	t3_rsnr2u	t1_hqpkkh5	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsnr2u/whats_considered_good_or_bad_when_it_comes_to_sex/hqz2nu2/
765eiop8	When done properly/well, therapy enables couples to actually hear what the other is saying. He needs to hear what she needs to say.   I also think she could benefit from therapy to unpack whatever mess he’s burdened her with during the marriage. Have you ever gotten out of a bad relationship, looked back and thought, “Holy f-uck,” and then your healing could begin properly AND you avoided men like OOP in the future? I think therapy would help his wife most of all.	1641153165.0	hqz2up2	t3_ruee4g	t1_hqz1gkf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruee4g/why_she_doesnt_care_for_him_during_sex/hqz2up2/

4jjb2aqh	It’s a lose lose though. A lot of men still get off on women not enjoying it - like making a woman do sex acts she doesn’t enjoy, domination/“CNC” or corrupting a “good girl” who is only a slut for them.  So once a man finds out a woman actually enjoys sex, it’s often less exciting for him. But then if we don’t show enthusiasm, it’s also not enough.   Which, fine. Let those guys stick to watching porn and sex dolls, since they don’t value being with another human.	1641153260.0	hqz34cu	t3_rsvjbs	t1_hqq2myv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsvjbs/as_funny_as_this_sounds_its_really_hard_to_find/hqz34cu/

When I was a *freshman* in college, I realized the vast difference between me and a high schooler. When I was a senior in college? Forget it. And you better believe that only losers were still dating high school girls.   Same with a 19 year old and someone in their 40s. Vastly different life stages.

You get into the job and your employers also try to pile on responsibilities Q, F, J, P, and W. When you speak up to say those aren’t what you signed up for, your employers say, “But you agreed!” No. You didn’t. So a smart employee stands her ground until her employer complies…or she leaves for a better job.  A wife isn’t even an employee!

7osmnunj	Yep ive been in similar situations and I've known  friends who have gone through it too. Given a choice between a decent looking man our own age and an extremely hot but inappropriately young guy, most women will choose the man their own age. But the reverse is true for men. They would pass up a beautiful, more attractive older woman for a chance with a homelier young one. When they say they like youth they're not kidding, they really find it attractive.  And if you start to look you'll notice that a lot of women who are in sincere relationships (not sugar babies) with older men are not particularly pretty (compared to their peers). I think it's what makes them targets for these guys. They aren't appreciated by men their own age so they love the attention and admiration of old men who find their youth attractive above all else.	1641155282.0	hqz8q9c	t3_ruhmdd	t3_ruhmdd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruhmdd/age_gap_gross_out/hqz8q9c/

1d125zkr	Very well said. I had to leave a job in the past because they tried doing that, giving me all the supervisor duties without the pay! These scrotes really try tricking women.

8uuz5573	One small thing I've noticed that men like this do is say things like, "let's see where it goes", which is code for, "I'm probably not actually going to comit, and if I do I won't be emotionally available. I didn't promise anything".  Like, yeah we want guys who are independent and laid back, but if from the very start they're treating it casually, watch out. They don't want a deeper relationship, and when you start to do those things, it would explain why they start backing out.  If they don't show full interest up front, or if they start  texting back slower and slower, keep looking.	1641156359.0	hqzboth	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzboth/

psdyfxu	I was wondering this as well - your friend is young, and may not understand the dynamics that are in play with this man. If you think it might be possible, perhaps you can try ONCE to broach the subject with her. You can tell her that you see a lot of red flags in his behavior. And maybe you can bluntly ask her if she’s thinking about dating him, because in your opinion, that’s what he’s angling for. If the conversation is nonproductive, then you know your friendship has no future. But if she does become “woke” to this kind of behavior, then you’ve done her a huge favor.	1641156593.0	hqzccnk	t3_ru6gg1	t1_hqy47u3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru6gg1/i_met_my_friends_lvm_during_the_holidays/hqzccnk/

Somebody else took up the responsibilities, and ended up quitting because the stress got to be too much.

5bc6by3l	To be fair he utterly manipulated her. The honeymoon phase with someone you think is a good person is an incredibly binding experience.   This bait and switch of his was very devious, especially considering she’s child free as you mentioned in another post.   Men do this intentionally when you’re emotionally invested. Imagine you’re genuinely falling in love with someone and you learn he’s a liar. It’s hard to just quit cold turkey, and if she’s not on FDS it’s even harder to not ignore the crimson flags and leave. Because that means being alone and possibly sad again.   He will hurt her even more in the future but rest assured he is a manipulator. Men who do this are selfish and love the attention they’re getting from the girl they’re lying to more than the girl themselves.	1641157971.0	hqzg9pq	t3_ruj11l	t1_hqzdyf0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruj11l/my_sister_is_dating_a_guy_who_lied_about_having/hqzg9pq/
h57msag5	Same issue. I don't think you can easily vet for this in the early dating stages, since normal people will also be on guard and emotionally closed-off in the very beginning.  Be sure to not cling on whenever it comes apparent they aren't matching your preferred energy. Do not adjust your behaviour to their preferences either.

He never bothers to see her and is simply not interested in being a father. But if that is not bad enough, he posted on Facebook many times how my friend is stopping him seeing their daughter. Of course all his friends & family believes him. Thankfully my friend’s family and friends know her and believe her. He is a loser and a complete waste of oxygen and it’s good that he is an absent father as he would only fuck up their lives!   Come to think of it, in my very close circle of family and friends, I know at least 4 women who have had partners desert them soon after a baby arrives and I always wondered how they explain themselves to their family and future partners.

6bu8qams	I'm aloof when I start dating because they're a stranger, I'm busy, and I'm vetting. Problem is, unavailable men seem healthily independent as long as there's that bit of distance.

a500fd6w	It's important not to give yourself over to a man you don't know well, of course, but after 2 months, he will have made his intentions to get closer clear if that was his goal. The fact that they pull away when you are trying to get closer is the red flag. That they are happy with the emotional distance after this amount of time tells you exactly what they want.  It's not you, it's them. As soon as they start pulling away, you know what they are really after. Cut your losses at this point. You are not clingy or overbearing. You are a normal human being with a normal need for connection. These men are the deviants.	1641159477.0	hqzjju6	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzjju6/
drjbia2c	Hmm well there’s this book on attachment issues called “Attached” by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.  They say that dating advice recommending playing hard to get and not initiating much is counterproductive for especially the anxiously attached. Because you let the other set the tone, you can become a magnet for avoidants apparently. They feel safe when you don’t initiate.  They advocate for open communication of what you expect (I’d be cautious with this as LVM will use it against you) and most importantly not letting him set the pace of the relationship. So: let him know you’re interested, don’t be afraid to message first sometimes, etc. etc.  It sounds logical to me, and might be worth -cautiously- trying. (I haven’t tried it yet because I’m not dating currently.) Maybe find a middle road between this and FDS? You’d probably want to vet stricter with this approach ie. if he doesn’t reply as fast as you, block and delete.	1641159498.0	hqzjlsu	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzjlsu/
9zgbu614	Well, I guess it's already a bad sign of he's part of the peanut gallery *for months*, right?  He should be interested in getting to know you more from the get-go, in a respectful way of course. It's also a good thing to check his future plans early on. If you don't align, it's easy to stop contact.	1641156123.0	hqzb1kt	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzb1kt/
fusz7	Boundaries. Holding to your standards. I’m still reading through the guidebook, but it seems that’s pretty much the first step.  When you’re casually dating, do you know with certainty he’s seeking a relationship? Do you know anything about their relationship history? Any successful prior long term relationships, or serial “dater” with nothing long term?  You aren’t being clingy, the problem is not you. If days go by without contact, they were never interested in a serious relationship with you in the first place, sadly. If days go by without hearing from them, block and delete.   Your time and emotional wellbeing are both entirely too valuable to allow anyone to cause you to question yourself so much! So please don’t.   Learn intentions before waiting around for too long. If their energy does not match yours, say goodbye. Instead of bending your rules to accommodate the person they are that makes you unhappy, stick to your rules and walk away at the first sign it’s not it. Men *do* show who they are early, and will also make their intentions extremely clear if they’re romantically interested in you.   If he wanted to, he would!!!! Men who want to see you and be with you will never allow you to feel doubt about it. I thought I was insecure and doomed to never be happy because I’d always be worried and wanting more - as soon as I met someone who actually liked me, I never once felt doubt at how much they cared for me … don’t accept anything less than that.	1641156453.0	hqzbybx	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzbybx/
9ovd4wye	I've had this a few times and it took me a while to realise I deserved better. I dated a guy in 2020 who I'd known for a few years and he was the one that initiated things. At first he was great, then got lazy with chatting and suggesting dates. So one day I just didn't text him. And that was that. I've dated a couple of other guys since then and the second they even hint at being avoidant I end it in my head and cut contact. Even if they're still keen. I just decided I'm not wasting my time on anyone that doesn't give 100% and doesn't work on their issues.	1641157180.0	hqze1jc	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqze1jc/
gf4quzzi	Your history sounds a lot like mine. And I'm going to be honest. I had the exact same stresses. Should I double text? He did, so maybe? Did I do something wrong when we hung out? I thought we were getting close?  How I vetted? Anytime I felt this way, bye boy👋 I realized that if I found myself confused, stressed, and turning the situation into a literal equation, it's because I'm putting to much effort into something, while the guy is not. To me, it's a sign that the guy is likely a scrote, and has not made it clear what he wants out of the situation. When that happens, it's a sign to leave.  This happened to me quite a bit. I ditched 3 guys in 3 months because of this. And I'm glad I did. By some miracle of God, I found my very HV fiancé. FINALLY I didn't feel any of the stress and uncertainty. For the first time, me AND the guy were equally putting in effort. After 2 years, there hasn't been a time where I felt like I wasn't getting what I'm giving.   My point being, a true HV man will not leave you scratching your head, wondering what you did or what you guys are. There will be nothing to over think, because he won't leave you uncertain at any point. It took me 5+ years to realize that uncertainty was a red flag. And it took me 10+ years to find a man who made me realize that it _is_ possible to not ever feel that way. Keep your head up, and be as picky as possible!😘❤	1641157216.0	hqze5cr	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqze5cr/
evbocv42	I had a scrote who texted me night and day until we met up. Then he kept wanting to hang out but “doesn’t text” and would call me randomly with no heads up at all. Ok, so I started calling him. He picked up maybe 50% of the time. Then on dates, he would be texting and calling people even though he would make me wait days sometimes. I point blank asked him 2 times if he still wanted to date and he was very adamant about it. I gave up after the second time. I don’t need to ask at all. Sketchy af.

5eyjl40e	I knew from single digits I wanted to be married and happy, and also knew from single digits that I never wanted kids. Back in the 70s and 80s, parenthood and esp motherhood was worshiped and glorified, and saying ANYTHING negative about it brought swift social reprisals, so immediately my INTJ antennae went up, and that bullshit radar kept going off. If it was so wonderful, why were any and all negative comments squelched with such force and anger? Not logical. Just like that IG post I saw recently: female submission isn't natural; if it were natural, there wouldn't need to be centuries of sermons on it. It would just be.   I have such contempt for men like this on every single level possible.	1641159668.0	hqzk1jn	t3_rsih6h	t1_hqut4ci	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rsih6h/yeah_yeah_i_know_the_answer_is_just_to_leave_but/hqzk1jn/

A lot of working class men stay fit cause that’s all they have to offer, and when they save enough, or buy a house- hello beer gut!   It’s a matter of values and lifelong habits, and most of all, respect for your partner.

a500fd6w	Even in my most pickme days as a full-time and then part-time SAHM/WAHM, I knew that if his job required 10 hours of work each day (I added commute time as well), then MY work day was ALSO 10 hours too, and as soon as he walked thru the front door, house/childcare work was 50/50. Weekends are 50/50. Holidays are 50/50.  I believe in 50/50 in marriage. But I mean a REAL 50/50 partnership, not this BS "man works 8 hours, comes home and relaxes while his wife works 24/7". Whenever the man is at home, he is responsible for 50% of the work, no arguments. And mowing the lawn for 2 hours every other Saturday only covers 2 hours of my time doing laundry or washing dishes. Not a whole week's worth.   I didn't quite achieve this is my home. Frankly, it became a chore in itself to instruct him what to do (even though he was generally willing to do it). So I left. Now I don't stress over making to-do lists and the loads of laundry and dishes are smaller (I also have a contractor to mow the lawn!).   SAHM is the only true full-time job in the word. No man's job can compete. Only a full partnership will do, or kick him to the curb.	1641160493.0	hqzm5yp	t3_rui8on	t3_rui8on	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rui8on/i_work_and_pay_all_the_bills_and_she_agreed_to_it/hqzm5yp/

6qo7pl16	I feel your pain! Didn’t matter if I was cautious and respected the build-up to intimacy or jumping in and laying it all out on the table, both types of men have ended up emotionally unavailable for me in the past. A key indicator I look back on now is if they have truly been able to move on from a past heartache- what they learned, improved in themselves, and how they show up today (many may cognitively know what they want but too emotionally immature to get there). A book that really opened my eyes was He’s Scared, She’s Scared. At the end of the day we can only change ourselves and it helped me to unpack the ways my own emotional unavailability and insecure attachment was rearing it’s ugly head again. I 100% believe that we can be pushed backwards not forwards with the wrong people in our lives and knowing when to walk away, early and often, is key. I also really liked the Dance of Intimacy as well as the Dance of Anger which I read first as I struggled to own my own anger and express it due to being raised by narcissists. In the end, trust yourself, you’ve got this!	1641160520.0	hqzm8fc	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzm8fc/

5eyjl40e	As an older woman, I'm not a fan of aloofness even in the beginning, and I'll tell you why. I speak only for myself, and YMMV. I know that when I met men who were handsome, perfectly nice, and with whom I got along -- but the spark just wasn't there -- I was aloof. I knew without knowing even in young pickme days that they weren't my person, so I held back all of me, knowing they couldn't handle all of me. Sure enough, they could not at all handle all of me, and breakups ensued.  With Jack, late beloved second husband, we were full-on from the beginning, all cards on the table, nothing held back, and it was glorious. I have a thing I do to vet, where I tend to pepper men with lots of questions, have side conversations/digressions, make connections to things they've said before, make literary allusions, etc. Think Tony Stark: that intensity, that quickness. Jack handled it, and matched me, and loved it. There's the spark, and it just never stopped until his last breath.   I posit that you're aloof because you just don't feel it. I used to get so frustrated because I asked people, how did you know you wanted to marry? They'd say, "You just know," with a shrug. It took me decades to realize they weren't holding back; they simply couldn't articulate all the tiny details that went on, and I can't, either, but it really is true. There's that bone-deep sense of rightness, knowing, alignment, vibing together, and you WANT to open up completely, because the other person truly sees you and loves every part of you.	1641160692.0	hqzmo8b	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzmo8b/

9f513x5h	If they tell you you're the "one" after taking breaks because they are not sure, they are not the "one". There is no "one". That is a mindset that will get your divorced.  You make a decision and you work on it. Full stop. If the cost exceeds the gain, you leave them.  I took a break from someone last year because I wanted space to get into therapy. I didn't want to be in therapy and also navigating a relationship. Sometimes timing is just as important as making a choice.	1641161264.0	hqzo4xm	t3_rudjb7	t3_rudjb7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rudjb7/say_no_to_breaks_and_open_relationships/hqzo4xm/
a500fd6w	This woman wants out desperately and feels utterly trapped. Why does she feel like she can't leave when that's what she clearly wants more than anything else? Oh idk, maybe because she has no job, income and little kids to take care of.   This is why we do not rely on a man's money and stop working after having children. They call SAH wives "dependents" for a reason.	1641161563.0	hqzowjc	t3_ruee4g	t3_ruee4g	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruee4g/why_she_doesnt_care_for_him_during_sex/hqzowjc/
9f513x5h	This, I agree. Problem is that men do not think that Tom is muscular, when he is. They think that they need to look like Chris, then they moan about how women have unrealistic expectations. Heck, you could look like Zach Braff and still be healthy, but instead of thinking, I just need to lose 20lbs and exercise and get a secure job, they think, I need to be a beast and drive a Tesla and be the CEO or else women will think I'm a loser.   It's actually men and their toxic bulls- that make other men feel like losers. So instead they give up and join the cult of who could care less and they marry women with low standards and resent them, because they really want more from life.	1641161568.0	hqzowz9	t3_ru3tku	t1_hqz8c43	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3tku/what_happens_to_mens_physical_appearance_when/hqzowz9/

He had the audacity to ask her to "wait for him" while he "sowed his wild oats" and promised he'd come back. Everyone around her in her religious, rural community was convinced this was a good idea and she should wait for him to stop being tempted by the devil and come back to her. Did I mention he was the reverend's son?  Anyway, the story ended with her realizing her worth, falling in love with a billionaire hotel owner, and starting her own business despite everyone around her telling her she wasn't good enough and it would all come crashing down eventually.

rfx840y	This happened to my friend. She found out she was pregnant with his son when she was only 17.  He was WAAAAY  older (he was in his 20’s when they met) than her and had multiple baby mamas who he never sees once they become pregnant. He has never met any of his babies. He just moves on to be with another child-free woman and leaves them to move they get pregnant. That is his game.  The really sad part of it all is that,  every year and holiday, he writes letters and pictures to his father asking the mother to give it to his father and she doesn’t know what to do. Sometimes, when we meet up, she shows us his drawings/letters, and our group ends buying him candy and toys telling him that it’s from us to try and distract him.	1641162304.0	hqzqtcz	t3_ruj11l	t3_ruj11l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruj11l/my_sister_is_dating_a_guy_who_lied_about_having/hqzqtcz/

I'm also in lightly dating a man I met, who works short stints interstate and may eventually go home to his home country. He's talked about living back in my state where we met. While I like him, I know as soon as he makes potential plans to leave, I'll cut contact because his actions would say he wasn't interested in me long term, or saw me as a holiday romance.

6d8ffmgl	No, I totally get it. A few years ago, I briefly dated a man that I thought was my own age...only to discover that he was in his mid-20s. He had prematurely greying hair and didn't take care of his skin, so he looked at least 10 years older than his actual age. Skincare notwithstanding, he was a great guy...but I couldn't get past the age gap. We were in totally different life stages. I'd cook for him at my apartment, and he'd show up for the meal like a college kid coming to Sunday lunch at his aunt's house.   Our age gap was only mid-20s to early 30s. I can't even imagine the mindset of someone my age who'd go after a teen or young adult.

I lost my shit and left immediately. He tried to call me non stop and beg for my forgiveness asking for another chance and how “I’m so mature for my age” and that I wouldn’t have given him a chance or slept with him if I knew his real age.  He’s right, I wouldn’t have given up my body to a man 20 years older than me.

b2fueeui	I'm so thankful that he backed out and pulled the "I'm not ready for a relationship" bs card for your sake. This guy is a complete joke. You deserve so much better than to build up some loser who's already taking you for granted.  Why would you date down? You seem to be at a completely different level than him. He'd never thank you for helping him out (which you'd end up doing a lot of), he'd just resent you and you'd end up even more miserable than now.  He never had a girlfriend despite being in his late 20's? There's probably a reason for it (either he's a pos or just strings women along just like he's trying with you - or - more likely, both)  Lives with his mom and it seems to be a long term situation and not just a sudden thing where he has to stay somewhere temporarily to get back on his feet? Yeah, no thanks...  Doesn't have his shit together? He shouldn't be dating.  Severe mental health problems? He shouldn't be dating.  This guy just shouldn't be even attempting to date at this moment, he should focus on himself his and figure his problems/life out. He even said it himself, so why tf is he on apps?  You have better things to do than to be one of many women this clown uses for an ego boost.

3zohrjth	The moment I realised the lengths a HVM will go to make sure a woman he's interested in feels that interest and feels secure is the moment I realised how relatively easy it is to cut out a large proportion of men in the dating scene. A man who tries to triangulate you with another women, doesn't respond the texts or call back, tells you he wants to "see where it goes", they're all coming from the same place and that is they're not serious and don't respect you/women.

a500fd6w	Don't date men who feel that they are "behind in life". My NVX was like this. He made personal, relationship, employment and financial choices that slowed his progression through normal adult life stages. I made the mistake of interpreting these are "bad luck" or "following a dream", but really they were the result of short-sightedness, impulsivity and the inability to plan and make goals for the future.  Men like this start looking at everything and everyone as a "shortcut" to get ahead. It is all about their ego and how they think the world perceives him. Once they feel that they've gotten as far as they can go with a woman, they will start looking around for the next ~~woman~~ stepping stone.  HVM (and HV people in general) make goals for themselves and have a specific future in mind. They don't let past mistakes define them, and they don't make the people around them pay for those mistakes, either. If he makes you feel badly because you are at a place in life that he wants to be and makes you feel poorly about it instead of praising you and sincerely asking for (and acting on) advice to get there on his own, he's a user.	1641163864.0	hqzuu10	t3_rukyak	t3_rukyak	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hqzuu10/
b2fueeui	Could be a potential vetting strategy as well.   I was on a date once and the guy refused to tell me his age, telling me I should have remembered it (I vaguely met him months prior that date). Them I jokingly said I should have just asked to see his ID instead of this convo and he said he would have never showed me anyway.   One of many red flags. Should have been an instant block after that date, because this behaviour is just straight up weird.

4nm98s2k	Yeah I've noticed they basically match the opposite of my energy. If I'm not invested yet and don't care if they come or go because I don't know them yet, that's when they're begging me to invest and commit, lecturing me about how I have to stop talking to other guys, etc. Then once I accept their demands and fully concentrate on them, they go cold and ignore me. Then they are almost like "who are you again? I didn't ask you for anything". There was a guy who, while I was still being careful, told me he was making plans for the future including me, then once I trusted him, he made other plans to live somewhere else entirely that did not include me, without telling me. He had no intention to tell me about it, I just found out because of small talk here and there. He was just going to stop texting me, without an explanation. And this is after he was so dramatic and manipulative at the start.  In fact, I don't know if that's an avoidant thing, but I've noticed that once they make the decision in their head that they no longer want a relationship, they do not feel the need to tell you. It's like they're all about themselves. I had a boyfriend (embarrassing) who got frustrated that I didn't want to go on a trip to visit him (because it was inconvenient for me or whatever), and he decided he couldn't accept getting turned down, and instead of breaking up with me, he just blocked me without an explanation. So he went from pressuring me to go on this trip to visit him, and after I politely said no, he just blocked me and even held big resentment against me for not going. Once they no longer need what they were getting from you, they drop you without telling you, even if they're the reason they no longer want you.  I don't know, but I think they're like addicts. They are pursuing whatever they feel in the moment will satisfy their needs. Maybe they're going through a bad time and a girlfriend makes them feel good. They'll pursue you and say anything to convince you because they want to satisfy their needs urgently. They even get fixated like only this girl can do it. Then later maybe they no longer have that need, maybe now they want to start a new career, they have some other new need. Don't ask them to be self-aware. They've heard of men doing this, but they never think they are doing this. They think they're the good man and their needs are the only truth anyway. They don't feel the need to tell you when they move on. They are not the kind to care about another person's needs ever. A husband should care about others.	1641164732.0	hqzx1d0	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzx1d0/

1b8shxax	Yep. This has remained one truth throughout my almost 5 decades on this rock. If a guy really likes you, and he’s emotionally stable enough to have a healthy relationship with, he will let you know from the get-go he wants to know you and he will respect you, your time and your space while doing so. It’s a good thing so many of them fail to keep their charades going and let us know early on who they are and what they’re about. My pet peeve is selfish men, the minute they display that their existence revolves around them, their wants, fantasies, expectations, etc, I’m outta there. Once you get with a truly giving man who understands that the term relationship is a verb, and life fails to stop being all about them, you can’t go back to anything less. I’ve never had anyone care about me the way my boyfriend does, he’s in this for the long haul and he lets me know every day.	1641165045.0	hqzxtou	t3_ruie6a	t1_hqzm5io	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzxtou/
7xkpkrcd	I have the same aversion : to barely-an-adult men because I put myself in their shoes and to older men because they're perverted and can't take a hint. I would find it repulsive to even touch an (-)18(+) year old < "mentally still a kid" person. I prefer people my age, + or -4 years at most.    It makes my skin crawl. I remember how gross those teachers that abused male students really are. Yeah, I understand teenage boys are horny etc but this doesn't mean an adult should profit off their mental immaturity. Men need to stop seeing sex as always a good thing, they need to cease glorifying it. I'm disgusted because I had a male friend in high school that later disclosed to me he was having sex with his literature teacher. We were in highschool, 17 year olds. He was the typical horny boy. The lit teacher was his mother's age 🤮 and married. He bragged to me and to his friends about his sexual endeavours. The idiot was groomed to think he was doing some conquest but in reality he was being used by a predator.	1641165064.0	hqzxvgl	t3_ruhmdd	t3_ruhmdd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruhmdd/age_gap_gross_out/hqzxvgl/

3kh4c	My last ex was like this: “I want to be wooed too”. I thought, ok fine we can woo eachother. That experience taught me the hard way that there’s only room for one person to be pursued in a relationship, and I need to be that person.   Spoiled men will cry and try to get into an intellectual debate with me about this need, but it’s physiological. Being wooed = sexy, turns me on, makes my vagina wet. Wooing = Turn off, makes my vagina seal up. Not every woman is like this. Some love pursuing.   Side note: Too many men were raised in households where they witnessed their mothers bend over backwards to make their fathers happy, whether they deserved it or not. So they grow up and think “my mom catered to my father all of the time, so I deserve that treatment too.” Ok sure, if you consistently add and never subtract value to my life for years then yes, I will make sure you always know exactly how much I appreciate you.	1641165437.0	hqzyt7h	t3_ruie6a	t1_hqztud8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hqzyt7h/

There's more than one in that town and the name is not on my scrubs, I never wear my place of work on my clothes.

1b8shxax	I think clingy is an unfair term. To me, it’s a place of questioning your mental health because the person you’re involved with isn’t meeting your needs. It took me a long time to realize that I wasn’t “clingy”, I was just with emotionally avoidant men time and time again who made me feel insecure. For me, the key was finding a man who wanted the same as I did (commitment, honesty, lots of time together, lots of mutual respect and willingness to dip our toes into each others’ passions, finding new ones together, etc). Some “relationship rescue” type websites out there will claim that women don’t want a man who needs us, wants lots of time with us, can be vulnerable with us. They claim we will get turned off by that. I think that’s a sweeping generalization. After decades of being with men who were the opposite, I realize the importance of being with someone who wants and loves the way you do. Push-pull dynamics are soul deafening and absolute hell. I will never go through that hell with a man ever again. If they are avoidant, they will likely remain that way. Save yourself the torture and find a man who is willing to wear his heart on his sleeve. I have never once been put off my my boyfriend’s vulnerabilities. Maybe time taught me that, maybe in my 20s I would have been, but now I would never want anything less than his absolute devotion to me and the life we are creating together. I’m so damn relieved I don’t have to try ever again to get a man to want the same kind of relationship I do.	1641166249.0	hr00vu7	t3_ruie6a	t1_hqzjc8v	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr00vu7/

I wouldnt be surprised if she was raised super religious where gay people are the devil.   But I do know that:  1) She does like sex because she still engages in it  2) She's not bothered about being single because it seems she absolutely despises this guy and clearly does not love him - I dont think you get to that point when your straight because in the back of your mind you know you have "other options" - She doesnt see other options because she does not want him and does not want to replace him.   3) Everything she is doing is coming from a place of "duty"   Obviously will never find out if im right but that's what im reading.	1641166267.0	hr00xi0	t3_ruee4g	t3_ruee4g	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruee4g/why_she_doesnt_care_for_him_during_sex/hr00xi0/

Even the LVM who are employed will present pipe dreams as actual plans. It's hard for a young woman to understand, it would look so foolish if women did the same. It turns into another way that men can look down on women for being "basic", and future fake or delay commitment.  🤡 Can you even imagine how people would react to a woman who has new life plans every few months, never takes any initiative, and runs her mouth about them nonstop?	1641166349.0	hr014tq	t3_rugays	t3_rugays	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rugays/90_day_allegation_against_syngin_and_social/hr014tq/

The right man for you isn’t going to make you wonder, he’s not going to be avoidant, and he’ll be clear about his own intentions and expectations.   What you’re describing sounds a bit bread crumby, and honestly you’ll absolutely know when a guy is really into you. He’d make it obvious through his words, actions, and lack of excuses.

2lraptay	all that power comes into play when the wife has children, the husband knows he can manipulate the wife into a constant cycle of yearning for his approval by gaslighting her about 'not being a good enough mother'. in previous generations women had no other choice but to stay in unhappy abusive marriages just to keep the children happy. marital rape wasnt even a thing. we have a generation of men who can no longer rely on societal and cultural pressure to find a wife. men dont respect women at all, they dont respect the work women put into childcare/cooking/cleaning because they think its easy  a married man with a child would never go to another man and ask him to take care of all the chores in return for a 'free room and 3 meals a day' because he knows the man will want MONEY. its a common pattern in men, when they have kids and their partner/wife/gf leaves them they wil hunt for a young naive pretty woman to bring into the house, not because he loves her but he wants someone to do all the 'woman work' around the house to keep it running	1641167350.0	hr03o62	t3_rui8on	t3_rui8on	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rui8on/i_work_and_pay_all_the_bills_and_she_agreed_to_it/hr03o62/

8exjxgl7	You may think you’re mature for your age, at the height of your beauty, and simply irresistible for these reasons, but I promise you—you will see things far differently in hindsight. Older men who go after barely legal women are PREDATORS. They are going after you BECAUSE you don’t know what manipulation looks like. They’re going after you because you’re eager to please and easy to impress. They’re going for you because they want to feel powerful.   In my grandmother’s generation it may have been normal to date someone 8-10 years younger, but it certainly isn’t now. Times have changed.

No the “with you” is silent and they’re still going to try to meet women with lower standards to have sex with. He’s not some simpleton you can save. He’s a man with his own agenda.

3kh4c	what i've learned is i have to treat every public space i'm in as if i'm an outdoor cat that's always looking out for threats. walking in public means keeping your head on a swivel. expect and anticipate threats to your safety and you won't be caught off guard by one.   make it second nature to identify and observe every single person in your vicinity everywhere you go **before they identify and observe you**. your instincts will tell you who is safe to smile at and who is not. after an initial thorough scan, immediately do a second rescan of the area. predators are sitting and waiting for women to prey on, and they will often see you before you see them (because they're waiting and looking for prey). when they see you initially notice them, they will 'act normal'. that's why an immediate second scan is necessary: they won't be expecting you to observe them again in such a short time period. re-scan the area every few minutes.   this requires you to avoid activities that would hinder your sense of sight or hearing (texting/scrolling your phone, reading, using your laptop, or using headphones). without these senses, you are extremely vulnerable and you should never obstruct both of them at the same time (don't ever scroll your phone while wearing headphones).	1641168117.0	hr05kfw	t3_rswsqr	t3_rswsqr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rswsqr/looking_men_in_the_eye_and_being_receptive_vs/hr05kfw/

6f4orzzc	Your aloofness may be working against you, and I say this as a fellow-reserved woman. Avoidant men are attracted to women they perceive as somewhat unavailable because, if the relationship progresses, they believe they can continue being avoidant without consequences. Of course, the conflict starts when he wants more emotional labor and you want more investment.   If you really like the guy and want to put off avoidants, be as engaged as you can. Answer texts  and calls right away, pay full attention when he’s speaking, when he does something you want/enjoy, give him little laughs and touches. An emotionally open and mature man will love that and escalate and an avoidant, other than the most narcissistic asshats, will show themselves as, well, avoidant. The trash takes itself out. If it doesn’t, you move on without warning.   Guys are humans too. From talking to the ones in my family and friend circle, they sometimes say to themselves, “If *she* wanted to, *she* would.”	1641168375.0	hr067kv	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr067kv/

8w9ask4b	To the women putting OP down, when a single boy grows up with his mother,  who he puts on a pedestal, while holding a negative view of his father, and does not establish his own identity and does not emotionally and physically separate himself, his life, and his interests from his mother, then his future girlfriend/wife will never come first.  You don't have to agree that every single son of a single mother is a non-self-differentiated mother enmeshed man.   Even OP isn't saying that or putting single mothers down.   She's saying that we need to pay attention to men who were raised in such environments, because their relationship with their mothers may be unhealthy (which isn't always apparent until a woman wants to marry him, and "suddenly" he has commitment and sexual attraction issues).  If you're here saying, "Yea, but some HV men were raised by a single mother. And I know many LV and NV men that have two parents....," then how are you any different than the ones crying, "Not all men!" and "Women are also abusive!"??

He seemed very genuine and was very vulnerable with me while we were getting to know each other so I chose to believe him at the time. Clearly unstable men... Are unstable and won't take the actions to heal themselves the way that I would have in his position. I guess I thought he was genuine which would mean he wouldn't be one to go look everywhere for casual sex. He made it seem like he never had a gf because if his anxiety and not being sure how to proceed with a girl. I just thought he was awkward.   "Honestly he saved you from yourself", I'm not exactly sure how I'm supposed to interpret that.

56gfp8ta	I used to have this issue but you have to learn to handle it then and there. I also work in a male dominated field. You have to learn to protect your space and handle interactions like this. Best case scenario, its cultural, and worst case, someone is pushing your boundaries to test and groom you for something far worse. I’m not being dramatic. It has happened to me and other women I personally know.  Examples: I had a foreign coworker who was a little too huggy and would even sometimes touch my ears because he thought it was funny. I told him in no uncertain terms that he was making me uncomfortable. Even though I was laughed at and called a “cold American” I just said sure lets just accept thats who I am and deadpan stared at him until he stopped laughing. If he did it again, I would openly say “do not touch me.” I also began casually bringing it up to other people in the workplace. It stopped.  Ive also had male colleagues stand inappropriately close to me when I’m explaining something or demonstrating something. I will stop talking and move away and then continue. I dont care if its awkward or it affects how they see me. First and foremost is my personal well being; not my job or whatever they think they could do to me.	1641169953.0	hr0a2wa	t3_rugzi7	t3_rugzi7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rugzi7/being_polite_to_a_fault/hr0a2wa/

2ngg36dl	The break-up-reapproach-with-lower-bar tactic is really common and manipulative almost to the point of outright emotional abuse imo. The idea is to wait until you're somewhat emotionally dependent on them,  then hurt you,  make you miss them  - hoping it'll soften you up enough that you'll accept less from them than you were willing to accept before when they come back around. Like denying someone water hoping they'll get desperate enough to drink piss.	1641170577.0	hr0bltn	t3_rudjb7	t1_hqzlmdc	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rudjb7/say_no_to_breaks_and_open_relationships/hr0bltn/

62w5unq8	She’s not saying you were bragging. It’s a subconscious behaviour women have been conditioned with, to prove they are worthy for a man to choose her. Basically, you inadvertently explain and justify yourself to him as to why he should pick you.  We all need to unlearn that Pick Me behaviour at some stage, as it is the man that needs to court and prove himself a worthy partner.   This guy was clearly manipulating you to feel sorry for him for an easy fuck. You thought he was struggling and wanted to nurture and rebuild him (work on this, you are not barb the builder). He is not struggling, he just wants to hookup, which is why he was back on OLD.   He settles for pity fucks because to a LVM, a fuck is a fuck. At least he didn’t string you along and told you straight up he doesn’t want a relationship. What he didn’t say out loud was that he just wants easy fucks.  Learn from this and NEVER give LVM benefit of the doubt again.	1641170860.0	hr0caa8	t3_rukyak	t1_hr04kef	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hr0caa8/

8r15jxb0	Language exchange websites are basically websites where you chat with soneone in the language you want to practice. Most conversations die down due to failure to move past small talk or you come across creeps asking for your phone number.  I'm Asian. The thing about Asians is that there is sexual racism against Asian males in the West. Asian women are fetishised whereas Asian men are emasculated. It's hence easier for Asian women to "integrate" into western culture via marriage although the white husband may be some creep with yellow fever.  The thing about Asians becoming second class citizens in the West is definitely true. It doesn't matter whether you're male or female with a high-paid job in Asia and you can speak the local European language fluently. Almost all Western companies do not count work experience in Asia as work experience (unless if you're a westerner who moved to Asia as an expat and moved back to the West) so you have to start your career from scratch again.  Some of these Asians who move to the West end up in blue collar jobs while some do try to get white collar jobs. A lot of western companies also don't want hire someone who went to uni in Asia. Those who want a white collar job hence have to get a masters degree or something in the West to increase their chances of finding a white collar job in the West.  There are also wealthy Asians who just don't go to work when the move to the West. Usually these folks are old enough to retire, extremely wealthy, or just inherited a large sum of money that they can sustain on for the rest of their life. It's not a surprise that a lot of Asians who move to the West are "crazy rich Asians" with Ferraris and luxury clothes.  I think the main exceptions are occupations such as nurses. There is a shortage of nurses in many countries so finding a nursing job shouldn't be too difficult even if somebody is not educated and has no work experience in the West.	1641171551.0	hr0dxsh	t3_rssu7e	t1_hqydbka	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rssu7e/selfaware_guy_realizes_he_doesnt_take_debate/hr0dxsh/
8w9ask4b	I've learned that I don't owe anyone my eye contact or a "Hi," and especially not at a local park or gym.  There are men that literally hang out at local parks, gyms, coffee shops, and other co-ed spaces on a daily basis waiting to speak to a particular woman that caught their eye. Even normal looking guys do this!   I found out the hard way that men will literally insert themselves into your field of view, do things like:* 1. Pretend like they're regulars at a local coffee shop, so that they can talk to you again and again. [The truth is that he lives over 1.5 hours away, but he met you once when he stopped by the store when he was driving through the area. He figured that you must be a regular (i.e., based on your belongings, and by asking around nonchalantly). He decided that he must speak to you again (because you were nice and replied to his questions), so he's been chilling at this coffee shop, in some random town, just to hit on you. ... This guy will give you his number and leave you alone.  2. Pretend like, "Ooops, he bumped into you at the local park again! What a coincidence!" ... No. No, again this is not a coincidence, but this guy doesn't want to believe that you don't care about him. You said "Hi" to him, and looked into his eyes. You chit chatted with him, like you did with everyone else. The problem here is that he is a covert abuser. He is a stalker. He asks others about you when you're not around. You will need to get a restraining order to get rid of this guy. He still won't leave with a restraining order. You will no longer want to go to your favorite local park after all of the trauma. You realize just how much effort he put into all these "chance" occurrences.   *True events to a T.   It took me way too long to realize that predatory men are hungry for someone to treat them like a person, so they're out in public waiting for an opportunity.   Remember that a HV man will not be offended if you don't say, "Hi" or make eye contact with him.   You're safer meeting men in other ways and places, where you can get to know their character.	1641171654.0	hr0e6op	t3_rswsqr	t3_rswsqr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rswsqr/looking_men_in_the_eye_and_being_receptive_vs/hr0e6op/
3kxxomjd	This. I was a secure attached buying the bullshit and consuming typical relationship "advice." I self-diagnosed (🤡) as anxious attached, and looked up how not to be clingy, when the men simply did not fancy me nor respect me as a human being. They dumped me whether or not I "clung" to them from the anxiety they caused. In the past, when I felt "secure" and gave space, I was still dealing with the disappearing act and just dumped slower. In the "secure" scenario, my friends and family were worried for me because I would go weeks without seeing this one lad. I believed he loved me and his excuses were legitimate (🤡). This behavior is especially selfish and a mindeff because they want access to benefits like attention/advice, so they will reassure you through text then bail on plans.   Although (not formally diagnosed) avoidant attached men have seemed narcissistic, withholding, and soul crushing to me, they are less dreadful than a controlling anxious-attached man (with whom there is zero attraction on my side, lol).

15guc4	Aye but it’s the emotional thing - she obviously does not even connect with this guy on an emotional level, so even when he’s trying to “communicate” to get sex, her primary action is “who TF are you? Ewww no” - like, doesn’t even fake interest in improving things.   But as I say I’ll never know!

7djs5tcj	I knew a few people freshman year of college who were trying to date someone back home who was in their senior year of high school.  None of those relationships survived past freshman year, not just because of the physical distance but the emotional distance as well.   High school and college are different worlds. I can't imagine a college senior dating a high schooler.  I had a 20-year old cousin dating a 16-year old. Nobody in my family talks to him anymore. There was a lot wrong with him.	1641172162.0	hr0fehu	t3_ruhmdd	t1_hqz3pwr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruhmdd/age_gap_gross_out/hr0fehu/

5bc6by3l	What I mean by “he saved you from yourself” is that by leaving, he saved you from wasting more time on him. It seems he effectively manipulated you. When a woman is in that deep, especially with a man objectively beneath their league, it usually takes something outrageous, or the man leaving her, for her to let go.   I apologize if my post came out harsh or brash. Clearly he knew what he was doing, but never underestimate a man’s entitlement to random hook ups, especially when they’re single.	1641172277.0	hr0foaf	t3_rukyak	t1_hr08w7o	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hr0foaf/

Back in my pickme days I was in a situationship with a LVM for 6 years. He lied about (by never mentioning) his daughter for 4 of those years. The next year he tried to use serious emotional manipulation to get me to commit a felony for him. 🤡 Please impress upon her these type of men are very dangerous.

4qrd1k4w	Sis, read the handbook, this is textbook scrote behaviour. And let me just add: as someone who is also in their late 20's, I can say with the utmost confidence that we are too old to be falling for this shit 😂  You're doing so well. SO well! I have a sneaking suspicion that you maybe haven't spent much time in the dating world (and especially the *online* dating world) since your breakup. Trust me, there are good men out there, but the vast majority are shitty in *comically* similar ways.  For every scrote like this, there are thousands and thousands more. He's not special. What you had with him wasn't special. We've all been there. I've been there too. Showing up to a date just to listen to the dude trauma-dump and try to manipulate you with sob stories, the nOt bEiNg rEaDy fOr a ReLatIoNsHiP, all of it. Leave him in the dust, read the handbook, memorize (I mean it) all these red flags, spend a few more months on FDS, and THEN give dating a try, if you'd still like.  And remember that if he starts with any bullshit behaviour, block him. Stop replying. If you're with him in person, say you have to go to the restroom and straight-up leave the restaurant. You cut these losers off the SECOND they start acting up.  You've got your life together, you don't have time for this shit. You are too good for him.  I promise you're not alone. We're here for you on your journey.   Godspeed sis 😘	1641172912.0	hr0h6wc	t3_rukyak	t3_rukyak	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hr0h6wc/

And the gift of my presence!"  You will be paying them allimony. They are scared boys who refuse to progress and then blame you, even though he always finds a woman's house to live in.

I don't want to be known as "that paranoid one" at work, so I was thinking to myself, I would accept the sweater, but keep it in my car and only wear it AT work, never anywhere else.

Thing is, this young woman is also a PickMe because she makes endless excuses for her sh\*tty BF and she's religious so "Oh he *does so much"* "*I'm such a sinner"* ***\[cringe\]***   Don't get me started on how he's an ex-con...  I've tried telling her "you roll your eyes when you speak about him and he gives you sh\*t...I don't think he's treating you well" and she backpedals and is like "well, *it is what it is.*" A rage inducing phrase.

dw5w2mrq	Well, you aren't wrong, except that it can make advancing more difficult. Or, for me, I want to be seen as impartial (as much as possible) in case I need to report male employees, or if I become worried that a resident is being abused. This has not happened at my facility, BUT it is something I think about, and we (luckily) do not have very many male employees. If my coworkers saw me as paranoid about being stalked or as untrusting of men in general, a situration arose where I needed to make a complaint or raise concerns, I would not want my opinions to get in the way of my resident's safety.  This is all my inner monologue and has not been expressed to anyone. It's unlikely, but it happens and I keep an eye out.	1641174675.0	hr0lfbw	t3_rujfgi	t1_hr0kpwu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rujfgi/fds_wisdom_prevents_disaster/hr0lfbw/

cgck7xuc	I used to experience this a lot in my past dating endeavours. It sometimes brought me to a point where I would doubt myself and think I might be the problem.   Thankfully I know now how to vet better and I agree that when men come off as too casual or use sentences like “I just want to see where this is going” it’s to me a clear sign of them being avoidant.   I’ve started to ask men directly from the get-go what they are looking for. Many are taken aback and give me vague answers. That’s when I decide that there will be no further dates. Not foul-proof as people certainly lie about their intentions but often you’d get a gut-feeling if someone is sincere or not.	1641171448.0	hr0dp51	t3_ruie6a	t1_hqze5cr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr0dp51/
16piab	A man’s distancing may also be in response to a woman’s behavior and vibe changing as the connection deepens. Often, we start out being carefree but once our bonding hormones are triggered (I don’t even kiss a guy until he’s vetted, cause oxytocin is a bitch in heat lol), we become invested too soon. Men take time to bond, even when strongly attracted to us. Go slow.

I never let myself be vulnerable like that before with guys because I always regretted it, but with him, it just spilled out easily. And he didn't make me feel weird about it or regret it. He just accepted it as a part of me. That's when I knew I had found someone different.

gtpp4	Reddit started as a very male-dominated site and really pretty 4chan adjacent as far as content goes. Starting 6 years ago when they brought in Ellen Pao as CEO briefly, they started banning more immoral subs and trying to clean up the site.   While there was certainly nice and funny content too, like aww or instantregret, there was also a LOT a lot of terrible shit on reddit when I joined seven years ago. We're talking necrophilia, snuff, shock and gore, open racism etc. More porn than you could shake a stick at... like half porn.   I know there is still plenty of racism kicking around but I mean like there was just a subreddit called n-words.   It has been on a steady path towards mainstream sanitization since then. Porn and misogynistic subreddits are some of the last to go because our culture (and the largely male staff) doesn't take misogyny very seriously. Still, I have noticed a steady increas in the female presence on reddit. (When I joined, anyone I talked to automatically assumed I was male.)  There has been steady backlash to feminist subs. Men are quick to complain and call it "man-hating" and "discriminatory". But I think the cultural tide is on our side. And I think it would be possible to establish more feminist subs.   FDS has been so successful because of their keeping female mods only and working hard to only allow female commenters. Subs like 2X get co-opted by male moderators who are then able to change the culture of the sub and control what gets seen. FDS has also had good discipline about anti-brigading rules and anonyminity, which help keep the subs reputation from being smeared.   If you look around the rest of reddit, you'll see people talk mad shit about FDS and make up all sorts of lies about it. You have to be disciplined and clearly-above board to dodge that kind of mud-slinging. I feel any feminist subreddit would get the same reaction once it was big enough for people to notice it.  Speaking of getting bigger, look at how much work it is for the FDS moderators to handle now that the sub is this big. That's why and how male mods slip into other subs--they needed the help and let anyone who was interested in. Even liberal / "ally" men are not that good at protecting women's interests.  Moderating is a key piece for any new subs to succeed.	1641175880.0	hr0ocgv	t3_ruk8x1	t3_ruk8x1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruk8x1/new_to_reddit_and_there_needs_to_be_more_feminist/hr0ocgv/

16piab	Yes, and after reading about the men who trade pictures of their wives and girlfriends with other men online-often without the woman’s knowledge, I believe it’s a good idea to have a “no phone in the room” policy if there’s a chance your clothes may be coming off. It’s what escorts do, and seems wise considering what’s at stake. And just another good reason to make sure a man’s head over heels and cherishes you or is otherwise vetted if you’re looking only for sex, before getting naked with him.	1641175266.0	hr0mv9y	t3_rul2wn	t1_hqztcl0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr0mv9y/

4qrd1k4w	LOL gurl you really triggered the scrotes with this one: 12 comments and only 2 showing hahahahaha 😂  I agree though - and we get shamed so hard for having standards. Just tonight I was at work; one of my coworkers had just had a baby (roughly a year ago). She asked me about my holidays & I mentioned a movie marathon on the 25th. I'm telling you, for a moment she looked like she was going to cry, and launched into how she hasn't had a moment to herself since her son was born. Just so defeated and sad... and then immediately started asking about my love life, and whether I had "found" someone yet, because I'd "better have kids soon" (with some noticeable resentment in her voice). SIS WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING AT, your life is breaking-mom 😂  It was such a weird interaction, but she was honestly a lot nicer about it than most. Women married to LVM are the worst. They're angry at their scrotes but have to shove it down, so it bubbles to the surface when they see a woman that *didn't* settle.  I love my life. I'm not swapping my peace and joy for cleaning the skidmarks out of some entitled spunk-nozzle's underwear.	1641181081.0	hr10fx1	t3_ruqx4w	t3_ruqx4w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr10fx1/

I haven't spent a lot of time in the dating app world or dating world since my breakup lol. It was literally the first guy I connected with. I get a lot of matches but they make it obvious that they aren't worth my time. I haven't dated in years... Was with a narcissist for a while then spent the last year healing myself from that mess. He must be insecure and getting validation from women who are doing better in life then him... Then runs away like a child as they know they aren't good enough.

2lraptay	marriage could be a magical thing if men just did their share of the chores and childcare. theres alot of married women who are doing everything alone, they have the wedding ring and husband but ultimately they would have been better off just ordering sperm online and getting pregnant using a turkey baster and the sperm in the mail  men have so much freedom in the patriarchy and marriage, just work a 9 to 5 and you'll get homecooked meals 3 times a day, access to a woman to have sex with whenever you want, children all taken care of, a clean house etc. men want things to stay exactly how they are. alot of my friends are women who are focusing on their careers/education. very few women really want to be stay at home mums without careers and financial independence	1641182317.0	hr136ca	t3_ruqx4w	t3_ruqx4w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr136ca/

4p06xyus	I was groomed as an 18 year old by my 32 year old boss. He told me there was no one else like me and that we should run away together. He told me so many things that made me feel like I was “special.” We didn’t actually date (because he has a much younger fiancé the whole time) but I stayed in contact with him. It was years of him trying to convince me why we should be together. Eventually I got a little older and realized how wrong and sick the situation was. I’m 33 now and although I thought he was my “friend” at the time… it makes me cringe to think of those memories.

73ngyv28	He seems like he was like in awe when I'd say something that made me attractive. For example he'd comment about how fit I am or how attractive he found my tattoos or nose ring. I obviously only got to know the nice side of him face to face so this plot twist definitely has left it up to me to add the points you're making which are likely very much the case. He's likely more insecure in a way that would make him act out to try to being me down or run away from someone who is out of his league. I mean... He's 28 and lives in his mom's basement... He even. Switched cars with his mom that night to bring me out... He said he couldn't bring me out in his car which had his sweaty gym clothes in it. SO TRUE. Own up to your shit...

8w9ask4b	How happy can you really be with someone after he lies to you about having children?   I mean, I'm unsure if there are any acceptable lies to start off with, but if so, there is still no way that lying about having children is unacceptable.   Hoping that you're sharing this thread with her, because I doubt that there is not a seed of doubt about this guy in the back of her mind.   Of course, there is a reason why fellow FDS members are asking, "What else is he lying about?" We know that this guy is not a person of integrity. He's lying about whatever he needs to, in order to keep up his image (narcissistic behavior).   Your sister must also know that he's likely hiding more from her (and will continue to do so), because that's just the type of person that he is.   She's lucky that she found out about his lie from the get-go.   No one can tell her what to do with her life, but at least you know that you did what you can.   Now it's up to her to realize that she deserves better.   Unfortunately, sometimes women (myself included) learned the hard way that we shouldn't ignore red flags.	1641184372.0	hr17l85	t3_ruj11l	t3_ruj11l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruj11l/my_sister_is_dating_a_guy_who_lied_about_having/hr17l85/

bvnm37an	It's always made me so angry how easy it is for men to get in shape. I work out so much and it doesn't pay off the way it does for them.      I have never been in a relationship where he had any interest in staying in shape/ eating healthy or working out with me. ( When at first they tried a little, but slowly strayed from most self-care)  It seems to be a phenomenon across the globe. 🤔	1641185103.0	hr192y5	t3_ru3tku	t3_ru3tku	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ru3tku/what_happens_to_mens_physical_appearance_when/hr192y5/

I've also worked an office job, Jeremy, and I know you spend half the day fucking around at your buddy's cubicle talking about some QB's ACL or the latest Michael Bay POS movie coming out.   The vast, VAST majority of men are not out working in the fields from sun up to sundown, so the claim that a SAHM is just "sitting around the house" and therefore her time and effort is worth less than a man's is laughable. If men think it's so easy, they're welcome to take over at any time.   \**crickets*\*   Yep, that's what I thought.	1641185115.0	hr193ua	t3_rui8on	t1_hqzxput	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rui8on/i_work_and_pay_all_the_bills_and_she_agreed_to_it/hr193ua/

You have time to chat or argue with strangers on the internet, but your kids are failing school? Instant turn off for me. This behavior tells me they're emotionally unavailable and dissociate from their own lives.

73ngyv28	Oh no I wouldn't have. Just saying it was an extra hit to the self esteem that someone objectively lower than me in all ways (career and looks in particular) pulled this move on me.

56wh84mz	I bought into the marriage lie and I left it hating my ex to my core. He dropped his mask 4 years into our marriage and it took me another 2 to snap out of my pickme mindset and finally leave. Towards the end he stopped communicating with me, would intentionally leave the house extremely messy for me to clean up and had overbearingly negative moods that affected my mental health.	1641186112.0	hr1b21c	t3_ruqx4w	t3_ruqx4w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1b21c/
79akltmw	I saw a meme this Christmas that basically said a magical Christmas is due to your mom's love for her family. It hit me like a slap in the face.  My NVM ex still expects me to buy presents for our children (and his grown son and his family!) and slap his name on gifts for which he would be as surprised as the kids at the contents.  I fought cancer last year. I did fuck all for him. *I* got gifts for the kids from ME. With my money. Wrapped them. Had a lovely Christmas morning with them. And when I dropped them off in the evening for his time, he sheepishly admitted that he had gotten and wrapped presents for the kids. And whined that it didn't feel like Christmas because he didn't get any (stacks of) thoughtful presents from me. He never got me anything, ever. I did the same thing some moms do which is buy and wrap my own gifts. He was so salty.  I just laughed and went home to a mimosa and bubble bath and spent the night reading some new books I got myself.  SO much LESS stressful than past Christmases.  I am raising two boys and definitely pointing out LVM behavior when I see it. I also warn them about how I am raising them and what kind of people they ought to be. I don't need their poor example of a father showing them women are supposed to do all of the emotional labor and putting in all of the effort.	1641186160.0	hr1b5ae	t3_ruqx4w	t3_ruqx4w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1b5ae/

I'm so happy your life is better scrote-free. I can't believe the audacity men have. He expects a gift from you every year but never gives you one.

56wh84mz	In hindsight I overlooked red flags because I was a pickme back then. But essentially, one day he got angry at me and started calling me names and the downhill descent began. Suddenly I was the root cause for all of the misery in his life and I had to go.   I have since realized he’s a covert narcissist and he began love bombing, devaluing, discarding and hoovering in cycles.  It was really bewildering how one moment he despised me and the next he couldn’t let me go.  He got really nasty and uncaring at the end.   I had to be the one to file for divorce, since he requested it but refused to discuss how we should move forward and how we should draft a settlement agreement to hasten the divorce. If I asked him whether he wanted to stay married instead he wouldn’t respond or express indecision. Indecision is a decision imo, if it’s not an enthusiastic YES, its a hell no.  So I just filed and let my attorneys handle it.	1641187184.0	hr1d2t7	t3_ruqx4w	t1_hr1bzv4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1d2t7/
79akltmw	Thank you! And thanks for the award, Queen that gifted it!  I DO believe the audacity, but I am older. I love hearing younger Queens take charge. I made all of the typical pickme mistakes: age gap relationship, fail to run everytime a red flag was revealed, spawned with a fuckwit, tolerated verbal/physical/emotional and finally physical abuse.  I have forgiven myself because I had an LV father and a narcissistic bipolar immature responsibility shirking mother.  Bought my boys and I a new condo that we're moving into this week. Also came into some $ that my LV ex will never know about. In the past I would probably have bailed him out of his financial mess. No Christmas decorations, but we made such good memories this holiday. It's not about stuff, it's about tradition and values.  Keep your head high, focus on your goals, and live your life according to your values. Be proud of who you're becoming for your younger self's sake.  Happy New Year, fellow Queens!	1641187209.0	hr1d4gt	t3_ruqx4w	t1_hr1cf5b	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1d4gt/

746ilbu0	This is so true.  I have a high school friend whose husband is so $h!tty that he didn't even want to buy the baby diapers or her personal hygiene stuff. He literally wanted to let the baby 💩 on itself 😭  She's still somehow convincing me marriage and children are desirable.  I'm worried about my friends. In high school we identified as feminists and made a pact to be strong  financially independent women who have our own money. A few years later both are married and totally dependent on their spouses.  And all financial accounts are joined. One is married to a seemingly HV man who mostly takes care of her. But I'm terrified that if anything happens to him she won't be able to afford to live on her own. Even he worries about this and encourages her to learn how to invest in crypto and stocks.  Both women have advanced degrees from elite universities but I think they gave up their careers to focus on their marriages. I feel like they're living in their husbands shadow. Pairing yourself up with a man really has a way of dimming your light.	1641187638.0	hr1dwf2	t3_ruqx4w	t1_hr150jj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr1dwf2/

4z5y91wa	Hi, last year I left a guy who controlled me through that damn phone because he cheated and traumatized me to the point of checking his phone sometimes twice at night 😐  Here are some.   If he has a groupchat with his friends and they send pictures of girls to each other. UGH. Gross and fucking weird. Triple or quadruple red flags if they are women you/they know irl.   If he never posts pictures of you unless you ask. Same with the never interacting, like you mentioned. Its so embarrassing bcuz I see this girl I went to highschool with tag her bf on so many posts on facebook and never does he interact with any of them. Then you go to his profile and he's super active with his friends......   If he follows his exes on social media. He wants to get back together with them 9/10 times if they're not still talking anyway.   Most important to note: People, ESPECIALLY MEN, are a reflection of their friends. If your man has friends who act a whole fool online, post misogynistic nonsense, or anything that makes you feel weird, your man is 100% partaking in the same behavior. His friends are not just "weird" so is he.   When I went through my exes messages with his friends, they literally never talked about me. His friends would ask "So you still slaying that gash?" (🤢) and he'd respond "Yeah she's cool." WHAT THE FUCK. COOL?!? We were together for 3 years and living together, and I'm a "cool gash?!?!" If you don't like his friends, you dont like him either!	1641188711.0	hr1ft9z	t3_ruskk4	t3_ruskk4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruskk4/what_classifies_as_social_media_red_flags/hr1ft9z/

He played interested suitor but he was nothing to behold.   After marriage and children, he lost his job and has very little interest in truly being a father.  She has to try to coerce him to take the children anywhere or spend time with them.  But, he has a cozy situation, she is the bread winner, he moved into the property she owned,  and is now working herself into an early grave.     He lacks social skills, is overweight, and out of shape, entitled and ...does little to help  around the home.

3mcgi	Yes!  As if these "moments of clarity" and the apology is somehow a time machine to undo what they did.  Also, I should clarify that *he* admitted he was drunk, not me surmising.  You might find this entertaining:  He mentioned more than once in this string of text messages that he "was hoping we could meet up so I could tell you all of this in person".  Because it's a last ditch effort to try to sleep with me?

v4qqb	>He’ll magically become your “knight” but reality, that fool is your nightmare.  I get hit with this type *the most* because my financial struggle is pretty out there. And I don't have a license, much less a transportation of my own. Damn sis the *minute* they hear I am broke suddenly they bust in with that "shining knight"-ness and promise me to help with this and pay for that even though I never asked.  "Don't worry I will pick you up and drop you off everyday! You just need to ask!" - uh huh, and if I agree to that "help" you suddenly can't this and can't that *unless* I give you my damn body isn't it? Sure scrote, sureeee.  I am poor, not a f\*\*king idiot.  Men who easily offer help and promise to continue to help long into the future is a red flag in itself. *Nobody* is that quick and free with their kindness - genuine kind people will take a step back, carefully consider all situations and options and give help or advice that they absolutely sure can and will do, and appropriate to *your* situation and comfort level.  Just like how men can love-bomb, they can also kindness-bomb you in a way that they don't really consider what they put their promises on, they didn't even think about the seriousness of it all - they see your weakness and just want to go in for the kill as soon as possible - hence the incredibly quick offer to "help".	1641191720.0	hr1krne	t3_rulv1u	t1_hr08je1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rulv1u/mens_reactions_to_having_their_lies_exposed/hr1krne/

I'll never forget the shit liberal fems said about us for having legit concern about how fluffy and weak liberal doctrine is and how it at best doesn't help women that much and at worst actually makes yes less safe.... Misogyny and male dominance is so strong that they have tricked even women who say they are feminists. They have relabeled the old patriarchy as "choice feminism" and changed what words mean until they mean nothing and bullied and locked us out of every space where we try to actually talk about women's reality. :(	1641192031.0	hr1l960	t3_ruk8x1	t1_hqzoyxy	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruk8x1/new_to_reddit_and_there_needs_to_be_more_feminist/hr1l960/

765eiop8	Quand is my favorite! I love him!  I finished it within a day, with breaks. Some of it was just too real: not just the things with the sh-tty “open relationship” boyfriend, but also her anguish  in trying so hard to fit the ideals she thought other people expected. And her awful sister with the unrealistic expectations in a scalding gaslight of “I’m only doing this because I love you”? Too close to home.  But the reader gets to see Anna grow and come into her own, realistically where she fights for it and isn’t bestowed some magical fix. Quan is dreamy and respectful, and a glaring f-cking contrast to Julian using Anna as an emotionless fleshlight.  The book also shows healthy male relationships.  All in all, I think it’s the darkest in the trilogy, but I still enjoyed reading it.	1641192367.0	hr1ls4n	t3_rudjb7	t1_hr1k3yk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rudjb7/say_no_to_breaks_and_open_relationships/hr1ls4n/

96sxm8fr	There were some large radical feminist ones, but they were banned by reddit as “hate speech”. Attempts to create similar ones similarly get shut down. Any type of subreddit dedicated to addressing how women are oppressed based on their sex or biology gets removed as exclusionary. For a while even subreddits dedicated to PCOS or periods were on thin ice. That’s the general climate on reddit, as well as the mainstream internet as a whole.	1641192534.0	hr1m1ap	t3_ruk8x1	t3_ruk8x1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruk8x1/new_to_reddit_and_there_needs_to_be_more_feminist/hr1m1ap/

88zmpwbq	Still waters run *dupe.*  I dated a few of those. I'm forty-something so I can report what happened to them years later.   Boyfriend A: Used to jet set but now works as an obscure commercial photographer-- apparently not obscure enough for his tastes so he changed his name. He was once drop-dead beautiful but has lost all his hair. He never talked about his childhood but I know the story because his brother-- who was bipolar, talked a lot and committed suicide a few years ago-- dated a close friend of mine back in the day.  They had a harrowing upbringing which may be why he never married, had children nor talked about his childhood.  Boyfriend B: We both got married to different people around the same time. Back when we were dating, I once found a children's book in his apartment with a dedication on the jacket from his ex. The book was something about a little caterpillar that never expressed itself. I thought to myself at the time that she must have struggled a lot with his periodic emotional withdrawal and that I definitely wasn't going to be buying him hinty kiddy books. He once showed up in one of those moods and I brusquely broke up with him on the spot. He also had a harrowing upbringing. I decided back then that "harrowing upbringings" were out of my paygrade. Also decided no more "still waters." He was divorced ten years later following a conviction for dv.	1641193481.0	hr1ng9k	t3_ruie6a	t1_hr1i3co	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr1ng9k/

Literally I look over and it’s some busty thirst trap or the screenshot of p*rn. How is that a quality form of socialising?? Men seriously have no sense of humour and think that sending their favourite links to P*rnhub is cool 🤢🤮. These guys are such degenerates and losers. I definitely recommend checking some of their conversations when snooping through their phones.	1641193646.0	hr1noyo	t3_ruskk4	t1_hr1ft9z	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruskk4/what_classifies_as_social_media_red_flags/hr1noyo/
y86nn	For me it's mostly the maturity or lack of which is the deal-breaker. What would I talk about with some 20 yr old dude? Everything I have learned and experienced and formed opinions about is something most likely not even known to him. And even if he's not some dudebro but has a beautiful mind, is kind etc., It would feel weird and abusive. Couldn't take a declaration of love seriously because I know how easily influenced you are that age.  Men though with younger women don't care about maturity that much.	1641193712.0	hr1nsfp	t3_ruhmdd	t1_hqz89o2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruhmdd/age_gap_gross_out/hr1nsfp/

88zmpwbq	Yep, this sounds precisely like the kind of thing  married/committed cheaters say to side dishes to garner pity and get a proxy to triangulate against a partner, as in "I'm trapped and can't leave her because she'll never let me see the kids again!"   It probably worked so well on side pieces he thought he'd keep it up long after his ex kicked him to the curb.  Ask them what they did to lose custody since that bar is scarily high. Not even dv convictions get custody removed. Men have to be rampaging junkies who left their babies in ditches while stoned and holding up mini marts.	1641194610.0	hr1p3a1	t3_rub2qv	t1_hqy74fd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rub2qv/tell_me_a_pickme_runs_a_page_without_telling_me/hr1p3a1/

1bzgkxl2	When I was 28 and using OLD I matched with a guy whose age was also listed as 28. Turned out he was actually 38.  When I confronted him he used that lame excuse of wanting to meet younger women (blah blah wanted to have children blah blah wasn't his fault he wasn't able to start a family when he was younger (yes he really said that) blah blah) and acted like he was a victim.  I pointed out that my preferred age range for matches was 40-something. (I don't remember exactly what I set it to, but it would have included 38-year-olds. I was okay with that at the time.) And he comes back with "but I wasn't specifically looking for YOU but for younger women in general" or whatever.  Like, was I the only premenopausal woman on the entire site willing to date a 38-year-old? I highly, highly doubt it.  I truly didn't care about his age. But his dishonesty was a deal-breaker. And the fact that he deliberately set out to get a hypothetical young woman to fall in love with him before revealing that he wasn't what she wanted, what she thought he was -- yeah, hell to the no with that manipulative bullshit.	1641195046.0	hr1ppv0	t3_rulv1u	t3_rulv1u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rulv1u/mens_reactions_to_having_their_lies_exposed/hr1ppv0/

3mcgi	From when I did have social media, I was fine with them having the status set as "In a Relationship", although I really didn't want random people even seeing a very pared down version of my profile.  I work in a publicized industry and wanted to keep some semblance of social media even though I didn't religiously update.    Everyone has habits, although one boyfriend always flooded his page with his drinking achievements from the Untappd app.  It made me feel like I was dating an alcoholic, which he admitted in jest that he was well on his way there.	1641195816.0	hr1qso3	t3_ruskk4	t3_ruskk4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruskk4/what_classifies_as_social_media_red_flags/hr1qso3/

86ld3iok	Not that I am diagnosing anyone, but your situation reminds me of me and this guy who was also "nice", told me sob stories about his struggles, admitted himself I am much better than him. He also lived with his parents in his late twenties, working a crappy job, with no clear future plans. Like you, I tried to help him, nurture him and was really in love with his potential. I now strongly suspect my guy was a covert narcissist who manipulated me.  You mention in other posts that you had too much emapthy for him, that you could relate to his sob stories. Be careful with this stuff, that's how covert narcissists get you hooked. Then he wanted to string you along, which is also something they do. You say he comes across as genuine and humble. I know it may sound preposterous that a guy with such a pathetic facade can be an N, but they pretend really well. Same thinking as an overt, but really much harder to spot unless in hindsight. Same entitlement and desire to manipulate, all the toxicity, but packaged in a nice guy appearance.  Please reflect on what makes you vulnerable to these types. I've have to re-examine my life since childhood to figure out what went wrong. The main idea I see is that he got you interested by appealing to your empathy and exploiting your kindness. That's a door you need to close so that this can't happen again. Relationships should happen between equals, peers who bring value to each other. You were willing to overlook major shortcomings that disqualified him as a potential partner because you felt sorry for him. This is something I would work on, it exposes you to these types in the future.	1641196037.0	hr1r3jj	t3_rukyak	t1_hr134fq	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rukyak/sort_of_warn_out_from_my_first_sort_of_romantic/hr1r3jj/

4nm98s2k	There's just no reason for age gaps. Why should men get an extra 10 years to develop themselves to a level on par with women? All these men being like 35 and being like "okay I'm finally ready to settle down with a 25 year old, I feel that age anyway and I feel like mentally I just click more with women that age". First of all, you and all other single men say exactly this. Second of all, what on earth did you do these past 10 years? Why would men be allowed more time to develop than women?  It makes zero sense. It's like "men are seen as full people with lots of qualities they can develop over time, women are only liked for what they are born with - youth and beauty - there's nothing for a woman to develop". First of all, so frustrating and misogynistic. Second of all, you give more time to a loser guy and he doesn't become better with time. The women encouraging this, women saying they like older guys, they should realize the older guy just had more time to fail.	1641196408.0	hr1rlrr	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr1rlrr/
vog9pcg	Personally, yes I am busy with my own life but when I decide to date, I am very serious about who I give a chance to. So I look into their pattern of communication very closely from the start. If the way they court me doesn't bring me much happiness but more anxiety, I'm out. So I don't think I could ever do 2 months with an avoidant anymore. I want to feel secure from the start and continuously with the man I'm dating. I don't deal with insecure feelings anymore when it comes to relationships.	1641196794.0	hr1s4dp	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr1s4dp/

vog9pcg	I disagree...  If he sets a pace that you don't like, you can just cut him off. Anxious attachment styles should only look for secure attachment styles. So OP should let him naturally decide the pace and then decide if it suits her or not. If OP is enough into the guy after he's proven initial seriousness, then OP may want to communicate her needs to re-adjust the relationship when needed and see if he respects that.	1641197480.0	hr1t15j	t3_ruie6a	t1_hqzjlsu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr1t15j/

3b0da7w4	Completely agree. I grew up in an abusive home with drug/drink addicted narcissistic parents. I was kicked out at 17 and I feel my trauma from my parents made me seek out the arms of LVM. Well when I was 20, I met a man who lied about his age. He said he was early 30s, which in hindsight was still too old for me but I sound out 6 months later he was 44!  He was manipulative and abusive. Made me feel inferior because he was white and I'm mixed. The lies got a lot worse and I found out he was sleeping with men behind my back! Please don't be me. These men target teenagers and young women with trauma. As I've worked through my issues and matured, I would never date a man even 5 years older, let alone 24 years older now.	1641202107.0	hr1yxgk	t3_rul2wn	t3_rul2wn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rul2wn/be_careful_ladies_and_especially_young_women/hr1yxgk/

9p6f6ftv	Do you have any hobbies or special interests that you could join meetups and group activities around?   Art related, sports, games, etc.  Volunteering can also help you get out of the house. There are websites that are dedicated to listing local volunteering opportunities for basically every country I’ve ever been to, I’m sure yours must have one as well. Pick something you can handle and hopefully that’s a specific area of interest!  If you are involved in a religion, there are also many community involvement opportunities there. (Men in religion are not necessarily any better than outside, FYI. Might even be worse using it to gaslight, so beware).  Allow yourself time to grieve your losses before pushing forward, but do push forward when you’re ready (such as getting a new pet).  Best of luck!	1641204815.0	hr22c5g	t3_rus2aw	t3_rus2aw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rus2aw/working_on_myself_just_makes_me_feel_more_isolated/hr22c5g/
4wr58x02	That's something rarely mentioned about reckless hypersexuality in women...that it's usually a symptom of a bigger issue, but then it might make it more difficult to slut shame if people understood that the women were hurting or confused in some way.  Best wishes on moving passed the past.  I hope you're able to forgive yourself.  I understand the pain of disrespecting yourself with guys who don't deserve you. It's painful but crap like that only happens when you're going through things.  One of our basic instincts is self preservation so if someone is going against that, clearly, something is wrong imo. It's just unfortunate that someone is usually trying to screw us and vulnerabilities are like a beacon for sexual predators.	1641204995.0	hr22k4z	t3_rusbr3	t3_rusbr3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rusbr3/speaking_my_mindshameful_pasttrigger_warning/hr22k4z/

ec1hfydh	That's the cruelest form of future faking. The carrot these guys dangle of a better and more comfortable life is way worse than the typical carrot, which is filled with absurd promises of a fairy-tale like romance. We are quicker to sniff the bullshit when the promises are too grand, but general kindness is easier to fly under the radar.  Being from a third world country, I get this a lot too. Even a NVM from my country has promised to "take me in and take care of me" years ago, like I was some sort of stray puppy. Miss me with that, I'm doing so much better than him nowadays, and I'm doing it on my own.	1641205160.0	hr22rld	t3_rulv1u	t1_hr1krne	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/rulv1u/mens_reactions_to_having_their_lies_exposed/hr22rld/
7osmnunj	I'm in my late 20s and it's an interesting time because i have friends ranging from 25 to 40 something. So I have a window into both brand new happy marriages as well as failing marriages that are just beginning to crumble. And then obviously I am exposed to tons of miserable marriages as well (usually older couples though, like past their 40s).  To me it seems like this: women love being married in their 20s and early 30s. Sincerely. They really push it on you during those years but it's not because they're trying to drag you down or anything. I think their motivation is genuine. They are happy and they want you to be happy as well and they think they've got it figured out and can dish out good advice. Bad marriage isn't on their radar. They do not think it can happen to them.  It's like they're asleep and playing house. It takes them some time to snap out of it and wake up. And yeah usually kids is the catalyst. And it's interesting because once they're awake they're awake. I think it's like an optical illusion where once you see it, you can't I see it.  So yep I totally attribute it to social conditioning.  My bf and I were considering marriage and I started having serious conversations with my married friends. One thing I noticed is that they repeat this thought (I swear it's brainwashing) where they say that all my hesitation about marriage is outdated because "baby boomers give marriage a bad rep." Basically they say boomers and gen x got married for the wrong reasons blabla bla but that millennials are gonna totally flip the divorce rate stats. 😬😬😬  I have my doubts. 🤷🏼‍♀️	1641205315.0	hr22ynd	t3_ruqx4w	t3_ruqx4w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr22ynd/

r0mm1	I just wanted to add, that there is a fine line between avoidants and covert narcissists. Things can blend very easily. There is also the two types of avoidants. The dismissive ones are the ones who often say “Let’s see where this goes.” I run from them. I’m past that point in my life. But if they express it in a secure way and not be anxious about it, then I can deal with that Because I’m similar, too.      A rebound I had, which was a bad idea from the start anyway, pulled this shit when I asked where this was going. Let’s see where this going 🤡. Red flags went up and he treated me ok, but sex was his primary goal each time. Pulled away from him and explained this is not what I wanted. Probably shouldn’t have even done that. Tried to contact me a few months later for wine because he was bored during lockdown. Block and delete.      But if he’s fearful avoidant, then he better be getting therapy. These ones are the worst. They have the ability to show intimacy and make plans, but then it gets too scary with them. This borders on covert narcissism, IME, but I’m not a doctor, sooo…   I’ll stay single and happy with my cats.	1641205916.0	hr23pel	t3_ruie6a	t3_ruie6a	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruie6a/so_done_with_avoidant_men/hr23pel/

The fact that some women make it to 40 without kids shows that it's not impossible, and makes scrotes feel embarrassed about their poor life choices.

If she decides she wants to change it, no one should be trying to influence her decision. I personally would only want one for health reasons, and even then, congestion can be helped by neti pots.

Being from asia and from the poorer side, I would say we have no problem spotting red flags a mile away because men, especially the richer more privileged ones don't see the need to hide their mask - they stare at us like we are worse than trash and scoff at *anything* we say. And even if the guy himself choose to play nice and be "kind", just wait until we meet the family - especially the mother-in-law. They are *really* impatient and just want you to get on being the slave already.  And funnily enough, poorer men who are on the same level as us or even poorer act like they are God give gift to earth and we should be *flattered* they give attention to us! "So stop being a f\*\*king b\*\*ch and give me money!" while pouting and throwing tantrum like a toddler in PUBLIC!!!!  And lets not forget jabba-the-huts goblin-looking *married* men who think we are sooooooooo desperate for their money, they just need to walk in, flash their money and their pregnant bellies and we will be swooning and wanting to throw ourselves onto them - and get mega ultra giga pissed when we don't react to their "awesome"-ness.

I've never seen a decent man in any of the marriages I had the chance to observe for a long-ish period of time (meeting new couples at social gatherings says nothing about their real life ofc).   My family still won't stop asking questions about when I'm getting married and every once in a while I remind them that not a single woman in the family has had a good husband. One was a violent alcoholic and pathologically jealous, another is a moody alcoholic, another is a cheater who does wtf he pleases without considering anyone in the family, another is a lazy incompetent hypochondriac who leeches off of a woman who has a saviour complex, etc.    Why on earth would I want anything like that for myself?	1641207155.0	hr25a91	t3_ruqx4w	t3_ruqx4w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/ruqx4w/the_happily_ever_after_marriage_fairytale_sold_to/hr25a91/

13f0oi	I'd get super anxious before dates and I realized it's because I have a lot of insecurities. Dates are a lot like job interviews and I realized that, were I to go on a date with a man of actual quality, I would be unqualified. We all want a HVM but we have to ask ourselves, "Am I a HVW?" I realized I'm not. Not yet, anyway. So I'm not dating while I focus on leveling up. I went back to school because I was always insecure about only having an associate's. After I graduate I'm going to pursue my dream career, because I was always insecure about languishing in the shitty job I have. I started going to the dentist to fix my messed up teeth, because that was always something I was insecure about (and let me tell you, it's made me feel SO MUCH BETTER about myself). On my to-do list is to start a workout regimen and therapy. I have various goals I want to achieve before I start dating again, including having an apartment on my own.  You said you think you know why you experience this anxiety, but are you sure that's the reason? If you're anything like me, the anxiety is because you know you're being evaluated and that you're not a version of yourself yet that you're truly proud of. If that's true, the solution is to postpone dating while you focus on self improvement. imo, the only way to date that's fair to yourself is from a place of security and self-love. Maybe you're not there yet?	1642525580.0	ht75b18	t3_s70ukr	t3_s70ukr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s70ukr/how_to_not_get_anxious_before_dates/ht75b18/

enqjhavz	This was such a powerful insight and explains a lot of the research around abusive men.   Despite the common line on it, the way a man treats his mother doesn't say much about how he will treat you, statistically.  What \*does\* say a lot about how he treats you is how his \*father\* treats women (and to a lesser extent, how his dad treats him).   Statistics don't support the idea that men are bad husbands because their mothers failed in raising them.   They instead shine the spotlight on their fathers and the beliefs of adult men around them when it comes to women ... but we don't hear about that with the same frequency that we hear mother-hatred.	1642525731.0	ht75prl	t3_s50w4r	t1_hsuxwfi	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s50w4r/female_dating_strategy_podcast_bonus_lundy/ht75prl/

enqjhavz	I agree with every word.  Well-said.   For context, understand that literally everything you've said here is the opposite of what most western women will encounter if they find themselves in a custody dispute in family court.   There, an abusive father is better than no father.  A child who knows they're not loved by their father has been brainwashed by their mother, to whom they're closer.   A woman's anger toward someone who has beaten, stolen from, isolated, or otherwise been cruel to her repeatedly is not at all valid - she can expect to be punished for it.   This is unfortunately still a far more radical post for a woman than it should be, even in western countries.	1642526019.0	ht76i3c	t3_s6u2g4	t3_s6u2g4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6u2g4/fds_changed_me_and_gave_me_a_healgasm/ht76i3c/

enqjhavz	I saw a set of posts on Facebook over the weekend, in which a man was pointing out that men associate women/female partners with pleasure.   They do not associate women or hetero relationship with \*responsibility.\*  What that means is that when they do end up in a relationship with a woman, all the parts of that woman that don't bring him pleasure (or even worse, that create responsibilities for him) are seen as a bug, a flaw ... and when they don't go away, he assumes the woman is the problem.  Instead of adjusting his flawed expectations, he then goes out and seeks another woman, again assuming this will be a source of pleasure and nothing but pleasure.  When she, too, brings responsibilities, obligations, and even moments of non-pleasure, he will again assume she is flawed.  These flawed (and non-human) expectations of female humans are behind men feeling entitled to cheat (one of the few female-male interactions in which solely pleasure is forefront, and most or all responsibilities are non-existent / delayed), weaponized incompetence with housework/children, and failing to stay with sick partners.  It's also behind abuser-think - when men attempt to colonize a female body for their own sexu@l use, while acting as colonizers do and attempting to remove / suppress the native inhabitant of that body until it/she can no longer impose boundaries or shape their interactions.  TLDR: when i see rants like this OP, I see another man who only associates "real women" with pleasure.  He doesn't see women as 3-dimensional human beings with whom complex, multi-layered relationships are possible.	1642526604.0	ht783dj	t3_s6qchd	t3_s6qchd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6qchd/the_average_lvm_posing_as_hv/ht783dj/

enqjhavz	If anyone has personal experience with this topic, I highly recommend Tracy's blog on [www.chumplady.com](https://www.chumplady.com).   It is hilarious and absolutely glorious!    I feel like the faucet of affairs that married men want you to ignore is this:  it's not the 1920s and his wife can absolutely destroy your life forever once she clocks you (and she will).  And his script-kiddie teens can do the same.  I've seen dorm-mates/ acquaintances / classmates / colleagues get fired because they hooked up with a guy without realizing his wife was further up the corporate chain in their own company.   I've seen them get booted from uni because his wife was on the board.  I've seen them get audited repeatedly by the IRS every time they start a new business venture ... and know the (now ex-) wife's modus operandi was filing a sharp little whistleblower form.  Despite what he's telling you, the odds that his wife is chained to a stove without wifi access are nil.  Even if she doesn't know anyone personally who can tell her how to blow up your life, there are entire internet forums full of people who will gladly give her ideas and step-by-step instructions.	1642527051.0	ht79b50	t3_s6mv67	t3_s6mv67	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht79b50/
1hidpphn	I put the old 65" in storage (it's going to be the break room TV in our new shop) and splurged on a 101" projector system with surround sound. The screen rolls down from the ceiling when you push a button on the remote, and it's not nearly as intrusive as a huge black screen is. I'm gonna build a little trap door for it to hide in the fancy trim of the fireplace surround in my house I'm currently building 😁  Tbh, I mostly just use it for music playlists or as an oversize computer screen for my nearly blind mother to review financials for the family biz. I rarely use it to watch TV.	1642527052.0	ht79b8q	t3_s71jp5	t1_ht75cmp	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s71jp5/they_always_tell_on_themselves_sometimes_sooner/ht79b8q/

16smro	To be totally *totally* fair, if a guy read my bio (because let’s be honest, most of them don’t and just swipe right on everyone with hopes they’ll get a match) and took note of my favorite foods or hobbies and then made sure to come through with it on a date, I would like that. But it can’t be something dumb like string cheese. Maybe he could have taken her to a cheese making session or a cheese and wine pairing. Something a little more thoughtful than Polly-O string cheese 🤦🏽‍♀️  On my profile I listed that I love sushi and pasta. My now-husband (who I met on Tinder) did some research, found the chicest, poshest sushi restaurant within 50 miles, and we split this giant love boat full of different rolls. Another date, he took me to a pasta making class and then we got to eat what we made for dinner. Both dates were thoughtfully planned out because he remembered reading my likes in my profile. But if he rolled up with gas station sushi and Chef Boyardee, the outcome would have been different 😅	1642527234.0	ht79szv	t3_s6cjhx	t1_ht3ds4z	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6cjhx/dae_have_a_visceral_negative_reaction_to_hinges/ht79szv/

enqjhavz	I've noticed that a lot of the pick-me types will diminish you as the wife until they want to "get back at him" for something he did to them too.  Then suddenly, they're going to "tell you" as if (a) you're suddenly powerful enough to be considered by him when he makes choices, and (b) instead of being "better" than you in some way, they're just like you, legitimately injured by a horrible man that they chose to be horrible with.  If he never does anything to trigger this, they'll try to set moral boundaries around your response to the cheating: "It's not me, so you can't feel / say / do this.  That's unfair."  :D  Pointing out that you don't take moral advice from moral failures never seems to click as a logical stance, for some reason.  Family lawyers always say men only leave once they have a new gal lined up (unless they've caught the wife cheating - that's the only other scenario).   So obviously there are plenty of these folks out there.  I'm a huge fan of the block and delete for any gal who makes it clear that her moral code allows her to engage physically with married men.  I'm not a therapist and it's a mental skein I don't have the time to untangle.	1642527386.0	ht7a7vw	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht4ujsf	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht7a7vw/

3arqy2l4	As a woc, I see this all the time. Moc hide behind the cover of "racism" so as to not be held accountable for their patriarchal behaviour and violence against women. And libfem only holds yt men accountable as if moc are not active participants in the violent oppression of women. I once had a libfem tell me that only yt men benefit from the beauty industry destroying the self esteem of women, she wouldn't believe that moc benefit as well. However moc also benefit. For example some own skin bleaching products that they advertise to woc all over the world. And they enrich themselves by enforcing colourism on woc to make more money selling their cosmetic products. This coddleing of moc by libfem is concerning, and I've seen it a lot last year with the rise of attacks against Asian women.	1642527827.0	ht7bfaq	t3_s5ctwx	t1_hswl9u5	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5ctwx/women_like_you_give_feminism_bad_name_shut_up/ht7bfaq/

enqjhavz	I mean, a married man is not going to show up and talk up his amazing wife and how great she is.  It raises red flags:  why are you cheating, then?  You're out porking around while she's cleaning your house, working full time, and raising your children?  What kind of monster are you?  He is \*always\* going to try to shift the blame for the cheating to her:  1. dead bedroom (almost always not true); 2. addiction (why is he leaving the kids with an addict? was she an addict when he met her?  If not, what stressor is she now trying to numb that he can't help with? Addiction is a common symptom of women trapped with abusers - is he an abuser?) 3. she cheated first (how does his cheating help that?  Do you want to be revenge fodder?  How is that romantic?) 4. she ignores me after we had the kids (kids are a lot of work.  Did she promise to be childfree when they got engaged?  Is he a dedicated user of condoms and has he obtained a vasectomy?  How many hours a week does he watch the child so she can - not do work that needs to be done - go do what she enjoys and spend time with her friends?) 5. we have an open marriage (how does he feel about her partners?  Have any of her situations turned into the kind of emotional connection he's seeking with you? If so, how did that make him feel?)  The reality is that most men have used their wives as beasts of burden and now ... in keeping with another comment on how men see women solely as sources of pleasure, not responsibility ... he is out looking for a woman who engenders in him the emotional feelings he expects from a woman (which is to say: "pleasure").   He doesn't want an actual emotional relationship or bond with either of them, tbh.   He wants a work horse and he wants a sexu@l playmate.  He's happy to find both in one person, but if he can't, he's fully entitled to go source his needs from as many be-breasted vendors as necessary.	1642528378.0	ht7cxw3	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht6yv62	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht7cxw3/

enqjhavz	Can you do some freelancing for a local publication?  Practice seeking out random interview subjects for your story, asking them questions, listening, soliciting more information from them, getting them comfortable enough that they let their guard down ... ?  That's really all the dating advice you need.  Dating is less about getting someone to like you and more about getting someone to share themselves with you verbally.  (Of course, you don't want your dates to feel like an interview four dates in ... this is just for date one, maybe 2, before you know much at all about the person.)	1642529672.0	ht7gib9	t3_s70ukr	t3_s70ukr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s70ukr/how_to_not_get_anxious_before_dates/ht7gib9/

enqjhavz	Kind of a sideline, but there is an app called "Mr. Number" ... it's a subscription (like $4/USD per month), but if you plug in a phone number, it pulls up the full name of the person it's for.   useful if you're texting someone you've met on OLD and only have their first name/ last initial.   From there, you can google their full name and usually pull up the data aggregator with their age (or a number within 1 or 2 years of their real age).    Side note: if they're actually a c-level executive at a large company, the company has probably paid a service to clean up their online presence, so these data aggregators won't have a lot of info (if any) on them available to you.  Another flag to check for if he's inflating his job title.	1642529831.0	ht7gy0x	t3_s6gm2d	t3_s6gm2d	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6gm2d/update_on_46_yo_coworker_claiming_to_be_34/ht7gy0x/

enqjhavz	I notice more and more men weaponizing female personality disorders when it comes to "explaining" their messed up ex.  It's really their way of saying "she's horribly traumatized, sure - I can't lie that away - but it couldn't possibly be \*my\* fault because she was already a mess."   Here's the catch, though: emotionally healthy men are not usually in long-term relationships with borderline (since that's the usual personality disorder claimed) women.   The first-third time there's a massive and isolating public outburst (or as soon as they register that their health and lives have declined in this short relationship), HVM tend to gently end that dating situation and move on.  I've seen it happen repeatedly.  If his ex was suffering from a genuine cluster-B personality disorder, he clicked with a deeply unhealthy pattern of interacting with others and chose to stay with that.  That doesn't reflect well on him - and you'd want him to seek trauma therapy and healing before entering another relationship.  Has he done so?   If, as usually is the case, his ex is presenting with some symptoms of BPD because she's suffering from C-PTSD, someone traumatized her.  It could be him or he could have been an unhelpful force on her healing journey, but either way ... you don't want that risk or someone who won't leave you better than he found you after a 5+ year relationship.   The second a guy mentions borderline, I would run as hard and fast as I could.  Every man I've met who I know (because I know his ex wife or children personally through another social group) to be a physical abuser / psychopathic type has eventually worked into the conversation that his ex is borderline.  I swear it's been added to the violent man's handbook that they all seem to study.	1642531549.0	ht7llpd	t3_s699fs	t3_s699fs	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s699fs/case_study_of_dating_mr_sensitive_part_i/ht7llpd/

enqjhavz	Exactly.  Technically, studies have shown it's a numbing agent, a substitute for having a life that one wants to show up for.    When that life improves, the need for the numbing agent vanishes, and a person can then power through any remaining chemical dependencies.

enqjhavz	A personal pet peeve is conflating "codependency" with "survival."  Women trapped with abusers have coping mechanisms that facilitate their survival with a predator in a war zone the size of a house or an apartment.     They're not hypervigilant or overly focused on their "partner" because they're codependent.  They're enslaved and attempting to escape alive - they've developed tactics that help them survive there and that seem dysfunctional outside of that prisoner-of-war camp, in the real world, with people who haven't enslaved them.	1642532527.0	ht7o93b	t3_s61b7p	t1_ht1fqh0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s61b7p/an_open_letter_to_woman_considering_aa/ht7o93b/

Somebody preferring dogs, for example, doesn't say anything bad about them as a person).  • Hates some female singers, but can't tell why.  • Comments other people's eating (not talking about giving health advice or being actually concerned), for example: "Is that all you're gonna eat?" Or "Are you going to eat all that?"  • Smoking (the smell of someone who just smoked makes my head hurt).  • Genuinely likes those "alpha male -quotes" that I've come across especially on Instagram.  • Makes jokes/comments about women only training their butt in the gym or saying that women shouldn't lift weights so they won't become "bulky".	1642533532.0	ht7qy2d	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht7qy2d/
enqjhavz	I don't disagree, but also ...  we blame mothers when men turn out a certain way...  Why would mothers of daughters be exempt?  Single moms? Married moms whose husbands override their parenting?   The reality of single motherhood is that (a) moms who have the kids (no dad around) are usually dealing with poverty.  Raising kids in poverty is HARD.   (b) moms who don't have their kids are usually leaving abusers (abusers and molesters are statistically FAR more likely to request - and get - sole custody of their kids).   Recovering from DV is HARD.  Building a life after a divorce is hard.  Building a life after DV, divorce, and the brutal court-forced loss of your children?  Living every day knowing your children are alone, forever, with the man who tortured you for years?  It breaks many of these women.   That means, by the time mom leaves, she's often traumatized.  She may be physically ill from sleep deprivation and overwork.  if she wasn't already isolated, single motherhood means losing most of her former married friends (even today - it's one of the most brutal parts of a divorce) and having to find time and people who would socialize with a single mom. Dating introduces so many risks on the step-dad front, so her "love life" may be neglected as a result.  If she left an abuser, most of them continue to abuse from a distance, either through the kids, the courts, the finances, the social network, or all of these simultaneously.   the shocking thing isn't that single moms tend to have flaws.  It's that so many women do so well.  In this study, that controlled for poverty and prior domestic violence, kids raised by single moms did as well as kids from healthy two-parent families.  Which means the real issue all along has been poverty and male intimate violence.  [https://www.families.com/study-kids-raised-single-moms-well-kids-raised-two-parents](https://www.families.com/study-kids-raised-single-moms-well-kids-raised-two-parents)   (I've also noted that friends who grew up with abusive dads tend to be deeply resentful of their mothers for not leaving their dads.  Even in situations where the family courts of their region / time would almost certainly have handed them over solely to their dad post-divorce anyway.)	1642533538.0	ht7qypm	t3_s5xqng	t3_s5xqng	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5xqng/women_who_say_their_single_mother_is_all_thats/ht7qypm/

enqjhavz	You can often look up the county court site and check the case search function.  Different counties publish different degrees of the case, but some have most of the divorce documentation.  You can usually tell whether there are any real back and forth on custody, or if the couple simply agreed without trial time (which may be a financial decision - trials are easily in the $10K+/day range in many areas).	1642533874.0	ht7rvjv	t3_s5xqng	t1_ht0rbuj	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5xqng/women_who_say_their_single_mother_is_all_thats/ht7rvjv/
4ange5r5	Is this a case of something deeper? When I was reading this, what jumped out was his ability to throw away 3 years over sex frequency. It seems like he didn’t truly love her. And everyone is defending him in the comments, calling him brave.   So, how do we know a man won’t turn on us like this? Especially if we have sexual boundaries?   I think one approach is to find out about his sexual past, and why his former relationships didn’t work out. If he mentions “sexual incompatibility” it might be a tell that he will likely throw away another relationship over the frequency he gets sucked off.	1642533905.0	ht7rylg	t3_s75gtg	t3_s75gtg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht7rylg/

enqjhavz	They weren't stunned because of their belief system - everyone in there would have fought tooth and nail for that outcome, gladly.    It's because she cost them a lot of income by simply agreeing.  Courts know mothers will bankrupt themselves for their children's safety and well-being.  They know men will bankrupt themselves over very little, but mostly over property and assets.  There's often a tendency to act like it's inevitable that each will lose what they're assumed to value most ... causes them to open their pocketbooks and prepare for war / enough litigation to buy their lawyers a new boat.	1642534014.0	ht7s92q	t3_s5xqng	t1_ht0yzjx	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5xqng/women_who_say_their_single_mother_is_all_thats/ht7s92q/

9p6f6ftv	It seems to me like he’s also a victim of misogyny (as most men are), and his self esteem comes from his sexuality. I say that because he said he feels “unwanted”, and there are many many ways to want a person outside of sex. He might have been passionately wanted, for his company, his character, his laughter and humor, his presence, his cuddles and comfort, but her ability to have sex is just about once a week. For men who are taught to value themselves for their sexual achievement only, that’s a blind spot. I feel sorry for him - feeling unwanted because you’re not constantly being fucked sounds pretty sad.  Outside of this, if it was really a mismatch in libidos, I’d hope the guy would pick up on that earlier than 3 years in!  My best advice/guess is that a true HVM would not show signs of putting sex on a pedestal, and would value himself for more than his sexual “achievements” as well. That and being mature enough to understand that the frequency of sex naturally fluctuates over the years. Doing it every day isn’t even all that from what I’ve heard of couples trying to conceive.  The eating out bit had me crack up a bit.   But it’s mostly sad, he objectifies her and himself too.	1642534535.0	ht7tnun	t3_s75gtg	t3_s75gtg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht7tnun/

(You can buy the former at age 18 and the latter, depending on alcohol content at age 16 or 18 where we're from.) Never mind if he went to a gas stop, pulled in with his own car (driving age without supervision is 18), he was still asked for his ID. Always.

nzo7f	I don't think breaking up over sexual incompatibility is shallow. It's quite possible he was a terrible boyfriend, but given the information we have it looks to me like he wanted to be a good lover to her but she just isn't very into it. There could be any number of reasons and back story that would make him a bad person, but this does not at the moment seem to be a case of a man dumping a sick woman or any of those shallow reasons we see a lot. It looks like a sad but needed end to a relationship. Both can now go find someone better suited for them.	1642534725.0	ht7u6c6	t3_s75gtg	t3_s75gtg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht7u6c6/

3bii2bnm	Yes THANKYOU   And a reminder: FDS is not here to coddle Pickmeisha’s who shit on other women.  This isn’t Side Plate support club.  Here to coddle women that knowingly sleep with taken men & make a million excuses for it. And put other women at risk to psychological damage & STIs.  Pickmeisha’s need to get out of scarcity mode trying to fight other women for their chance to be clowned by some regular cheat.  Mental health problems and low self esteem aren’t an excuse to shit on other women either.  Your esteem & mental health is your responsibility to handle.   This is ‘get your shit together & don’t be stupid’ zone.   The problem is with this type they tend to have a fragile ego and can’t process shame.  They try to find a million excuses to avoid the shame of shitting on other women.  When actually that shame has something to teach them.  Because secretly they enjoyed shitting on other women and being temporarily put on a false pedestal by men.   Take responsibility for your actions.   Don’t do to others what you don’t want done to yourself.   Some side plates are out here publicly gloating about the married men they sleep with on tik tok   Then in the next breath…. trying to get sympathy saying ‘put a leash on your man’ or making excuses for their actions.   Blaming the girlfriend for not knowing he’s got other women.   Sorry but last time I checked the point of cheating was to hide it.  So he’s deliberately hiding it….& the Pickmeisha is playing along with it   So her not knowing is not a justifiable excuse for the Pickmeisha to keep servicing him.   If you’re making yourself available 3 hours a week to sleep with a married man…you’re clowning yourself.  You’re the one who is playing into it, coming to his house when his girlfriend goes to the gym for an hour.   Sorry I’m not buying it when the Pickmeisha knows he’s married, makes a habit of that BS & acts like a victim cos he does the same to her.  How you get them is how you lose them.  If he will cheat WITH you, he will most definitely see you as an even bigger clown and cheat ON you.   This is simply a way for trifling Pickmeisha’s to offload blame. And cry victim.   You can’t be complaining about these cheating disrespectful men whilst AIDING them to shit on us.  The minute you know he’s married - that should be the END of it.	1642535423.0	ht7w2s9	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht5u5ky	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht7w2s9/

enqjhavz	I think it's multi-faceted.   First, I think we're conditioned from birth to compete with other women.  When we adopt more feminist viewpoints, etc., we have to rewire those neurological circuits and re-route that emotional energy and a lot of us (me too) still jump on any societally acceptable (or feminist-approved) short cuts like: mother-in-laws, "Karens", pickmes, or other women grouped by race or politics or belief system, etc.   That's not to say that there aren't horrible women out there, or that we don't have legitimate complaints about some of these labels.  But I can always tell I'm rechanneling my patriarchal conditioning if my level of sneering fury against \[\[insert female-dominant group here\]\]\] is entirely disproportionate to the specific name-able act(s) that a specific name-able woman committed intentionally against specific me.    If I'm feeling a tsunami of dismissive anger against an entire group of women whose names I do not know, I'm probably playing directly into patriarchal hands.  And that likely means it's a fairly safe anger, in that it won't upset any men and there won't be any negative consequences from them for my expressing it.  Second, I think we tend to devalue mothers and their sacrifices for their children.  If I ask you to value a man's sacrifices for his family (let's say he's a HVM):  my own dad worked daily for myself and my siblings, came home, cooked supper for us every other day, did laundry (mom hated it, so dad did it), did our homework with us, took us to neighborhood events, encouraged me to aspire to higher education and worked overtime to pay for it .... we'd all feel a glow of warmth, of respect.  What a great dad (he was, truly).  Let's say in adulthood, my great dad showed concern over a few of my adult decisions or asked to be included in my adult life in a fairly moderate way, this kid's birthday party, that trip to whale-watch in Alaska with me and my husband, and maybe we don't always agree ... he gives the kids the occasional ice cream a little too late in the evening.  Do I hate him?  Do I challenge him for overstepping into my adult life?  Do I demand that he leave, clear the way for my husband - HE CHOOSES THE DESSERT NOW!  Of course not.  A parent's relationship with their child doesn't end at adulthood or marriage ... it changes, sure.  I see a lot of MIL complaints that expect the MIL to vanish, really.  And I think that's unrealistic.  A parent who loved their child enough to do a good job isn't going to flake entirely when that child marries - they'll be around.  I see perfectly functional parent relationships compared to "emotional incest" a lot, but only where mother in laws are concerned (even where the father in law is oggling the new wife and living out of the guest room).  When that happens, what I hear is that old patriarchal conditioning to be competitive with other women ... and it's coming from the new wife.   That said, I've only ever had one "mom" in law who I didn't get along with, and she was technically his stepmom (and just generally hated anyone who got along with his biomom).  Every other mom, as soon as I made it quite clear that I didn't think our spheres overlapped (I'm here to get physical with him, not do his laundry) and that I didn't plan to fight her presence in his life, has turned out to be a lovely woman who poured her heart and soul into raising as good of a man as she possibly could.  I'm still friends with more of them than I am the ex-boyfriends. :D    Finally? The idea of a "pickme" mom who leans on her son instead of her husband ... this (a) is rare IMO, and (b) is easy easy easy to vet for early in the dating process.  She's not going to suddenly become wildly enmeshed and start living in his bedroom 3 years after you met him and one year after the wedding.  That stuff has been there since day one and you just gambled that you could bully it out of existence and lost.  Choose better.	1642535709.0	ht7wut2	t3_s5eo5e	t3_s5eo5e	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5eo5e/why_is_there_so_many_crazy_motherinlaws_lets/ht7wut2/

f4fr272a	You can't "protect" yourself from this. Sexual compatibility is very important, in the sense that both people need to not only have a healthy understanding of sex, but a similar libido. I'm sure she's been feeling pressured to engage in sexual acts to please him, which isn't a good way to live at all.  If a man wants a relationship with a lot of sex and the woman doesn't, both of them need to respect the other's desires and boundaries and either adapt to the needs of the person who wants less sex, or break up.	1642535743.0	ht7wy2b	t3_s75gtg	t3_s75gtg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht7wy2b/
dmqvg8oj	I really, really dislike it when a man shares a lot of anecdotes about his high school days on a first date. I don't mind *one* funny story about Mr Herbert the math teacher from ninth grade, but I find it seriously off-putting if some twenty-six-year-old who's been out of high school for almost a decade still makes his high school experiences the focal point of any conversation he leads. It makes me think that not much can have happened in the intervening years!	1642535774.0	ht7x166	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht7x166/

nzo7f	Of course he would wait. If a guy is really into a girl and has reason to believe she is into him, it's not a problem to wait until the right time. If after a sexual relationship is established, it turns out they have drastically different desire levels, it's a GOOD thing if they break up. Far better than to end up miserable for life.	1642535942.0	ht7xhr1	t3_s75gtg	t1_ht7ug6q	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht7xhr1/

8ygtnym6	Honestly I'm glad he broke up with her instead of staying with her and cheating, gaslighting, manipulating or abusing her (obviously can't be sure he didn't though).   "She feels like a sex toy" - sums up most sex with men.   I don't care about sex that much, so for me I'm going to find someone who also doesn't care about sex that much. So that might include - guys who have bigger and better things to do with their time, guys who don't exhibit sexual or emotional immaturity (i.e. making sexual jokes, making comments on my ass or boobs, throwing tantrums...), guys who don't like misogynistic movies or celebs, guys who don't want to "cuddle" or "massage" me, and guys with integrity (so they can tell me up front how they feel about sex). I also am not having sex these days, so from the beginning most guys will take themselves out of the picture.	1642536196.0	ht7y6r5	t3_s75gtg	t3_s75gtg	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht7y6r5/
f4fr272a	Men who don't take proper care of their nails/hands. Also, men without a sense of fashion, especially those who wear baggy, casual clothing all the time.  Excessively hairy armpits/body.  Beards are extremely disgusting to me. Like why do you have fur on your face?? Face pubes are just as bad.  Generally men who don't trim their body hair and don't clean themselves sufficiently.   As for behaviour, men talking to me in the same way they'd talk to their bros, even when it's clear they're interested in me, is a massive ick. So many men don't know how to talk to women or treat a lady like a lady.	1642536490.0	ht7yzqf	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht7yzqf/

enqjhavz	Those are my roots also.  It's men shifting their responsibilities.  Instead of giving their wives respect and power, they shift that duty on to their children ("a child's salvation is at the feet of their mother") ... so then the sons are the ones burdened with duties toward his mom and the daughters having to live out the same cycle of being exploited with promises of one day having their own opportunity to "run the show."    Of course, at the end of the day, men run the show.  Dad doesn't have to honor or respect his own wife, and his son - should he get tired of the duty - can just triangulate his own wife with his mother and let them battle it out.   Vile, toxic stuff.	1642536507.0	ht7z1b2	t3_s5eo5e	t1_hswzi61	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5eo5e/why_is_there_so_many_crazy_motherinlaws_lets/ht7z1b2/

dmqvg8oj	Agreed on that. I love it when men have a healthy love for sport and play a sport themselves, but extreme fans are very off-putting. The rage they sometimes display when 'their' team looses is frightening, and the amount of time they'll sink into watching 'their' team play is concerning.  It's doubly strange if they don't play sports themselves. Like, I'll watch a documentary about climbing Mt Everest because I mountaineer and it's interesting to see how people who're much better than me do it. But a dude who doesn't even play football casually living vicariously through watching some guys on a screen play a sport he himself is too lazy to participate in?

"Sexual incompatibility" and "He's a victim of misogyny"?

67wkuuu0	Anxiety flare-ups are your body’s way of warning you about something. The core issue is not the anxiety, think of that as the symptom, when really you need to find a real cure for the cause.  From your other replies, it sounds like the core issue is your self esteem. Honestly your self esteem needs to be sky high to date, especially using something as low-reward as OLD. Your body is trying to warn you of that, because when we have lower self esteem it makes us more accepting of negative scenarios.   Take longer to work on that, it is kinder to yourself to not rush or force yourself to be ready. With deeper personal growth you’ll evolve to the point you won’t care at all what these guys think, as you won’t need or want any male validation. It’s okay to not be there yet, but more destructive if you keep trying to push past the pain.	1642537049.0	ht80gbc	t3_s70ukr	t3_s70ukr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s70ukr/how_to_not_get_anxious_before_dates/ht80gbc/

nzo7f	In that case, I would see first how you feel around him and when you guys touch. How is the chemistry? Do you not only feel love for him but also happy/arousal feelings (can feel like tingling, butterflies in the stomach, being preoccupied with wanting him, etc), or is it too calm, like just a friend energy? Is he on your mind a lot? Do you WANT and eagerly look forward to getting naked with him (even if you're scared) or is it something you're kind of dreading? If that basic chemistry test is good on your part, then start thinking about what you want your sex life to look like and when it's the right time start talking with him about it. I grew up in a "waiting for marriage" religious milieu and while I decided I didn't want that, I do think women in that situation should still experiment with masturbating and learning their own body. That will help them a lot with figuring out how often they actually want it and what they like.   I will say that if you are waiting for marriage, there's a good possibility you have been raised to think it would be the end of the world if you don't end up long term with the first person you have sex with. I do understand that fear and while I enjoyed my puppy love first experience, it turned out 100% fine with me to eventually move on from what was an unhealthy relationship and find someone else. No long term emotional effects or anything.   Also, if you aren't experienced in romance and sex it's normal to be very afraid of the ins and outs of it all and how to know if the person is the right one. The weird thing is, you WILL know when you meet a good person for you - it's surprisingly comfortable and easy. It's good to put yourself out there and go on dates so you learn who does not fit and then at some point you will meet someone and be like "What? Why isn't this hard like the others?"	1642537179.0	ht80t53	t3_s75gtg	t1_ht7xr3l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s75gtg/guy_dumps_gf_of_3_years_over_sex_frequency_how/ht80t53/

dmqvg8oj	I have a friend whose ex-boyfriend was *surprised* when she dumped him because after three months of having sex together and plenty of instructions, he still had not made her cum one single time. Like, he was baffled that that might lead to a break-up. He just seriously never considered it a big problem. Despite her continuously giving him instructions in bed, he never thought it was important to her and felt no real need to change the situation because he didn't see it as something that might eventually harm his access to her and her body.  His reasoning? None of his exes cared, because they all 'eventually' started coming after a few months, they just needed some time to 'adjust to the new person' and maybe she just needed that time too? She informed him of the obvious facts that his exes didn't magically 'adjust' to his bad performance, they just started faking it, and after he had calmed down from that enough to speak in full sentences again, he s*till* didn't see why she would break up with him because of a lack of orgasms after three months of sex.  This brainwashing goes so deep that some scrotes are legitimately surprised to encounter someone who hasn't let it get to her!	1642537530.0	ht81s63	t3_s6qchd	t1_ht61d1h	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6qchd/the_average_lvm_posing_as_hv/ht81s63/

You'll have your favorites and you'll have the ones you barely remember and you'll have the ones who immediately terrify you that they'll stick around and did you raise him wrong and what on earth is he thinking and do you have to invite her to the family BBQ where she's sure to have a screaming match with at least 2 people in the first hour?  (Moms don't get to do the whole toxic shotgun "don't you hurt my child" thing to our sons' dates - not that it's ever helpful anyway - so you'll have to keep smiling and not say anything at all and just hope it peters out before there's a pregnancy or a wedding...)   But if you did raise him well, loved, with standards, self-discipline, surrounded by HV people, with his own goals and aspirations and a healthy attachment pattern ... eventually he will bring someone home who he loves and you either like or will determine to learn to like.  Of course, you realize that your feelings on it aren't what matters - what matters is whether they're good together, that she's a healthy person emotionally, that she's kind and empathetic and honest, and it will get serious.  Then you'll all (you, him and her) have to figure out where the lines are, what family gatherings look like with this new stranger-turned-family in your midst.  Hopefully you'll meet her parents and like (or pretend to like :) ) them too.  You'll figure out what triggers her a bit and she'll learn the same about your family and because everyone is emotionally healthy, those areas will be mutually avoided.    Everyone will eventually come to bond and love each other, your holiday traditions will start to include not just her, but her parents, and her friends, and her community and hobbies as well, and vice versa. They'll want some concessions that hurt a bit, but you'll oblige and in return, you'll build trust that allows you to also ask for a little help here or an accomodation there.  (It seems like a bit of this gets revisted when the grandkids come and the boundaries shift again.)  I come from a very family oriented culture and have always lived surrounded by a noisy symphony of various relatives (and my in laws and my ex inlaws and my sibilings inlaws, and my own parents' large families and all of their inlaws) on all sides, so I married both times fully expecting my MIL, FIL and extended in laws and friend groups to be part of my life and home fairly frequently.   Had I envisioned an isolated adventure involving just me and my spouse ... or my spouse and my family alone ... I'd probably have found married life and my MIL much more stressful than I did.	1642537688.0	ht827nd	t3_s5eo5e	t1_hsyopiu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5eo5e/why_is_there_so_many_crazy_motherinlaws_lets/ht827nd/

dmqvg8oj	I think to figure out what might help you, you need to figure out what you're anxious about.   Think about it. What exactly is making you anxious? Do you fear for your safety? If so, is it because the man you're going out with is displaying red flags? Do you feel embarrassment at the notion of being seen with your date in public? If so, are you actually attracted to him? Do you feel anxious about having to 'entertain'? If so, have you fully realised yet that it's *his* job to prove his worth to *you*?	1642537815.0	ht82kfx	t3_s70ukr	t3_s70ukr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s70ukr/how_to_not_get_anxious_before_dates/ht82kfx/

ec1hfydh	OMG yes. So many men obsessed with 90s and 00s bands from their childhood/adolescence that are not even active anymore. Ick, ick, ick.  I also hate when men only listen to one music genre, especially if it's the the "rock" spectrum, like prog rock (the worst condescending douches imo).   They'll bitch and moan about anything you want to listen to that is not what they like. And they'll extend this to movies, TV shows, games, etc as well, and criticize everything you like as "schewpid".

caxkcnil	It doesn’t really surprise me from a boymom. They’re the type to always side with their precious little boy and vilify everyone else instead of holding them accountable.   I don’t expect people to side with their daughter in law, even if it’s the right thing to do, they always seem to side with their family/sons. Despite what people say a daughter in a law is most of the time seen as a stranger, she’s not blood. Other subs have proven this to me.   The mother in this post probably wasn’t supportive of her, like ever. She probably disliked her since day 1. It should have been a deal breaker not a red flag.	1642538056.0	ht838hx	t3_s6i0tj	t1_ht7uta8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6i0tj/she_needed_fds_a_long_time_ago/ht838hx/

At closer analysis, I realized he already had it scripted so he could just use his crayon analogy for something perverted immediately.    I don't think I've ever received a message online from a stranger that didn't immediately turn sexual after I've said 'hello' back. As soon as it goes there, I always block.

bwfh41o1	100% with you about wanting cats. Cats are so important to me and they are always something I want to have in my life. If a man doesn't like cats, I actually consider it a red flag because whenever I hear the reasoning for WHY someone doesn't like cats, its always some iteration of them not liking a loving being having boundaries.  If a man is allergic to cats, I wouldn't call it a red flag but I still wouldn't date him because that allergy is just incompatible with the life I want to live.	1642538238.0	ht83qiu	t3_s74wrl	t1_ht7qy2d	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht83qiu/

3bii2bnm	They will feed her lies and the Pickmeisha falls for it thinking she’s getting this great unappreciated guy  He’ll say ‘she doesn’t give me attention’  ‘I did x y z & she doesn’t appreciate me’  Idk why Pickmeisha’s fall for this when we know 98% of men are liars. Nowhere near what they claim.   The chances of them magically getting an amazing guy, who is also cheating on his wife….is ridiculously slim.   Yeah cos he exhausted her with his gaslighting, negging, belittling, incompetence & ogling other women.   He’s not telling her that part.   That’s why she’s deflated & lost the will to try with him. Because he’s strung her out.   He strung her along pretending to be different when he wasn’t.   He’s exhausted that woman’s patience. Or desire.  That’s why he’s lining up his ducks to cushion the fall.  He will seek out an immature woman to pump his ego up b4 she ditches him.   Bc he can’t face being alone.   As he can sense she’s had enough.   He wants to be the one that moves on fast and punish her some more. Rub it in her face.   Most times the wife has brought up them ending things multiple time’s in a fair manner…but he refuses & claims he loves her. Gaslights her. Guilt trips her. Claims he’s not cheating, she’s paranoid.   So he’s the one REFUSING to end it,  yet making out the wife won’t let him go.  They’re both still in the puppy stage, Pickmeisha barely knows him as she only sees him 3 hrs a week at most.   The side plate is just damage control.   If she was so terrible, he would of left.   The wife may be hesitating bc she’s tired of going through that process as it’s exhausting to keep putting your energy into liars.   But at the point he’s cheating, he knows she’s on her way out. He knows she left the building .  But he won’t leave bc he wants to punish & harm her.  He wants to drag it out & hurt her.  He’ll use a side plate Pickmeisha to humiliate her some more.   Side plates are literally being used as a tool to punish women who won’t take their shit.  It’s just laughable they pass it off as ‘winning’  Winning what? Someone’s sloppy seconds?   He’ll try manipulate the main to stay.   Whilst telling Pickmeisha ‘she’s obsessed with me I can’t get rid of her’ or ‘she needs me’   Lies, he’s the one gaslighting her to stay. Dragging things out.  Side plates have this immature mindset of ‘he picked me when he has with her! I must be so special!’   When a harsh reality check is…  Men tend to go for low value women when choosing an ongoing side plate.   Because they know high value women aren’t going to knowingly settle for that clown position. Or play hush.   Someone who’s not that bright, has low self esteem, is desperate, immature, low morale & willing to lie.   That’s not a compliment, but side plates think it is.   You have to ask yourself, if she’s so bad why hasn’t  he left?   The reason is because there’s plenty benefits to him staying. They don’t want to leave.	1642538298.0	ht83wi5	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht6yv62	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht83wi5/

Blocked and deleted.   - triangulating me with an ex or a dream girl that exists only in his mind “I’m looking for a woman who is like this and who does that” when no one asked in the first place  - word salad, gaslighting, instead of apologizing. The man is emotionally immature and has a fragile ego. If you’re an adult and you can’t self reflect and apologize for something you did or said, I don’t want you in my space.   - if he apologizes only to get something from me. You don’t apologize to people because you want their attention back, but because you know you made them feel bad and you regret it. If you don’t understand that, you lack empathy  - if he waits for me  to reach for my purse instead of immediately taking care of the bill.

ec1hfydh	Yes, I have a few male friends, most of them are in stable long term relationships and have never hinted at anything other than platonic towards me.  Of course, having too many female friends is VERY odd, but it really gives me the ick when a guy doesn't have one single female friend, I just can't trust them. To me, it's obvious that he only values women for sex. Of course I need to vet the friend too and see if it's really just a friend, I'm not blind.  Also guys who claimed that "men and women can't be friends": instant dealbreaker, he's definitely going to be jealous, possessive and a cheater.	1642540008.0	ht88kvr	t3_s74wrl	t1_ht827mz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht88kvr/

xvt62lr	A little while ago I saw a post where a woman was disappointed with her bf’s proposal.  He did the same thing, he wrote a poem and stuck it in their advent calendar.  She said it was on a piece of paper ripped out of a notebook (so with the little pieces on the side) and just scribbled on there.  No ring.  So she was upset because she expected effort and an actual ring.  This poor girl got eviscerated in the comments….telling her she should be grateful for the effort, it’s the feelings behind it that count.  I teach fashion history and we do talk a bit about rings and giving your partner a ring goes waaaaayyyyyyy back.  So it is not wrong of this poor girl who has been programmed since birth that asking to get married requires a ring to be upset when she doesn’t get one.  And when i pointed that out of course I got downvoted to all hell.	1642540510.0	ht89xxh	t3_s6hqgr	t3_s6hqgr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6hqgr/he_proposed_and_a_few_days_later_we_went_ring/ht89xxh/

skrbu	Allow me to be the partypooper on this one.. Therapy doesn't actually fix character. It's not a therapist's job to change who you are as a person, teach you empathy, give advice etc. A therapist is there to validate you, get you in touch with your feelings, give you tools for regulating your well-being etc- none of which would make a narcissistic clown become a better person. If anything it only arms them with more sophisticated vocabulary.	1642540752.0	ht8am94	t3_s6wu1r	t1_ht67db0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6wu1r/we_dont_do_that_no_more/ht8am94/
7yp276el	These crappy men also trash their wives and girlfriends for "not staying in shape" after having several kids or "letting themselves go". They use that bullshit to excuse cheating an emotional abuse. Meanwhile my sister has had five children, holds a full time job and has zero help around these house while her worthless husband is going to his gym 7 days a week. She has a college degree but never developed the critical thinking skills to realize that Conservative Christianity is actively working against her rights so there's not much anyone can do.

I wouldn’t be too worried about a fancy attorney being able to persuade a judge you could work when the government agency had determined you ARE disabled. However, I’m sure it is a good idea to have some type of representation. Have you asked your attorney about payment plans, or low cost resources?

3bii2bnm	These are the same fragile lying men   Telling Pickmeisha ‘she’s obsessed with me I can’t get rid of her’…..‘she’s in a bad place I need to stay’  Or ‘it’s complicated’ ‘I can’t leave yet’  Bullshit. Bull fucking shit.  Never believe their lies about why they can’t leave.  These grown men are always screeching about how they’re leaders etc & how women are so passive aggressive / difficult  ….but they just can’t break up on amicable terms?  They just don’t have the strength to leave this ‘intolerable’ woman? Spit it out?   When there’s no real threat of her killing him?  Most time’s that woman can barely stand looking at them & is on her way out.  They know this & their fragile ego cannot handle a woman dumping them for their BS.  So they trolley dash a Pickmeisha into the picture…to cushion the fall.  And most times it’s because they want to make her jealous she’s missing out.  When it has the opposite effect.  Just showing us what we’re NOT missing.   Nobody craves constant disrespect & belittling…. bro.   Your dick, personality, ‘offerings’ aren’t irreplaceable….bro.   That’s why you’re running to Pickmeisha.  Cos you sense we’re not chasing after you.   And really if she was so low value & he was so confident in his options, he would of left her alone.   I just think what’s stopping you bro?  If you’re so in demand? You don’t like her or want her?  Then let her go. What are you clinging on for?  Because you enjoy abusing others?   Because you can’t physically cope with being alone because you’re weak?  Because you’re selfish & have to line up another victim b4 you drop the last one you sucked ?   But instead they’re salty she won’t take his shit.  Salty little fragile cowardly men. Weak. It’s repulsive.   And they want to punish her….for not putting up with his rude disrespectful behaviour.   Behaviour they’d never tolerate themselves.  These are the men who drained their partners and know their relationship is hanging on by a thin thread bc of his bullshit.   What really happened most times.   He begged her for a shot, lovebombed for for months Aka was doing the most to get her .  Pulling out all the stops. Cos she wasn’t that interested. He was doing the most to prove he’s serious.   Then slowly over a period of time he wore that woman’s feelings down to salt. And made her regret giving him a chance.   Because he’s insecure, deliberately sabotages things.   Only feels big when kicking women down.  He can’t even generate his own energy, pathetic parasite.   Not realising that’s the EXACT reason women are hostile with vetting. That’s the exact reason women don’t trust these men’s words by default.   Because that’s how they turn out.  Men don’t think we have a right to protect ourselves and our best interests…when we do.  Doesn’t matter if it’s 4 months or 4 years….if they disrespect me - they are dead to me.   DEAD.   No we’re not jealous of the next victim you’re sucking dry  ….we feel RELIEF we are free from your shit.   No we aren’t missing out on ten more years of that depressing soul sucking bullshit.   When he senses he’s gone too far & she’s leaving  He aggressively gaslights her, saying she’s paranoid & can’t appreciate what a good guy he is  Meanwhile he’s lining up his side plate Pickmeisha to jump to , to cushion the fall  He doesn’t really care about her either…but at least she cushions the fall & distracts him / pumps his fragile ego up.   Because the pathetic male parasite can’t survive on its own. It can’t face itself. It must find a new host body to suck.   It’s fragile & unstable.   They punish us for not trusting them, even when they know theyre doing us dirty.  And any woman who allows herself to assist men in punishing women for refusing to take their nonsense….is a clown.	1642542477.0	ht8fcgs	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht4sohw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht8fcgs/

I eat nearly vegan for a reason, and it has nothing to do with preferences or some moral obligation I feel, and everything to do with keeping me out of the surgery theater. So many men want to argue with me about how serious my issues are, and I ain't having that.  Instant ick if he tries to order for me. Usually it's shellfish too, which I am allergic to, then I have to navigate 'correcting' his assumption without coming off as a bitch, even though it pisses me off to no end that he put me in that situation first.

7r96naxj	To be fair, society has been fucked up for so long that most men haven't seen the 8 types of love and have nothing to model.  Eros, erotic love is passionate, sexual and fertile. The honeymoon stage where we want to make babies and can't keep our hands off our lover. Where we both consent, agree, desire and long for each other. It's been perverted into date rapes where men won't control themselves and blame the women for being so sexy. The "give sex by x date" rule, where men don't want the matching desire and enthusiasm, the want what they paid for.  Philia or affectionate love. Lol nope. they despise the friendzone and reject our friendship if they can't get their peepee wet, and then they cry that no-one cares about their mental health. Their male camaraderie consists of pointless, shallow bullshit and roastings, bonding over their hatred of women, elevating men who harm the most women.  Sorge or familial love. Considering the amount of parental neglect and abuse, substance addicted parents, poverty, racism, chauvinism and all around societal fuckery, who is having  a great childhood with 2 loving parents, aunts and uncles, cousins and siblings that don't suck. Incest porn has warped their minds. Female family members are not fuck opportunities! I'm surprised it didn't say "sister" as well.  Ludus or playful love. Men have fucked this one up. Negging, criticizing, mocking, rape comments, misogyny, bullying and overall saying shitty things to hurt women's feelings and crush our spirits, then claiming "it's a joke", is not playful teasing or fun banter. It's trolling and sadism.  Mania or obsessive love. They've cornered the market on this one. Coercive control, stalking, harassment, possessiveness, jealousy, murder. But a woman double texting a man is the insane one.  Pragma or enduring love. With few long-term marriages to model, and being unwilling to invest, reciprocate or participate in their own marriages, men have nothing to model and seemingly no desire to create their own. They demand enduring love from women however.  Philautia or self love. LVM can't stand to be around themselves. Riddled with insecurities, shame or delusions that can never be fulfilled, they latch onto women to love them endlessly to spackle up their dead souls. We're expected to have fountains of self-love so we can eat shit with a smile.  Agape or selfless love. LVM bristle at our expectation that men be generous. They're so stingy and panicky that a woman is going to steal their remaining $4.99 they can't imagine two people loving freely and generously. Except women. We have to be bottomless pits of love for loser men.  Without experiencing or witnessing these types of healthy love, it's no wonder men expect all from one woman. And the pornsick, depraved ones expect it from underage girls. Expecting children to manage his emotions via sexual content. Be his friend and future wife. It's sick.  Women need to keep their other friendships as well so we don't expect all types of love from men who can no longer give one type.	1642542752.0	ht8g3nh	t3_s6wu1r	t3_s6wu1r	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6wu1r/we_dont_do_that_no_more/ht8g3nh/

If I encountered a person my age with the exact personality these people had in high school, I would not be impressed.   Yet these LVM miss the sixteen-year-old versions of the boys and girls they used to hang out with. That's bizarre to me. No sixteen-year-old's personality impresses me these days. There are a lot of former sixteen-year-olds I love, but that doesn't mean I can't look back at the versions of them they were at sixteen and think 'yeah, you were whack as hell'.

f7zju3b5	I am not an attorney. I am a business consultant who has been involved with the court system through my work with nonprofit organizations in big cities and also as an individual whose NVX left her baby by himself and the baby aspirated his formula and died. The NVX had a massive multiyear custody battle with his ex and the ex and her spouse had a seemingly "free" attorney that no one could understand why or how - well, we know now why but at the time, no. So I have been around court houses. Your state or city might have some women's attorneys who could intercede. You cannot go into the court unrepresented with an ex who is doing this to you. Also your attorney should have informed you about division of assets and spousal support according to your state's law. Everything is set by formula and only in rare cases will judges change those formulas. So if your ex makes more, then there is no way you will have to pay him, no matter how scrotey he is or what lies he tells. At the hourly wage you give, he cannot afford this attorney for long. I found a resource for [how to prepare for court](https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/preparing-for-court-yourself) for women. Most important: do your best to seek legal resources for disabled people and women in your area. $4K is a lot for an attorney in a simple divorce case with limited assets. Unless there are extreme circumstances you will be ordered to mediation first.	1642539384.0	ht86vhv	t3_s778fl	t3_s778fl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s778fl/lost/ht86vhv/

fzaszs22	I represent myself against my ex husband in family court. He went so far as trying to kill me, and still abuses me and my kids. However, representing myself has been the cheapest and easiest option for me. Two of the lawyers I hired were absolute psychopaths, and one worked with my ex against me.  I know it feels hopeless but numbers don't lie.  And if you are already on disability, that's a sealed deal.  The only defense you need to state is that: You've been married for 25 years.  The law says that after (find this info out) x amount of years, maintenance payments are required from him. You have been on disability for x amount of years.  Currently you receive 18k for disability.  And you would like maintenance payments based on his income of $30 per hour.   Don't bother communicating with your ex or his lawyer, but make sure to turn your proof into the judge before a hearing. Keep it completely about the numbers and nothing else.   Whenever I took my ex to court about something it's literally 55mins of him and his lawyer slandering me and bringing in witnesses who lie so poorly I can prove them wrong in an instant.  Then I get 5 mins to make my case and it's over.	1642540901.0	ht8b144	t3_s778fl	t3_s778fl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s778fl/lost/ht8b144/

clgej1km	If you haven't already done so, gather as much documentation on your disability/medical issues as you can; disability determination approval letter, medical records, diagnoses (all the stuff you had to submit when applying for disability and any relevant records since). If you have any evidence of his abuse/manipulation, get that together as well (screenshots, emails, whatever you have). I'm guessing proof of your income and expenses would probably be helpful too. Print all of it and organize it in folders, a binder or something that you can easily find what you need if you're asked about something or if a lawyer or judge needs to see it. If your disability will make this difficult, ask a friend or family member to help you. I'm not sure what you can do about the lawyer part; maybe go to the legal advice sub and ask there.   What an awful awful situation, I'm so sorry you have to go through this.  Good luck!

3bii2bnm	Also it says they’re a fragile coward with low self esteem   I’m sick of cheaters being painted as confident, life of the party types.  No that’s what they WANT you to think.  Actual narcs (most of which are cheats) are the most fragile people on earth.   Don’t fall for their nonsense. Their fake confidence.   They’re a bottomless pit of self hatred.  You shouldn’t envy them. They’re empty inside.   And that’s why they try bring you down with them.   That’s why they hate women who see through it.   Their ‘confidence’ is fake, unstable & borrowed.   They gravitate to confident women to mirror them, then get jealous & spiteful.   That’s weakness. Not strength.   Why are they so reliant on kicking others down? Even those who were loyal to them?  It wreaks of bitterness. Just wanting to drain others for fun.   Cos honestly I’d rather just get rid of them than start up some exhausting affair, which takes way too much brain power for low return   What are they getting out of wasting more time?  More headaches?   Why the hassle when you don’t even want them anyway?  It tells me they are indecisive, insecure, bitter & not sure they can get better. Why they haven’t jumped  Confident people can just leave & not worry.   They can handle being single.   That’s why these cheaters refuse to breakup. Even when you’re being fair.   It’s a game and they have to ‘win’  They can sense their partner will do fine without them. And it smarts their fragile ego.   Confident ppl also don’t get a ‘thrill’ from shitting on loyal folks  Sometimes a relationship isn’t meant to be.  It’s not a big deal .  There is no need to push & push them till they break.   Or drag it out to humiliate them.   Just grow a pair & end it.   Most cheaters and their side plates have something in common- chronic insecurity/ fragile ego.   They always have to one up others bc they think everyone shares their low morale.  So they want to beat you to something that wasn’t even in your head. Or on your agenda.   That’s why they try feel the other out b4 leaving  But the other woman barely knows the real them & is likely to get the same.   Why the stress of a double life when you could be single guilt free & do what you want?  I know I have options so I don’t need to drag someone through the mud to boost my esteem.	1642543733.0	ht8ipvs	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht6ilrt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht8ipvs/

7r96naxj	Do you have complex-ptsd, fawn type? Where you feel you have to be on your best behaviour and impress people so they'll like you? That if you're not helpful and compliant, they'll abandon you? That men are doing the choosing and you have to be good enough? That regular men who don't want a relationship with you are fine, but once he's "potential husband" you get nervous and seek his approval?  [http://www.pete-walker.com/codependencyFawnResponse.htm](http://www.pete-walker.com/codependencyFawnResponse.htm)  Fawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs and demands of others. They act as if they believe that the price of admission to any relationship is the forfeiture of all their needs, rights, preferences and boundaries. The disenfranchisement of the fawn type begins in childhood. She learns early that a modicum of safety and attachment can be gained by becoming the helpful and compliant servant of her exploitive parents.	1642543918.0	ht8j6uh	t3_s70ukr	t3_s70ukr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s70ukr/how_to_not_get_anxious_before_dates/ht8j6uh/

I don't do this but if I were to give advice about dating to a woman who is less experienced, I'd tell her to write out all of the strange, orange/yellow flags if she is not one to cut men off at the first fuck up. If it all fizzles out, they can always go back and remind themselves that they were probably right about everything they picked up throughout the honeymoon phase.

roc65	Yea. My ex ate like a child, his favorite food was pizza, of course. I gained 50 lbs. dating him because all  we did was sit at home while he ordered takeout (I also had major mental health issues because he was abusive which derailed me from being healthy). I watched his own child go from a healthy weight to obese in a year's span because of the poor eating habits he inherited from him. Not eating health is  sign of emotional immaturity.	1642543579.0	ht8ibcu	t3_s74wrl	t1_ht7ovgv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht8ibcu/

I don’t think side plates understand (because most are dumb)  Most time’s he’s cheating with the soul intention to piss his partner off and make her jealous  It’s often with a fixation on making her more bothered about him…bc she isn’t that bothered   If he wasn’t bothered, he’d leave.   If he doesn’t care at all, why’s he still there 90% of the time.   It doesn’t make sense really does it.   That’s what I do if I’m genuinely not bothered.  It’s cos she’s over his shit  The side plate could be anybody   Any old idiot who buys his sob story & pumps his esteem ….is willing to give him attention whilst he’s on the toilet  These women get it in their head some steamy ‘twin flames’ romance is happening  Like sis the dude is literally only texting you when he’s having a shit, after spending all day with his girlfriend who’s increasingly tired of his nonsense   He’s ignoring her calls 95% of the time.  Allocating her 5-10% of his attention   That’s embarrassing.  I would be embarrassed to be in that position.   Clambering for a chance to be the ‘other woman’ he texts on the toilet.  No thanks. Men aren’t oxygen.   He’s been tryna bother her all day & it hasn’t worked  So now he’s turning his fragile esteem to you  Cos he knows she’s going to leave him unbothered	1642544986.0	ht8lyr2	t3_s6mv67	t1_ht5tf4d	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6mv67/on_dating_married_men/ht8lyr2/

e475yfwt	My biggest red flag is when a guy presents himself as the bon vivant guy, always there to make people laugh and relax the atmosphere. But like, all the time. As if his only personality trait/interest in life is having fun and getting noticed. But in "good", like you can't blame him because he makes jokes and people like funny guys. I dislike when their only dating tricks is humour (and usually, it is not that good. There is always a moment when they run out of jokes and just start with stupidness and """absurd humour""").   This makes me think several things : first, immaturity because why can't you have at least one serious discussion ? two, lack of confidence. Usually, men like this think you will clearly see the fraud they are if they were not diverting your mind with jokes and humour. three, in my experience, this has always resulted in cowardly and untrustworthy men. In the sense that they are so hyper focused on themselves and the image they send back (being the good guy who makes everyone) that they are very inattentive to the problems of others, in particular those of their girlfriend. For them, their girlfriend is there to reassure them, put them at ease... It rarely occurs to them that their girlfriend might need them at some point. You know, those kind of guys who, when you point out to them that they never do the laundry, answer you "ah but you didn't say anything!". And then they'll make a little joke to relax the atmosphere and try to make you forget that it's still you who have all the mental load, while he scratches his balls on the couch !   This may be an obvious red flag for the FDS community but I feel like it's not so much the case in society. I have the impression that many women fall for these nice and funny guys, who have no problem committing (within the limit of the forever girlfriend obviously but they will manage to bullshit their girlfriend that  marriage is only a symbol, or maybe she will gaslight herself first about that). You see, all these guys who play it cool and easygoing but as soon as you dig a little deeper you realize they're just useless and loud. They are all talk and nothing beyond.	1642545095.0	ht8m8s6	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht8m8s6/

b2js99lw	Wonderfully said. It’s very easy, especially when we’re first learning to have boundaries and standards in dating, to be very harsh on our past selves as well as on others who have not yet learned these things. Self compassion goes far.  I often find that if the memory is within the past five years or so, I’m often self criticism and cringey about it. But I’m now thinking of myself ten years ago, who felt trapped in getting married to a man who treated her as an accessory rather than a partner, and I just have nothing but love and care for her. She was doing the best she could, and now I will do better for her.	1642545750.0	ht8nxie	t3_s78ntb	t3_s78ntb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s78ntb/forgive_yourself_for_past_mistakes_with_men_but/ht8nxie/

They feel threatened, jealous, insecure, bored, etc2 - and you become the target either because they think you won't retaliate, or because they are jealous of your work ethic, your youth, your kindness, whatever.  And you blowing up after enduring the bullying is the CORRECT course of action - they realize they pushed you too far and you get rightfully angry - and they are now trying to save face. They try to make you look "bad and overreacting" as a form of gaslighting.  Keep on being ruthless, keep on being angry - even if you hear just one more word from those bullies, go straight to the manager, raise hell, make a scene. Remember that YOU ARE THE VICTIM, and those bullies will get away scot free if you keep silent.  Don't befriend bullies, you are wasting your time - you go there to work and make money, not to be treated like shit by pathetic bullies. Stop giving them your time and attention.

e475yfwt	I usually cancel dates when I get too anxious about them. Dating should be a fun and overall nice experience to have, not another stress event we add to our pile. And I usually think about the reasons why I'm so anxious to meet this guy : is it because of something he says or does that makes me uncomfortable ? Is it because I smell lovebombing and it triggers me ? Is it because I'm too caught up with him and my judgement is clouded ?  Also, doing phone calls (from 20 - 30 min) and pre-screening face times is now mandatory for me. It is so so helpful to filter men before meeting them and it helps making the first real date more natural.	1642546124.0	ht8owd6	t3_s70ukr	t3_s70ukr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s70ukr/how_to_not_get_anxious_before_dates/ht8owd6/

Seriously, for anyone who loves pets but can't have them due to allergies, air purifiers are a game-changer.	1642546759.0	ht8qj5x	t3_s74wrl	t1_ht83qiu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht8qj5x/

pwl7ea	I am loving these outlooks and answers!  - food preferences: agree, at a certain age, especially if a person values their health, fruits, veggies and healthy foods are portions should be the norm. In that vein, a guy should know how to cook the basics and engage in that for a good majority of his meals. The perpetual takeout person is usually pretty unhealthy and lazy.  - FDS really turned me on to the men who don’t wash their asses trope. It’s a real thing! I know of men who only use water to wash with no clothes or anything. The genitals at a minimum need soap, scrubbing and rinsing every day! But of course guys are fine sitting in their own genital filth, dried pees droplets everywhere and expecting a blow job.  - Agree with guys who feel the need to comment on anyone’s food intake or choices. “You must really be hungry!” GTFO	1642547125.0	ht8rgan	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht8rgan/

3bii2bnm	Erm  I do meet some Pickmeisha’s with a similar bitter mindset tbh  They’re the type who take pleasure in tearing attractive women down or anyone they’re envious of   Maybe cos one bullied them in school  Most grow out of it…but some do not  They’re still the same at 55, the severe ones   As in they have too much internalised misogyny   But I think women are more capable of levelling up and getting a grip than men are  Men hold grudges against the entire female sex bc ONE woman they liked politely rejected them in school  Or they had one bad experience  It’s always ppl with fragile egos   They get stuck in a fixed mindset   Rather than a growth mindset  Healthy ppl can process shame & embarrassment & learn from it. Basically they can take an L  Fragile people cannot, they chronically avoid facing themselves & take it out on others subconsciously   This is why therapy wouldn’t work on a covert narcissist   They’d just use it as a way to get sympathy & not change   When most women have suffered multiple and still find it in them to give men a fair chance   Honestly the older I get the more I realise peoples limitations   Contrary to what we’re told…some ppl will never change. They will go to the grave as problematic   And by trying to ‘fix’ them too long you can become an enabler or end up collateral damage   I think some will always end up ‘stuck’ on a certain level  Bc they’ve been snowballing so long it’s second nature- & they can’t take harsh truths.   They’re almost resistant to anything except admiration, no matter how rude they get.   If they can’t even keep it real with themselves   How can they with you?   There was a quote saw that said   A mans maturity is in line with how much truth he can take about himself  And I think that’s true.	1642547724.0	ht8sxce	t3_s5kgw2	t1_ht0eflk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5kgw2/please_for_your_own_sake_find_out_if_he_was_a/ht8sxce/

6330th43	As someone who works in the creative industry men often ask me for free work. Like they find out that I draw so they ask for a free drawing! I “joke” and say sure if they pay me, sometimes they call my bluff and say sure (but I don’t take them up on it because obviously I don’t want to draw their stupid idea), something they really push it and try to make me draw them something. Either way it feels deeply disrespectful and opportunistic, honestly I think it’s a power thing. You wouldn’t ask someone to give you a free filling upon finding out that they’re a dentist, would you? I literally make a living out of my work.  I completely agree with you on not eating vegetables - I’d extend it to picky eating if any kind.  Being overly political very quickly. I just think it’s gauche and inappropriate and usually either antagonistic or manipulative.  It’s also a massive ick for me when men don’t have a basic broad knowledge of history or geography. You should know what continent EVERY country is on, at least vaguely, imo. You should also have a basic grasp of a lot of historical figures and their stories.  It’s a bit of an ick for me when men don’t read fiction but it seems like that’s 99% of them honestly, and I partly blame hustle culture and capitalism for that.    Also, playing video games or being really online. It’s just juvenile.	1642550595.0	ht8zup9	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht8zup9/

9f513x5h	Not strange deal breakers at all.  The first one, not eating vegetables, is a sign that the person does not look after his/her health. I would also include "doesn't eat seafood and has no allergy to it nor is vegan/vegetarian" in this category. If a person doesn't eat "ethnic" foods (they always eat a meat a two veg and they think that "fried rice" is "Asian food"), I would think that they have some sort of bigotry they are hiding... and would need to vet them further to find out if they are simply inexperienced (you can work with that) or narrow minded (red flag). It's also a red flag if you are a POC and one of the first things they ask about you is if you can cook a very basic dish from "your culture". They basically want an "exotic chef mcbangmaid".  So the first deal breaker(s) really roots out people who are not functioning adults or are bigots.   The second one, the person who doesn't consume female created, fronted, produced, "oriented" media, is a misogynist. They think of female artists, singers, actors, as "less than" males. They take women less seriously, if they are employers will promote women less, and when their wives are pregnant, they will dismiss her difficulties as "women's stuff" and not help her raise the children (unless they are boys). They are also likely to adhere to the unspoken tenants of toxic masculinity: boys don't cry.	1642550955.0	ht90pkm	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht90pkm/

42k065yg	There's a reason why the "fun" feminist is the only one that is supported by men at large. The "fun" feminist has "eye liner sharp enough to stab the patriarchy" (men benefit), is sex-posi and kink friendly (men benefit), goes 50:50 (men benefit), and praises and coddles men who do the bare minimum like talk about their feelings (men benefit).  Feminists who focus on women's independence and safety first and foremost are hated by men. We're called prudes, ugly, misandrists, sexists, for committing the crime of focusing on women. Feminists are never going to be popular under the patriarchy, and when ever some facet of feminism goes mainstream, keep your wits about you because it's probably being twisted to benefit men at the expense of women.	1642551166.0	ht917l5	t3_s5ctwx	t3_s5ctwx	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5ctwx/women_like_you_give_feminism_bad_name_shut_up/ht917l5/

It is always better to be proactive, but it’s never too late. It’s like how the best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago, but the second best time is right now.	1642551917.0	ht92zkh	t3_s78ntb	t1_ht8haer	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s78ntb/forgive_yourself_for_past_mistakes_with_men_but/ht92zkh/
9f513x5h	👆  This is what bothered me the most about trying to escape my abusive ex. I was told that I was the problem because I was "controlling". No actually, if I wasn't hypervigilant, I would not be able to predict WHEN he would go off the rails. I needed to know WHEN my life would fall apart and when I would have to put it back together so that I could make time for basic things: like going to the doctor, taking the dog to the vet, going to the grocery store. Those were things that could only happen when there WASN'T a crisis on.

42k065yg	It's a combination of male entitlement and almost no consequences.  If a man gets a woman pregnant and he really doesn't want to be involved, he can just bail. Women don't have that luxury, we HAVE to deal with it with or without the man who did it.  And just like men who refuse to take the trash out until their wife has asked them over and over, you better believe these men won't wear a condom until you badger them to do so.	1642552464.0	ht94bl0	t3_s32n6w	t3_s32n6w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s32n6w/whats_with_men_not_giving_a_damn_about_birth/ht94bl0/

8zo6b41l	My Husband has only called me by my first name once in 20 years of marriage.  He had a pet name for me which I was Fine with for a long time but recently I have been increasingly irked by his apparent inability to address me by my name and also to compliment me or say I look beautiful etc.  We are now hashing these issues out in marriage counselling…	1642552835.0	ht957rq	t3_s74wrl	t1_ht8bhw8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht957rq/
3bii2bnm	I just don’t understand why men need them  Aside from using you as an object to flaunt to other men  Or weaponising it  I once had an ex take a picture of me without my consent in a towel, I wasn’t really showing much  I also looked terrible as he caught me off guard & I was laying around on my phone   I said ‘delete it’  And he started getting lippy with me, saying ‘no you look cute’  Yeah….he didn’t last long. Immature.   I pushed him to delete it   But I think the thrill was voyeuristic & making an ‘example’ of me   A lot of these pornsick men get off on voyeurism & pushing boundaries   He claimed he deleted it but brought it up 8 years later to a mutual friend of mine   EIGHT YEARS and he still had it  If that isn’t some stalker shit idk what is, dude was pressed  I’ve changed phones multiple time’s since then  I have no images of us in my phone  He also had this weird habit of posting pics of us from college on his story saying ‘good times’ trying to fish for sympathy or flaunt me years after the breakup   We didn’t even date that long. 6 months.   Wasn’t a particularly groundbreaking or serious relationship   I dumped him cos he was childish.   People would DM me finding it weird  I think he was super bitter I dumped him   Imagine holding onto a 6 month relationship for 8 years🤣 and keeping the photos when he was the one who ruined it.   Fragile.   Like he expected me to come back   And he felt smug about having that image  I’m over it I don’t care   He was also super bitter I never chased after him  He tried making a pass at me years later & got rejected  I think he was mad cos he earns more money now  Still an immature passive aggressive loser idc  I’m pretty sure he still has that image to hang it over my head  It’s giving ‘immature loser who can’t get over me’ if anything   At the time I found it childish but mostly trivial….. but now I know It’s a SUPER red flag when men take images like this without your permission   It shows they don’t respect boundaries & want to frame you in a bad light   I know it’s easy for young girls to make this mistake But just don’t do it. It’s not worth it.   Men gossip. They share nudes. They weaponise it   They will take them without you looking sometimes  They can keep them DECADES   And upload them online   I’ve noticed it’s often abusive / cheating types who pester me for nudes in relationships  And it’s so they can flaunt me to other guys or use it against me later  Why do they need it when they see you IRL?  Bc they want to share it to other men.	1642552957.0	ht95i1k	t3_s6ufge	t3_s6ufge	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6ufge/liberal_feminism_at_its_best/ht95i1k/
4k5q5nww	How could any woman with a partner who isn't generous with her think he loves her? Isn't common sense that we are generous on things or people we love? Ofc I am not saying all it takes to show love is by spending money on you, but I would consider that the first step. If a man is cheap with me, I don't need to dip any further to know that he doesn't love me.	1642553093.0	ht95tqu	t3_s7bhuw	t3_s7bhuw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7bhuw/this_is_what_we_mean_when_we_say_dont_go_5050/ht95tqu/

z0g9qv8	If he’s in any one of these professions, it’s an automatic no from me.  - Journalist: I live in Hong Kong and I’ve seen with my own eyes the violence of the 2019 protests. Most journalists I’ve met blindly subscribe to the mainstream narrative that these protesters are “freedom fighters” and ignore the fact that these same “heroes” literally set a man on fire and attempted to burn down residential blocks, and that one of their most quoted voices in the media was exposed as a white man pretending to be a born-and-bred Hong Kong Chinese. I don’t need an idiot who misreports the truth or tries to educate me about the geopolitics of my own region in my life, especially if he’s not even from my part of the world.  - English teacher: Given how many “s*xpats” we get here in Asia, and how many of them are English teachers… no thanks. Even worse, some of them are not even qualified to teach. And I should know since I actually have a certificate in teaching English as a second language.  - Pilot: I don’t think I’ve ever met a pilot who isn’t egotistic and a player. Add to that the fact that many of them in my region are stupid enough to believe the lies in mainstream media and to think that the COVID rules (eg closed circuit flights) they have to follow shouldn’t apply to them.	1642553789.0	ht97dt5	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht97dt5/

They have the delusions that modern women can work 8 hours then come home and pull another 8 hours out of thin air to do 100% of the housework and childrearing, then 2 hours to be a porn star, then actually get refreshing sleep. Not to mention time for self-care to be a supermodel trophy wife, plus commute to work, plus grocery shopping, keeping up friendships so hubby can just swan along to birthdays, dinners and BBQ's like King Dick.  And now we're supposed to pay all our own expenses plus half his expenses on NO INCOME.  And we believe it too.  We believe the insanity in his head, and we put it into our own heads.

5eyjl40e	I've experienced this before -- it's how bros talk to other bros. It's a particular toxic mixture of smack talk and immaturity. I had this kind of fun relationship with my trainer, BUT he knew how to read signals, and mostly we were just incredibly silly together. From him, it was okay ONLY because he was an incredibly talented trainer who trained all kinds of people from all walks of life. From other men, it can be infuriating, toxic, bullying, demoralizing, just shit.  This is all about power, dominance, control, make no doubt about it. You have two ways, to my thinking, to deal with this: go completely grey rock and do not react at all, because they want to provoke a reaction. Your reaction today, while completely understandable, was reactive abuse. They push and push and push, and when you go off, OMG they're just shocked. Bullshit, they were aiming for an explosion.   The other thing you can do is Marquis of Queensbury's rules: absolutely NOTHING is held back. Make jokes about how much of a whore their mother is, how small their peens are, anything you can think of. Make it THE MOST unforgivable, off the charts obnoxious shit you can think of, and just let the chips fall where they may. You WILL hit some sore spots, and when you do, keep punching. Jab til they hurt. Remember, this is about power and dominance. And if this feels absolutely unfamiliar, it should; women are, by and large, socialized to cooperate and collaborate, not compete and do hierarchical, one up/one down crap like this.	1642554846.0	ht99py7	t3_s76ze9	t3_s76ze9	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s76ze9/being_disrespected_at_work/ht99py7/

It was an unspoken fact that some of that money would go into a "fuck off" stash in case the man did something stupid.

He's stopped to eat, he's stopped to shit, he's had time to shoot you a quick text.  LVM feel that if they're not getting goodies, why bother. Investing in building a relationship over facetime until you can resume seeing each other in person doesn't give him what he feels entitled to.  Watch him swing back around to meet in person once this wave dies down, as if nothing happened in between.  Honestly, don't get sucked into a 'texting phase' during a time when men can't take you on dates. It's giving them attention for free.	1642560537.0	ht9mrl6	t3_s7ew38	t3_s7ew38	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7ew38/texting_advice/ht9mrl6/

8w9ask4b	Housing. Is he willing to be all in and open to making a life with a future wife, wherever that may lead (mutual respect for both careers, families, etc.)?  I've talked to men who: 1. One divorced dad only rented a 2-bdrm over two years after his divorce because he needed an office space because he's been working from home due to Covid-19. This guy isn't lacking financially (one bit). Once he got more space, then he said that now his daughter is able to come sleepover (in his office/her bedroom). First of all, wtf? Why didn't he prioritize her from the start? I think that she'd sometimes stay with his parents when he had custody or something. Anyway...  2. Guy who told me that he was looking into real estate and buying a new house in out nowhere (45 min from modern civilization) because he'd get more bang for his buck (also excruciatingly not lacking financially, and can afford to live in NYC if he wanted). Umm, no thanks. I'm not going to be someone's last item on the life checklist. 3. Guy who'd likely be too family enmeshed to make an independent decision as a couple 4. Another one who thought that I'd be pleased about living with him in his already packed house filled with his mother's boxes of trinkets and fine China (likely lead painted and unsafe for actual use, and def not microwave/dishwasher safe). Like, get your mom a temperature-controlled storage unit. If she has no space for 10"x6" worth of boxes (he even moved 3 places with them! They used to border, floor to almost ceiling, his former 1bdrm's entire dining/living room wall).  Yea. I once really wanted a shared home with someone. Now, I'm unsure.   I'm hoping my feelings will change when I meet a better (i.e., healthy, loving, and committed) match.	1642560595.0	ht9mwg3	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht9mwg3/

They do see you through the lens of what they can use you for, and they’ll sneak this into conversation to test how willing you are to provide or perform for them.

omr46	Yep!! A guy I dated NEVER called me by my real name. Only a nickname I created “Kay” which was the first initial of my real name, on dating apps. Usually when I finally meet someone from OLD, I tell them my real name. But noooo, not this guy. We ended up just being friends and he kept calling me Kay for MONTHS, although I kept correcting him time and time again. I finally put my foot down and decided that I’m not gonna take his shit and told him to call me my real name. He decides to shit test me afterwards and called me “Kay” anyway. I ignored his ass. The next time he messages me he calls me by my real name.. finally. These men only get away with what you let them get away with. I’ve been more firm with him and establishing my boundary… and he’s finally respecting me… and I feel damn good about it.

enqjhavz	I totally get it, 100%.  You're absolutely right.  It feels like you've gone through the looking glass.  The experts all say that no one can predict an abuser's next action as well as his current victim, and they say the most dangerous time in the relationship is when you try to leave ... and then they pathologize your hypervigilance around him during exactly that most dangerous time.   And god forbid you be more accurate than they are while you're still with him ... if you're coping relatively well with the insane demands of living in hell, do you even want to leave?  Are you even battered? Maybe you like this?   I had to take a break from the entire battered women's industrial complex for a few years after leaving my first husband. It's not entirely sure how it feels about battered women, and there was so much internalized misogyny in a lot of the otherwise well-meaning women I encountered.  I felt like I was performing "battered woman" long after I'd moved into the anger and rebuilding phases ... and that performance was a woman who never would have lasted a day in the actual abusive relationship, so I'm not sure where they got the idea that this was how I should be.	1642563466.0	ht9t6v3	t3_s61b7p	t1_ht93m1n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s61b7p/an_open_letter_to_woman_considering_aa/ht9t6v3/

4ituqtx6	I used to think this, but the last guy I dated with opened my eyes to the possibility. He actually *likes* women - as people (the bar is in hell, I know). He had many female friends, but also many male friends as well, just a large social circle. He spoke very highly of his female friends, never mentioned their looks but rather their accomplishments, and showed genuine interest while in conversation with women, no matter who they were. Definitely made me suspicious initially, due to being cheated on by an ex with many female friends, but I quickly noticed the difference and the genuineness. It is possible! Him and I didn’t work out for unrelated issues, but I’m glad to have dated him for giving me that insight.  I think the problem comes from men being friends with women they would either date or are attracted to. If his female friend came onto him, would he date her? Or sleep with her? If the answer isn’t a resounding no then it’s an issue. If he can’t be sincere friends with women he’s not attracted to then it’s not sincere.	1642564374.0	ht9v48l	t3_s74wrl	t1_ht827mz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/ht9v48l/

I am often scared to repeat the same mistakes and like a lot of us here, have more than enough trauma from poorly judgment of who to place trust in. It takes constant reminding that I am different and wiser now.   The step-by-step list is practical cuz it teaches us to embed an emotional ICK with red flags, and re-write the mistakes with what we know differently today! Going to make this a practice.

owunw4l	I have a similar issue. I have hormonal issues coupled with a neurodivergent brain, so I have a higher libido AND sex feels amazing for me, I literally get euphoric high from it. It's a sensation I can't achieve otherwise, even through masturbation. Alcohol is the next closest thing that can produce that feeling for me.   So if I want to control my impulse to sleep with a guy too soon, I usually keep the dates in public spaces - no going to each other's homes. Also, staying occupied with work or a some other personal project helps to keep me off dating apps (where I've met the majority of my sexual partners).	1642565239.0	ht9wxcv	t3_s7gkwb	t3_s7gkwb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/ht9wxcv/
3z87uwbx	What's your end goal? Are you looking for a stable relationship? Do you want marriage?  Even if you're OK with the huge risks that come along with casual sex (I'm not), you're wasting your time if your objective is to find a partner. There's a 0.002% chance something that's just a good romp ends in something long term, and you're investing energy in quick ego boosts instead of focusing on what you really want.  So, how do you do it? You focus on the end goal. Recognize that you need to stop focusing on sex and to start prioritizing the things that will result in a successful relationship. Yes, sex is very important, but it's not a huge indicator of long term compatibility.	1642565239.0	ht9wxel	t3_s7gkwb	t3_s7gkwb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/ht9wxel/

This is especially if he is chewing gum/brushing his teeth before kissing me. Otherwise not acceptable.   -Poor hygiene/grooming (showers less than daily, dirty/ragged nails)  -dismissive of pets' value   -overly uncalloused hands and/or limp-wristed. This is a giveaway he probably will not help jump start your car, or not know basic car tasks for his own vehicle.

If you are genuinely excited for a date you will feel optimistic, full stop, not "gee, let's see how it goes 😕"   - lies about anything, even "white lies." showing he isn't strong enough to tell the truth and own it.

Just not clever enough to speak eloquently and plainly.   - dead eyes, from pornsickness or sociopathic tendencies   -bumbling about anything, refusing to learn new things or at least try, no curiosity  -any kind of acting like a child, even jokingly.

If any hair is falling past the ears, it is probably too long.  - low T. When the man's father looks like he is more protective/able to pummel someone in self-defense compared to his son  - Pretending to be very "wholesome" and "innocent"  (see: Gino's character from 90 Day Fiance)  it' a turnoff period, but moreso when the guy is just hiding perversion/pornsickness   - untrimmed ear/nose hair   - dressing like an old man (sandals with socks)  -hunched gamer posture  - not listening, and instead responding with something "cute" and generic to avoid actually taking me seriously   - saying "I love you " over and over again that makes me feel pressured and smothered, even if we both said it already  - trilbys (neckbeard "fedoras") -- yes I know this is a quirk on my part, not all hat wearers but i just can't   - stringy hair from greasiness, not product  -men with sickly-pale skin (borderline scurvy from not eating veggies 😂)  -men who cannot accept balding and have weird patches of longer hair with the balding.

Double standard    -men who pick on easy targets (like beating you in a video game when he has more experience with the game, and acting very high and mighty)  -gatekeeping   - knowing the man is not competent enough to take care of himself, thus you could not trust him to take you to the ER in case of an emergency or accident   - 50-50  - criticizes when men are generous/treat partners well  -demonizes "snooping" over infidelity   -excuses infidelity, or gives unsolicited reassurance he thinks cheating is wrong   -doesn't tip in countries where tipping is expected   - doesn't want to leave his home   - resents women's grooming / makeup rituals   -anything else to make you suspect the man is a Redditor 🤡	1642566895.0	hta0at7	t3_s74wrl	t3_s74wrl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s74wrl/strangest_icks_and_dealbreaker/hta0at7/

If you’re still getting tested every 3 months for STDs like you said, then you’re probably not ready for a serious relationship anyways. I think your next step is deciding what you want.

j8bst	Yeah I think a combo of being disgusted/ disappointed by men over the years + thinking of intimacy/ access to me as being only for people I really like and respect… and realizing it takes a little while to figure out who that is.  I was mostly dating men I was already acquainted with for a while, from my community,  and they had social ties and a reputation to maintain.  Then I moved to a new city and was meeting way worse, more dangerous men in bars or men who didn’t measure up from apps. Like one night I took a big risk allowing a stranger into my home (but not my body lol) and realized afterward how bad the situation I put myself and my housemate in was. Maybe it just takes one of those to freak you out enough to make casual unappealing.	1642568636.0	hta3nd1	t3_s7gkwb	t3_s7gkwb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/hta3nd1/

My experience on OLD severely affected my self esteem because it demonstrated to me that my high effort would always be met with lackluster enthusiasm and cheap dates.

9f513x5h	If you've ever survived an abusive relationship, you're tougher than millions of people who have never had to ever experience one.  I also hate how the term "narcissist" is just thrown around these days. It's pathologizing the abuser by giving them something that on the DSM rather than just calling abuse, abuse. It's also misused so now anyone with bad behavior is a "narcissist". Suddenly millions of people getting divorced are divorcing a "narcissist". Your ex cheated on you, suddenly that's abuse. Uhh, no... your ex was a scrote, but unless you have legitimately experienced abuse (coercive or physical), you have no idea how difficult it is to simply leave or what women have had to do to survive. Your ex abused you but was a "good dad"? No such thing. An abusive ex will use your children against you, will eventually abuse your female children, IS NEVER a good father.  One of my criticisms of lib fems is that they have used the terminology for toxic masculinity to suit men's agendas by weaponizing male feelings. So if a man tries to manipulate you by crying, you can't call it manipulation, because you're reinforcing toxic masculinity. No, actually that's just a toxic man using feminism against you.  And to bring this back to the OP's topic, the 13th steppers in AA, are just weaponizing the ideas of AA to take advantage of vulnerable women. They are in an environment where they get to share their deepest uncensored feelings and failings. Some of them will just lie about their intentions so they can find out a woman's weaknesses in order to manipulate them into sex.	1642569269.0	hta4tua	t3_s61b7p	t1_ht9t6v3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s61b7p/an_open_letter_to_woman_considering_aa/hta4tua/

owunw4l	As someone who's in a similar situation to OP.... I'm BY FAR the most sexually promiscuous out of any of my friends. Because I know I'm engaging in risky behavior, I actually engage in safer sex practices than any of my friends: I get tested once a month, get pap smears more often, and am more strict about using condoms. The women that I know who have gotten STIs (or unintentionally pregnant) didn't have many sexual partners and let their guards down because of it.  And just like potential boyfriends, causal sex partners need to be vetted too.	1642569626.0	hta5h6q	t3_s7gkwb	t1_ht9xr0u	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/hta5h6q/
9tqfzv4a	It sounds like stepping off the roller coaster might offer some clarity. From what you've described, it sounds like you're on autopilot. Could you step back for a while? I'd stop dating all together because it'll be too tempting in the early stages. Get to know yourself instead of distracting yourself with dates. Reinvest that energy into starting new hobbies, business ideas and making female friends.   Sex positivity is BS anyways, you're giving men what they want.

d7oax4lp	It's just so transparent, like first of all, what guy would have the energy to even want to meet up with a woman face to face that they don't like at all, just to break up with them? So much easier and simpler to ghost her or just do the good ol' text to break up method, both are free of charge. It just seems a bit too contrived on his part to want to turn this into a much bigger deal than it has to be. They talked for 10 months... they don't sleep together, made much effort to be in each other's lives unless they were bored and talked on the phone like idle teenagers, or labeled each other as bf/gf. She is just as uninterested as he thinks he is with her.  Only difference, is that if she realizes she's about to get left behind for another girl, she'll probably feel confused but never the less relieved not having to keep answering his annoying "yo u awake?" messages.	1642569884.0	hta5xsd	t3_s7cydw	t1_hta1wic	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7cydw/you_can_date_a_man_for_ten_months_think_youre_his/hta5xsd/

bc7m409d	Right. Its like how we would also strongly suggest for another woman looking to curb her drinking behaviors to stop drinking when she goes to parties.   Of course, you are in control of your behavior. We truly just have to face ourselves and deal with our stuff. Only you know what is going to work to keep you away from that fine c**k charcuterie. We stop when we decide to stop. In your case maybe Id start small, put up some barriers with men, stop inviting them in your home.   Do a c**k detox. Get a realistic 6 incher or an entire machine. Find other things that feel good that keep you alive.   Indulge your other senses and pleasures. But a blanket that feels good and then wrap yourself naked in it. A yummy candle. Paraffin treatment. Healthy touch like massage. Trade if you dont have the money if you can.   Think of the potential consequences. Remind yourself of situations other women have gone through. Ive realized a pregnancy scare isnt worth it for me. Or a herpes scare. Ive had enough "abnormal" paps. I know its being a killjoy, but it keeps me away from fucking people I ultimately shouldnt.  Maybe seek out a boyfriend? Or... if you have any bi tendencies start hooking up with women. Less STD risk that way and zero pregnancy risk.	1642570190.0	hta6hi0	t3_s7gkwb	t1_hta2mmv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/hta6hi0/

2ghig8vu	Hey OP I'm not trying to be condescending, I've never been into casual sex so I don't know the steps people take to be safer. The reason I don't smoked is because the possible consequences outweighs whatever I could get out it. Many of my family members are gynecologist so since I was a young adult, I have been hearing the horror stories. In men some strains of HPV can't be detected, the vaccine can't protect you from all strains of HPV and it can also go undected on your body and later on cause problems, that's without mentioning that new super strains are appearing. Knowing that was enough to steered me off if I ever were to consider it. Some people don't know that as the mainstream media like to say everyone has herpes so who cares!? But that's not true. Specially for woman, some STDs can be a lot more than just an itch. If that doesn't steer you, that's okay.	1642570673.0	hta7cb7	t3_s7gkwb	t1_hta0mw1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/hta7cb7/

cw7827nc	The thing that’s really disturbing about this is that he’s only going through this elaborate “friends”rules because she never slept with him. If she had already slept with him and he met somebody else he wanted to be exclusive with he would just block her on everything and act like she was crazy if she ever ran into him in public. But even though he’s met someone who he deigns worthy of commitment, he’s still obsessed with the vagina that got away. Stuff like this honestly makes me lose all hope. It’s like you’re damned if you do, and damned if you don’t. She did the right thing by not sleeping with him, but he’s still trying to hustle her. It’s like you can’t win. But if nothing else, it absolutely proves why you should hold out on men.

Now, this never has actually come to pass, and life experience, anecdotal evidence, and actual research have changed my mind. SAHDs do not do as good a job as SAHMs on average and put in significantly less effort on average. They are also the demographic with the highest chance of cheating. So basically, they’ll do a half-assed job of everything and cheat on you while you support them entirely.

Obviously sending your nudes is not empowering when you literally have zero control over what the recipients (men) do with them once they have them.	1642561245.0	ht9oee8	t3_s6ufge	t1_ht9mptb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6ufge/liberal_feminism_at_its_best/ht9oee8/

I only sort of believed him but gave him the benefit of the doubt 🤡   I caught him out in various little white lies throughout our time together…  When I broke up with him, he was trying for months to get back with me…but after some sleuthing I figured out he had a girlfriend. Guess who it was? Yup! Good old Sarah. Turns out they weren’t quite finished when he was dating me for the first time either.

a19i2ivx	I agree with that. Lundy Bancroft's "why does he do that?" Even points out that abusive men choose when to snap, and even gave an example of a man destroying stuff when he is mad, and when his SO is asked if he mostly destroys his own things or things that are hers... she realized he only destroyed things that she needed and were important to her.  Most abusers seem to be very calculated in their abuse, which makes it even worse than if they had no control imo.  The guys I talked about in my previous comment likely had some sort of drug in their system. Most likely alcohol.	1642692371.0	htguruf	t3_s8c442	t1_htgjrms	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8c442/the_male_version_of_abcdefu_is_literally_domestic/htguruf/
5cp1c9w0	Yes! Both of these are overlooked far too much! Women tend to be blamed and then blame themselves if he lies - ‘oh it must be because she’s too hard on him and he knew she wouldn’t like the LIE.’  And yes, even Lundy Bancroft talks about this in his book ‘Why does he do that’ - most men who claim to have been abused, were actually the abuser themselves. This checked out twice in my time. One of the guys I dated seriously, the other one I only went on one date and then dipped out because I got a bad vibe from him. Later down the line found out he was trying to cheat with me, on a woman he had been dating for a while (who was an acquaintance of mine)…and had abused her and the girl before that. But of course, he played the victim.	1642692488.0	htgv2ia	t3_s7z9w6	t1_htd2kbc	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7z9w6/we_have_to_stop_putting_up_with_this_shit/htgv2ia/
59j5jj81	Shame on him for projecting his issues on you. A woman could be both (beautiful and smart), either, or neither, and in all cases she still deserves to be treated according to her fundamental rights as a human being. There was no need for him to try and “protect you.” Not that it matters, but given the relentless sexualization and predation on women I’d rather not even be seen as pretty and instead be virtually unnoticeable by the majority of the male population.   I loathe the fact that society, and by default many parents, even comment on girls’ looks to begin with when it’s widely understood and accepted that boys are innocent children which should be left out of toxic conversations about appearance and unbothered with conventional beauty standards.	1642692597.0	htgvcj1	t3_s8g16r	t1_htgd4fd	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/htgvcj1/

847tjefl	Hi OP, you’re not alone. I got my nose done when I was 19 bc I hated it so much and the first year or two I loved it but then reality hit and saw how different people treated me. It was like night and day the way I perceived ppl treated me after the surgery. It felt like people were nicer and men too, hell even my own mom!! My dad never really mentioned my nose growing up but my grandma (his mom, whose nose i had) would make vile comments about my body growing up. She’d say I would be prettier if I had a different nose or would point out how big my ass was and grab it etc, while my mom would hardly complement me at all. So, with both of these women who played important  roles in my life made me feel less than what I was I decided that getting my nose done would make me feel better and make everything ok, it didn’t lol After the nose job I noticed my mom calling me pretty more often while my grandma would too. I hit me hard with how much they started commenting it because it just reinforced the silly idea that I wasn’t good enough prior to the surgery, that i truly was ugly but now i’ve realized that THEY were the ones who were wrong and not me (my appearance ) rather than helping and giving me the tools to have a healthy self esteem they did everything they could to tear it down. I find it pathetic and hilarious now whenever they make comments about my body (the topic now is how hairy I am /yawn/) because I love my body the way it is. I now know (my soul) that I won’t ever mutilate my body for the approval of others the next time I take the form of a human (or any other being). It took me a long time to accept my nose job and am very grateful that it wasn’t botched but if i could go back in time i would to tell myself i’ll be ok without it.	1642693604.0	htgxxdl	t3_s8g16r	t3_s8g16r	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/htgxxdl/

3bii2bnm	Makeup can wash off though  It doesn’t require your face to be sliced up by a male surgeon  It’s non invasive in that way  Even eyebrow waxing etc not that invasive - won’t require you to sit in a hospital bruised, bloody & scarred   Most profiting surgeons are male, most paying patients are female  And the concern is what happens when everyone looks the same ?  What’s the next standard? And the next?  It’s just a bit silly when 20 year olds are getting Botox   They don’t even have wrinkles but they’re getting their forehead filled with Botox?  It’s getting excessive   I’m also seeing women who were already very conveniently attractive just getting more & more work done   To the point they look like inflatable pornstars  Then they get too much done, and get more insecure, then get more work to correct it  We’re not plastic dolls. Things can go wrong when you get that much surgery    And does it have any real effect on women’s esteem & how men treat us?  I think ppl have this idea that they’ll be magically safe from misogyny once they become more conventional   Or they have this mindset of ‘if I beat these other women a guy will give me loyalty’  No - misogynists will still cheat on you.   They do it to pretty women all the time.   Maybe even more so cos they’ll get intimidated & seek more control  Men can get very controlling with attractive women   There’s a ton of beautiful abused celebs who prove this  They don’t think about the extra hate / sexual harassment & abuse they’ll get as well  Misogynists take a lot of glee in taking conventional women down a notch or abusing / cheating on them to feel less insecure    It’s not gonna be all rainbows  You’ll get a new set of problems with increased attention   Men will also use attractive women just to attract more women to cheat with etc - treat them as objects or trophies but not actually love them   I think we have to draw the line somewhere  If you look at indigenous cultures, even some of the men wore paint on their faces   Cleopatra, wore kohl eye liner- she often used natural substances to emphasise features  The history of makeup etc goes back quite a while  Although it has got excessive now bc of the capitalist digital realm we find ourselves in where ppl are competing for visual attention   That has a lot more to do with it   The real issue is with ppl getting surgery claiming it’s natural- many celebs come to mind.   Then they are setting unrealistic standards  Even with makeup you can see people’s features shining through and their uniqueness   But now everyone is slowly starting to look like a clone   To the point that men are interrogating women’s natural features   And I feel this is gonna give their kids esteem issues   The trouble is most ppl cannot afford top surgeons or the after care if things go wrong   The media presents this fairytale transformation where all their problems suddenly disappear  They don’t have any longterm health issues, their relationship is magically better  We don’t see them five years later with breathing difficulties divorced  Cosmetic surgery shows  like The Swan for example showed women getting surgery bc their boyfriend cheated   They fed the current culture we have now  Men still cheat on models. It won’t fix the problem   There’s a lot more women meeting these beauty standards now  And men are still cheating on them, & not respecting them & playing them against eachother  To them all they see is ‘yey more choice, why settle down’  Most need an internal , mental level up more than anything   I meet many women who have swapped their insecurity about having small breasts….with being insecure about having fake breasts  They haven’t tackled the root mental problem & so they don’t feel much better off   They still feel jealous, insecure & competitive around women   What was the point of it then?	1642694013.0	htgz0b9	t3_s8g16r	t1_htgho09	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/htgz0b9/

I was confused because she looked like she's in her mid to late 20s She's gorgeous. Another woman I used to work with I thought was 35-38ish. Later, it came up in casual conversation that she'd going to celebrate her 65th birthday soon. She had a fantastic figure, always came into the office with above the knee classy, gorgeous dresses, heels and beautiful hairstyles. She's single and happy. Men will age you.But even women who look their age get hit on ALL the time.  They're still stunning. I met s woman at a neighborhood bar who was always getting hit on. She was in her 60s and gorgeous. She really took care of herself, moisturised, sunscreen, he hair was always fire 🔥🔥, beautiful nails. Light gorgeous makeup. She dressed beautifully too. She ALWAYS had men of all ages hitting on her. She ignored most of them.  But the men  who were her age were so gross. Receding hairlines, sagging skin, some were bald, beer gut, yellow nails, bad teeth, sagging unmoisturezed skin.

He also knows that the text is going to be upsetting for her, but chooses to send it anyway. He gets a kick out of making her feel insecure, he’s abusive.  I’ve had ex’s that humiliated me in front of their friends and it was a horrible feeling. I hate to think what was said when I WASN’T there.

Since you said you’ll be focusing more on friendships and career, be sure to join the sister sub Female Level Up Strategy, which focuses more on these areas. I also dig fourthwavewomen, for more generalized discussion of how misogyny as a cultural factor impacts our lives. Just find the balance between this stuff and living life. Too much exposure to ugly realities can affect you emotionally, and it’s important to embrace the positive aspects of being a woman, and to be able to recognize that while patriarchy just is, good male partners (and men in general) do exist within it.	1642696710.0	hth67xz	t3_s8cruu	t3_s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/hth67xz/

Of course boys are easier, you let them do whatever while your daughters are forced to learn to care for themselves and everyone else. Which would be harder to train someone for?

c0y2cydk	First up you are really brave for writing all this down in such depth. You have really articulated your experience and I am positive that the very action of doing that will be helpful to you in processing and learning.  Secondly, remember you are in a sisterhood, not just here on FDS but among all the other women who have been through similar experiences with men just like this, who are out there everywhere all over the world, many more than you could ever imagine because such a vast proportion are not speaking or sharing what happened to them.  My best piece of advice in your future relationships is to listen to your gut. It does not lie, ever. Any time I have ignored my gut instinct I have come to regret it. An example being that I was with a man like the one you describe, who didn't like my sexual past and was constantly trying to punish me for it. I knew I should ditch him the moment he said the first word about it, but I didn't, instead I tried to 'work things out', because women are conditioned to bear the weight of other people's problems, issues and concerns. You don't have to do that. When your gut tells you a guy needs to fuck off, that guy needs to fuck off. Same when it tells you a situation feels weird, or uncertain, or simply unhappy. Trust yourself, and look after yourself - literally. It is your principal directive to keep yourself safe and secure, and optimise your mental and physical wellbeing. Get rid of anything in your life that is impeding that. It's not always simple with regards to jobs or housing but we can exercise complete quality control over the men we date.	1642697321.0	hth7v1i	t3_s8cruu	t3_s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/hth7v1i/

c2houkih	>Makeup can wash off though  The reason plastic surgery is problematic and OP is upset about it is that she thinks she did it for men and the choice to invest in it was driven by the impulse to appeal to men. For many women, the same holds true for makeup. The badness of plastic surgery isn't merely or even predominantly in its permanence but instead in who it's done for.  >It doesn’t require your face to be sliced up by a male surgeonIt’s non invasive in that way  It does require other sacrifices on the part of women (e.g. time or money) and depending on the ingredients used in makeup can also cause health complications. It's also not immediately obvious that a lifetime of engaging in an expensive habit is any more or less of a sacrifice than going through plastic surgery once and being done with it.  >Even eyebrow waxing etc not that invasive - won’t require you to sit in a hospital bruised, bloody & scarred  Eyebrow waxing is still painful and, more importantly, still might cater to the male gaze, at least to the extent that plastic surgery ostensibly does. You could make room for the idea that people eyebrow wax for themselves, but the same could then be said about plastic surgery. If, like OP, you think the 'for myself' rhetoric is just pick me self-gaslighting, then the same could be said about eyebrow waxing and makeup and any cosmetic thing largely marketed to women.  >Most profiting surgeons are male, most paying patients are female  Most people who profit off of the makeup industry are male, most consumers who fund the industry are female.  >And the concern is what happens when everyone looks the same ?  Makeup can be used to help people realized idealized beauty norms that follow trends as well. What drives people looking the same is the choice to follow a trend - that choice is open regardless of whether people follow trends via plastic surgery or makeup.  >What’s the next standard? And the next?  Perpetually evolving beauty standards drive the entire cosmetic industry, which encompasses both makeup and plastic surgery.  >It’s just a bit silly when 20 year olds are getting BotoxThey don’t even have wrinkles but they’re getting their forehead filled with Botox?  It's no more silly than 13 year olds putting on makeup. Both evidence, at the core, a dissatisfaction with how one looks without any 'improvements' at all.  >I’m also seeing women who were already very conveniently attractive just getting more & more work doneTo the point they look like inflatable pornstars  Although this is a thing scrotes say, and what makes its scrotey is that scrotes just think women wearing 'natural makeup' are wearing no makeup, plenty of attractive women still feel the need to wear makeup and make themselves look different. Ultimately, real respect and power can be afforded to women only if it doesn't matter how they look - whether that's attractive, like an inflatable pornstar or like they just got out of bed.  >We’re not plastic dolls. Things can go wrong when you get that much surgery  Things can go wrong with makeup too (e.g. many women get illnesses after chronic use of parabens found in makeup). While plenty of women use makeup and don't end up developing medical disorders because of it, the same could be said of women who get plastic surgery. The badness of plastic surgery (and makeup) isn't rooted in the potential ill consequences for health, but instead in what OP is highlighting: it's driven by insecurities, self-objectification, and patriarchy.  >If you look at indigenous cultures, even some of the men wore paint on their facesCleopatra, wore kohl eye liner- she often used natural substances to emphasise features  If you look at *our* culture, makeup is gendered and the overwhelming majority of its consumers are women. You could say 'more men are using makeup now than before' but that doesn't mean it's truly equal or isn't still gendered. Since we're critiquing the practices of women who currently exist, it makes sense to critique *our* culture. Applying the norms of some prior culture to justify a current practice is a bit like saying 'in the past people didn't have sewage systems so they'd just dump their waste in the streets, so we should be doing that now'. Alternatively, just because a practice was done historically, as was the case with kohl and Cleopatra, doesn't mean it was justified or right (that logic would justify a host of reprehensible things e.g. marital rape, slavery etc.). Ancient Egypt was also a generally misogynistic society in which a woman's role was predominantly as a mother and wife, yet we wouldn't take this historical fact to justify treating women this way now.  I *think* the tone of the rest of your post suggests you think I'm supportive of plastic surgery, but in truth I'm actually part of the 'no makeup' gang and like drawing parallels between plastic surgery and makeup because I think our intuitions about the former haven't been corrupted by patriarchy nearly to the same degree as the latter. I didn't want to make my position on this too obvious in my original post, since people often have knee-jerk 'I-I'm doing it for me I swear' reactions to feminist critiques of makeup. But, like OP, I think such reactions are ultimately inauthentic.	1642697631.0	hth8q54	t3_s8g16r	t1_htgz0b9	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/hth8q54/

3bii2bnm	Lol it’s funny I have had no trouble orgasming with attractive, confident, athletic men who actually have the intuition to read what I like & care about pleasing me   Smart men know that if you please a woman properly first, he’s going to get rewarded with some genuine enthusiasm back which boosts his confidence and pleases you = good sexual chemistry/ give & take   If you listen to what she likes, don’t overstep the mark  etc…she’s gonna relax & enjoy herself / feel safe   The reason most men can’t sexually connect with their partner…(often all their doing)   Is cos they’re constantly belittling her, goading her, denying her basic respect, ogling other women triangulating her, playing hostile mind games & spreading themselves across 3 women behind her back  Women can sense that shit intuitively and it turns them all the way off & makes them tense / hostile   Why would they go to town on a man that rude   That’s enough to kill anyone’s drive …even if you did fancy them	1642699498.0	hthdxeu	t3_s88mdh	t1_hth49t4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s88mdh/sigh_ladies_tell_me_what_you_think/hthdxeu/

It’s not often I feel this way and I only ever feel this way in relationships where I am taken care of. My rule is me first then you because I know I won’t leave them hanging and it’s easier to chase subsequent orgasms after the first. But every now and then I just don’t have the energy for it but I want the intimacy and so I don’t care about it.

Fat, ugly, old, 10 children, stupid, etc. so many of them said they would take ANYONE.  Dude. Your desperation is so loud, women can smell it when you're near. You hate yourself, have no self respect, have no standards and you  reflect that on the world around you. The truth is, these dudes dont just hate women. They hate men more lively and social than them, they hate men that are nice to women, they hate their families, they have no friends.   For people so low and powerless in the world, they NEED women to feel inferior. They want older women to lower their standards, and keep young girls humble by parroting this stupid "wall" shit. Even when the old creeps get young women they're angry because she's there for his money 🥴 The truth is, these dudes feel so worthless and are aware they're unlovable people, so they need to knock people down to their level so they can feel just an ounce of power and control.	1642702244.0	hthljmx	t3_s8ipsv	t3_s8ipsv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8ipsv/part_2_i_blocked_him_but_he_used_someone_elses/hthljmx/

As a kid, we taught him to pick up, vacuum and dust his room, run and fold his own laundry, load a dishwasher, clean the cat box and feed the pets, take out the garbage as needed and put out the cans every week.   He was also taught to make simple things in the microwave. Quesadillas, oatmeal, hot dogs, etc.  Mothers, if a mentally retarded child can learn and employ these tasks, your neuro-typical kid can too.

I stopped wearing make up completely and don't partake in body hair removal because I was never doing it for me.   I do get my eyebrows threaded every few months. And I'm in hair school because I freaking love hair changes. I've had all different colors mostly done by myself. I've had all different cuts from a shaved head to down to my boobs.   You are right that it's about understanding what is actually for you and what isn't.

v4qqb	Am not a parent so this is purely an opinion - but I do think sons *have* to be treated with far more discipline and authority that daughters. Just based on the reason that the entire society is hell-bent on turning boys into horrible adults by teaching them that smoking, drugs, alcohol, hookups, treating women like shit, cheating etc. etc. are cool and "manly".  Whenever I have to deal with school-aged students I found that softer and friendlier approach work on girls - but with boys it just have to be full authority mode or else they won't listen to you.	1642703235.0	htho9e8	t3_s8mqwe	t3_s8mqwe	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htho9e8/

eo34pdbz	I would say that has more to do with the patriarchy and how boys are raised not to respect "female" (aka "the friendly approach") authority. If they learn at home that when mom says "Pick up your clothes, please" in a friendly voice is more of an option than an obligation because there are no real consequences if they don't (and they are only *really* in trouble if someone shouts or tells dad), it's not wonder they won't respond to that approach later in school.   Girls are also taught from earliest childhood on to be more aware of other people's emotions and moods and to accomodate them, take responsibility for them and make people happy - as toxic as that can be. They know that mom may not shout if they don't do their chores, but that doesn't mean she isn't pissed or disappointed. It's a basic survival mechanism if you are used to being the weaker party in conflicts: Pay attention to the mood of the people who could harm you or make your life difficult, see the clues that something may happen before it actually does, because by then it's too late. A boy just sees "Mom doesn't shout, so it's not really a problem".	1642703902.0	hthq3e1	t3_s8mqwe	t1_htho9e8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/hthq3e1/

8zttver0	Actually, lab diamonds don't come cheap. Just google "lab diamond prices", and a 3 ct diamond actually costs close to 20 k € (convert to $ at your discretion), so it's not quite that. He certainly didn't cheap out on her.   However, he didn't quite match her preference which she hadn't ever expressed before to his knowledge. Which is unfortunate.  However, what in my opinion puts her in the asshole territory is the fact that first, she was only worried that her BF might have been given a "fake" because it didn't cost enough, and once she found it the diamond was lab-grown, she suddenly could see the difference she hadn't seen before.  What puts him in asshole territory is that not only he refuses to exchange the ring for a "real" one of the same value (although I have my doubts his fiancée would be happy with the smaller stone, either), but also his language. "being firm with her" sounds like he sees her like a child he needs to parent, which she most assuredly isn't.  Ergo: They both suck, they both deserve each other - but instead, they decided to grace the rest of humanity with their fresh availability on the dating scene. \*sigh\*	1642705842.0	hthvegx	t3_s88hwr	t1_htfaftw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s88hwr/aita_for_buying_my_fiancée_a_labgrown_diamond_and/hthvegx/

Men still hanging out with their high school friends really only goes two ways: It's either a really good friend group of mutual support and growth that stuck together precisely *because* they kept developing after finishing school, or it's a shitshow of people who stuck together because they *didn't* develop one single bit after graduation. No middle ground. It's either 'lovely group of men supporting each other on their very different life paths' or 'bunch of teenagers in the bodies of grown men still thinking fart jokes and abuse are the height of masculinity'.

They don't want to date the woman they're approaching, and they may not even expect to ever get the chance to have sex with her. They're just dipping a toe in, seeing what they can get away with and what there's an opportunity for. Flirting, sexting, ego boost.

It's so eerie, reading someone else describing your exact situation, but with just the details changed. When I went through what you've just gone through, it really fucked me up. This happened about 20 years ago and it took me longer to get to the same realization that you are having.   I'm so happy for you that you are free from this absolute parasite and that you've found FDS. If I had access to this community back then I know my life would look MUCH different than it does now.   The type of abuse that this man perpetrated against you is so deep and insidious and evil. You have survived hell by getting rid of him. Forgive yourself. Forgive yourself completely. Understand that none of the things he said and implanted in your mind about you are actually true; they're lies.   Use the resources here to unlearn all the lies, and to learn everything there is to know about yourself. Your sisters will always have your back. You are strong and intelligent and capable and I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself.	1642705665.0	hthuxjk	t3_s8cruu	t3_s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/hthuxjk/
4gmnd1jd	Men's beliefs about women are informed by what the men around them believe about women. In the FDS podcast episode with Lundy Bancroft, he says the women in a man's life are not responsible for how he behaves around women, because he models his behaviour on the men in his life. It's not your fault. There's literally nothing you could have done because men will always identify with other men, even if they claim to love you very much you're still just a woman to them.	1642707163.0	hthywse	t3_s8mqwe	t1_hthfdy8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/hthywse/

I'm in my mid-thirties and now have crow's feet when I smile... and I LOVE them! As someone who has always had a baby face and looked younger than my age, it's been infuriating that people take me less seriously at work because I look like an intern, being referred to as a 'girl' or 'young lady' when I'm a goddamn adult and having issues dating men my own age because they look a generation older.

gtpp4	Fyi I think "being exclusive" IS the same as being "boyfriend & girlfriend". Was when I was growing up / 10 years ago, anyway  > even though I told him that the request was controlling (it is, right?)  Yes. For future reference, if you are subjected to controlling behavior, don't tell the offender about their error and hope for them to reform. They won't. Just bail.  > I called him out on being abusive and controlling and sexually coercive  Same again, here. I truly understand the impulse. But if you notice abusive behavior in someone, don't try to talk them into changing. It just won't work. If they cared about not being abusive/controlling, then they would already be avoiding that behavior. If they cared about being nice to you, they would be nice to you.  > during the relationship it felt like I wasn’t able to think logically, which prevented me from fully seeing what was happening   Unfortunately, this is super normal. The stress of frequent abuse addles the mind. Don't be too hard on yourself, I bet most women have found themselves in your shoes at least once. The greatest advice I think I can offer there is: learn to treat your own feelings as a good reason to leave. When you are feeling anxious, insecure, confused, stressed, sad, angry, unsure of yourself, unhappy, that alone is a rock-solid reason to leave the relationship you feel that way in behind you. That way you don't need to assess what he's doing, if it's bad "enough", if you're being "fair" to him. Base everything on how you feel. If you don't feel happy, comfortable, and confident-- leave.	1642707598.0	hti0373	t3_s8cruu	t3_s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/hti0373/

dscckfse	I guess your culture must have a 'getting to know each other' phase that doesn't involve dating? So you only go on first dates with someone you already know quite well.  In which case, you need to do the 'multiple guy' thing during that earlier phase. You talk to a lot of guys, get to know them in a culturally appropriate way, make sure they know you aren't exclusively talking to them and I guess being asked on a date is the indicator that he wants to be exclusive/become your boyfriend.	1642709019.0	hti3z3l	t3_s803er	t1_htg84vb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s803er/how_to_avoid_a_situationship/hti3z3l/

I really did do it for me, and in fact, may very well do it again since I have fat deposits on my upper arms that are genetic.   That said, I for one always believed in myself, even at my heaviest of over 400 lbs. My father, a Depression child, did tend to use shame-based parenting, but by the time I came along (older sister and brother), he and my late mother had mellowed a lot. I just know I felt and looked better after I had lipo, but mannnnnnnnnnn did it ITCH when healing!

My brother has been married for 10 years and a few years back my sisters and cousin mentioned they realized he’s a huge male chauvinist. And I said I noticed when we were teenagers. We loved to watch movies and when my dad arrived we’d all scramble to set the table amd heat the food for him. Once it was only me and my brother and I asked him why he wasn’t doing anything if it would delay watching the movie for us both and he said that whether he did anything or not I was gonna get yelled at if the food wasn’t on the table by the time my father was in the living room amd he wasn’t. Made it pretty clear to me that not only was he comfortable with me getting in trouble for his lazy ness he didn’t see anything wrong with it.	1642712191.0	htibcnh	t3_s8mqwe	t1_hthsinr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htibcnh/

9mlsk	At least there is acknowledgment that this is terrible. No child should have the threat of paying rent hanging over their head when they had no choice in being born or who their parents are. It's...idk...weird to me to think children owe us gratitude for our choice to not make them suffer unfairly. It doesn't teach them to have gratitude, it teaches them to fear the loss of housing, support, dignity, stability. All the while, their brains are growing, they're learning to self-regulate and set boundaries, they're learning what it means to take care of themselves and their things.  We're women trying to unlearn those same behaviors: feeling like we owe someone else for simply existing as who we are. I would say there is a parallel in a parent telling me as a child that I owe them gratitude for not being charged to live in my family home, and an adult women being told by a man that she owes him a date for not threatening her in some way when he hits on her.	1642712755.0	hticwmp	t3_s8mqwe	t1_hthaatl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/hticwmp/
9mlsk	Agreed. The line could be drawn from a child feeling too scared to mess up out of fear of being unfairly punished, to a woman feeling too scared to say "no" because of fear of being unfairly punished. How do we raise confident children if we demand their gratitude for what ultimately is their right to safety and security? How do we as women do all this work to undo cultural conditioning for pleasantness and compliance, then burden our children with the same kind of forced submission and forced gratitude?   I'm not talking about rules, boundaries, learning, I'm talking about the whole "be glad you don't have it worse!" approach. If men said that line to us we'd immediately identify it as LV. Stands to reason that a parent saying it is also LV.	1642713111.0	htidw3a	t3_s8mqwe	t1_hti00yx	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htidw3a/

8zttver0	I'm not so sure about that... When I grew up, there was a boy in the neighborhood. Classical bully, quite strong for his age, prone to violent outbursts of anger, liked to beat up other kids. The whole nine yards. Eventually, he was allowed to train martial arts if he promised to not beat up other kids - and, as far as I know, he didn't. However, the way he looked at everyone - like he was planning something truly evil. Those eyes - soulless and calculating... I firmly believe that he merely learned to hide it better, but that he hasn't truly changed.	1642714040.0	htighjh	t3_s8mqwe	t1_hti4key	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htighjh/

v4qqb	The difference in your story is that he is a bully *before* they allow him to learn martial arts - kinda like a band-aid solution to a gaping wound - of course it wouldn't work.  I am talking about starting young - like when he starts to be able to do chores, start training him in martial arts, instill the discipline and humbleness at the age where they are eager to learn. Usually the kids that do - that I know of - that have something like that in their routine aside from school and chores are calmer and more high-headed for a kid.	1642714411.0	htihj29	t3_s8mqwe	t1_htighjh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htihj29/

c2houkih	I think it depends on how you're conceiving of degrees. A lifetime of applying makeup, spending money on makeup, and learning about makeup seems, in a sense, like an even greater commitment than plastic surgery. Plastic surgery might permanently alter how you look but wearing makeup inculcates a lifelong habit - it permanently alters what you do and the shape of your life itself.  I also think you could probably differentiate between makeup and things like hair colours since non-natural hair colours and certain hairstyles are not conventionally attractive and, if anything, pull women away from conventional standards of beauty. Now, you could say some people use makeup in a similar way, but they certainly aren't the majority.  Sometimes I think we could take the same FDS-style approach towards BDSM and apply it to other forms of self-objectification. We're skeptical when people say they just 'happen' to get aroused by submissiveness in women, since this fetish happens to reflect actual norms and relationships fostered by patriarchy. Similarly, we might think that forms of self objectification that bring us closer to patriarchal beauty ideals (whether they be implemented via makeup or hairstyles or plastic surgery) probably warrant a greater degree of suspicion than ones that don't.	1642715374.0	htik7nn	t3_s8g16r	t1_hthnqcm	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/htik7nn/

1dd8f0z5	never got surgery but before i cut off my LVM father, because of his constant negging, i fully planned to get a nose job. It’s still not my favourite feature but without his awful voice in my ear ive definitely gotten much better self image. he used to neg me so much about every little thing i was thinking about/planning plastic surgery as young as 10.

2iv735i0	I have two sons - 24 and 16. With the oldest, I was already teaching him basic cooking skills, how to clean the house properly (no weaponized incompetence here). He already knew how to do laundry and fold clothes Japanese-style (Kondo) by the time he was in middle school. He saw the value in it when at school the teachers asked to fold their class shirts and he impressed them with his simple but very precise folding. When they both started working at 16, their bosses were impressed that they knew how to mop and do dishes correctly. This made my oldest level up faster and now works at a boujee gym.   Both of them would whine and say… why do I have to do this? Men shouldn’t be cleaning … blah blah blah. Esp since I was a SAHM for a long time. I reminded them that if they wanted to stay happily married, they needed to be able to do 50% of labor in the household. Also, majority women now work so men have to be able to keep up their half of running a household. I wanted my future daughter in laws to gain a partner and not another child they had to care for. I want my future grandchildren to have the best chances of being raised in a two parent HAPPY household.   Showing your sons how to balance home, school and work life is the best way to keep your legacy and family intact. One of the best ways of teaching respect for “unseen” housework is making them do it so they understand it doesn’t magically clean up on its own.	1642716111.0	htim7gq	t3_s8mqwe	t3_s8mqwe	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htim7gq/
ocmgr	Maybe their baby mama caught them. Maybe they got a girlfriend. Maybe they scratched an itch and changed their mind. Maybe they were never interested in the first place.   The truth is, you will never know, and it doesn’t matter. Would it be nice for all adults to communicate with sincerity and provide closure? Absolutely. But we advice women to block men often for fear of abuse or worse when rejected. Men likely block women for fear of guilt, or a lack of care to whatever your response would be. Whatever the reason, they clearly weren’t for you.	1642716140.0	htimaa3	t3_s8txhc	t3_s8txhc	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/htimaa3/

I had some man tell me exactly that - his ex is a stalker etc. etc. etc.  , and he blocked her in front of me.  He was cheating on her with me.

3lh0sgjj	Perhaps is time and money, it's a greater commitment over your life span if you always and forever engage in makeup practices but you can always decide to not to it anymore. Unlike plastic surgery that is a permanent change, only alterable by additional surgery and very unlikely to ever take you back to your original state.   But I think we are ultimately on the same side of this argument. I've given up the argument with people on make up and hair removal because it always ends in 'i feel better this way and like it and it's for me' which ultimately you can't argue. I'm not in the business of telling someone how they feel but there are obviously so many factors that push you into wearing make up in specific ways and ensuring no hair grows on your body.   I know it's a hard journey, but it's important to think about why you are doing something and where that concept came from.	1642716681.0	htinpwn	t3_s8g16r	t1_htik7nn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/htinpwn/

7xf9ck	Listened to a presentation by 2 chinese political lesbians yesterday (very brave of them - one of them had a shaking voice which could have been natural but sounded like fear) - they are hardcore in their philosophy. Even more so than western radical feminists.  They also spoke about ghost marriage and how if you die, your husbands family can sell YOUR DEAD BODY to be married to someone else.  I think I'd become a political lesbian too. Ewww.	1642716915.0	htioc62	t3_s7y5xp	t1_hthtnnn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7y5xp/indian_scrotes_threatening_to_boycott_marriage_if/htioc62/

Then it doesn't matter.   Change the perspective. Not what did YOU do wrong, WHY did he do that - no.

7a63r9jb	> Of course boys are easier, you let them do whatever  Spot on.  I actually think it is far *harder* to raise boys to be as well-socialized, responsible, kind, and helpful as girls, because you're fighting against every bit of media and culture and all of their peers and 99% of the male role models in their lives.    And the moment they leave home, they're likely to be able to find an infinite number of friends and romantic partners whose standards are rock-bottom for guys, so why bother to keep pushing themselves when they can coast instead?  Imagine spending 18 years trying to help your son become a decent human being, taking out student loans for him to go to college...and then he pledges a fraternity and comes home mouthing off about Karens and how the wage gap is a myth.

7r96naxj	I suspect heavy porn use gives men the same symptoms as ADHD / dementia. Brain fog, low motivation, unable to focus or plan long term, poor memory.  They just can't be bothered to go on a date. It feels like too much effort. Too many moving parts. No energy to get up and chase when they can just open their laptop and jerk off.

d3ofi4f1	Thank you!! I never said anything about rent or kicking them out. Just that it's their mess and I won't be responsible for their cleaning once they're adults so they have to learn to do it now. I would never hold something like that over their heads. Especially after their abusive father actually made them put their shoes and coats on and stood them by the door telling them they would be kicked into the street if they didn't behave at age 5!! I'm actually very lenient with them because of that and kicked him out instead! Withholding computer games is not the same thing but I still feel like an evil mother for it.

3mcgi	You and I both!  It never occurred to me that these "complaints" were the truth about what *he* was doing to her.  It may be just words, but in many situations the men who do this are deadly.  This became glaringly clear in my own life with my uncle.  He accused my aunt of being "controlling", described their marriage as constantly trying to keep her happy because of her refusal to get a job, among other things.    In reality, my uncle was a total bastard.  My aunt told my mom how he forbade her to go back to work, thus wanted her to exclusively be a SAHM, wouldn't even give her enough money to buy groceries, refused to pay for their son to be in daycare, constantly grabbed her "fat" after she had their son, terrorized my aunt and forced her to have sex with him, and other depraved things that would be its own post.  His treatment of my mom, his own *sister*, was no better.  He also terrorized my mom and on more than one occasion nearly beat her up (I had to protect my mom).	1642720204.0	htium20	t3_s63fhi	t1_ht5ax1d	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s63fhi/a_few_months_ago_told_my_friend_dating_a/htium20/

gsv78	Also, I have quite a few male entrepreneurial friends who reach out to me with projects to work on, mostly they’ll go through since we work fast and we add credibility to each other, sometimes they’ll fall apart but there are never harsh feelings or blame because it’s common to have things just not work out for one reason or another sometimes especially in the entrepreneurial space. That’s why I didn’t think much of the first instance of it not working out because I already understood taking too long could potentially be a factor that would make it not work.	1642722383.0	htizwg6	t3_s8w84l	t3_s8w84l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/htizwg6/

owunw4l	A couple of reasons:  1. They're cheating. Some of them plan to cheat and overcome with guilt, so they bail. Or they could just be emotionally cheating, enjoying the attention and knowing they could have another woman, with no intention to follow through from the start.   2. They chicken out. HVW are intimidating to insecure men.  3.

3mcgi	You described my ex's mom.  She coddled both him and his brother, but his half brother was particularly favored.  There is a 15 year age difference between them (my ex is the youngest).  His half brother was from his mom's first marriage where her husband beat her up and was just as bad, if not worse, to his brother.  When my ex's mom married my ex's dad, his brother was 10 years old and needed a lot of psychological help.  Throughout the marriage, his brother was a problem child.  It put a strain on her second marriage because "\[half brother's name\] can't help it" and every excuse under the sun to absolve him from his wrongdoings.  It didn't get much better when my ex's mom became pregnant with him and his sister.  Now the attention was off of him.  Later in life this evolved into drug and alcohol abuse which still wasn't remedied.  When my ex was in high school, his mom took cash advances from his dad's business credit cards to give the money to his half brother.  She felt responsible for her son's struggling and that she constantly needed to swoop in and save him.  My ex's mom couldn't pay back the money fast enough, though.  Once his dad found out, he was ready to divorce.  As a couple it took a lot of work for his dad to regain any trust, but even when my ex and I were together, the issues with his brother were once again heightened.	1642723195.0	htj1v2j	t3_s8mqwe	t1_hthe5b6	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htj1v2j/

7djs5tcj	My uncle was like this. My grandmother spoiled him senseless. He didn't move out of her house til he was 65.   He never paid a dime in rent and was a hoarder. He did nothing to help around the house and wouldn't get her groceries. We only knew how bad it was when Grandma called us crying because there was no food in the house except for "his" steaks, which she "wasn't allowed to touch."  The day he finally moved out, she tripped on all his hoarding crap and broke her arm. He called 911 and left her on the floor for the EMTs to find, but not before stealing her silver on his way out the door.  He was dead a year later from Covid.

4zqeygg1	In my  experience, men are very fickle creatures, and will look for reasons to reject you to justify their behavior. I once had a man who refused to date me because I don't watch television, and he's a big movie freak. Never mind that TV and movies are totally different.   It  doesn't  even matter why, and you shouldn't waste time trying to figure it out; they will dump/block/ghost for any reason, or no reason. I swear men are brain damaged and pornsick, and they likely think that they can do better, so let him try.   And don't give him another chance when he comes groveling back. You weren't his dreamigirl; don't let him treat you like second place.	1642724393.0	htj4q8j	t3_s8txhc	t3_s8txhc	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/htj4q8j/
bglvt8j	Don't be ashamed of yourself. Particularly since you two met in college - a time when you are relatively inexperienced and as a result aren't automatically looking for or expecting the worst in people to come out. And, especially if you're a decent person, it will be naturally harder for you to imagine all the different  ways a dangerous, indecent, horrible and/or manipulative person would behave to take advantage of you. That is actually in your favor that you're not familiar with shitty behaviors because it means you're not the type to do this to someone else on purpose. But now you know others are and you learned early in life. So you're ahead of the curve.	1642724597.0	htj57k2	t3_s8cruu	t3_s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/htj57k2/

These men assume this means I'm not going to let them watch/attend sports games when nothing would be further than the truth.  I think its great they have interests or see a game with their friends as a social thing.  I'm baffled why they just assume what its going to be like, instead of just *talking* to me about it.

6qo7pl16	Totally, men will go to great lengths to impress a woman they want and have no problem lying or exaggerating the truth in that conquest! I’ve found men have a deep desire to be admired and the ones who’ve watched too many romcoms or stuck in Peter Pan boy mentality or even just honestly losers will have a weird propensity to exaggerate the truth by thinking once they “win you over” the lies won’t matter and you’ll be forgiving cause you’re in love and have empathy and can see why he did it to impress you and blah, blah, blah 🤢. I once dating a guy who told me he bought his ex a Maserati - turns out he gave her 5k for the down payment, ummm a huge difference between buying a car vs. helping to buy one. These situations are most often related to money or status I’ve found - to impress you and gain the admiration they crave yet do not deserve. It’s an immature tactic at best and a narcissistic one at worse when they try to gaslight their way through the truth by saying or inferring you didn’t ask more info or you misheard or even, in your case, they admit to exaggerating and somehow think that’s going to be ok. You did the right thing, liars always end up telling on themselves and a lot of pain and potential heartache is saved when we nope at the first sign of dishonesty. We’re not in grade school anymore and certainly don’t live in a Disney movie fantasy. Most of these men have deep-seated inferiority complexes and are quite frankly lazy IMO. Lying is much easier than being real. I feel you, it’s infuriating and what a pain you wasted that time he was totally leading you on with the hopes of the project…my guess is he thought he’d win you over and you’d somehow miraculously wouldn’t care cause now you’re interested in him!

I recognized I really do love my time by myself to write, read, contribute to people and spaces that lift me up. I’m better able to spot manipulation and walk away and set really good boundaries and while scary to do it at times I feel really good about it keep at it cause I’m taking care of me! I realized being alone is not lonely at all. That self care is my commitment in life above all else and to no longer say yes when I really feel no. I learned to express my feelings fully, to embrace the trauma of my past, to recognize how my narcissistic parents (both diagnosed by the courts) shaped who I became but not who I am anymore.

Secondly, I'm just going to offer some random stream of consciousness feedback because there is just so much to be commented on in this tale  Never tell a guy your past sexual history. Don't tell a guy how many partners you've had or ANYTHING. The most I would maybe say is, "I've had a little experience but nothing major" or some version of that.  The only other acceptable sexual thing to tell a guy is that you are clean for STD's. Hopefully you are no longer engaging in FWB, but I can't stress enough how you should get all sexual partners tested!!!   Also, don't have sex early on. He could be a serial killer for all you know--it's better not to be alone with strange men   As far as any controlling behaviors, in the future if you see them **LEAVE HIM.** Never let a man control anything you do  Wishing you all the best!

bpbux1pi	So many. I'm keeping a lifeline out for my sister who was a backup sex option for an ex when his date with another woman didn't end in sex. A friend who refuses to go anywhere without her boyfriend who is 25 years her senior and still pays alimony to his ex. Friends who disappear for months during the honeymoon phase only to pop back up when his mask starts slipping. A friend who had a baby with a one night stand and went to couple's therapy before marrying the scrote. So many awesome women have made themselves small and convenient to appeal to what we've been told is attractive and non-threatening to men.  And it never really gets easier to cut them off, you know? Most of us were pickmes before so part of me can empathize with them. But I can't have any of that in my life anymore. Like another poster said here recently, it's not possible to hold strong boundaries in one area of life and allow yourself to be collateral damage of someone else's weak or non-existent boundaries without experiencing resentment.	1642728909.0	htjf8o9	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjf8o9/

bpbux1pi	It's less a rediscovery than returning home to myself, but younger parts of me reemerged once I felt safe after my divorce and now I sing, dance around my apartment, and have coloring books and kinetic sand and fidget toys around.  I finally have space to question my initial reactions to things and deprogram a lot of traits and reactions I was told I had but don't. I can have Zoom calls with my therapist on the couch rather than hiding in my office with headphones on. My CPTSD is still there but it's never activated at home anymore. Several medical issues cleared up. I can make the same thing for dinner two nights in a row if I'm tweaking a recipe and no one is around to complain. I can listen to the FDS podcast while I'm cleaning. It's strange allowing podcasts or music I'm listening to to fill the room and it makes me feel like *I* have a right to fill the room rather than make myself small and inconsequential.  It's only been a year since I left but I can't wait to meet the next versions of me.	1642729815.0	htjhc6b	t3_s8y34s	t3_s8y34s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y34s/whatve_you_rediscovered_about_yourself_since/htjhc6b/

I must've witnessed them go through 3-4 guys each in the span of 2 years. They'd come crawling back when they were single, but that kind of hot/cold friendship is not sustainable to me. So I just matched their energy, and both have not reached out yet (both with guys rn). Also had another one who on the surface seemed okay but actually has a lot of baggage and was living a very male/love centered life. Lastly, my NV mom is sexist, "not like other girls", and would always play devil's advocate. Keeping it cordial and avoiding deeper chats.	1642730823.0	htjjn9n	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjjn9n/

gsv78	\> to impress you and gain the admiration they crave yet do not deserve. It’s an immature tactic at best and a narcissistic one at worse when they try to gaslight their way through the truth  This. I should've known since he isn't the most fortunate looking (way below average and not related to weight or hygiene, just horrible facial structure, height and genetics) that there would be a huge inferiority complex.   I do feel like he strung me along in an attempt to meet up and build some sort of connection by seeing each other in person a lot, he didn't get any admiration from me but when I go out by myself I do get a lot of attention from people looking at me or doing double takes or just looking shocked when they see me. I think he might've been getting some weird admiration or sense of confidence from that because I don't think anyone shows interest in him or even bothers to look at him.   Either way, it completely killed the relationship of two years. I'm just surprised because I had no issue meeting up casually before, and we'd hung out casually multiple times, and I've met his group of people he works with and had no issue meeting up casually again (before this ofc), so it's weird he randomly decided to do all of this, left me feeling unsettled but I'm glad that you also see what I see.	1642731018.0	htjk3ac	t3_s8w84l	t1_htj9062	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/htjk3ac/

2oozw1sy	I had a friend like this too, and it’s disheartening how much society accepts this. It’s seen as nOrMaL, because, “sOmE oF uS lIkE sPeNdInG tImE wItH oUr BoYfRiEnD.” Even my mom would laugh and say it’s typical young woman behavior, and just to wait it out.   No. When I was in a relationship, I made a lot of time for this friend. She was single, we had both just started at the same job, and we really relied on each other emotionally. I had a standing Friday date night with her after work, no matter what. Even if I saw my boyfriend later, I always went out with her first.   Then, the tables turned, and I was single, while she got married. I guarantee if I texted her now, she’d say, “we can hang out on July 22, because he will be out of town.” She absolutely will not do anything without her husband! I think it’s even more ridiculous with a husband, because…you get to see him every day. What is ONE dinner without him going to do that will ruin your relationship? Especially when it means the word to your single friend, who never gets to eat dinner with anyone.   And with sooooo many women, I have said these thoughts, only to hear, “wow, you went above and beyond as a friend, hanging out with her so much. That is…not typical…and a lot to ask of someone! I mean…I’d want to see my husband too.” Sometimes something will be thrown in about how I will understand when I have a husband.   I mean…honestly. I don’t think it’s that hard to be a decent friend. And I know all my breakups have been way easier, since I haven’t neglected friendships when I was dating someone! It’s ridiculous how much this behavior is normalized in society. Nobody out of their teens should ignore their friends completely and call that infatuation “normal.”	1642731379.0	htjkx2i	t3_s8y6si	t1_htjjn9n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjkx2i/
2dkrcgj0	That I'm actually very introverted and conflict avoidant. I thought I was a tiger because they were so passive and would physically run away at a hint of conflict. Whenever I did personality tests, I'd get super domineering extroverted types— putting some distance between that made me realize that's not my genuine self. If you've heard of the "crazy" woman trope, it's usually because there's a narcissistic, cold, and passive guy who's not filling her needs.	1642731461.0	htjl3yu	t3_s8y34s	t3_s8y34s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y34s/whatve_you_rediscovered_about_yourself_since/htjl3yu/

gsv78	Heres some tips I figured out being in the entrepreneurial space:   1. Master your craft and make your name known wherever you can (positive things only though)     1. This adds credibility and deters people who are looking to use you because you get put into this higher space of being harder to reach, meaning the more they wanna work with you, the more they have to be able to do.  2. Focus on connecting your friends to credible people as well as being connected with credible people.     1. Occasionally you'll get a guy like the one I got in my post, but for the most part building a web of friends that are all interconnected means that when people you don't work with usually ask about your credibility, someone will know someone who met someone through you, and they ended up working on X project together. It also builds you a stronger support system because if you have no clue who someone is and they have no mutuals at all, you can guess they aren't that big in their field.     2. Keep most relationships in the entrepreneurial space casually business. Reach out during acceptable hours \*not late nights or before 6AM\*, don't try to become best friends with everyone you meet, let them know what you do, be helpful, if they ask for favors or advice on something you have expertise on do a free 15-20 minute consultation style call where you shoot them advice. Only do that if you feel like they're a beneficial relationship and they can also provide value to you in things you might want to do. Sometimes if you give them advice on their ventures, they'll meet someone else who needs help and they'll be able to vouch for your knowledge in the field.        1. Don't bother with people who always seem to talk abut never actually seem to accomplish anything. Or people with new projects all the time that don't go anywhere.     3. Your best business partners will also be people you can be friends with. Focus on being friends with people who you naturally connect with who have high energy, high integrity, and high intelligence.  3. Social media is big, use it to your advantage. Post who you're with, what you're doing, also reach out to people through social media if you see they have similar friends/partners.   I hope this helps.	1642731845.0	htjm00n	t3_s8w84l	t1_htjewbl	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/htjm00n/
6qo7pl16	Yes!! Omg girl I laughed at your edit cause not needed, you are beautiful and will turn heads! Hence why he wanted to be around you to feel superior or special, it’s so real and weird, like association just by having a good looking woman by their side…And I know how you feel on that front, I purposefully dress down to avoid the gross lustful attention. Who knows why he decided to do what he did now, maybe attention, maybe a bad dating experience and wanted to feel deserving or to show off in front of someone who rejected him in some way, who knows. Men will always want a beautiful woman around them and somehow feel more worthy or superior?

hdguzjz	My ex cheated on me with a lot of escorts, and in my quest to figure out how that lifestyle worked so I knew how to catch his ass, I discovered that they have one of these databases that they use, and I mean nation wide, to warn others about dangerous, abusive, gross, or just unpleasant men.  I don't know how it works because they keep it extremely close to breast for obvious reasons.  So ... It can be done ladies.

gdzgk0ng	I went through something similar.  Please understand- these women are almost always abused, and they no longer trust even their own eyes.  The first time I sensed my ex was a pedo was when I noticed he was chatting with a 13-year-old online.  13!  It was on World of Warcraft.  I was horrified, but since I didn't see anything "suspicious" (hindsight: WTF?  The fact that she stated her age and he continued to have daily conversations with her was freaking disgusting, I know), I decided to CoMmUnIcAte (read: I was dying to hear that I was crazy, because the alternative was that I acknowledge reality, and I just couldn't).  Of course, he shamed me for snooping and double, triple, quadruple shamed me for thinking his intentions were anything less than honorable.    Years later, I was informed that he is indeed, a pedo.  Only at that point, I had no proof- and the person who told me refused to testify against him.    IF ONLY I had kept evidence of the convo he was having, kept it secret from him, and made silent plans for divorce I AM SURE a competent judge would have made my custody battle a whole lot smoother than it was.  A competent judge, that is... so who knows.	1642727675.0	htjcdys	t3_s8vzni	t3_s8vzni	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8vzni/awful_everything_same_grooming_different_scrote/htjcdys/

7r96naxj	DSM-5 Criteria for ADHD  People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity–impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development:  Inattention: Six or more symptoms of inattention for children up to age 16 years, or five or more for adolescents age 17 years and older and adults; symptoms of inattention have been present for at least 6 months, and they are inappropriate for developmental level:  Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or with other activities.  Often has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities.  Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.  Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., loses  focus, side-tracked).  Often has trouble organizing tasks and activities.  Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework).  Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities (e.g. school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).  Is often easily distracted  Is often forgetful in daily activities.  All my porn addict exes displayed these *with me* but they held down medium-high level jobs, so there was some learned misogyny in there. Or they were being paid ludicrous amounts while being shit at their jobs I guess. Or they were pretending to be stupid - weaponized incompetence.	1642735650.0	htjupip	t3_s8txhc	t1_htjsolk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/htjupip/

psdyfxu	My LVM father found various ways to communicate to me that he was disappointed his daughters weren't prettier, by his standards. He's the type of scrote who fetishizes Asian women for being petite and delicate. Yet he decided to reproduce with a taller than average sturdily built woman and, being a taller than average sturdily built man, produced taller than average sturdily built daughters. Cue surprised Pikachu face. He lived and worked on a farm and here he had three daughters very physically suited for farm work (I could maneuver and stack 75 pound hay bales as a tween) but he was still disappointed.  “It's like they're mentally still living centuries ago when a daughter's main value was how many cows you could trade her for.”  Thank you for the laugh! I’ll have to use this line… I’m glad you’re so well-grounded and have the right perspective, despite growing up with a lack of support.

3vgrsvmu	There was a friend I had who jumps from relationship to relationship the last time she was single was probably grade 9 and we are 23 now.  Every time I talked to her the topic would always be about her boyfriend at the time and if I tried to bring up what’s going on with me she would relate it back to her bf. If we wanted a girls night it would be us plus her bf. Anywhere we went just know if you invite her then you are also inviting her bf too.   Every single Instagram post or Snapchat story will be paragraphs about how much she’s in love with her bf at the time and pics of them together. The only time she really called me was if A) they are in a fight or B) something serious happened to her bf and needs someone to talk to or C) she’s now bored of being glued to her boyfriends hip and is now looking for a new bf (like I said she can’t be single, she will break up with her bf and be in a new relationship the next week)  The last straw for me wasn’t even how boyfriend obsessed and pick-me she was but it was actually because she threw a bday party and “cancelled” it because of covid. Which I respected however, I found out via an Instagram post that she had the party anyways and just uninvited me. Ever since then I have drifted away from her and muted her on all social media. It’s also funny because every single person that was in that insta post for her bday are no longer friends with her and she has a new boyfriend.  She will be back in a couple of months to talk about her relationship problems but I won’t be there to listen. Anyways long story short I now run the other direction if I meet women who are boyfriend obsessed and glued to their bf by the hip.	1642736075.0	htjvn7n	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjvn7n/

i3i83cdo	I found FDS when my friend and co-worker was going through a tumultuous time of... well, drama.   The pandemic and lockdown had her stuck at home with her lvm husband, her Instagram would be all "look at this delicious meal hubby made for us today" and worshipping his carnitas but at work she would just go off about how he just watched TV all the time, no sex, no job. She started an affair with another balding old man at work after getting too drunk at a Christmas party, he was her superior in a way. And then a few weeks later she was pregnant while her husband had gone to Europe for 8 months for a new job.   It's still not clear whose child it is but the husband doesn't suspect a thing. He wasn't there with her through the pregnancy or birth but now they're all living with him and after multiple conversations with her she still wasn't getting it so I had to distance myself. I still see her posts about how helpful her husband is so amazing but she's all alone now in a new country and a new baby and a husband that works too much and is barely home.   After she had gone we were still having really time consuming conversations online about her woes but this woman literally left her whole life behind her to chase this useless man to another country not even 100% sure that he was her child's father. I had to end that friendship after a while. I felt guilty because multiple times she told me I'm the only one she can talk to about this but it wasn't my burden and I had to set that boundary. She made that bed, she had to sleep in it.	1642728930.0	htjfaiz	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjfaiz/
ghbxa94x	A friend I had to let go of is dating a guy 10 years older than her with two kids. He’s always hanging out with people her age and getting drunk. He’s divorced and gave over full custody of his kids. He gets jealous when she’s busy studying as she’s in nursing school. He’ll even go out with other girls and post it online to make her jealous. She would send me pictures of them two and it made me sick. She’s beautiful and he’s just no. She goes to the gym every day. She started meal prepping for him to help him lose weight. I don’t think he’s ever stepped inside a gym. He drives a beat up old car while she drives a brand new Jeep. Every time they go out they get wasted. My birthday was a month ago and instead of spending it with me she was at a bar getting drunk with him.	1642729334.0	htjg87x	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjg87x/
62w5unq8	You are the sum of who you surround yourself with.   Your bf may be living vicariously through the people he associates with. My ex used to claim he was nothing like his NVM friends. Nope. His mask eventually dropped too.  If your bf is truly growing and maturing, he will grow out of those people and cut contact with them. If not, that’s *his* decision. He has made his choice, but your boundaries are *yours* to enforce. If you’re not okay with this, what can *you* do? What choice will *you* make since you cannot tolerate those people?	1642736326.0	htjw6yh	t3_s8zap2	t3_s8zap2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/htjw6yh/
hvxu4eki	Ooooh boy most of the people around me are LV as fuck so I've cut off a TON of pickmes. I'd say maybe upwards of maybe 14ish friends/close friends since 2020 who were extreme pickmeishas and LV all around.  I can't list each one with their individual story but I'll just give outlines of things I've noticed in common with them/what made them pickmes to me:  - Obviously, chasing men, fighting for their attention and validation. This bothers me SO much. Especially since they'd ditch me at the drop of a hat for a guy they barely knew. I just don't befriend women with low standards for men anymore. Either she's also got the FDS mentality or I'm not going to be her friend, simple.   - Terrible boundaries with men. They'd let them walk all over them, make disgusting jokes to and about them, talk about them behind their back with their bros, send their nudes and details about their relationship to other dudes etc etc. These women knew and did nothing about it, just said meh and accepted it. Ugh!    - Being okay with the men around them being misogynistic as fuck. Nope.   - Constantly crying over a NVM. I just didn't want to hear it anymore.   - Encourage me to make bad choices during vulnerable times (all circled around being promiscuous) which again, nope. Cut these women off immediately. Can't tell someone who literally got SAed that the next to do to forget what happened is to go out there and mess around.    - I also cut a few of my friends out for only having relationships on their mind/as their main motivation in life. If that's the only thing you're after, good for you. But I'm just not going to stick around anyone like that.   - Kind of similar to above but I cut off 2 old friends from my life after they started bullying me and all they kept talking about is wanting to look hot and compete with other girls while I was telling them about how stressful my life is and how I want to move away. They just weren't listening and didn't care about their future. They also consistently treated me like shite for most of the decade that I've known them so I said bye-bye and blocked them.    - I've cut someone out of my life after they told me that it's my fault that I got assaulted and defended the man before even hearing the full story. She even left out certain details when giving her shitty opinion and didn't help at all when I opened up during a vulnerable time. Imagine being THAT much of a pickme dumbass bitch to stand up for a creep you don't even know.... Glad to say she's out of my life.  Edit: I've also cut off women who were friends with pickmeishas. I honestly don't tolerate that kind of energy in my life anymore. Even if I'm not directly interacting with them, I don't want to be around them or have a mutual friend with them.	1642732128.0	htjmn6o	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjmn6o/
e8u6ytr4	I had a short relationship with a man who ended up moving to Italy. We ended it on good terms and decided to be friends. We kept in touch and genuinely did become just platonic friends. The romance had been very short-lived. He happened to be in town a year later and he joined our mutual friends and I at the beach. He started hitting on me. I called him out because I knew he had a girlfriend now. So my pickme friend starts taking his side and acting as though it’s totally normal and cool behavior to cheat on one’s gf and as if I was somehow a prude! All the while she was desperately trying to get his attention and tried to flirt with him. Gross. That’s just one story of this friend. I dropped her.. eventually.	1642732822.0	htjo98m	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjo98m/
d42obgfy	Friend who used to have high standards and expectations of a man. Seemed to be looking for a high quality man. Found one, I didn’t get a great first impression. When she was dating her BF she played Barb the Builder to get him onto a career trajectory she thought was more fitting. Helped him sort his finances (he was super in debt and addicted to collectibles). They moved in together so she could help fix his finances too. Now that she is engaged they bought a huge house and the mortgage was a shock to both of them I think. And talking about wedding planning and it’s a backyard bbq/potluck like I get it’s Covid but what!? We had a falling out for other reasons but I’m not going to miss having her in my life. So much stress with her around it’s been more peaceful with her and her insecurities/constantly trying to compete for the lowest level gone.	1642735940.0	htjvcim	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htjvcim/

My ex from a few years ago had a great job, great family, but he was friends will college dropouts and drug dealers. He was NV our entire relationship and I ignored it.   What does your boyfriend have in common with these people? It’s obvious that he enjoys their companionship and jokes. He’s probably just like them.	1642736432.0	htjwfb8	t3_s8zap2	t3_s8zap2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/htjwfb8/
prq4z9g	I would have a discussion with your boyfriend about your thoughts on his friends. I don’t think you need to explicitly ask him to cut them out since you said that you yourself have LVM/pick me friends you haven’t completely cut off yet. Just see what his thoughts are and encourage him to spend more time with his new friends.	1642736812.0	htjx9d5	t3_s8zap2	t3_s8zap2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/htjx9d5/

8l4lqvkj	I had a pickme friend a few years ago. I was actually really fond of her and she did have some nice qualities. She met a guy and they got serious. I met him for the first time when the three of us had dinner, and after that I didn’t hear from her for a while. I reached out a few times to see if she’s okay. She sends me a text telling me that her boyfriend found me really attractive and therefore she couldn’t be friends anymore. About three years later she got in touch and asked if I wanted to go see a movie and that her boyfriend had dumped her. I couldn’t deal with pickme behaviour like that so I told her not to call me again.

caxkcnil	I have ADHD.   > no empathy, not being able to care  You’re describing a sociopath. People with ADHD can absolutely be too sensitive and emotional for neurotypicals.   We have trouble regulating our emotions (they can be too strong) and most of us struggle with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria.   > no motivation  We’re more than capable of having motivation and having big dreams. We tend to have a lot of ideas and be very creative. What we struggle with, is discipline.   We can make great plans, but we struggle to follow them. It can take us longer to achieve them, but it doesn’t mean we never will. It doesn’t mean we don’t want to, or we’re not making efforts to reach our goals.   > Maybe he was just stupid  Please don’t associate ADHD with a man’s stupidity or weaponized incompetence.   ADHD is not a lack of intelligence or a lack of empathy or maliciousness.   The men you’re describing are misogynistic, it’s as simple as that. Men who believe women exist to serve them and please them, men who don’t see us as people but as appliances, etc. it’s a low-value man problem and it’s not fair to associate them with people (especially women) who are legitimately doing their best, trying to function in a world that does not accommodate them.	1642737705.0	htjz6mk	t3_s8txhc	t1_htjupip	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/htjz6mk/

7r96naxj	Every time 😩  Long term porn use causes hypofrontality, or reduction in the grey matter in the pre-frontal cortex, which damages executive functioning.  It does have the same symptoms as ADHD (read anything on the front page of nofap, they describe it themselves), so porn addict men, in a relationship, gleefully diagnose themselves and use it to justify and excuse their misogyny.  I am in no way associating women with ADHD with men who use porn.	1642738316.0	htk0hge	t3_s8txhc	t1_htjz6mk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/htk0hge/

8estq45x	Yes, I've told him everything that I've already written in this post about these people, and he agrees with me that it's "awful and cringe," as you just said.  He continues to be friends with them "despite these things" because it's not a "dealbreaker" for him, and they are otherwise good friends to him from his point of view (both of them are "fun" to hang out with, interesting to talk to, and they've also been there for him in the past when they all went to university together and they were there for him during his times of need).  Another similar example is with media (video games, books, and TV shows/movies). I personally enjoy playing games (in moderation, from time to time), I find a good read to be extremely satisfying, and I also enjoy decent movies and TV series. *However,* as soon as a video game, book, movie, or TV series shows *any* red flags to me, such as romanticized rape, uncalled for nudity, or graphic (borderline pornographic) sex scenes, then I immediately stop consuming the media because this is a personal dealbreaker for me. On the other hand, my boyfriend doesn't find these things to be dealbreakers for him, and he will continue playing/reading/watching "despite these things," although he does acknowledge their problematic nature and actively wishes that developers/authors/producers wouldn't add such atrocious things into their media because he said it "adds a bad taste" and "ruins" something that is otherwise decent (and this is something that he's brought up as a pet peeve to me even before I told him my opinion on the matter).  It's honestly pretty irksome to me, but I don't know if this is just a difference in preferences/tolerance/thresholds (whether it comes to friends or media), or a legitimate red flag.	1642739232.0	htk2eau	t3_s8zap2	t1_htjre5v	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/htk2eau/
1d125zkr	a few years ago I was going through a really rough breakup and one of my male friends at the time was being a good, supportive friend (I really thought so back then) and then he tricked me into being alone with him for a few minutes and assaulted me and had the intention of raping me. Luckily, I was able to quickly leave and drive off. anyways, I told my friends who were mutual friends with him, so they all were warned. One of my friends then spoke up, sobbing, saying he did the same thing to her. However, another one of my friends listened to me and her share our stories about him - and she went forward telling him we were "spreading rumors about him" and we were "liars" and "mad no one wanted to date us" and she went ahead and entered into a situation-ship with him!   I ran into him working at walmart after that - when I saw him he made eye contact with me and I sat my basket down and ran to the nearest exit. everyone in that circle has been blocked	1642739271.0	htk2h59	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htk2h59/

Literally the last episode it was like straight up porn. It's so uncomfortable to watch. It also makes me wonder if Sydney Sweeney (Cassie) is being exploited since the sex scenes are mostly her.

As for the LVM/pickme acquaintances that both my boyfriend and I have, we don't contact those people at all anymore (it's more like, we have old facebook and instagram accounts from ten years ago and never bothered to unfriend/unfollow all those accounts) - I just shared that information more as an example of how everyone has LVM//pickme friends growing up, but we learn to outgrow them and that's fine, but the body of the post is to talk about how it's concerning to actively be friends with such toxic people.	1642739626.0	htk37jc	t3_s8zap2	t1_htjx9d5	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/htk37jc/
1d125zkr	when I was in college one of my closest friends and I would study together a lot - it helped us both - but she was a huge pickme in her personal life. when she got a boyfriend she would bring him to everything and they would often invite me to Third wheel. he seemed cool, we all seemed to get along pretty well. until one night when he started DMing me and then read-only said "I wish I met you before I met (her name) because I would much rather be F\*\*\*\*ing you. I really want to F you. You're so much more intelligent and attractive and you and me have so much more in common". I told him that was not appropriate, took screenshots, and called my friend (his girlfriend), on the phone I was almost sobbing telling her what happened as the screenshots were sending - she calmly replied "Oh I know. he's told that to me plenty of times, he talks about you a lot to me. that's just how he is. im not worried about it. I actually dont understand why YOURE so upset though". the calmness and unbotheredness in her voice still bothers me to this day.  I slowly cut them off, eventually he did find another woman that was willing to sleep with him and then serial cheated on her - she was devastated. she was also the type of pickme friend that was always telling me to give guys a chance even when they were ugly or had red flags saying they were "practice" and that he was "nice" saying "maybe I would change my mind"	1642739699.0	htk3csb	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htk3csb/

caxkcnil	> Every time 😩  Every time what? You say something ableist and try to educate someone with ADHD about their own condition?   You said no empathy and not being able to care are symptoms of ADHD. You also said porn sick men have the same “symptoms”.   You’re absolutely equating people with ADHD with these sociopathic entitled misogynistic males.   I never heard or read about “lack of empathy” as an ADHD trait and most people with ADHD (who actually experience it) will tell you we tend to care too much for our own good.   I’m primarily inattentive and I’m still able to be a thoughtful friend/partner who remembers the smallest details about her loved ones. Because I care about them. A lot.   Being inattentive can be excessive daydreaming, forgetting what you were about to do, where you put your phone, etc. It doesn’t necessarily have to impact people around you.   I don’t care about what coomers with Münchhausen say about ADHD. They probably saw an over-simplistic TikTok made by a teenager and thought it was enough to diagnose themselves.	1642739772.0	htk3i55	t3_s8txhc	t1_htk0hge	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/htk3i55/

9vf9k04	I love reading all these stories! Warms my cold heart :)  I spent 20 years of my life in one relationship after another, never knowing who I was without a male partner. I was codependent, anxious, always second-guessing myself, always wondering if I was the crazy one.  I left my last (abusive) ex 9 months ago. Since then, I've discovered:  -I actually do enjoy other women's company - well, HVW at least. They're not all crazy, catty or evil witches like some of my exes claimed.   -I rediscovered my love for writing. I didn't have much room for creativity because my mind was always occupied on my exes' wants and what they thought of me. I started writing a new book for the first time in 10 years.   -I also rediscovered my love for reading! I go through 25+ books in a year, whereas with my exes, I was lucky if I could finish 3-4/year.   -That I love learning self-defense. I picked up BJJ a month ago and even though I get my ass whooped on the reg, I enjoy every moment and it's making my confidence skyrocket.  -I am confident and I really do love myself. I love traveling, eating whatever I want, and being on my own schedule. Most of all, I learned that I really am a good, kindhearted person who cares a lot about other people. I no longer have a LVM/NVM sucking away all my precious emotional energy. I'm not needy, clingy, insecure, jealous, a cheater, or any of those horrible things my exes said to me.	1642740370.0	htk4p3w	t3_s8y34s	t3_s8y34s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y34s/whatve_you_rediscovered_about_yourself_since/htk4p3w/

62w5unq8	You don’t have to justify yourself to me. The questions I raised were something you should reflect on by yourself.   Think about what it means for someone you love to be friends with people with problematic views and values, is that someone you wish to spend your life with?  Take the time to understand how his behaviour impacts you, whether it is inadvertent or not. Consider to yourself, why are you justifying and defending his choices to strangers on the internet. Clearly something is not sitting right with you if you had to seek advice from strangers on the internet.

7d1wafuk	Made friends with a somewhat religious girl at school, she'd leave me on read for like over a week at times because she's just "bad at texting" but when she was bored and had noone else she'd be up my butt getting close to me. Tried to warn her about a guy from her religion (muslim) who was going to use her to fool around then ditch her which he did, she invited me out to a special event what seems like..? a year ago? then when I asked when and where she never got back to me. But on instagram had time to post stories hanging out with people she's talked shit about behind their back. It's literally been a long ass time since I've been matching her energy and not putting in effort when she's responded to my stories with emojis, and now she's switched into my classes (nasty surprise) and trying to act like nothing has happened and looking at me with like puppy-dog eyes. I can't with her fake ass. I'm stuck with her all semester now.	1642740932.0	htk5slw	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htk5slw/

gsv78	Yeah, especially because if you’re an ugly guy with a super beautiful girl with all the green flags (speech intelligence ambition) people will wonder exactly how you landed her, who you are, etc.. It’s weird but men do place status on other men based on how attractive the women around them are. He might have been realizing that I may as well be the only woman without serious issues or shortcomings that would spend time with him, and that pushed him to create this ruse to try and spend more time together. Generally speaking, the ugly guy who exaggerates and lies a lot does not end up with a beautiful, ambitious, intelligent, and self determined woman, he ends up with someone who will accept his minimal effort and someone in his own value tax bracket.   I don’t judge friends, business partners, or associates based off looks, only what they have done, what they can do, and their values. Keeping that in mind I never even bothered to consider him as a romantic option based on looks and values, just as a casual friend. I date based on the value someone adds to my life, if you don’t add any value then why even bother forming some kind of relationship. I’d rather spend my time on self discovery and doing what I enjoy than with people who subtract or don’t add anything.	1642741348.0	htk6lan	t3_s8w84l	t1_htjmfm4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/htk6lan/

wpgbf	This is not true. The men who believe this are not adept at making their partners orgasm.

779l8y45	So let me get the straight. Girlfriend moves in with boyfriend. Boyfriend gets rid of the ugly and dangerous fireplace that freaked her out. He then tries to covertly punish her for the removal by having her pay the electric bill. She thinks the bill will be lower than her original offer and feels that's unfair. He doesn't reveal the truth - he thinks it will be higher than her offer to pay the mortgage. When the punishment doesn't work out, he manipulates the utilities to artificially increase the cost.   That was actually quite difficult to parse out. This guy is a liar about his intentions.	1642741536.0	htk6ydi	t3_s8xf33	t3_s8xf33	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8xf33/purposefully_doing_things_to_drive_up_his_gfs/htk6ydi/
enqjhavz	Thank you for pointing this out.  That was my first thought too.  There's so much pressure to shift our stance of holding men responsible to - instead - holding a woman responsible for holding that man responsible MORE or BETTER or IN THE RIGHT WAY.  We're always encouraged to adopt this by men as well, since it takes the heat off of them.  And history shows that for all of the infighting among women that this causes, it ultimately changes nothing where men are concerned.   Moms aren't the reason some men are LV or patriarchal in their thinking.  If women were able to change men, we wouldn't be the ones filing for divorce in larger numbers than men - we'd just change our husbands.  If we could turn our sons into the incredible men our husbands weren't, we'd definitely do that too! Pickmes aren't the reason abusive men exist.  Yt women aren't the reason MOC are degrading us.  \*MEN\* decide who they will be toward us, and then act on those choices.  (Plenty of women grow up with LV moms and LV dads and don't abuse men or exploit male labor as a result; whether your bf has good parents shouldn't excuse his adult choices.)  Women don't shape male behavior nearly to the extent we like to think that we do (hence the discussions about what kinds of military-level force are utilized to shape post-puberty, testosterone-driven male behavior).   I've raised sons and a stepson who I consider HVM, and I can confidently tell you that those first ten years, when they were sweet and bonded and their emotional landscape and self-of self were forming were shaped by me (and their mom, for SS), but that would have mattered zero percent had their dads, grand dads, uncles, cousins, and social groups not also been full of relatively HVM who refused to tolerate mistreatment or disrespect toward women.  Unfortunately, they do hit a stage where they look to the men around them to see how seriously they have to take the female voices in their lives - including their mother - and having an older man point them right back to me as the authority in their life on that topic was the crux of their compliance.  Had those been LVM who disrespected me in my sons' field of vision?  I'm not sure things would have played out in the same way.   It's scary to be powerless, but acknowledging where we lack the ability to control the outcome - or another person - is truth.  And that truth is ultimately what will show us where to focus our efforts to be free.	1642741564.0	htk707t	t3_s8mqwe	t1_htint01	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htk707t/

enqjhavz	That sounds like more of a clusterB / antisocial PD issue and less of a male issue.    Most of the more traditional LVM behavior we discuss here is the product of social conditioning and post-puberty hormonal influences on empathy / bonds.  It's not going to show up in a boy that hasn't hit puberty yet (assuming his home life is fairly healthy).	1642741968.0	htk7rrp	t3_s8mqwe	t1_htighjh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htk7rrp/

7a3pfetq	Same happened to me. I noticed he’d get notifications at all times of day, it wasn’t until one day he accidentally had his cars speakers read one of the texts that said “I love you too” that I questioned it. He said it was his dad, I didn’t believe him but the notification did read “ from “Pa” “ so I left it alone … notifications from “Pa” never stopped so it raised some suspicion . Well needless to say, next time “Pa” (dad) called, I made sure to remember the number. Called the number one night and lo and behold it was his FIANCÉE. Like you, I borrowed his card and took us out to dinner and drinks even spa dates several times before we finally sent him a selfie enjoying mimosas for breakfast on him. Well, their engagement was called off, he lost a girlfriend and “PAola” and I are still on friendly terms.

enqjhavz	I would hope every parent teaches their child the chores necessary for household maintenance.   What puzzles me about this line of thinking is ... don't young men live outside their parents' house for quite some time prior to marrying these days?   If so, wouldn't he have, like, a decade of self-care and home maintenance under his belt when you meet him?   So you can presumably vet for this issue when you go to his house while you're dating?  Does he care for it?  Are he and his roommates squabbling about the chores (and is he the one not doing them)?	1642742276.0	htk8clw	t3_s8mqwe	t3_s8mqwe	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8mqwe/ladies_stop_coddling_your_sons/htk8clw/

agr78w6b	I had a friend I met in college. She was a fair bit older than me, and we met through a school club. I was going through a rough time, and she was a nice, comforting presence who helped to boost me up. Some time passed and her husband divorced her, and I was there for her while she was going through the grieving process of losing her marriage. Not long after, she started dating younger men who were very much losers. I had no qualms about telling her this. She hopped from one relationship to the next, with each man getting worse and worse, and her claiming all the while she was just having fun while pursuing her goals. Well, a decade goes by, and she still hasn’t achieved her goals, and her boyfriends have gotten worse and worse and so have her viewpoints. She has learned nothing and is in a worse place than where she started. The last boyfriend she had (and may or may not still be with) was an unmedicated schizophrenic on welfare who believed in all the most extreme right-wing conspiracies and would beat her up and choke her out and berate her while expecting her to be his mommy bangmaid. Again, I expressed my concerns. I tried to help her see the light. Now beyond claiming that she “gave as much as she got” and could handle herself, she started to harass me. I asked her to avoid discussing politics with me since it was clear I wasn’t getting through to her and I figured this was just a phase she’d get over. Instead she constantly brought up the conspiracies and would spam my phone and social media with them and bring them up into conversation unprompted and get hostile when I tried to not engage or actively disagreed. I even tried to just fade away for a bit with hopes she would get back to normal. But she kept harassing me. It was really hard for me to cut her out of my life, and it was a decision I weighed for quite a while and got input from others on. In the end, I concluded she had been toxic for quite some time, and my hopes that she would go back to the woman I initially befriended were clearly not going to come to fruition, so I sent her one last message as a farewell with some last bit of advice and blocked her on social media and on my phone. I don’t know how she is doing now, but I don’t expect she’s doing any better. Having a friend I knew for so many years and cutting them out of my life is not something I’d done before nor since. A friendship of 10 years ended. I have a lot more peace now, but a part of me still worries for her and hope she eventually gets to a good place again. I just can’t have her in my life anymore.	1642742455.0	htk8ono	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htk8ono/

8l8g74j3	Omg I have the perfect story for this . So buckle up queens get comfy and if u have a drink that's a plus. Lol . So I met this girl p over the pandemic for something related to our common interests we were in similar friends groups so I knew she wasn't a fake.  She dms me on insta and we get talking . At the same time this random guy in my dms asks me out and I turn him down . She later on tells me she also got asked out I ask by whom?. And ITS THE SAME FRICKING GUY. So I tell her and we both have a good laugh. Make a group chat and roast him and stuff drove him up shameville etc (although couldn't do much because everything was online and it was during the freaking pandemic)  Later on she tells me she is dating this guy and I'm super excited for her. I'm like go girl ,happy for you etc etc. Then she tells me she met him online 😵 and he is her soul mate.  I was shook. But it still gets worse. He is a misogynistic pig who hates women and classic dysfunctional family. And she eats it all up. He then played nice for a month and then showed his true colors but by then pickme was already hooked and was dreaming of forever with him. This guy is a player 👀 and had done this to multiple girls before and also during their "relationship " asked a minor for nudes and even got it. Even after all this she doesn't leave him . Idk what to say. I called her up and told her once that this guy is and news etc etc. But she pretended to agree with me and then went to our mutual friend and bitched about how nosy I was and how I was never going to find a guy. So I gave up helping pickmes from then on	1642744358.0	htkc5l8	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htkc5l8/

5gkmznie	Yes, in a variety of ways. I once had a guy who was actually an old friend, he had a crush on me, but I’d shut it down. We had a decent friendship, I even enjoyed his company. Suddenly, he had a variety of reasons for me to rely on him…   If a man is refused an expressed interest and suddenly finds a reason you “need” him, especially for a distinctively non-sexual manner that requires that you spend a lot of time with him…give that a hard look.   More often than not, it’s a man who you don’t know too well, but you have some connection like friends or work, meaning he thinks that you feel an obligation to be polite AND he seems “safe” to you because “yo girl you know me, don’t go thinking too much of yourself.”   It’s an unimaginative ploy by men who think that they can game the system by bypassing the learned mistrust most women have of men they don’t know, setting up a fake situation where they get to dictate the boundaries. (The party of the year is right around the corner! Oh sorry, the next corner! Oh I guess it’s the next one, oh well, at least we have all this bonding time where I get to tell you funny stories and charm your pants off”) It sucks you in because obviously working women like to make money, but it’s also “I proved that I’m a nice guy by not getting angry when you said no, AND I’m trying to make you money. Next time I ask you out, you owe me a yes.”  It’s the puppy in the white serial killer van. “You can trust me, and I have something you want/need.” To them, the best case scenario is that you suddenly realize how stupid you were to turn him down, the worst case scenario is that they get to force you to spend time with them, which gives you time to realize how great they really are, and how stupid you were to turn them down.   There’s usually no job/money/whatever it was that you just HAD to do.	1642745644.0	htked07	t3_s8w84l	t3_s8w84l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/htked07/

kuhiy	not plastic surgery per se but relate hard as recovered lip filler addict. I have bad body dysmorphic disorder and Im ngl that I have a ‘wish list’ of procedures I wish I could get if I had expendable money. It’s sad bc even as a radfem and someone w a BA in sociology who knows beauty standards are made up arbitrary patriarchal garbage, it doesn’t change how I feel about myself or my BDD, it only gives me a cause. As far as fathers, I never met my dad (he chose not to be in my life as punishment for my mom asking him for child support despite him being a doc who could fully afford it 🤡) or ever had a father figure/healthy loving relationship from a male in my life except for my grandpa, but we weren’t super bonded in any way so I’ve never felt any real love from a man and female socialization already grooming me to seek male validation + lack of any love from a man growing up def primed me to seek male validation..on steroids lol. plus societal messaging that our value lies within our appearance ofc my brain was like ‘to be loved I must be beautiful. everything else is secondary’. Years of anorexia that I’m recovered from now later, but still suffer from severe BDD, I hopped on the lip filler bandwagon around 2017. And I went NUTS. It was never enough bc 1) an external bandaid cant fix an internal issue (and I have been in and out of therapy for years but bdd is a majority a socially rooted issue imo and so therapy has never helped me personally) 2) the way bdd works is you ‘fix’ one flaw and become fixated on another or further hyper fixate on the ‘fixed’ flaw with it still not being good enough etc. So I would get more syringes every 4 months and this went on for like 2 years. I totally disfigured my face and ofc I regret it now looking back. It’s been four years since my last syringe and I still have filler in my lips (docs used to say our bodies break it down over time but new info has come out showing this isn’t true and filler can remain for years, and needs to be dissolved by an enzyme which ofc conveniently costs as much money as getting the filler, so I haven’t gotten them dissolved bc $$$) and ironically now one of my bdd fixations is…my botched lips lol since the filler migrated instead of dissolved, it’s basically all in the portion of skin above my upper lip. So much money spent - I would spend all the money I made on filler. Every day Id look in the mirror and swear my lips had deflated over night. Ofc looking back with objective eyes that wasn’t the case!   So that’s my story with my own cosmetic saga..I try my best to warn women about fillers and lots of women thankfully have come out w similar stories (not the bdd part, but being botched by filler migrating rather than dissolving) but the PS industry is a self perpetuating cycle that creates and relies on beauty standards and insecurity. Purely cosmetic surgery is not an autonomous choice, we don’t live in a vacuum and our ‘choices’ are fully impacted by societal messages including beauty standards and female socialization.	1642746426.0	htkfmug	t3_s8g16r	t3_s8g16r	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8g16r/i_regret_my_plastic_surgery_the_impact_of_the/htkfmug/
yz5qp	A few days ago Russia passed a new law under which p*dos will get a life sentence, and it applies to having s*x with anyone younger than 18 (if you're 18 or older) and the amount of men angry at this new law is terrifying. Some of my male acquaintances asked why I'm not worried since "women can be p*dos too" and I was like "Well, I'm not worried because I have no plans of having s*x with minors. And if you're afraid of someone accusing you of this crime — it sure sounds like you're the problem".	1642746432.0	htkfn5j	t3_s8ipsv	t1_hth9v06	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8ipsv/part_2_i_blocked_him_but_he_used_someone_elses/htkfn5j/

172w3bkm	My ex would withdraw affection and communication when he got into his negative moods. It really made me feel like I was walking on eggshells with him. He crossed boundaries, and I lit myself on fire for his needs.... then he broke them. He would sometimes rage,p and pick needless fights. He would diss me, intimidate me when he was angry. Out of self-defense, i dished it back too and he upped the ante.  &#x200B;  I realized he had a traumatized childhood and did not have any secure attachment with his parents, they emotionally manipulated him since he was young. (Controlling family, his mom probably a narcissist) He projected and took out his stress on me. He even so dared to say, ”You put conditions on our relationship, and that’s weak to me.” After I supported you at your lowest point?

10fuzrmb	I didn’t like the language used in the articles I was coming across and the one I ended up linking was the one with the least offensive wording to me (which may not have been the most legit one).   While I don’t want to promote incel propaganda *(and I see what you’re saying it does have those vibes)* I’m going to leave it up. If it is incel propaganda, it’s not very good because there will always be women who try to get pregnant by famous men. That’s nothing new. Damn, it’s really bad incel propaganda because the “evil females” will now think to smell and carefully examine the contents of a used condom before trying to use it.   I didn’t know all these other crappy things Drake has done to women until others commented them here, and for that reason I’m leaving this post up.

8wzhy2dr	In college two friends and me broke up with a pick me friend. It was a real break up, with a fight, tears, etc. But she became unbearable. For two years all she could talk about were the guys she was flirting/sleeping with and whining that she was not in a relationship. Right in the beginning of it I got so annoyed that I wanted to cut ties, but then her mother died. She was shaken and I pitied her, so I (and all of the others) supported her during this time. Two years later everything was still about her and her trouble to find a boyfriend. She nearly stalked one guy she had a crush on. It was embarassing to watch but she did not listen to us at all. Then she finally got together with her now boyfriend (/husband? I don't know). He was a model of a LVM, misogynistic, arrogant, condescending and always acting like he had to mansplain the world to us, stupid girls that we are. He is 6 years older than her too.	1642749930.0	htkkv00	t3_s8y6si	t3_s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/htkkv00/
