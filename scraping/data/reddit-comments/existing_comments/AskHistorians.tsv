y03e0	In support of your point, it is important to remember that criticism of the armament of WWII tanks frequently boils down to comparing penetration values to the frontal armor of the heaviest German tanks. Given the proportion of German units who had zero tanks of any kind, and in fact would have been more or less recognizable to their forefathers in 1918, the HE rounds are important. And rather than worrying about Tiger II frontal armor, if a round can punch a Pz IV or Stug III, it can take on the vast majority of armored vehicles that would appear in their sights.	1642692580.0	htgvayl	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfxm6l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htgvayl/
w9ir1	Preemptively clearing some confusion: حرام (with a long second a) and حرم (with a short a) are separate words, but they are related. The first term is *haram* from *halal/haram*. The second term is the one referring to the household.  To continue. Yes, subordinate rulers, princes, noblemen, even minor landlords, had a *haram* (or *zenanah* as it is called in Persian). How many people populated this household and how prosperous it was naturally depended on the man's standing and wealth. In other words, those who could afford to have separate quarters for their womenfolk, had them.   That means that a poor Punjabi farmer with a wife and son would not have a *haram*. His landlord would.  This whole practise of seclusion, veiling, concealment etc. is called *pardah* (Persian for "curtain")  Lastly, in the subcontinent, *pardah* was/is practised by Muslims and some upper-caste Hindus.	1642692920.0	htgw65y	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htf6g9x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htgw65y/

2ycwtyy0	I apologize if this comment is not considered in-depth enough for the subreddit, but I'll give it my best shot.  First, we know that the Chinese were using some sort of postal system well before the 1800s, if only because Marco Polo wrote about it. Marco Polo describes in his *Travels* that the postal system comprised of a series of waypoints that the letters would be delivered to-- a messenger would travel to the designated postal area, hand off the letter, and then another messenger with a fresh horse would then deliver it to the next area, and so on until it finally reached its destination.  &#x200B;  >At each station four hundred good horses are kept in constant readiness, in order that all messengers going and coming upon the business of the grand khan, and all ambassadors, may have relays, and, leaving their jaded horses, be supplied with fresh ones. Even in mountainous districts, remote from the great roads, where there were no villages, and the towns are far distant from each other, his majesty has equally caused buildings of the same kind to be erected, furnished with every thing necessary, and provided with the usual establishment of horses. He sends people to dwell upon the spot, in order to cultivate the land, and attend to the service of the post; by which means large villages are formed. In consequence of these regulations, ambassadors to the court, and the royal messengers, go and return through every province and kingdom of the empire with the greatest convenience and facility...    >   >\[...\]   >   >In the intermediate space between the post-houses, there are small villages settled at the distance of every three miles, which may contain, one with another, about forty cottages. In these are stationed the foot-messengers, likewise employed in the service of his majesty. They were girdles around their waists, to which several small bells are attached, in order that their coming may be perceived at a distance; and as they run only three miles, that is, from one of these footstations to another next adjoining, the noise serves to give notice of their approach, and preparation is accordingly made by a fresh courier to proceed with the packet instantly upon the arrival of the former... at each of these three-mile stations there is a clerk, whose business it is to note the day and hour at wich one courier arrives and the other departs; which is likewise done at all the post-houses.   >   >***- The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian*** (translated by Thomas Wright, 2002)  While Marco Polo is obviously describing a messenger relay system being used by the Great Khan to correspond with other important peoples, that might not be considered sufficient enough of an answer, because it seems you're asking how normal people would write letters to one another.  Your average layperson was not able to use this postal system. It is only being used to deliver correspondence to government officials or would-be government officials. In that case, it's just a matter of knowing who the recipient is and which district they reside in.  &#x200B;  >There was a well-established old order which met the needs of the Chinese state and people on a pre-modern basis. The state had its long established official post, a far flung network of post stations on major routes over which horse relays carried couriers with official communications, as well as personages, and goods.   >   >\[...\]   >   >Although the system was very efficient by pre-modern standards, it had become increasingly inadequate by the late Ch'ing period. Besides, the official postal system served exclusively the needs of the government; postal service for private individuals varied with the locale. A city-dweller could enjoy the luxury of having his mail delivered or picked up by a courier at his house or his place of business and transmitted safely to any part of China at reasonable cost by the commercial letter agencies, *(min*) *hsin-chii*, called hongs by Westerners. For those living in the interior or in certain rural areas, however, courier facilities were either infrequent or non-existent. Very often, letters were sent by special messengers or were entrusted to muleteers, chair-bearers, travelers and the like because couriers and letter agencies tended to operate only in large towns and along routes where there was a sufficient volume of commercial correspondence to make it profitable.   >   >\[...\]   >   >Because of the importance attached to official correspondence, no Chinese government extended the use of the postal system to the people.

Main post routes radiated from Peking, connecting it with all provincial capitals where resided the governors-general, governors, commissioners, and commanders-in chief. Subsidiary post routes formed numerous networks around each district. Along the five main routes, at intervals of about 100 li, were post stations with horses and other facilities, and on subsidiary routes, at intervals of approximately fifteen to twenty-five li, were foot-courier stations.   >   >***- Postal Communication in China and Its Modernization 1860-1896***by Ying-Wan Cheng; East Asian Research Center Harvard University (1970)  &#x200B;  So, if you're a low-ranking Chinese official who lives in a huge metropolitan area, and you want to deliver your letter to another official, what you do is go to the postal station and hand the courier your letter. You tell him who it is to be delivered to and which district they live in. He then runs off to the next station, and hands it off to the next guy. So on and so forth until it eventually reaches the correct station. Once there, a foot courier then goes to the official's house or place of work and hands the letter to them.	1642693791.0	htgyf3d	t3_s88meg	t3_s88meg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htgyf3d/

8brve	"Historiography" is basically "the history of history." It's how historians have argued about history over the years. So it's a good place to start if you are thinking about doing history in a serious way, but it is also somewhat daunting because there is a lot to learn and a lot of historiography can feel pretty theoretical and obtuse if you are not steeped in these old academic debates.  For the history of science, I would recommend looking into how historians of science talk about doing their work, and what the goals and methods of the history of science are. These are often quite different from how scientists talk about their own history, and very different from how history is integrated into a scientific curriculum. The goal of history in a science class, for example, is to situate the future-scientist in understanding how the current theories were developed, so it is a "march of winners" (and usually a few big names who are meant to represent what it means to be a scientist — so in a physics/astronomy class you get the classic Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, Newton procession). In the serious study of the history of science, we don't assume that there is a smooth transition between old ideas and new ideas (often the new ideas are quite different than the old ones, even when they use the same terms), and we also are interested in the "losers" of history as well (you can't really understand Galileo without understand Christoph Clavius, for example; Clavius was the dominant Jesuit astronomer in Galileo's time, and would have written the text books that Galileo himself would have learned from, and was the chief arbiter of how the Church would respond to Galileo's claims, and so he's super important to understanding who Galileo thought he was talking to and how his claims were received). Historians of science are also very interested in peeling back the practice of science from the idea that it is just about "big ideas" or "big discoveries" done by "big men." There's always been a lot more to scientific practice than that version of things, if you care about how it actually happened.  ANYWAY. The above are just some examples of "baseline" historiographical assumptions by historians of science. There are many more ways to think about it. If I were preparing a very basic historiographical overview for someone looking to approach this topic seriously, it might include:  * Thomas Kuhn, _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ — a place to _start_ and not to _end_. Kuhn is the most famous philosopher/historian of science by _far_ but that is because he started a lot of conversations, not because he answered them. Most historians of science today are NOT Kuhnians. But he is a very useful introduction to thinking about what makes the history of science difficult to do, and some of his basic methodological arguments (like, you should try to understand how historical scientists understood their own work on its own terms — don't approach the past looking to show whether it is right or wrong according to modern scientific understanding, as that is not very productive/useful) hold up. Take his "model" of scientific revolutions with a grain of salt; most fields don't exhibit quite the dynamics that Kuhn argues for. And a lot of it is muddled.  * Ludwik Fleck, _Genesis and development of a scientific fact_ — is a precursor to Kuhn (a lot of people think Kuhn basically ripped off Fleck), and is worth reading after Kuhn, just to see how the same ideas are fleshed out in somewhat different (and arguably more sensitive) ways.   * Stephen Shapin and Simon Schaffer, _The Leviathan and the Air-Pump_ — a now-classic historical study of arguments about the nature of the vacuum in 17th century England. Even if you have no interest in 17th-century England, there are tons of methodological approaches being espoused here (you can roughly think of this approach as being very influenced by the SSK — Social Study of Knowledge — school of thinking), including how to think about how historical make claims to truth, the meaning and role of experiments and instruments, and the social nature of scientific discourse (who is allowed in a laboratory, and who is not? who is allowed to attend scientific meetings, and who is not? etc.). Overall a hugely influential book on how historians of science of all periods work today.  * Bruno Latour, _The Pasteurization of France_ — Latour is a sociologist/anthropologist, but a lot of the modern history of science is heavily influenced by insights from qualitative sociology and anthropology, and all historians of science have read this book. You don't have to love Latour (lots of historians don't)  but knowing about how Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is applied to the historical study of science is very important to making sense of a lot of modern history of science.   The above are just sort of the bog-standard texts that all historians of science will have probably read at some point (usually in graduate school). Beyond that you start to get into much more subject-specific histories. So if you were interested in the history of physics, you'd want to look at the writings of Peter Galison and his students (of which I am one). If you were interested in the history of biology, there is a whole other literature there depending on which angles you were looking at. And so on and so on, for any subfield or approach you can imagine.  Now, you're saying, crap. I didn't ask for how to become a graduate student in this field, and I'm not going to read 80 books before I start on my project. I hear you. But I would take a look (even a skim) at some of these resources. At the very least, read Kuhn, because he provides a LOT of discussions about how (and why) to do history of ideas, and that sounds relevant to what you are interested in.   Separately, there are books on how to do history _in general_ — not relating to the history of science. These cover things like, how to think critically about primary sources, what are primary and secondary sources, how to document your work through citation, etc. I believe the FAQ has some recommendations for these. This kind of stuff is useful (most of it is unsurprising, I think), but in a way I would emphasize the other historiographical stuff (e.g. Kuhn) a bit more. Because the hard part about doing history is not downloading all of the papers on a given topic and tracing through the footnotes — scientists do that all the time as part of their literature reviews — or going to an archive and saying, "show me all of the letter in this folder by this old scientist." The hard part is _making sense_ of these things in a way that doesn't commit serious errors (like attributing a modern understanding to a historical figure who thought about it very differently). And that's where the historiography will come into play.   Kuhn, for example, has an excellent discussion about why it is so difficult to answer question, "when was oxygen discovered, and by who?" You'd think it was simple, and the textbook version makes it seem like you can say, "on this date, Lavoisier or Priestly understood oxygen existed," but the reality is that the understanding of it emerged in pieces over a protracted period of time, and didn't "cohere" until a much later date. As a result it's one of those things that probably _doesn't_ have a distinct moment of discovery, but rather the idea of its "discovery" is sort of a backwards, after-the-fact narrative framing of what was actually a more complex and muddy process. This kind of stuff is important, because the "bad narrative" history of science gives us a poor understanding of the reality of how science works (and the consequences of that can be more than intellectual — no historian of science that I know was surprised that the CDC's understanding of how COVID-19 worked took a while to work out, but you can see that lots of people accustomed to a model of "scientists just get the right answer" lost a lot of faith seeing that play out in real time about something they cared about).	1642694530.0	hth0dq6	t3_s8kqxq	t3_s8kqxq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth0dq6/
esjzc	Why is Friday called 'Congregation Day' in Arabic?  I have looked at a previous Ask Historians thread about why Muslims congregate on Friday as well as searched online.  There is general agreement that the Quran commands muslims to congregate on 'Congregation Day' AKA Friday in Arabic, but this seems circular.  If Friday was already known as Congregation Day before this command, then why was that so? Was there a customary congregation on the 6th day in pre-Islamic Arabia? And if so, why the sixth day and for what purpose?  If Friday became known as Congregation Day AFTER the Quranic command, then why was the 6th day chosen?	1642694805.0	hth13gf	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hth13gf/

9x5qn2xl	Vikings avoided battles as much as they could, especially with the Franks due to their superior cavalry and weaponry. Instead they excelled in amphibious warfare. Danes did their best to achieve wealth through regular raiding without having to fight costly battles. They operated in small, independent war bands. They targeted soft targets, such as churches, abbeys and trading centres. They also struck towns when festivals and holidays were being celebrated for greater haul of treasure. For example, Danes raided Tours three days before the feast of Saint Martin in 1853. They also took political and ecclesiastical hostages and held them for ransom. This was all made possible by the use of narrow longships that were perfect for both sea and river voyages so were able to penetrate deeply into the Frankish interior. For example, a viking fleet rowed 210 miles up the Garonne river to Toulouse in 1844.  Therefore, the reason for their success was that viking bands were fast, adaptable and cleverly opportunistic. They were able to attack  where they knew the rewards were great and the defenses weak. They knew  when to fight and when to escape, when to approach by ship and when to  ride overland, when to accept tribute and when to plunder. Several groups of  vikings could band together quickly when needed and go their separate ways  when this served them better. Indeed, a warrior band could even take employment with a European ruler to stave off another viking band or to fight his  other enemies, even his own family members: “To Sigfrid and Gorm and their  accomplices he \[Charles the Fat in 882\] gave several thousand pounds of silver  and gold which he had seized from the treasury of St-Stephen at Metz and from  the resting-places of other saints, and he gave them permission to stay so that  they could go on ravaging a part of his cousin’s kingdom as they had before.”  One example of viking defeat against the Franks is oddly the one that ended in setting up Normandy: the Siege of Chartres (911). Here the vikings significantly outnumbered the Franks, but were defeated with notable loses. However, Charles the simple, King of West Francia, was looking for more permanent solution to the viking problem, so he offered Rollo and his companions land centred on Rouen in return for serving as a buffer against future viking raids up the river. Rollo and his companions gladly accepted, being cleverly opportunistic as usual. The viking rus themselves were badly defeated by the Byzantines in the battle of Arcadiopolis and battle of dorostopol.  And if we’re focusing on 11th century Normans, it has to be said that they were more likely French than viking by then, especially in Hastings.  >It is also interesting to note that few of the participating nobles in the Battle of Hastings were from the Cotentin Peninsula. Moreover, and none were reported to have supplied ships.This would suggest a clear demarcation between Lower Normandy and the Cotentin Peninsula. In part, this demarcation could reflect continued resentment of William’s rule within this region, insofar as the revolt of 1047 discussed earlier was in fact led by a prominent Cotentin lord. Still another trend which is of interest is the relationship between the nobles’ and knights’ origins and the relative density of early Viking settlement in the duchy. According to a map of settlement names, there was a high density of Viking settlers in the Cotentin Peninsula and the Pays de Caux region. It is in precisely these regions where fewer Norman combatants originated, as opposed to the Bessin region around Bayeux which had far fewer Viking settlement names and thus fewer descendants of viking settlers. Therefore, the Normans who fought at the Battle of Hastings were more likely to have possessed French than Viking/Nordic ancestry.  Of course, this is not to say that vikings were bad warriors. I don’t think anyone claims that, but they were not superior militarily to their enemies.  Sources:  Medieval Maritime Warfare, Charles D.Stanton  Viking tactics in West Francia, William E.

152vfu	"German units who had zero tanks of any kind" includes, by late 1944, a lot of German tank units.    Tanks weren't being attacked just by tanks: aside from improving tank armament and anti-tank guns both towed and mounted on various chassis, German armour faced considerable threats from the air.  Not just from tactical aircraft, but strategic bombing all the way from the refinery that made the fuel and metal, the factory that built them, the trains and tracks used to transport them, and so on, right up to the front line.  The Panzer Lehr was effectively annihilated during the fighting around St Lo, and amongst the weapons doing serious damage were M10 tank destroyers and (in Operation Cobra) strategic bombers pressed into what amounted to tactical service.	1642696253.0	hth4zoi	t3_s89fqq	t1_htgvayl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hth4zoi/
hkr7nkbc	Wow! Thank you for this response, it's about everything I was looking for.  I was aware of Kuhn's work, but I didn't know about its relationship with Fleck. In my mind, I'm more familiar with discussions surrounding Lakatos, Feyerabend, Kuhn and Popper.   You're right that I'm hesitant to read so much before starting my project, but I will definitely put these on my reading list. Since you seem to be well informed on this topic, I was wondering if you knew about some modern works on the philosophy of science? (If that's something separate?)  I'm particularly interested in the social sciences, neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology. I'm aware that Kurt Danziger is one historian of psychology, but do you know of any others by any chance?	1642696272.0	hth51hs	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth51hs/
b0uy0vfb	Alright. So, the first thing I want to note is that this is a topic that lends itself in a way few others do to sensationalism and propaganda. So, if you want to research this in your own time think critically and try to find academic sources rather than mere newspaper articles as the non academic sources I found tended to be… not good.   The main thing to note is that the cannibalism occurred over a roughly six week period in 1968 from May to July during the violent factional infighting that occurred at the time. An official government investigation of the cannibalism occurred in 1981-83 and later the Chinese author Zheng Yi conducted a personal investigation throughout the mid to late 80s which has been both praised and criticised for its content.   **The Background: Guangxi in 1968**  Guangxi in 1968 was an extremely turbulent place notorious for its violence. It had been led by a man named Wei Guoqing since 1954, however by 1968 Wei was in hot water. The Cultural Revolution started in the area in 1967 and almost immediately a rival faction appeared in the local party organisation, led by a man called Wu Chinnan. Wei’s faction was named the “Big Faction” or “Guangxi United Command of Proletarian Revolutionaries” and Wu’s “Small Faction” or “Guangxi April 22 Revolutionary Action Command” or just “4.22”. Wei’s faction very much came out on top with the local militia, miliary and capitol coming out in his favour against the so called “Rebels”. Things escalated fairly quickly into violence after an imposed compromise was ignored by the Big Faction, who wanted to wipe out their enemies. On May 11 1968 a successful coordinated attack was launched upon multiple Small Faction strongpoints, with many of those who surrendered after the fighting being summarily executed. Violent struggle sessions were launched in the area, with an extraordinary 90 of the 144 areas in Wuxuan county (The area most studied and seemingly the epicentre of the violence) having sessions that ended with impromptu executions. This was extraordinarily violent even by the Cultural Revolutions standards, with the official investigation stating that 524 people were executed in the area. It is worth noting however that whilst high level officials in Guangxi directly ordered and encouraged violence and extrajudicial killings they did not order cannibalism, that was something that occurred at a lower level.   **The Cannibalism**  Of the 524 executed in Wuxuan government reports state that somewhere between 64 and 76 people were eaten throughout the counties municipality and nine communes. To give some more details in a list Zheng writes that of 64 people killed and eaten 56 had their heart and liver cut out, 18 were completely eaten, 13 had their genitals eaten, one was decapitated after being eaten and 7 were reportedly cut up whilst still alive. Those doing the killing were for the most part not the violent, idealistic students many imagine when they think of the Cultural Revolution. Instead, the perpetrators were those at least ostensibly on the side of law and order who had been trained to follow orders and serve as a moral example to the community engaging in a violent purge of their perceived enemies. To give an example of such cannibalism taking place Zhang Boxun (perceived as being a supporter of the Small Faction) attempted to escape a struggle session in June 18 by jumping into a river, but was caught, killed and had his heart and liver cut out by militiaman Guo Lixiang who together with another man cooked them in a pot. A notable aspect of the cannibalism that occurred is that people from diverse parts of society participated in Wuxuan cannibalism, from idealistic youths to old women, teachers and even state functionaries. It was not limited to just one social group.  **Why Cannibalism?**  Probably the most natural question to ask at this point is why cannibalism? This kind of even did not commonly occur in other parts of China under similar circumstances and it is not like there was a famine in the area forcing people to engage in this behaviour.   Unfortunately, there isn’t really one simple answer to this question. However, there are various reasons that have been proposed as at least partial explanation for why the people of the area decided to eat their enemies as well as kill them.   Firstly, it was a group activity. Cannibalism seems to have generally occurred in group “human flesh banquets”(as Zheng states the masses called it) in which peer pressure was brought to bare. This was effective, with over 80 of the Huangmao Foodstuffs Depot and Distribution Office units members reportedly eating meals made from other people, some reportedly under duress. Cannibalism seems to have served as a way to check and affirm peoples loyalty, and bears some similarity to traditional communal feasts.   Secondly the cannibalism often seems to have been somewhat symbolic, notable here is the fact that a majority of those killed had their hearts and livers extracted and eaten. Important symbolic parts of the body were being extracted and eaten, not necessarily all of the body. Beliefs are held in parts of China that those who eat specific of a goshawk or tiger become strong and brave, perhaps eating enemies’ livers and hearts were perceived as having a similar function.  Cultural arguments have also been made, pointing out similarities between the cannibalism and traditional Zhuang ox sacrifices or Chinese folk tales involving cannibalism. These arguments are unsurprisingly extremely controversial, with Zheng (the author who conducted a personal investigation) being accused by some of cultural chauvinism against the Zhuang for such insinuations.   Political tensions obviously also played a role, with those eaten being killed at the end of a struggle session or a fight against the Big Faction. This is the explanation that seems to have become most popular in the western media, with blame being laid on communism in general and the cultural revolution in particular for creating the hatreds that inspired the cannibalism. This is an argument that is again extremely controversial, mostly in the extent to which communism as an ideology is to blame as opposed to local conditions.   Communal tension also has been suggested as a cause, with some instances of murder and cannibalism such as the murder of Peartree Li’s family seeming to occur mostly due to pre-existing hatreds finally having an outlet. Grudges taken to a murderous extreme are well documented to have occurred in other parts of China during the Cultural Revolution, cannibalism may have served as a final, extreme insult to the deceased and their family.  **It's Legacy**  The cannibalism that occurred there has a complicated legacy. Zheng Yi’s book on the topic is our main source of information but has serious flaws with some of his conclusions (for example that 10,000 people ate human flesh) not being justified by the evidence he provides. The work has also been accused of morphing into a political polemic, unconcerned with historical accuracy. The government of China restricts access to records of the topic, which means that major historians of the area end up being people like Song Yongyi who whilst a respected academic has also been arrested by the Chinese government for stealing state secrets and has a distinctly negative attitude towards the Chinese government.   Overall, what I would take away is that the cannibalism occurred during a time of absolutely massive internal tension in the area over a period of about six weeks in which one revolutionary faction suppressed another with extreme violence. A wide range of other reasons have been proposed for why the cannibalism occurred, however there is no single answer that applies to all cases, and likely never will be.	1642696568.0	hth5u2x	t3_s81fmu	t3_s81fmu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s81fmu/why_did_massive_massive_cannibalism_occur_in_the/hth5u2x/

mbx1lsj	This is such an important point that I feel often gets forgotten when discussing WWII tanks, especially British infantry tanks like the Churchill. The vast majority of fighting that all tanks did in WWII was against infantry, and a gun that has limited HE capacity is borderline useless against soft targets like infantry, anti-tank guns, artillery, unarmored/lightly-armored vehicles, etc. Infantry tanks in particular were not designed to go toe-to-toe with other tanks, but rather to do exactly what their name implies: support the infantry against enemy infantry. In this role, the Churchill was arguably one of the most successful tanks of the war.  Now of course infantry tanks did go up against enemy tanks from time to time, and while their thick armor gave them decent survivability, their mediocre capacity for AP fire did hold them back, at least against heavily-armored late-war German tanks like the Panther or Tiger, which as you rightly said were few and far between; the 75mm gun was more than adequate for dealing with the more common Pz IV's and Stug III's. But from a doctrine standpoint, the infantry tank, especially the Churchill, did what it was designed to do and did it effectively.	1642696860.0	hth6md1	t3_s89fqq	t1_htgvayl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hth6md1/

Seems pretty ignorant to write it off as Afrocentric when Africans aren’t the only non Europeans? I do realize there was a slave trade but it’s hard to believe thats all there is to it.

bfvcv	The earliest reference I could find online was a footnote in the University of Western Ontario Medical Journal from 1951 which ends: "But, then, I always was a [cunning linguist](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1bU0AQAAIAAJ&q=cunning+linguist&dq=cunning+linguist&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2k9Ks48D1AhXilFwKHb-FDu8Q6AF6BAgIEAI)."  Having searched a bunch of different newspaper archives, the earliest I could find there was an anecdote titled "Wall Scribbler Caught In Act" where a man in his late 50s writes "I am a [cunning linguist](https://www.newspapers.com/image/152649153/?terms=%22cunning%20linguist%22&match=1)" on an ice cream vending machine. This was in the *Akron Beacon Journal* for 12 May 1967.  There are also exciting and incorrect answers on Quora etc. which claim variously that the joke didn't exist before 1968 (based on Google N-Grams), and that 'cunnilingus' wasn't even a term until the 1940s. The OED does not bear this last idea out, with cunnilingus attested to as describing an activity in 1864.   More interestingly, the primary meaning shifted in the 20th century from a person who performs the act to the act itself. Before ~1900 you might say e.g. "he was employed as a cunnilingus for the Queen of Sheba".	1642697438.0	hth86n2	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htg3vd1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hth86n2/

8brve	The modern philosophy of science is, in my view, pretty divorced from the practice of doing history, and from insights into thinking about the history of science. As some point in the last few decades, the historians and the philosophers went in very different directions (the philosophers got much more analytical and much less interested in history, is one way to think about it). So there is a reason that all of the relevant stuff (Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, Popper, Fleck, etc.) is from the 1930s-1970s, and then all of the "philosophical" work in the history of science comes from other sources (anthropologists, sociologists, and other historians). Amusingly, the History of Science Society and the Philosophy of Science Association still co-locate their meetings every few years, but there is very little overlap between the two in terms of the questions they are asking. (There are some historians and philosophers who lament this, there are some who do not.)  So the odds are you will find more philosophical discussions that are useful for history by reading historians of science. E.g., Galison for thinking about physics, Rheinberger for thinking about biology — both are historians are their heart but they do philosophical things with it.  The term that would seem most useful for looking into are the "history of the human sciences," which is what we mean for the history of social sciences, anthropology, psychology, etc.   One other resource: there are a few series like the Cambridge History of Science that basically get scholars to summarize entire fields in single articles, and always have a sort of methodological introduction. These can be very useful. The Cambridge History of Science, volume 7, is about the modern social sciences ("psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, geography, history, and statistics"); I would definitely take a look at it! The introduction is on "Writing the history of social science," by Ted Porter and Dorothy Ross, who are both immensely respected historians.	1642697675.0	hth8urk	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth51hs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth8urk/

30n1rleb	Does anyone know how to find original texts of petitions to the English Parliament from the late 1300s?  I'm doing deep dive into historical environmental impacts of trawling fisheries, and found an excellent resource from 1889;  * Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission. (1889). United States: U.S. Government Printing Office.  Inside, it contains a reference to a petition to the English Parliament of 1376-77, referenced as such:  * Pet. 51, Edw. III, A.D. 1376-'77. - Petition No. 50  The US Commission book contains a quote of the text, which describes the nets being used, states a complaint about degraded fisheries over a period of seven years, and a response that a commission should be made to "inquire and certify on the truth of this allegation" but I'd love to be able see the full text. I know it's a stretch, but tips on how to look for the context surrounding petitions at this time (i.e. who made the complaint, and where did this happen specifically?), and any results of the aforementioned commission would also be greatly appreciated.   I was going to do a full post for this, but saw this thread and thought it might fit better here.

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642699926.0	hthf59n	t3_s8o7ks	t3_s8o7ks	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8o7ks/what_war_did_my_relative_serve_in/hthf59n/
8brve	For historians, I'm not sure it's easy to generalize, other than saying, "usually questions about how social and intellectual contexts affect and are affected by scientific work" (which is very vague, and still not encompassing), but you can get a sense by looking at the [kinds of papers that people are presenting at the annual meetings](https://hssmeeting.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/1/sessiongallery/schedule?dayId=1&searchParams=%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22sortMode%22%3A%22SessionName%22%2C%22sortDirection%22%3A%22Ascending%22%2C%22sortByFieldId%22%3Anull%2C%22displayMode%22%3Anull%2C%22filterByFieldValues%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByTextValue%22%3Anull%2C%22filterByFavorites%22%3Afalse%2C%22filterByScheduleRoomIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterBySessionTypeIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByScheduleDayIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByScheduleTimeSlotIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22isScheduleOtherEventSearchAllowed%22%3Atrue%7D) (apologies in advance that this online conference platform makes it hard to see these at a glance — I prefer PDFs...). Much of the work of the history of science these days is in a mode of "descriptive/interpretive" more so than "trying to come up with an answer to a philosophical question."   Similarly with the [PSA](https://dryfta-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/psa2020/eventdocs/1636310360MeetingProgram-PSA2021-2021-09.pdf) — you can see that the questions they are trying to answer are very abstract and rarely have anything like historical case studies to back them up. That's fine, they can do their own thing, but it's not very useful for historians.	1642700056.0	hthfi2b	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hthbhx8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hthfi2b/

2liuru	According to Aelian (*Historical Miscellany* 12.12), "Note that on Crete at Gortyn an adulterer when caught was brought before the magistrates and after conviction was made to wear a garland of wool. The garland amounted to accusation that he was depraved and effeminate, and had looks appealing to women." So either the specific form of the garland was feminine, or it was because wool was a symbol of women's work like spinning and weaving, or dressing him up in appealing clothing was supposed to refer to the sexual nature of his crime.	1642701917.0	hthkndc	t3_s7wggh	t1_hth244y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7wggh/christian_mythology_has_roman_soldiers_putting_a/hthkndc/

pncvt	### Introduction and Theory  I cannot claim to be a particular specialist in martial arts or in its historiography – my greatest hands-on experience has been about two years of Wing Chun I did before the age of 10; my attempts to actually look into the history of this topic has been marred by just how barren a lot of the historiography is.  But the explanation of that comparative barrenness is part of the answer to your question, because it explains how the myth has continued to have such presence and currency. As Paul Bowman puts it, when it comes to the writing of the history of martial arts, there are in effect  > two different kinds of discourse, each claiming to be knowledge: ideological and mystical, on the one hand, versus verifiable and somewhat more prosaic, on the other.  And in turn, there are distinct priorities and desires among the proponents of each. By and large, hands-on practitioners of martial arts will repeat the stories told within their own discipline(s), not least because they form part of the overall 'package' of being a practitioner. Academic historians of martial arts, however, will be looking critically at what can be verified through reliable sources, irrespective of what is believed by the practitioners. Indeed, academic *anythings* will do that – specialists in the human, for instance, will investigate the actual, empirically verifiable effects of martial arts on the body and the mechanisms by which those effects occur, irrespective of what the specific claims made by practitioners may be.  Before continuing, it is worth making two digressions to set the scene a bit. The first is to echo Bowman's point that although these discourses are incompatible, neither is more legitimate inherently. The invented traditions of various disciplines as they exist today are nevertheless important to those disciplines as they exist, and even if they are in a sense 'lies' they are still the basis of sincerely held beliefs about particular practices; yet it is still important to have a grasp of verifiable reality when it comes to the various dimensions of martial arts.  The second is to note that the majority of contemporary historical writing on East Asian martial arts is non-academic in nature and written by present-day practitioners – [not unlike military history in the 19th and early 20th centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dca5b9/historiographic_question_what_is_new_military/f288xkw/) – with serious academic approaches being comparatively recent. However, it is quite fortunate that much of this academic material, precisely because it is competing with repeated myths and received wisdom, is relatively accessible – for instance, the journal *Martial Arts Studies* is open-access, and so too is the article I'm drawing on by Paul Bowman. What it means is that both compete in the same arena, and there is arguably no real middle ground: practitioners themselves will have difficulty accepting that their disciplines' received knowledge is at best inaccurate and at worst complete bunk; academics will understandably be miffed at the suggestion that they ought to treat this received wisdom as having equal value to what is actually verifiable.  This sets the scene for *why* the myth has persisted: for the martial arts practitioner, whether there actually was a Southern Shaolin Temple or not is irrelevant, because it did exist in the context of their own perspective on their own practiced tradition. The historian cannot change the practitioner's mind because the two are operating on different wavelengths, so to speak. As for *how*, that's a different question that we can dig into a bit.  ### The History  We can, with decent certainty, say that the Qing were not particularly keen on the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan or its attendant branches, for two principal reasons.   The first was that, like many other Eurasian powers of the Early Modern period, the Qing liked to rationalise their domains and constituents, and disliked entities that lay somewhat beyond their power. The Shaolin Monastery was only one of many Chinese Buddhist institutions over which the Qing did not necessarily exert direct control, and which which were themselves only one part of a general distrust of independent religious institutions that also broadly applied to Daoist temples. The second was that, like many Buddhist and Daoist temples with a martial arm, the Shaolin Monastery had contributed troops to support the Ming in the previous dynasty's wars, albeit against the Shun rebels of Li Zicheng rather than the Manchus. Despite not being one of the temples that supplied troops to the 'Southern' Ming during the Qing conquest of south China (of which there were many), the Shaolin Temple was nevertheless perceived as a potential locus of Ming loyalism, not just by the Qing state itself but also by elites who objected to what they saw as illegitimate alien rule. Thanks in part to the romantic writings of resentful ex-Ming officials, there came to be a pervasive but frankly impossible myth that the Shaolin monks had rebelled against Qing rule and that the monastery's destitute state in the late 17th century was a result of imperial reprisals that had stopped just short of ordering its total dissolution.  The reality was that by the time that Qing rule extended over Henan, the Shaolin Monastery had already been in pretty dire straits. In supplying troops to the Ming to fight off Li Zicheng, the Shaolin Monastery lost many of its monks in battle against Li and his allies, but its troubles did not end there, as it was subsequently preyed on by local warlords who had emerged in the absence of Ming authority. According to local chronicles, one such warlord named Li Jiyu pretended to patronise the monastery, and at one stage requested that certain ceremonies be held for his birthday. As these were being performed, he had his troops storm the monastery, where they slaughtered the disarmed monks and destroyed much of its infrastructure. Some further damage may have been caused by the Qing army as it marched south through Henan in the 1640s. Left destitute, the monastery remained dilapidated for nearly a century, with decades of neglect under relatively apathetic Qing rule. The Qing did eventually patronise the monastery somewhat, but only from 1704 onward. These contributions could be significant, as the Yongzheng Emperor paid for substantial renovations in 1735, and in return the temple hosted the Qianlong Emperor during his first Southern Inspection in 1750. But while the core monastery saw some Qing patronage, its subsidiary shrines in the region were destroyed and dispersed as basically a final nail in the coffin for its power as a local institution. It never really regained its former prestige either, with nobody holding the post of head abbott between 1664 and *1999*. The Qing remained consistently suspicious of the monastery, which was often suspected of colluding with various dissident groups at least as late as the Eight Trigrams revolt in 1813, when official communications expressed concern that the monastery might harbour other sectarians.  Thanks to the earlier depredations, the Shaolin Monastery as a military entity had very much collapsed. The same chronicler who recorded the destruction of the temple by Li Jiyu reported visiting the temple some time between the late 1650s and 1670s, where he requested that two novices demonstrate their skills for him. 'Their performance was no better than that of street beggars. It was not worth watching.' While the monastery retained its legendary reputation for martial prowess, the Qing were not eager to allow it to be taken seriously; in 1775 the Qianlong Emperor officially forbade officials and officers from involving Buddhist monks in the army, in response to news that the governor of Henan had taken on Shaolin monks as army instructors. 'Having monks train his soldiers is not only beyond one’s authority,' wrote the emperor, 'it also makes him into a laughing stock.'	1642704297.0	hthr6pd	t3_s8ddl3	t3_s8ddl3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hthr6pd/
pncvt	### The Myth  The Qing conquest of China was, to say the least, a deeply traumatic event for many Han Chinese, especially as it involved the overthrow of the Ming, a state that had built itself on 'de-Mongolification' in the wake of Yuan rule, and which had upheld a sort of cosmically-ordained division between the 'civilised' and 'barbarian' worlds, made particularly potent by the construction of the Great Wall. Manifestations of anti-Qing sentiment often came in fits and starts, but it is probably fair to say that the Qing never could – and never did – feel entirely safe from a proto-nationalist uprising by any of their non-Manchu subjects. More importantly for the purposes of analysing the history of Shaolin, many organisations in southern China that pitched themselves as anti-Qing liked, for the purposes of PR and credibility, to claim continuity with movements and entities that had resisted the Qing invasion. Perhaps most prominent among these was – indeed, is – the Heaven and Earth Society in Fujian, splinters of which became the triad crime gangs, and which claims to have been formed when the Qing invaded southern China in the 1650s. There is, in fact, no verifiable truth to this: the Heaven and Earth Society came into existence in the early 1760s as a community mutual aid organisation, and only began anti-Qing agitation later in the decade, well after their foundation. What it goes to show, though, is that stories of an anti-Shaolin reprisal by the Qing were rooted in a pervasive anti-Qing attitude that was particularly prevalent in south Chinese society.  The origin story of the Heaven and Earth Society that eventually developed involves, surprise surprise, the Shaolin Monastery, and it seems to have been at least partly responsible for cementing the narrative that the Shaolin Monastery was destroyed during the Kangxi reign (1661-1722) and its practitioners scattered across southern China. That this was specifically a *Southern* Shaolin Monastery is not always consistently clear, and other variations on the Heaven and Earth Society's version of the myth sometimes claim it was the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan. However, the idea that this was a branch monastery – given the perhaps suspect timeframe of the destruction if it was supposed to be the original one – seems nevertheless to have had some currency. This did, however, have the perhaps unintended effect of leading to *several* monasteries claiming to be the rebuilt Southern Shaolin Monastery. According to Zhou Weiliang, at least three Buddhist temples in Fujian claimed to be the Southern Shaolin Monastery, with relatively little to actually show for it. But this claim nevertheless had currency, particularly in a region and in a time where it was possible to insinuate anti-Qing connections comparatively openly and expect that the extent of public support would outweigh the risks of official opposition.  To tie this in to the Hong Kong film industry, almost of HK martial arts cinema finds its roots in Wing Chun and its practitioners – more specifically, Ip Man's branch of Wing Chun – and Wing Chun basically replicates the Heaven and Earth Society's founding myth in claiming to originated from monks fleeing the destroyed Southern Shaolin Monastery. Judkins and Nielson argue that the claim of Shaolin origins among martial arts clans dates to at least the 1890s, when the trope also starts to appear in martial arts novels; this would track with the uptick in anti-Qing sentiments that would eventually lead to the empire's downfall, and which became particularly acute in the wake of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-5. That said, the Shaolin aspect of the Heaven and Earth Society's origin myth is attested as early as 1811, so the development in the 1890s ought to be understood as involving the adoption of this myth by martial arts groups, and not its original invention.  On top of this, modern East Asian martial arts owe a lot to Japan, in that Japanese martial arts in the early 20th century were perhaps the most formalised and professionalised, thereby setting expectations for martial arts in the rest of Asia, and also in that martial arts became a way for East Asian countries to assert a sense of identity in response to the Japanese ascendancy in the region. Before the term *Wushu* (literally 'martial arts') was established as the standard by the Communist PRC, the Nationalist ROC referred to Chinese martial arts as *Guoshu*, literally 'national arts' (or 'the national art'). As an aside, a comparable dynamic can be seen with Taekwondo, which, despite its internal narrative of being an ancient Korean art, is functionally a branch of Shōtōkan karate which was given a Korean nationalist rebranding after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and used as part of the two new Korean states' attempts at nation-building in the post-colonial period.  Tying that back to Hong Kong, it is easy to retroject contemporary Hong Kong's tense relationship with Chinese nationhood back into the twentieth century, when the situation was actually a bit more clear-cut. Later nationalist claims of Manchu 'Sinicisation' aside, the essential foreignness of the Qing in their early decades has always been quietly understood (well, 'believed' is perhaps more appropriate), and so the story of the Shaolin monastery's destruction takes on a certain character of nationalist resistance – one with particular currency amid the rise of the Japanese Empire and the longer-term traumas this left, and also amid the continued British colonial presence in Hong Kong. Lest we forget that 1967 saw massive left-wing protests against British rule in which 51 Hongkongers were killed by British police; just four years later Bruce Lee burst onto the cinematic scene in *The Big Boss*.  An undercurrent of Chinese nationalism pervades a not insubstantial amount of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, and it is probably no surprise that Japan and the Japanese can be found as the antagonists in some of the more iconic works in the genre: 1972's *Fist of Fury* sees Bruce Lee beating up karate students in post-WW1 Shanghai; 2008's *Ip Man* is set largely during the Japanese occupation of southern China; the now somewhat obscure (but at the time quite popular) *Apkido*, also from 1972, is set in prewar, Japanese-ruled Korea. You can even find subtle hints in films that don't directly address the Japanese Empire: Bruce Lee's self-produced *Way of the Dragon* (1972 again) has a number of scenes where Bruce demonstrates the superiority of kung fu over karate, first against the employees at the restaurant he's protecting, and then against the thugs hired by the mafia boss (including Chuck Norris); Stephen Chow's *Kung Fu Hustle* (2004) evokes the overall period setting of the 1940s even if the Japanese are curiously absent. Going all the way back to the Shaolin temple, then, it forms part of a motif common across the genre where kung fu isn't just a cool fighting style, it's also an assertion of (Han) Chinese resilience.	1642704313.0	hthr8bd	t3_s8ddl3	t1_hthr6pd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hthr8bd/
7sxro	This is a really great question, and unfortunately one I'm not qualified to answer. *The Imperial Harem* is only about the sultans and only in Constantinople. The author does provide some generalizations, which I used to broaden my answer to OP's questions about Afghanistan, and which are probably applicable to Morocco as well.   Just in case, I pressed "Ctrl+F" in my e-textbook to see if Pierce ever mentions Morocco or North Africa, but all we got is a couple references to Ibn Battuta's writing.   There are very few textbooks about harems and ordinary women's lives in the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. [*The Colonial Harem* by Malek Alloula](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Colonial_Harem/AGi7AAAAIAAJ?hl=en) looks very promising. Alloula was Algerian and focuses his work on Algeria, which is the closest I could get to Morocco. I think I'm most likely to read [*Rethinking Orientalism: Women, Travel, and the Ottoman Harem* by Reina Lewis](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rethinking_Orientalism/LbWQ8gP5xWkC?hl=en). Finally, [*Harem* by Valentine Gallet](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Harem/quEkyAEACAAJ?hl=en) is an art history book that analyzes orientalist western art in the 1800s-1900s. I might buy that one to learn more about this art that is wildly problematic but also so gorgeous.  TL;DR: I'd have to buy several more textbooks to begin to answer your question. My knowledge of the Ottomans is also limited to what is necessary to understand their influence in Eastern Europe, and I'm not an expert in the Ottoman occupation of Egypt or the broader history of North Africa.	1642704377.0	hthrewt	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htdny9a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/hthrewt/

tzc66	I've been getting replies in my mail, although they don't show up here, perhaps they were deleted immediately after being posted?   I couldn't actually read the full replies, but from the small parts visible in my mail from reddit i could see one of them asked where i read about the "single son" policy.  I should have been more clear in my comment above i think. It was in /u/orangewombat [other response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mnk6yr/comment/gu6r3st/) to a similar question, which he linked above.  The part that left me confused is this one: > One mother, one son Although the sultan could have as many concubines as he wanted, it appears that a woman's eligibility for concubine status ended when she bore the sultan her first son. The woman and her son, the prince, would continue to live within the harem until well into his teenage years, but the woman was no longer eligible to be the sultan's sexual partner. “[C]oncubines were only temporary sexual partners of a sultan[.] It seems likely that there was a revolving-door policy in the imperial harem that deprived a woman who had borne a son of further eligibility for the sultan's bed.” Imperial Harem, loc. 770.	1642705509.0	hthuind	t3_s7sm1l	t1_hte1xfp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/hthuind/
7j3q5	To add to your excellent response, while the Valentine was quickly phased out of the British Armoured Regiments once the British started getting American Shermans, the Soviets actually liked it and used until the end of the war - Valentine production was even kept up until the end of the war at Soviet request (half of all Valentine production was eventually sent to the Soviet Union).  The main difference seems to be in its use - while the British were using it as an infantry support tank (In the various army tank brigades), where it was replaced by the Churchill or medium tank (26th Arm Bde in North Africa), where it was replaced by the Sherman.     Soviets tended to use it to replace light tanks like the T-70, (The Valentine is actually in the same weight class as the M5 Stuart, despite being substantially better protected) and after some kinks in the earlier Valentines were ironed out, they eventually received and used over 3,000 of them throughout the war (And the Soviets were picky about the tanks they received - they complained loudly when the British tried to dump obsolete Crusaders on them via Lend Lease).  Ironically enough, the upgunned Valentines (armed with the same 6-pdr as the early Churchill tanks) was less popular at first than the 2-pdr Valentines because they traded a turret Machine gun to fit te 6-pdr, and because of the lack of a good HE round for the 6-pdr until later in the war.	1642705782.0	hthv8tg	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfnuco	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hthv8tg/

551ffhkm	The Korean king Hyeonjong (r. 1009-1031) came to power through a coup. The previous king, Mokjong (r. 997-1009), had very little power over his kingdom. Goryeo (the Korean kingdom at the time) was effectively ruled by Mokjong's mother, Queen Dowager Cheonchu, and her lover Kim Chi-yang. There were many in the kingdom who weren't happy about this. Cheonchu and Kim Chi-yang had a son who they allegedly wanted to succeed the childless Mokjong, and the queen tried to have her nephew Hyeonjong killed since he was the only other one in line to be king.  During Mokjong's reign, Goryeo had achieved a tentative peace with the Khitans who ruled the Liao Empire to their north. They had agreed to submit to the Khitan emperor Shengzong instead of the Song (Han Chinese) emperor. This meant they paid tribute to him and also that they let Shengzong (or his representative) perform the official investiture of King Mokjong.  In 1009, though, Mokjong was overthrown in a coup. There were factions who wanted Hyeonjong to succeed Mokjong instead of Cheonchu's son with Kim Chi-yang. They deposed Mokjong, killed Kim Chi-yang and his son, and exiled Mokjong and the queen. During their flight from the capital, Mokjong was assassinated even though he had agreed to make Hyeonjong his successor. Hyeonjong was installed on the throne without knowing that Mokjong had been killed for it.  Meanwhile, the Khitan had been waiting for an opportunity to re-invade Goryeo. They had settled their war with the Song in 1005 with the Treaty of Shanyuan, so they were eager to claim more territory on their southern border with Korea. After being informed of Hyeonjong's succession to the throne, the Khitan invaded Korea. They claimed that the Koreans were guilty of regicide, which especially angered them since Shengzong had been the one to invest Mokjong.  Years of brutal war followed. Between 1020 and 1022, peace was eventually negotiated. Not coincidentally, in 1022, Hyeonjong had his envoys report to the Khitan that he was dead and had been succeeded by his son. In reality, Hyeonjong did not die until 1031; his son Deokjong was made Crown Prince in 1022 but did not succeed him until 1031. If Hyeonjong had not faked his own death to his Khitan overlords, they may not have been satisfied with the peace negotiations.  **See**: Vermeersch, Sem, "Royal Ancestor Worship and Buddhist Politics: The Hyonhwa-sa Stele and the Origins of the First Koryo Tripitaka", *The Journal of Korean Studies* 18:1 (2013), 115-146.	1642707189.0	hthyz8r	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htfjseu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hthyz8r/
a3wnh	In addition to /u/Comprehensive_Try765 's comment on relative wealth, a wealth to GDP comparison isn't apples-to-apples either. GDP is an income metric while wealth is an aggregate. To make the comparison you care about ("ownership of total world purchasing power"), you need to compare personal wealth to total wealth. As you can imagine, "total wealth" is a very difficult metric to calculate even within a single civilization.	1642707274.0	hthz7b7	t3_s78b8h	t1_hte9mlo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s78b8h/was_mansa_musa_really_the_richest_person_in/hthz7b7/

a3wnh	It's also worth mentioning that when discussing the wealth of autocratic rulers, the divide between public and private wealth becomes very ambiguous. How much of the Roman treasury did Augustus control? How much of the empire's tax revenue can be considered his own personal income?

esjzc	Why is Friday called 'Congregation Day' in Arabic?  I have looked at a previous Ask Historians thread about why Muslims congregate on Friday as well as searched online.  There is general agreement that the Quran commands muslims to congregate on 'Congregation Day' AKA Friday in Arabic, but this seems circular.  If Friday was already known as Congregation Day before this command, then why was that so? Was there a customary congregation on the 6th day in pre-Islamic Arabia? And if so, why the sixth day and for what purpose?  If Friday became known as Congregation Day AFTER the Quranic command, then why was the 6th day chosen?	1642694805.0	hth13gf	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hth13gf/

9x5qn2xl	Vikings avoided battles as much as they could, especially with the Franks due to their superior cavalry and weaponry. Instead they excelled in amphibious warfare. Danes did their best to achieve wealth through regular raiding without having to fight costly battles. They operated in small, independent war bands. They targeted soft targets, such as churches, abbeys and trading centres. They also struck towns when festivals and holidays were being celebrated for greater haul of treasure. For example, Danes raided Tours three days before the feast of Saint Martin in 1853. They also took political and ecclesiastical hostages and held them for ransom. This was all made possible by the use of narrow longships that were perfect for both sea and river voyages so were able to penetrate deeply into the Frankish interior. For example, a viking fleet rowed 210 miles up the Garonne river to Toulouse in 1844.  Therefore, the reason for their success was that viking bands were fast, adaptable and cleverly opportunistic. They were able to attack  where they knew the rewards were great and the defenses weak. They knew  when to fight and when to escape, when to approach by ship and when to  ride overland, when to accept tribute and when to plunder. Several groups of  vikings could band together quickly when needed and go their separate ways  when this served them better. Indeed, a warrior band could even take employment with a European ruler to stave off another viking band or to fight his  other enemies, even his own family members: “To Sigfrid and Gorm and their  accomplices he \[Charles the Fat in 882\] gave several thousand pounds of silver  and gold which he had seized from the treasury of St-Stephen at Metz and from  the resting-places of other saints, and he gave them permission to stay so that  they could go on ravaging a part of his cousin’s kingdom as they had before.”  One example of viking defeat against the Franks is oddly the one that ended in setting up Normandy: the Siege of Chartres (911). Here the vikings significantly outnumbered the Franks, but were defeated with notable loses. However, Charles the simple, King of West Francia, was looking for more permanent solution to the viking problem, so he offered Rollo and his companions land centred on Rouen in return for serving as a buffer against future viking raids up the river. Rollo and his companions gladly accepted, being cleverly opportunistic as usual. The viking rus themselves were badly defeated by the Byzantines in the battle of Arcadiopolis and battle of dorostopol.  And if we’re focusing on 11th century Normans, it has to be said that they were more likely French than viking by then, especially in Hastings.  >It is also interesting to note that few of the participating nobles in the Battle of Hastings were from the Cotentin Peninsula. Moreover, and none were reported to have supplied ships.This would suggest a clear demarcation between Lower Normandy and the Cotentin Peninsula. In part, this demarcation could reflect continued resentment of William’s rule within this region, insofar as the revolt of 1047 discussed earlier was in fact led by a prominent Cotentin lord. Still another trend which is of interest is the relationship between the nobles’ and knights’ origins and the relative density of early Viking settlement in the duchy. According to a map of settlement names, there was a high density of Viking settlers in the Cotentin Peninsula and the Pays de Caux region. It is in precisely these regions where fewer Norman combatants originated, as opposed to the Bessin region around Bayeux which had far fewer Viking settlement names and thus fewer descendants of viking settlers. Therefore, the Normans who fought at the Battle of Hastings were more likely to have possessed French than Viking/Nordic ancestry.  Of course, this is not to say that vikings were bad warriors. I don’t think anyone claims that, but they were not superior militarily to their enemies.  Sources:  Medieval Maritime Warfare, Charles D.Stanton  Viking tactics in West Francia, William E.

152vfu	"German units who had zero tanks of any kind" includes, by late 1944, a lot of German tank units.    Tanks weren't being attacked just by tanks: aside from improving tank armament and anti-tank guns both towed and mounted on various chassis, German armour faced considerable threats from the air.  Not just from tactical aircraft, but strategic bombing all the way from the refinery that made the fuel and metal, the factory that built them, the trains and tracks used to transport them, and so on, right up to the front line.  The Panzer Lehr was effectively annihilated during the fighting around St Lo, and amongst the weapons doing serious damage were M10 tank destroyers and (in Operation Cobra) strategic bombers pressed into what amounted to tactical service.	1642696253.0	hth4zoi	t3_s89fqq	t1_htgvayl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hth4zoi/

In my mind, I'm more familiar with discussions surrounding Lakatos, Feyerabend, Kuhn and Popper.   You're right that I'm hesitant to read so much before starting my project, but I will definitely put these on my reading list. Since you seem to be well informed on this topic, I was wondering if you knew about some modern works on the philosophy of science? (If that's something separate?)  I'm particularly interested in the social sciences, neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology. I'm aware that Kurt Danziger is one historian of psychology, but do you know of any others by any chance?	1642696272.0	hth51hs	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth51hs/
b0uy0vfb	Alright. So, the first thing I want to note is that this is a topic that lends itself in a way few others do to sensationalism and propaganda. So, if you want to research this in your own time think critically and try to find academic sources rather than mere newspaper articles as the non academic sources I found tended to be… not good.   The main thing to note is that the cannibalism occurred over a roughly six week period in 1968 from May to July during the violent factional infighting that occurred at the time. An official government investigation of the cannibalism occurred in 1981-83 and later the Chinese author Zheng Yi conducted a personal investigation throughout the mid to late 80s which has been both praised and criticised for its content.   **The Background: Guangxi in 1968**  Guangxi in 1968 was an extremely turbulent place notorious for its violence. It had been led by a man named Wei Guoqing since 1954, however by 1968 Wei was in hot water. The Cultural Revolution started in the area in 1967 and almost immediately a rival faction appeared in the local party organisation, led by a man called Wu Chinnan. Wei’s faction was named the “Big Faction” or “Guangxi United Command of Proletarian Revolutionaries” and Wu’s “Small Faction” or “Guangxi April 22 Revolutionary Action Command” or just “4.22”. Wei’s faction very much came out on top with the local militia, miliary and capitol coming out in his favour against the so called “Rebels”. Things escalated fairly quickly into violence after an imposed compromise was ignored by the Big Faction, who wanted to wipe out their enemies. On May 11 1968 a successful coordinated attack was launched upon multiple Small Faction strongpoints, with many of those who surrendered after the fighting being summarily executed. Violent struggle sessions were launched in the area, with an extraordinary 90 of the 144 areas in Wuxuan county (The area most studied and seemingly the epicentre of the violence) having sessions that ended with impromptu executions. This was extraordinarily violent even by the Cultural Revolutions standards, with the official investigation stating that 524 people were executed in the area. It is worth noting however that whilst high level officials in Guangxi directly ordered and encouraged violence and extrajudicial killings they did not order cannibalism, that was something that occurred at a lower level.   **The Cannibalism**  Of the 524 executed in Wuxuan government reports state that somewhere between 64 and 76 people were eaten throughout the counties municipality and nine communes. To give some more details in a list Zheng writes that of 64 people killed and eaten 56 had their heart and liver cut out, 18 were completely eaten, 13 had their genitals eaten, one was decapitated after being eaten and 7 were reportedly cut up whilst still alive. Those doing the killing were for the most part not the violent, idealistic students many imagine when they think of the Cultural Revolution. Instead, the perpetrators were those at least ostensibly on the side of law and order who had been trained to follow orders and serve as a moral example to the community engaging in a violent purge of their perceived enemies. To give an example of such cannibalism taking place Zhang Boxun (perceived as being a supporter of the Small Faction) attempted to escape a struggle session in June 18 by jumping into a river, but was caught, killed and had his heart and liver cut out by militiaman Guo Lixiang who together with another man cooked them in a pot. A notable aspect of the cannibalism that occurred is that people from diverse parts of society participated in Wuxuan cannibalism, from idealistic youths to old women, teachers and even state functionaries. It was not limited to just one social group.  **Why Cannibalism?**  Probably the most natural question to ask at this point is why cannibalism? This kind of even did not commonly occur in other parts of China under similar circumstances and it is not like there was a famine in the area forcing people to engage in this behaviour.   Unfortunately, there isn’t really one simple answer to this question. However, there are various reasons that have been proposed as at least partial explanation for why the people of the area decided to eat their enemies as well as kill them.   Firstly, it was a group activity. Cannibalism seems to have generally occurred in group “human flesh banquets”(as Zheng states the masses called it) in which peer pressure was brought to bare. This was effective, with over 80 of the Huangmao Foodstuffs Depot and Distribution Office units members reportedly eating meals made from other people, some reportedly under duress. Cannibalism seems to have served as a way to check and affirm peoples loyalty, and bears some similarity to traditional communal feasts.   Secondly the cannibalism often seems to have been somewhat symbolic, notable here is the fact that a majority of those killed had their hearts and livers extracted and eaten. Important symbolic parts of the body were being extracted and eaten, not necessarily all of the body. Beliefs are held in parts of China that those who eat specific of a goshawk or tiger become strong and brave, perhaps eating enemies’ livers and hearts were perceived as having a similar function.  Cultural arguments have also been made, pointing out similarities between the cannibalism and traditional Zhuang ox sacrifices or Chinese folk tales involving cannibalism. These arguments are unsurprisingly extremely controversial, with Zheng (the author who conducted a personal investigation) being accused by some of cultural chauvinism against the Zhuang for such insinuations.   Political tensions obviously also played a role, with those eaten being killed at the end of a struggle session or a fight against the Big Faction. This is the explanation that seems to have become most popular in the western media, with blame being laid on communism in general and the cultural revolution in particular for creating the hatreds that inspired the cannibalism. This is an argument that is again extremely controversial, mostly in the extent to which communism as an ideology is to blame as opposed to local conditions.   Communal tension also has been suggested as a cause, with some instances of murder and cannibalism such as the murder of Peartree Li’s family seeming to occur mostly due to pre-existing hatreds finally having an outlet. Grudges taken to a murderous extreme are well documented to have occurred in other parts of China during the Cultural Revolution, cannibalism may have served as a final, extreme insult to the deceased and their family.  **It's Legacy**  The cannibalism that occurred there has a complicated legacy. Zheng Yi’s book on the topic is our main source of information but has serious flaws with some of his conclusions (for example that 10,000 people ate human flesh) not being justified by the evidence he provides. The work has also been accused of morphing into a political polemic, unconcerned with historical accuracy. The government of China restricts access to records of the topic, which means that major historians of the area end up being people like Song Yongyi who whilst a respected academic has also been arrested by the Chinese government for stealing state secrets and has a distinctly negative attitude towards the Chinese government.   Overall, what I would take away is that the cannibalism occurred during a time of absolutely massive internal tension in the area over a period of about six weeks in which one revolutionary faction suppressed another with extreme violence. A wide range of other reasons have been proposed for why the cannibalism occurred, however there is no single answer that applies to all cases, and likely never will be.	1642696568.0	hth5u2x	t3_s81fmu	t3_s81fmu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s81fmu/why_did_massive_massive_cannibalism_occur_in_the/hth5u2x/

mbx1lsj	This is such an important point that I feel often gets forgotten when discussing WWII tanks, especially British infantry tanks like the Churchill. The vast majority of fighting that all tanks did in WWII was against infantry, and a gun that has limited HE capacity is borderline useless against soft targets like infantry, anti-tank guns, artillery, unarmored/lightly-armored vehicles, etc. Infantry tanks in particular were not designed to go toe-to-toe with other tanks, but rather to do exactly what their name implies: support the infantry against enemy infantry. In this role, the Churchill was arguably one of the most successful tanks of the war.  Now of course infantry tanks did go up against enemy tanks from time to time, and while their thick armor gave them decent survivability, their mediocre capacity for AP fire did hold them back, at least against heavily-armored late-war German tanks like the Panther or Tiger, which as you rightly said were few and far between; the 75mm gun was more than adequate for dealing with the more common Pz IV's and Stug III's. But from a doctrine standpoint, the infantry tank, especially the Churchill, did what it was designed to do and did it effectively.	1642696860.0	hth6md1	t3_s89fqq	t1_htgvayl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hth6md1/

There are certainly historical topics that relate to contemporary issues and it is possible for legitimate interpretations that differ from each other to come out of looking at the past through different political lenses.

Seems pretty ignorant to write it off as Afrocentric when Africans aren’t the only non Europeans? I do realize there was a slave trade but it’s hard to believe thats all there is to it.

bfvcv	The earliest reference I could find online was a footnote in the University of Western Ontario Medical Journal from 1951 which ends: "But, then, I always was a [cunning linguist](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1bU0AQAAIAAJ&q=cunning+linguist&dq=cunning+linguist&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2k9Ks48D1AhXilFwKHb-FDu8Q6AF6BAgIEAI)."  Having searched a bunch of different newspaper archives, the earliest I could find there was an anecdote titled "Wall Scribbler Caught In Act" where a man in his late 50s writes "I am a [cunning linguist](https://www.newspapers.com/image/152649153/?terms=%22cunning%20linguist%22&match=1)" on an ice cream vending machine. This was in the *Akron Beacon Journal* for 12 May 1967.  There are also exciting and incorrect answers on Quora etc. which claim variously that the joke didn't exist before 1968 (based on Google N-Grams), and that 'cunnilingus' wasn't even a term until the 1940s. The OED does not bear this last idea out, with cunnilingus attested to as describing an activity in 1864.   More interestingly, the primary meaning shifted in the 20th century from a person who performs the act to the act itself. Before ~1900 you might say e.g. "he was employed as a cunnilingus for the Queen of Sheba".	1642697438.0	hth86n2	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htg3vd1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hth86n2/

8brve	The modern philosophy of science is, in my view, pretty divorced from the practice of doing history, and from insights into thinking about the history of science. As some point in the last few decades, the historians and the philosophers went in very different directions (the philosophers got much more analytical and much less interested in history, is one way to think about it). So there is a reason that all of the relevant stuff (Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, Popper, Fleck, etc.) is from the 1930s-1970s, and then all of the "philosophical" work in the history of science comes from other sources (anthropologists, sociologists, and other historians). Amusingly, the History of Science Society and the Philosophy of Science Association still co-locate their meetings every few years, but there is very little overlap between the two in terms of the questions they are asking. (There are some historians and philosophers who lament this, there are some who do not.)  So the odds are you will find more philosophical discussions that are useful for history by reading historians of science. E.g., Galison for thinking about physics, Rheinberger for thinking about biology — both are historians are their heart but they do philosophical things with it.  The term that would seem most useful for looking into are the "history of the human sciences," which is what we mean for the history of social sciences, anthropology, psychology, etc.   One other resource: there are a few series like the Cambridge History of Science that basically get scholars to summarize entire fields in single articles, and always have a sort of methodological introduction. These can be very useful. The Cambridge History of Science, volume 7, is about the modern social sciences ("psychology, economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, geography, history, and statistics"); I would definitely take a look at it! The introduction is on "Writing the history of social science," by Ted Porter and Dorothy Ross, who are both immensely respected historians.	1642697675.0	hth8urk	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth51hs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth8urk/

30n1rleb	Does anyone know how to find original texts of petitions to the English Parliament from the late 1300s?  I'm doing deep dive into historical environmental impacts of trawling fisheries, and found an excellent resource from 1889;  * Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission. (1889). United States: U.S. Government Printing Office.  Inside, it contains a reference to a petition to the English Parliament of 1376-77, referenced as such:  * Pet. 51, Edw. III, A.D. 1376-'77. - Petition No. 50  The US Commission book contains a quote of the text, which describes the nets being used, states a complaint about degraded fisheries over a period of seven years, and a response that a commission should be made to "inquire and certify on the truth of this allegation" but I'd love to be able see the full text. I know it's a stretch, but tips on how to look for the context surrounding petitions at this time (i.e. who made the complaint, and where did this happen specifically?), and any results of the aforementioned commission would also be greatly appreciated.   I was going to do a full post for this, but saw this thread and thought it might fit better here.

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642699926.0	hthf59n	t3_s8o7ks	t3_s8o7ks	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8o7ks/what_war_did_my_relative_serve_in/hthf59n/
8brve	For historians, I'm not sure it's easy to generalize, other than saying, "usually questions about how social and intellectual contexts affect and are affected by scientific work" (which is very vague, and still not encompassing), but you can get a sense by looking at the [kinds of papers that people are presenting at the annual meetings](https://hssmeeting.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/1/sessiongallery/schedule?dayId=1&searchParams=%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22sortMode%22%3A%22SessionName%22%2C%22sortDirection%22%3A%22Ascending%22%2C%22sortByFieldId%22%3Anull%2C%22displayMode%22%3Anull%2C%22filterByFieldValues%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByTextValue%22%3Anull%2C%22filterByFavorites%22%3Afalse%2C%22filterByScheduleRoomIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterBySessionTypeIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByScheduleDayIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22filterByScheduleTimeSlotIds%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22isScheduleOtherEventSearchAllowed%22%3Atrue%7D) (apologies in advance that this online conference platform makes it hard to see these at a glance — I prefer PDFs...). Much of the work of the history of science these days is in a mode of "descriptive/interpretive" more so than "trying to come up with an answer to a philosophical question."   Similarly with the [PSA](https://dryfta-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/psa2020/eventdocs/1636310360MeetingProgram-PSA2021-2021-09.pdf) — you can see that the questions they are trying to answer are very abstract and rarely have anything like historical case studies to back them up. That's fine, they can do their own thing, but it's not very useful for historians.	1642700056.0	hthfi2b	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hthbhx8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hthfi2b/

2liuru	According to Aelian (*Historical Miscellany* 12.12), "Note that on Crete at Gortyn an adulterer when caught was brought before the magistrates and after conviction was made to wear a garland of wool. The garland amounted to accusation that he was depraved and effeminate, and had looks appealing to women." So either the specific form of the garland was feminine, or it was because wool was a symbol of women's work like spinning and weaving, or dressing him up in appealing clothing was supposed to refer to the sexual nature of his crime.	1642701917.0	hthkndc	t3_s7wggh	t1_hth244y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7wggh/christian_mythology_has_roman_soldiers_putting_a/hthkndc/

pncvt	### Introduction and Theory  I cannot claim to be a particular specialist in martial arts or in its historiography – my greatest hands-on experience has been about two years of Wing Chun I did before the age of 10; my attempts to actually look into the history of this topic has been marred by just how barren a lot of the historiography is.  But the explanation of that comparative barrenness is part of the answer to your question, because it explains how the myth has continued to have such presence and currency. As Paul Bowman puts it, when it comes to the writing of the history of martial arts, there are in effect  > two different kinds of discourse, each claiming to be knowledge: ideological and mystical, on the one hand, versus verifiable and somewhat more prosaic, on the other.  And in turn, there are distinct priorities and desires among the proponents of each. By and large, hands-on practitioners of martial arts will repeat the stories told within their own discipline(s), not least because they form part of the overall 'package' of being a practitioner. Academic historians of martial arts, however, will be looking critically at what can be verified through reliable sources, irrespective of what is believed by the practitioners. Indeed, academic *anythings* will do that – specialists in the human, for instance, will investigate the actual, empirically verifiable effects of martial arts on the body and the mechanisms by which those effects occur, irrespective of what the specific claims made by practitioners may be.  Before continuing, it is worth making two digressions to set the scene a bit. The first is to echo Bowman's point that although these discourses are incompatible, neither is more legitimate inherently. The invented traditions of various disciplines as they exist today are nevertheless important to those disciplines as they exist, and even if they are in a sense 'lies' they are still the basis of sincerely held beliefs about particular practices; yet it is still important to have a grasp of verifiable reality when it comes to the various dimensions of martial arts.  The second is to note that the majority of contemporary historical writing on East Asian martial arts is non-academic in nature and written by present-day practitioners – [not unlike military history in the 19th and early 20th centuries](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dca5b9/historiographic_question_what_is_new_military/f288xkw/) – with serious academic approaches being comparatively recent. However, it is quite fortunate that much of this academic material, precisely because it is competing with repeated myths and received wisdom, is relatively accessible – for instance, the journal *Martial Arts Studies* is open-access, and so too is the article I'm drawing on by Paul Bowman. What it means is that both compete in the same arena, and there is arguably no real middle ground: practitioners themselves will have difficulty accepting that their disciplines' received knowledge is at best inaccurate and at worst complete bunk; academics will understandably be miffed at the suggestion that they ought to treat this received wisdom as having equal value to what is actually verifiable.  This sets the scene for *why* the myth has persisted: for the martial arts practitioner, whether there actually was a Southern Shaolin Temple or not is irrelevant, because it did exist in the context of their own perspective on their own practiced tradition. The historian cannot change the practitioner's mind because the two are operating on different wavelengths, so to speak. As for *how*, that's a different question that we can dig into a bit.  ### The History  We can, with decent certainty, say that the Qing were not particularly keen on the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan or its attendant branches, for two principal reasons.   The first was that, like many other Eurasian powers of the Early Modern period, the Qing liked to rationalise their domains and constituents, and disliked entities that lay somewhat beyond their power. The Shaolin Monastery was only one of many Chinese Buddhist institutions over which the Qing did not necessarily exert direct control, and which which were themselves only one part of a general distrust of independent religious institutions that also broadly applied to Daoist temples. The second was that, like many Buddhist and Daoist temples with a martial arm, the Shaolin Monastery had contributed troops to support the Ming in the previous dynasty's wars, albeit against the Shun rebels of Li Zicheng rather than the Manchus. Despite not being one of the temples that supplied troops to the 'Southern' Ming during the Qing conquest of south China (of which there were many), the Shaolin Temple was nevertheless perceived as a potential locus of Ming loyalism, not just by the Qing state itself but also by elites who objected to what they saw as illegitimate alien rule. Thanks in part to the romantic writings of resentful ex-Ming officials, there came to be a pervasive but frankly impossible myth that the Shaolin monks had rebelled against Qing rule and that the monastery's destitute state in the late 17th century was a result of imperial reprisals that had stopped just short of ordering its total dissolution.  The reality was that by the time that Qing rule extended over Henan, the Shaolin Monastery had already been in pretty dire straits. In supplying troops to the Ming to fight off Li Zicheng, the Shaolin Monastery lost many of its monks in battle against Li and his allies, but its troubles did not end there, as it was subsequently preyed on by local warlords who had emerged in the absence of Ming authority. According to local chronicles, one such warlord named Li Jiyu pretended to patronise the monastery, and at one stage requested that certain ceremonies be held for his birthday. As these were being performed, he had his troops storm the monastery, where they slaughtered the disarmed monks and destroyed much of its infrastructure. Some further damage may have been caused by the Qing army as it marched south through Henan in the 1640s. Left destitute, the monastery remained dilapidated for nearly a century, with decades of neglect under relatively apathetic Qing rule. The Qing did eventually patronise the monastery somewhat, but only from 1704 onward. These contributions could be significant, as the Yongzheng Emperor paid for substantial renovations in 1735, and in return the temple hosted the Qianlong Emperor during his first Southern Inspection in 1750. But while the core monastery saw some Qing patronage, its subsidiary shrines in the region were destroyed and dispersed as basically a final nail in the coffin for its power as a local institution. It never really regained its former prestige either, with nobody holding the post of head abbott between 1664 and *1999*. The Qing remained consistently suspicious of the monastery, which was often suspected of colluding with various dissident groups at least as late as the Eight Trigrams revolt in 1813, when official communications expressed concern that the monastery might harbour other sectarians.  Thanks to the earlier depredations, the Shaolin Monastery as a military entity had very much collapsed. The same chronicler who recorded the destruction of the temple by Li Jiyu reported visiting the temple some time between the late 1650s and 1670s, where he requested that two novices demonstrate their skills for him. 'Their performance was no better than that of street beggars. It was not worth watching.' While the monastery retained its legendary reputation for martial prowess, the Qing were not eager to allow it to be taken seriously; in 1775 the Qianlong Emperor officially forbade officials and officers from involving Buddhist monks in the army, in response to news that the governor of Henan had taken on Shaolin monks as army instructors. 'Having monks train his soldiers is not only beyond one’s authority,' wrote the emperor, 'it also makes him into a laughing stock.'	1642704297.0	hthr6pd	t3_s8ddl3	t3_s8ddl3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hthr6pd/
pncvt	### The Myth  The Qing conquest of China was, to say the least, a deeply traumatic event for many Han Chinese, especially as it involved the overthrow of the Ming, a state that had built itself on 'de-Mongolification' in the wake of Yuan rule, and which had upheld a sort of cosmically-ordained division between the 'civilised' and 'barbarian' worlds, made particularly potent by the construction of the Great Wall. Manifestations of anti-Qing sentiment often came in fits and starts, but it is probably fair to say that the Qing never could – and never did – feel entirely safe from a proto-nationalist uprising by any of their non-Manchu subjects. More importantly for the purposes of analysing the history of Shaolin, many organisations in southern China that pitched themselves as anti-Qing liked, for the purposes of PR and credibility, to claim continuity with movements and entities that had resisted the Qing invasion. Perhaps most prominent among these was – indeed, is – the Heaven and Earth Society in Fujian, splinters of which became the triad crime gangs, and which claims to have been formed when the Qing invaded southern China in the 1650s. There is, in fact, no verifiable truth to this: the Heaven and Earth Society came into existence in the early 1760s as a community mutual aid organisation, and only began anti-Qing agitation later in the decade, well after their foundation. What it goes to show, though, is that stories of an anti-Shaolin reprisal by the Qing were rooted in a pervasive anti-Qing attitude that was particularly prevalent in south Chinese society.  The origin story of the Heaven and Earth Society that eventually developed involves, surprise surprise, the Shaolin Monastery, and it seems to have been at least partly responsible for cementing the narrative that the Shaolin Monastery was destroyed during the Kangxi reign (1661-1722) and its practitioners scattered across southern China. That this was specifically a *Southern* Shaolin Monastery is not always consistently clear, and other variations on the Heaven and Earth Society's version of the myth sometimes claim it was the original Shaolin Monastery in Henan. However, the idea that this was a branch monastery – given the perhaps suspect timeframe of the destruction if it was supposed to be the original one – seems nevertheless to have had some currency. This did, however, have the perhaps unintended effect of leading to *several* monasteries claiming to be the rebuilt Southern Shaolin Monastery. According to Zhou Weiliang, at least three Buddhist temples in Fujian claimed to be the Southern Shaolin Monastery, with relatively little to actually show for it. But this claim nevertheless had currency, particularly in a region and in a time where it was possible to insinuate anti-Qing connections comparatively openly and expect that the extent of public support would outweigh the risks of official opposition.  To tie this in to the Hong Kong film industry, almost of HK martial arts cinema finds its roots in Wing Chun and its practitioners – more specifically, Ip Man's branch of Wing Chun – and Wing Chun basically replicates the Heaven and Earth Society's founding myth in claiming to originated from monks fleeing the destroyed Southern Shaolin Monastery. Judkins and Nielson argue that the claim of Shaolin origins among martial arts clans dates to at least the 1890s, when the trope also starts to appear in martial arts novels; this would track with the uptick in anti-Qing sentiments that would eventually lead to the empire's downfall, and which became particularly acute in the wake of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894-5. That said, the Shaolin aspect of the Heaven and Earth Society's origin myth is attested as early as 1811, so the development in the 1890s ought to be understood as involving the adoption of this myth by martial arts groups, and not its original invention.  On top of this, modern East Asian martial arts owe a lot to Japan, in that Japanese martial arts in the early 20th century were perhaps the most formalised and professionalised, thereby setting expectations for martial arts in the rest of Asia, and also in that martial arts became a way for East Asian countries to assert a sense of identity in response to the Japanese ascendancy in the region. Before the term *Wushu* (literally 'martial arts') was established as the standard by the Communist PRC, the Nationalist ROC referred to Chinese martial arts as *Guoshu*, literally 'national arts' (or 'the national art'). As an aside, a comparable dynamic can be seen with Taekwondo, which, despite its internal narrative of being an ancient Korean art, is functionally a branch of Shōtōkan karate which was given a Korean nationalist rebranding after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and used as part of the two new Korean states' attempts at nation-building in the post-colonial period.  Tying that back to Hong Kong, it is easy to retroject contemporary Hong Kong's tense relationship with Chinese nationhood back into the twentieth century, when the situation was actually a bit more clear-cut. Later nationalist claims of Manchu 'Sinicisation' aside, the essential foreignness of the Qing in their early decades has always been quietly understood (well, 'believed' is perhaps more appropriate), and so the story of the Shaolin monastery's destruction takes on a certain character of nationalist resistance – one with particular currency amid the rise of the Japanese Empire and the longer-term traumas this left, and also amid the continued British colonial presence in Hong Kong. Lest we forget that 1967 saw massive left-wing protests against British rule in which 51 Hongkongers were killed by British police; just four years later Bruce Lee burst onto the cinematic scene in *The Big Boss*.  An undercurrent of Chinese nationalism pervades a not insubstantial amount of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, and it is probably no surprise that Japan and the Japanese can be found as the antagonists in some of the more iconic works in the genre: 1972's *Fist of Fury* sees Bruce Lee beating up karate students in post-WW1 Shanghai; 2008's *Ip Man* is set largely during the Japanese occupation of southern China; the now somewhat obscure (but at the time quite popular) *Apkido*, also from 1972, is set in prewar, Japanese-ruled Korea. You can even find subtle hints in films that don't directly address the Japanese Empire: Bruce Lee's self-produced *Way of the Dragon* (1972 again) has a number of scenes where Bruce demonstrates the superiority of kung fu over karate, first against the employees at the restaurant he's protecting, and then against the thugs hired by the mafia boss (including Chuck Norris); Stephen Chow's *Kung Fu Hustle* (2004) evokes the overall period setting of the 1940s even if the Japanese are curiously absent. Going all the way back to the Shaolin temple, then, it forms part of a motif common across the genre where kung fu isn't just a cool fighting style, it's also an assertion of (Han) Chinese resilience.	1642704313.0	hthr8bd	t3_s8ddl3	t1_hthr6pd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/hthr8bd/
7sxro	This is a really great question, and unfortunately one I'm not qualified to answer. *The Imperial Harem* is only about the sultans and only in Constantinople. The author does provide some generalizations, which I used to broaden my answer to OP's questions about Afghanistan, and which are probably applicable to Morocco as well.   Just in case, I pressed "Ctrl+F" in my e-textbook to see if Pierce ever mentions Morocco or North Africa, but all we got is a couple references to Ibn Battuta's writing.   There are very few textbooks about harems and ordinary women's lives in the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. [*The Colonial Harem* by Malek Alloula](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Colonial_Harem/AGi7AAAAIAAJ?hl=en) looks very promising. Alloula was Algerian and focuses his work on Algeria, which is the closest I could get to Morocco. I think I'm most likely to read [*Rethinking Orientalism: Women, Travel, and the Ottoman Harem* by Reina Lewis](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rethinking_Orientalism/LbWQ8gP5xWkC?hl=en). Finally, [*Harem* by Valentine Gallet](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Harem/quEkyAEACAAJ?hl=en) is an art history book that analyzes orientalist western art in the 1800s-1900s. I might buy that one to learn more about this art that is wildly problematic but also so gorgeous.  TL;DR: I'd have to buy several more textbooks to begin to answer your question. My knowledge of the Ottomans is also limited to what is necessary to understand their influence in Eastern Europe, and I'm not an expert in the Ottoman occupation of Egypt or the broader history of North Africa.	1642704377.0	hthrewt	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htdny9a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/hthrewt/

tzc66	I've been getting replies in my mail, although they don't show up here, perhaps they were deleted immediately after being posted?   I couldn't actually read the full replies, but from the small parts visible in my mail from reddit i could see one of them asked where i read about the "single son" policy.  I should have been more clear in my comment above i think. It was in /u/orangewombat [other response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/mnk6yr/comment/gu6r3st/) to a similar question, which he linked above.  The part that left me confused is this one: > One mother, one son Although the sultan could have as many concubines as he wanted, it appears that a woman's eligibility for concubine status ended when she bore the sultan her first son. The woman and her son, the prince, would continue to live within the harem until well into his teenage years, but the woman was no longer eligible to be the sultan's sexual partner. “[C]oncubines were only temporary sexual partners of a sultan[.] It seems likely that there was a revolving-door policy in the imperial harem that deprived a woman who had borne a son of further eligibility for the sultan's bed.” Imperial Harem, loc. 770.	1642705509.0	hthuind	t3_s7sm1l	t1_hte1xfp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/hthuind/
7j3q5	To add to your excellent response, while the Valentine was quickly phased out of the British Armoured Regiments once the British started getting American Shermans, the Soviets actually liked it and used until the end of the war - Valentine production was even kept up until the end of the war at Soviet request (half of all Valentine production was eventually sent to the Soviet Union).  The main difference seems to be in its use - while the British were using it as an infantry support tank (In the various army tank brigades), where it was replaced by the Churchill or medium tank (26th Arm Bde in North Africa), where it was replaced by the Sherman.     Soviets tended to use it to replace light tanks like the T-70, (The Valentine is actually in the same weight class as the M5 Stuart, despite being substantially better protected) and after some kinks in the earlier Valentines were ironed out, they eventually received and used over 3,000 of them throughout the war (And the Soviets were picky about the tanks they received - they complained loudly when the British tried to dump obsolete Crusaders on them via Lend Lease).  Ironically enough, the upgunned Valentines (armed with the same 6-pdr as the early Churchill tanks) was less popular at first than the 2-pdr Valentines because they traded a turret Machine gun to fit te 6-pdr, and because of the lack of a good HE round for the 6-pdr until later in the war.	1642705782.0	hthv8tg	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfnuco	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/hthv8tg/

551ffhkm	The Korean king Hyeonjong (r. 1009-1031) came to power through a coup. The previous king, Mokjong (r. 997-1009), had very little power over his kingdom. Goryeo (the Korean kingdom at the time) was effectively ruled by Mokjong's mother, Queen Dowager Cheonchu, and her lover Kim Chi-yang. There were many in the kingdom who weren't happy about this. Cheonchu and Kim Chi-yang had a son who they allegedly wanted to succeed the childless Mokjong, and the queen tried to have her nephew Hyeonjong killed since he was the only other one in line to be king.  During Mokjong's reign, Goryeo had achieved a tentative peace with the Khitans who ruled the Liao Empire to their north. They had agreed to submit to the Khitan emperor Shengzong instead of the Song (Han Chinese) emperor. This meant they paid tribute to him and also that they let Shengzong (or his representative) perform the official investiture of King Mokjong.  In 1009, though, Mokjong was overthrown in a coup. There were factions who wanted Hyeonjong to succeed Mokjong instead of Cheonchu's son with Kim Chi-yang. They deposed Mokjong, killed Kim Chi-yang and his son, and exiled Mokjong and the queen. During their flight from the capital, Mokjong was assassinated even though he had agreed to make Hyeonjong his successor. Hyeonjong was installed on the throne without knowing that Mokjong had been killed for it.  Meanwhile, the Khitan had been waiting for an opportunity to re-invade Goryeo. They had settled their war with the Song in 1005 with the Treaty of Shanyuan, so they were eager to claim more territory on their southern border with Korea. After being informed of Hyeonjong's succession to the throne, the Khitan invaded Korea. They claimed that the Koreans were guilty of regicide, which especially angered them since Shengzong had been the one to invest Mokjong.  Years of brutal war followed. Between 1020 and 1022, peace was eventually negotiated. Not coincidentally, in 1022, Hyeonjong had his envoys report to the Khitan that he was dead and had been succeeded by his son. In reality, Hyeonjong did not die until 1031; his son Deokjong was made Crown Prince in 1022 but did not succeed him until 1031. If Hyeonjong had not faked his own death to his Khitan overlords, they may not have been satisfied with the peace negotiations.  **See**: Vermeersch, Sem, "Royal Ancestor Worship and Buddhist Politics: The Hyonhwa-sa Stele and the Origins of the First Koryo Tripitaka", *The Journal of Korean Studies* 18:1 (2013), 115-146.	1642707189.0	hthyz8r	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htfjseu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hthyz8r/
a3wnh	In addition to /u/Comprehensive_Try765 's comment on relative wealth, a wealth to GDP comparison isn't apples-to-apples either. GDP is an income metric while wealth is an aggregate. To make the comparison you care about ("ownership of total world purchasing power"), you need to compare personal wealth to total wealth. As you can imagine, "total wealth" is a very difficult metric to calculate even within a single civilization.	1642707274.0	hthz7b7	t3_s78b8h	t1_hte9mlo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s78b8h/was_mansa_musa_really_the_richest_person_in/hthz7b7/

a3wnh	It's also worth mentioning that when discussing the wealth of autocratic rulers, the divide between public and private wealth becomes very ambiguous. How much of the Roman treasury did Augustus control? How much of the empire's tax revenue can be considered his own personal income?

bl85j	I'm looking for a good book on medieval heresies, particularly one that focuses on the kind of theoretical side of what the heretics believed, and ideally something accessible to someone without much background in medieval history. Essentially, I want to get a fuller picture of what people like like Dulcinians and the Bogomils believed and why they believed it (to the point that they were willing to die for these beliefs).	1642711087.0	hti8bsc	t3_s8jmqy	t3_s8jmqy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8jmqy/thursday_reading_recommendations_january_20_2022/hti8bsc/

8brve	"Historiography" is basically "the history of history." It's how historians have argued about history over the years. So it's a good place to start if you are thinking about doing history in a serious way, but it is also somewhat daunting because there is a lot to learn and a lot of historiography can feel pretty theoretical and obtuse if you are not steeped in these old academic debates.  For the history of science, I would recommend looking into how historians of science talk about doing their work, and what the goals and methods of the history of science are. These are often quite different from how scientists talk about their own history, and very different from how history is integrated into a scientific curriculum. The goal of history in a science class, for example, is to situate the future-scientist in understanding how the current theories were developed, so it is a "march of winners" (and usually a few big names who are meant to represent what it means to be a scientist — so in a physics/astronomy class you get the classic Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, Newton procession). In the serious study of the history of science, we don't assume that there is a smooth transition between old ideas and new ideas (often the new ideas are quite different than the old ones, even when they use the same terms), and we also are interested in the "losers" of history as well (you can't really understand Galileo without understand Christoph Clavius, for example; Clavius was the dominant Jesuit astronomer in Galileo's time, and would have written the text books that Galileo himself would have learned from, and was the chief arbiter of how the Church would respond to Galileo's claims, and so he's super important to understanding who Galileo thought he was talking to and how his claims were received). Historians of science are also very interested in peeling back the practice of science from the idea that it is just about "big ideas" or "big discoveries" done by "big men." There's always been a lot more to scientific practice than that version of things, if you care about how it actually happened.  ANYWAY. The above are just some examples of "baseline" historiographical assumptions by historians of science. There are many more ways to think about it. If I were preparing a very basic historiographical overview for someone looking to approach this topic seriously, it might include:  * Thomas Kuhn, _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ — a place to _start_ and not to _end_. Kuhn is the most famous philosopher/historian of science by _far_ but that is because he started a lot of conversations, not because he answered them. Most historians of science today are NOT Kuhnians. But he is a very useful introduction to thinking about what makes the history of science difficult to do, and some of his basic methodological arguments (like, you should try to understand how historical scientists understood their own work on its own terms — don't approach the past looking to show whether it is right or wrong according to modern scientific understanding, as that is not very productive/useful) hold up. Take his "model" of scientific revolutions with a grain of salt; most fields don't exhibit quite the dynamics that Kuhn argues for. And a lot of it is muddled.  * Ludwik Fleck, _Genesis and development of a scientific fact_ — is a precursor to Kuhn (a lot of people think Kuhn basically ripped off Fleck), and is worth reading after Kuhn, just to see how the same ideas are fleshed out in somewhat different (and arguably more sensitive) ways.   * Stephen Shapin and Simon Schaffer, _The Leviathan and the Air-Pump_ — a now-classic historical study of arguments about the nature of the vacuum in 17th century England. Even if you have no interest in 17th-century England, there are tons of methodological approaches being espoused here (you can roughly think of this approach as being very influenced by the SSK — Social Study of Knowledge — school of thinking), including how to think about how historical make claims to truth, the meaning and role of experiments and instruments, and the social nature of scientific discourse (who is allowed in a laboratory, and who is not? who is allowed to attend scientific meetings, and who is not? etc.). Overall a hugely influential book on how historians of science of all periods work today.  * Bruno Latour, _The Pasteurization of France_ — Latour is a sociologist/anthropologist, but a lot of the modern history of science is heavily influenced by insights from qualitative sociology and anthropology, and all historians of science have read this book. You don't have to love Latour (lots of historians don't)  but knowing about how Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is applied to the historical study of science is very important to making sense of a lot of modern history of science.   The above are just sort of the bog-standard texts that all historians of science will have probably read at some point (usually in graduate school). Beyond that you start to get into much more subject-specific histories. So if you were interested in the history of physics, you'd want to look at the writings of Peter Galison and his students (of which I am one). If you were interested in the history of biology, there is a whole other literature there depending on which angles you were looking at. And so on and so on, for any subfield or approach you can imagine.  Now, you're saying, crap. I didn't ask for how to become a graduate student in this field, and I'm not going to read 80 books before I start on my project. I hear you. But I would take a look (even a skim) at some of these resources. At the very least, read Kuhn, because he provides a LOT of discussions about how (and why) to do history of ideas, and that sounds relevant to what you are interested in.   Separately, there are books on how to do history _in general_ — not relating to the history of science. These cover things like, how to think critically about primary sources, what are primary and secondary sources, how to document your work through citation, etc. I believe the FAQ has some recommendations for these. This kind of stuff is useful (most of it is unsurprising, I think), but in a way I would emphasize the other historiographical stuff (e.g. Kuhn) a bit more. Because the hard part about doing history is not downloading all of the papers on a given topic and tracing through the footnotes — scientists do that all the time as part of their literature reviews — or going to an archive and saying, "show me all of the letter in this folder by this old scientist." The hard part is _making sense_ of these things in a way that doesn't commit serious errors (like attributing a modern understanding to a historical figure who thought about it very differently). And that's where the historiography will come into play.   Kuhn, for example, has an excellent discussion about why it is so difficult to answer question, "when was oxygen discovered, and by who?" You'd think it was simple, and the textbook version makes it seem like you can say, "on this date, Lavoisier or Priestly understood oxygen existed," but the reality is that the understanding of it emerged in pieces over a protracted period of time, and didn't "cohere" until a much later date. As a result it's one of those things that probably _doesn't_ have a distinct moment of discovery, but rather the idea of its "discovery" is sort of a backwards, after-the-fact narrative framing of what was actually a more complex and muddy process. This kind of stuff is important, because the "bad narrative" history of science gives us a poor understanding of the reality of how science works (and the consequences of that can be more than intellectual — no historian of science that I know was surprised that the CDC's understanding of how COVID-19 worked took a while to work out, but you can see that lots of people accustomed to a model of "scientists just get the right answer" lost a lot of faith seeing that play out in real time about something they cared about).	1642694530.0	hth0dq6	t3_s8kqxq	t3_s8kqxq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/hth0dq6/

nxyvc	No, they did not.  The 2nd edition of the Cambridge History of Warfare (2020) is unfortunately pretty much the same as the 1st edition (2005), and as such, it reflects a previous generation of scholarship. Specifically, the expert who contributed the chapter on Greek warfare is Victor Davis Hanson, who was a leading scholar in that field in the 1990s, but whose views have been subject to sustained and comprehensive criticism ever since. I have written [many posts on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/profiles/iphikrates#wiki_historiography_of_greek_warfare) about the problems with Hanson's work and the older scholarly tradition he represents.  The notion you're asking about here - that Greeks before the Persian Wars settled whole wars in brief stretches of intense violence between hoplites - is the core of Hanson's work. It is not completely groundless, of course; Hanson could never have convinced anyone if he'd made it all up. But there are important reasons why we can still say with considerable confidence that he was wrong.  &nbsp;  **The kernel of truth**  What Hanson is getting at is that the wars of Greek states in the Archaic period were necessarily simple. Everyone accepts this; Greek states of this early time were small, poor, and primitive compared to the powerful states of the Near East. They did not have the revenues to afford standing armies or the organisation and coercive power to grow into expansionist empires. Instead, their armies consisted of citizen militia, raised for a particular campaign and disbanded as soon as that campaign was completed.  This basic system allowed the Greeks to raise large armies at minimal cost, but these armies couldn't be kept in the field for any length of time. Ordinary people had to return to their ordinary lives or the harvest wouldn't get done and people would starve. This meant that Greek states were unable to commit to long campaigns or sieges. Most of them could only afford to muster an army during a few months of summer, in between major phases of the agricultural cycle.  This extreme limitation to the availability of armed force meant that decisions had to be forced quickly or not at all. Barring the occasional storming of a city, the enemy had to be confronted in the field if anything was to be accomplished. In other words, there were structural reasons why many campaigns might end in a pitched battle, after which both sides would return home and end the fighting for the time being. (It should be noted that even more campaigns likely would have ended with nothing but a bit of ravaging and plundering.)  All Hanson needed to complete his vision of a warfare shaped entirely by pitched battles between farmer-hoplites was the claim, made by a Persian in Herodotos' *Histories*, that the Greeks always seek pitched battle on flat ground when they fight each other. Armed with that claim, Hanson could argue that these hoplite battles were the only way the Greeks knew how to fight. At first sight, it seems both plausible and confirmed by the passage in Herodotos.  &nbsp;  **The reasons for doubt**  Let's start with that claim in Herodotos. To put it bluntly, it is a lie.^1 This is clear from the context: the one making the claim is consistently portrayed as a liar and a fool, and in this particular instance he is trying to trick Xerxes into thinking the conquest of Greece will be easy. Herodotos probably never meant for anyone to believe him. He is portraying the Greeks as savage and stupid. We are supposed to see this as a transparent bit of slander, for which the speaker would eventually pay with his life (he was killed in battle against the Spartans at Plataia). That means we cannot see this claim as a fair generalisation.  And of course the Greeks understood how to wage war by other means than pitched battle. There are many examples of surprise attacks and ambushes as well as assaults on cities - all of which could result in the sort of quick and decisive outcomes that suited militia armies.^2 Pitched battle was just one possible solution to the problem that the troops would have to go home again soon - and probably not the preferred one, because it was extremely risky. Everyone wanted victory, but no one wanted to lose a huge number of their own citizens.^3  At the same time, while a lot of *campaigns* may have ended with a single battle, it is much harder to prove that those battles decided *wars*. Sure, the troops had to go home after a few weeks in the field - but they were ready to go again the following year. At this low frequency, conflicts between states could drag on for generations. After the Persian Wars, as soon as some Greek states built up some revenue streams of their own, the frequency of their campaigning increased; armies might be sent out several times during the spring-summer season, or even be paid a wage to march out in winter in the hopes of gaining some strategic advantage. Decisive battles were rare.  In terms of equipment, Hanson assumed that the farmers who formed the militia armies of Greek states were all more or less uniformly armed. In his view they were a socio-economic class of small farmers, who each had just enough to afford hoplite armour for himself (but not more). Therefore, if the farmers were doing the fighting, this must have meant that all the fighters were hoplites. The fact that the fighting was often done over farmland also neatly unites the warriors and the stakes of war. It all fits together in his model. But we now know this was not true; in the Archaic period, only the elite could afford hoplite armour, and the mass of the population would have fought as lightly equipped infantry, mixing in with the hoplites. By the later Archaic period, as Greece grew wealthier and more people could afford hoplite armour, the rich differentiated themselves by fighting as cavalry while specialist light-armed units (archers, javelin troops) soon made their appearance. Greek warfare was never an exclusive affair of hoplites (even if the sources, with their extreme elite bias, sometimes give this impression).  Finally, the duration of pitched battles (when they occurred) is simply not known. To suit his theory about what hoplite fighting looked like (which is a separate question), Hanson supposed they must be over quickly, because the warriors would quickly become exhausted. But we have no clear evidence. The sources often say battles went on "for a long time", but we don't know how long is a long time. The only thing we really know is that the pursuit of the defeated side would often go on until nightfall, but that doesn't tell us very much about how long the actual fighting went on.  In short, while Hanson's theory is not *entirely* groundless when we look at the basic conditions of early Greek warfare, it fundamentally misunderstands or even totally ignores much of the evidence. The actual picture was much more complex, and, needless to say, much less rosy.  &nbsp;  **Sauce**  1) R. Konijnendijk, 'Mardonius' senseless Greeks', *Classical Quarterly* 66 (2016) 1-12  2) P.

I'm a bit disappointed to hear that a book I've been reading quite thoroughly would contain such outdated and reality ignoring information, but I suppose it's better to know that now than to never know it at all and take such info at face value.  I'm not sure if this would be in your area of knowledge, but do you know if the rest of the book following the writing on the Greeks is more accurate and reliable or is it all within this same framework?	1642713525.0	htif15v	t3_s83m6b	t1_hticbst	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/htif15v/

They ended up dragging their feet on gun mounts for so long that Canada gave up waiting and developed their own for the Ram tank and then sent the design to Australia for the Sentinel. You realistically see British tanks build with 6-pounders in 1942.   Pressure to put a more potent gun into the Churchill resulted in the Churchill 3" 20 cwt Gun Carrier, an arguably worthless tank destroyer that was also only built after the imminent threat of German invasion was gone and there was no longer a need for it.	1642713798.0	htift30	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfxm6l	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htift30/

33y5r	What you saw happening in *The Apartment* was the character dialing 2-1-1 to reach *Long Distance,* because he wanted to call another city.  This is a minor plot point in *Rear Window,* where Jimmy Stewart's character can tell, even through binoculars, that the murder suspect dials three digits, thus he could only be placing a long distance call.  Originally, all phone users had to tell an operator whom they wished to call.  In 1879, fearing a shortage of operators due to a measles epidemic, phone numbers were introduced in Lowell, Mass. They quickly became popular, allowing switchboard operators to quickly connect calls with little training, and spread nationwide by 1910.    In 1891, Almon Strowger invented automated exchange equipment that could interpret interruptions in the phone line's current as digits and use a system of stepping relays to connect to another local line.  At first, Strowger's exchange equipment was a competitive advantage adopted by upstart competitor phone companies in big cities, and by small-town telcos looking to save money, but the Bell System developed its own automated exchange equipment by 1919 and by 1930 most urban phone subscribers could dial their own local calls.  Very small communities continued to have switchboards into the 1970s, and as heard in *The Andy Griffith Show,* it wasn’t uncommon to ask to be connected to another party by name rather than number.  The telephone network was always an affiliation of hundreds of independent companies. By the Great Depression, almost all cities had only a single telco—but many remained independent of the Bell System, particularly in rural areas.  General Telephone gradually purchase a number of small-city telcos, and there were other regional multicity companies.  Rural areas that offered little chance for profit eventually established telephone cooperatives with help from the New Deal’s Rural Electrification Administration.  The majority of intercity phone circuits, however, were operated by the Bell System’s Long Lines Division.  Until the 1960s, placing a long distance call meant first contacting a local operator by dialing 0 or 2-1-1.  That operator would then arrange the long-distance circuit, calling you back when it was ready.  Beginning in the late 1940s, big-city operators could put long-distance calls though using a process similar to Touch-Tone dialing, and connect the parties within a few seconds.  Direct Distance Dialing was introduced in 1951 and expanded quickly through the Bell System, using the North American Numbering Plan of unique numbers for every line, and had become the norm by 1965 in nearly all cities.  This could only be used for “caller-pays” calls however, and long distance was still expensive enough for midcentury movie audiences to understand the meaning of “but he’s calling *long distance.”*  For collect or Person-to-Person (you only pay if connection to a specific person is made) calls, users still dialed 0 for Operator.  Once again, however, rural areas lagged behind, and Direct Distance Dialing probably never became available to *every* landline across the country.	1642714487.0	htihqv4	t3_s89ak9	t3_s89ak9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89ak9/when_did_americans_start_dialing_phone_numbers/htihqv4/

Those are just basic books on historiography, but it might help provide you a background on why historiography is important when doing research. To me, historiography was one of the most interesting classes I took in my graduate school career because it was so philosophical. It completely changed the way I thought about writing history. It kind of helps you take a deeper dive into researching and source material, especially primary sources.Writing History by Storey is just a basic how-to on writing about history, but it's a very useful reference when trying to remember the little things about writing about the subject.	1642715225.0	htijsz2	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htijsz2/

dtg6h	One more thing that really took the game to the next level was the music. Halo as a series has always been known for great music, but there is a sense of wonder that plays really well into the outside levels in particular with the Halo Main Theme. The music hypes up moments in the game like few other games did, especially shooters, at the time. Every track from the somber lonely sounds when running through a forerunner facility after not having seen another human for a level or two, to hopeful ready to take the fight to the covenant, to the Warthog Run's ability to make you feel like everything is about to go down, know something is about to go down, all fill a natural point building tension, or atmosphere that really sucks you into the experience.  &#x200B;  They also knew when to use tracks that you will barely hear over the sounds of a warthog, and when to change it up to loud semi-rock music that blasts out over the sound of a Scorpions Main Cannon. They were fitted so well to their relevant scenes that you started to know what was happening before it was happening just by the hype of certain songs behind you. There is nothing like the feeling of flying a Banshee in the canyons of Assault on the Control Room or Two Betrayals as On A Pale Horse, or the Flood theme playing when you are locked away in the tunnels of 343 Guilty Spark.   &#x200B;  These sounds, with unique and easily identifiable motifs, inspired people to join music, the male choir band craze (craze is probably too strong of a word, but I don't really know what to replace it with), I have several friends who learned Guitar or Drums specifically because of the Halo series, which may be anecdotal, but there are bound to be others with similar reasons or experiences.	1642716295.0	htimp6o	t3_s7eef4	t1_htc8q6k	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7eef4/what_was_it_that_made_halo_combat_evolved_such_a/htimp6o/

kv44g	>But why did they keep building and designing new bulky, slow infantry tanks, rather than investing earlier in a medium tank with higher speed and bigger guns?  It's easy to say that the British went down the wrong path in hindsight, but the development of British armour doctrine is fairly reasonable when you look at it in context of its time.  Let's go back to the early 1920s. The British adopted first the Medium Tank Mk.I then the Medium Tank Mk.II. These tanks could reach a speed of 24 kph, which was more than twice as fast as Renault FT light tanks, and had a 47 mm gun that could penetrate up to 30 mm of armour, enough to defeat any enemy tank at the time. There was also a close support variant with a 3.7" howitzer. Here we have a high speed medium tank with a big gun!  The family of tanks continued into the Medium Tank Mk.III, but only three prototypes were built. This tank was supposed to be able to reach speeds of 41.5 kph with a more powerful engine, but a blow was struck to the British armoured force with the disbanding of the Experimental Mechanized Force and cuts to the budget of land forces in 1927. The Mk.III died from this blow, and the medium tank concept with it. This was a very bad move for the British, since the Mk.III inspired the Soviet T-28, arguably the best interbellum medium tank.   Experimental work continued and it quickly turned out that you can't have everything in one tank. In 1934 the army requested a tank with the capabilities of the Medium Tank Mk.III, but lighter (12 tons instead of 16). At the same time, the army was eying the French Renault NC, so they also asked for something similar: a thickly armoured tank armed only with a machine gun.  These two directions evolved further in the mid-1930s. The British were impressed by the Soviet BT tanks at the Great Kiev Exercise and wanted something like that for themselves, and so the cruiser tanks evolved to be more like the BT (bulletproof armour, Christie suspension, high speed). At the same time, requirements for armour grew too, so you see an increase in armour on both the Cruisers (Cruiser Tank Mk.IV) and the infantry tanks (Infantry Tank Mk.II) although the latter obviously got the brunt of the armour upgrades. The armament was also modernized with the high velocity 40 mm 2-pounder and 3" howtizer for close support tanks.  Looking at the tank armament at the start of WWII, one would hesitate to state the the British bet wrong. Their "medium" tank was superior to the German Pz.Kpfw.III. The armament was the same (remember that there were no 50 mm guns yet), the armour of the Cruiser Tank Mk.IV was thicker (early Panzer IIIs had 14 mm of armour, the same as the Cruiser. Tank Mk.III), the Cruiser tank was faster. The infantry tanks had superior armour that withstood anything up to German AA guns.  It made sense for the next generation of British tanks to look exactly the same. The Cruiser Tanks Mk.V and [Mk.VI](https://Mk.VI) departed little from the Mk.IV concept and the Infantry Tank Mk.IV was still a slow and thickly armoured tank (although it had a howitzer in the hull, a feature that was quickly dropped).   The problems with this concept were only realized in the battles in North Africa. The long sight lines meant that fighting was happening at much longer ranges than in France. In this case the smaller and (slightly) faster (but more importantly, much cheaper) Valentine proved superior to the cumbersome Matilda. Also it had superior reliability and no issues with long range driving that plagued the Matilda. The new Churchill also turned out to be pretty okay against 88 mm guns at long range.   The Cruisers weren't in such good shape though. They could avoid 88 mm gun fire at long ranges due to their speed, but once they had to engage German tanks at closer ranges they couldn't compete. The solution was the "heavy cruiser" concept that surfaced at the end of 1941: a tank with the armour of an infantry tank and the speed of a cruiser tank. This was your "high speed medium tank with a bigger gun", as it would have the 57 mm 6-pounder gun that allowed it to fight German tanks at long ranges.  The problem with the heavy cruiser is that there were many ideas about how to build it. Development split into three paths: the A24 Cavalier built using Cruiser Tank [Mk.VI](https://Mk.VI) components, and then two brand new tanks: the A27M Cromwell (using a new Meteor engine) and A27L Centaur (using the old Liberty engine). The plan was to put these tanks into service in 1942, but it took far longer than expected to iron out all the bugs. By the time the tanks saw battle in 1944, it was clear that the concept was already obsolete. The replacements were already in development: a minor upgrade to the Cromwell concept (Comet) that saw battle at the tail end of the war in Europe, and a major redesign that abandoned every tradition in British tank building (the Centurion).The former was just a stopgap, but the latter resulted in a fantastic tank series that served for decades after the war.  As for the Churchill, while there were competing tank designs that were supposed to replace it, there were no proposals to do away with the concept of an infantry tank in general. If anything, the Churchills only got slower and more thickly armoured as the war went on. Like heavy tanks in other nations, they were still relatively specialized vehicles, the main type of tank in the British army was the heavy cruiser, whether the Sherman or the Cromwell.  &#x200B;  Sources and further reading:  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/03/medium-tank-mki-first-of-maneuver-tanks.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/03/medium-tank-mki-first-of-maneuver-tanks.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/12/medium-tank-mkii-interbellum-long-liver.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/12/medium-tank-mkii-interbellum-long-liver.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/01/medium-tank-mkiii-britains-cerberus.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/01/medium-tank-mkiii-britains-cerberus.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/the-first-cruiser.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/the-first-cruiser.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/cruiser-tank-mkii-with-best-intentions.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2019/01/cruiser-tank-mkii-with-best-intentions.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/04/infantry-tank-mki-first-infantry-tank.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2017/04/infantry-tank-mki-first-infantry-tank.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2018/05/short-term-queen-of-desert.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2018/05/short-term-queen-of-desert.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/01/britains-christie.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/01/britains-christie.html)  [http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/05/cruiser-iv-bit-more-armour.html](http://www.tankarchives.ca/2016/05/cruiser-iv-bit-more-armour.html)  [https://warspot.net/246-first-among-equals](https://warspot.net/246-first-among-equals)  [https://warspot.net/382-front-line-prime-minister](https://warspot.net/382-front-line-prime-minister)  [https://warspot.ru/15292-bednye-rodstvenniki-kromvelya](https://warspot.ru/15292-bednye-rodstvenniki-kromvelya)   [https://warspot.ru/13466-kromvel-luchshe-pozdno-chem-nikogda](https://warspot.ru/13466-kromvel-luchshe-pozdno-chem-nikogda)	1642718011.0	htipuij	t3_s89fqq	t3_s89fqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htipuij/

itaexggd	This answer is pretty amazing, and I'm glad that it confirms some of my sneaking suspicions as a computer science student and a lay reader of the history of computing. I've hypothesized from my teaching experience, and have written about, how teaching a too simplified version of the history of science might actually be detrimental to emerging scientists. It gives students a false sense of how science works. Yet I've lacked a solid framework on which to base my feelings. So this post is really helpful.   Anyhow, do you happen to have any suggestions about works on the history of computing that entail historiographical discussions? I've obviously read a thing or two, though in a haphazard manner without a good understanding of how the field works.   As a follow-up question, I am aware that military history has a bad reputation due to the fact that many military historians are trained in the military, and not as a historian. Is there any sort of similar reputation for the history of science among mainstream historians, considering how many historians of science are trained in science and not in history?	1642721541.0	htixvc4	t3_s8kqxq	t1_hth0dq6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htixvc4/

4sv8x	Honestly, I don't think that a band member in the 1960s would have seen it as disrespectful to cover a Beatles song in their presence. After all, two years before the release of *Sgt Peppers* there was a BBC TV special titled *The Music of Lennon & McCartney* which featured a variety of musicians covering Beatles songs...in their presence. 'Yesterday' was widely enough covered in the 1960s that it sometimes gets claimed that it's one of the most covered songs ever (in the 1965 BBC TV special it has McCartney do half the song, and then Marianne Faithfull does the other half). And not everything in the BBC special was exactly respectful: [Peter Sellers' version of *A Hard Day's Night*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLEMncv140s) is comedic, a parody of [Laurence Olivier's portrayal of Richard III in the Shakespeare play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDxnXgYPnKg). Presumably performed while members of the Beatles were there in the studio (BBC productions like this in the 1960s were basically recorded live), the Beatles almost certainly would have *loved it* because they had been massive fans of Sellers' comedy group the Goons.  Indeed, Beatles covers were common in the 1960s, where bands felt that a cover of a Lennon and McCartney track not released as a Beatles single might be a possibility for commercial success - that is why you get the Rolling Stones covering 'I Wanna Be Your Man', the Hollies covering 'I'm Looking Through You', Joe Cocker covering 'With A Little Help From My Friends', along with all of the early songs given away by Lennon and McCartney to other Merseybeat/London Invasion bands (e.g., 'From A Window' by Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, 'Hello Little Girl' by the Fourmost, 'World Without Love' by Peter and Gordon).  What did change with *Sgt. Peppers* when it was released on May 26th 1967 was the formation of a rock canon formed around albums, and in which *Sgt. Peppers* was often to be found at or near the top, with discussion of the worth of the album usually focused on the effort put into the arrangements and production of the sound, and its becoming the first enormously successful rock album that wasn't just a collection of songs but something closer to a symphony crafted together in a deliberate order from individual song material.   Rock being 'canonised' does have an implication of it being possible to commit sacrilege in some way by defacing the music. And some readers will probably have a negative reaction to Big Daddy's [comical recasting of 'Sgt Peppers' as 'Poison Ivy'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8yaP_woyRc) or the [Hollyridge Strings' easy listening instrumental version of 'Sgt Peppers'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bppQnpRy7sU). And so the screenwriter who wrote that dialogue in the 2013 movie is most likely referring to the hallowed halls of the rock canon when he has the actor playing Mitchell or Redding voice concern about disrespect - he's voicing the feelings of 2013 about something that happened in 1967. *Sgt Peppers* was an instant commercial and critical success: for example, a negative critical comment about it in the New York *Village Voice* got hundreds of angry letters in reply. But the rock canon did take longer than a week to form, and the change in the way that people saw rock music that happened as a result of *Sgt Peppers* did not *quite* happen overnight.  And it's *very* clear that the Beatles did not feel disrespected hearing their song sung by Jimi Hendrix (who also clearly became a member of the rock canon). Certainly, Paul McCartney - the song's main writer, and one of the people most influential on the production of the album - was clearly *very* pleased to hear Hendrix's version of the song when Hendrix played it at the Saville Theatre:   > I remember him opening at the Saville on a Sunday night, 4th June 1967. Brian Epstein used to rent it when it was usually dark on the Sunday. Jimi opened, the curtains flew back and he came walking forward, playing 'Sgt. Pepper', and it had only been released on the Thursday so that was like the ultimate compliment. It's still obviously a shining memory for me, because I admired him so much anyway, he was so accomplished. To think that that album had meant so much to him as to actually do it by the Sunday night, three days after the release. He must have been so into it, because normally it might take a day for rehearsal and then you might wonder whether you'd put it in, but he just opened with it. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career.	1642723892.0	htj3j6s	t3_s8esuw	t3_s8esuw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8esuw/what_is_the_historical_reason_for_playing_a_band/htj3j6s/

But it never grew into anything major.  *The Ku Klux Klan in Canada: A Century of Promoting Racism and Hate in the Peaceable Kingdom* by Allan Bartley (2020) looks at it at the national level, and I just read this too, but I didn't find it as good as Pitsula's book.	1642724479.0	htj4xjn	t3_s8jmqy	t1_htgwylf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8jmqy/thursday_reading_recommendations_january_20_2022/htj4xjn/
7rvatyyv	Pitsula direclty addresses that (on p.7): "[t]he Klan, on the other hand, never mentioned Aboriginal peoples. It was as though they did not exist: they were thought to be a 'vanishing' race of no interest or relevance." This makes sense considering the Indian Act was in full force and most First Nations in Saskatchewan (and Canada as a whole) were confined to remote reservations. They didn't matter to the KKK because they were not a group that the Klan came into contact with frequently, unlike immigrants (meaning Chinese and Ukrainians for the most part).	1642724651.0	htj5c7c	t3_s8jmqy	t1_hti0q09	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8jmqy/thursday_reading_recommendations_january_20_2022/htj5c7c/

7s4rt2oe	The quote you used does accurately describe some instances in the first World War where even though the Germans were defending, they still had similar casualties to the Entente powers. There is also examples where casualties were less than the entente powers. My answer will stick mostly to the western front as German organization and planning over the slow and disjointed Russians in the East is what created their casualty difference there. The eastern front was far more mobile due to the size of the region so trench systems were far less common especially compared to the gridlocked western front that is synonymous with our view of trench warfare.    One thing that helped the Germans avoid more casualties in the war was the way they built trenches. The Entente power's trenches were most built straight out of digging into the earth and using wood, wire mesh, or sandbags to reinforce the walls.  Most of these trenches were only about 6 to 8 feet deep with dugout in support trenchs dug to only around 16ft, with some trench lines even shallower then that.   The Germans had observed the process of the Russo-Japanese war from 1904-05 and had seen the use of trench warfare there. During WWI, they based a lot of their knowledge off of these studies and used reinforced concrete in the construction of their trenches, something the Entente rarely did. They also made extensive use of dugout bunkers, usually a minimum of 16ft and would even reach multiple stories in some places. They would also provide ventilation for them to avoid the hazard of gas attacks. They could sit and ride out many of the initial bombardments that precluded many offensives and go to the surface whenever the advance started. Some of the bunkers could be collapsed by the artillery bombardments, but most were very suitable to surviving them.    The Germans also generally had greater amounts of heavy artillery, especially in the first couple years of the war. Entente planning would fail to properly neutralize the German artillery before many offensives and it would mean the German artillery could pound the Entente soldiers as they cross no man land. German doctrine also made better use of machine guns, even dictating interlocking fields of fire that would create large kill zones for infantry trying advance.    As the Entente was more focused on the offensive and the Germans viewed that they really only needed to hold onto the land they already have as they were well inside France, this explains why the Entente didn't do the same and use concrete in trench construction. Their view was why waste the resources on better trenches as it would discourage the attitude of the advance. Certain technologies like the tank could assist in advancing, but like most wars that came before, it was expected for the attacker to face more casualties to overcome the defender. Not always the cass but still happened throughout the war.	1642725935.0	htj8d3r	t3_s8wn96	t3_s8wn96	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8wn96/what_factors_lead_to_german_casualty_ratios_being/htj8d3r/

u9kma	Not exactly inaccurate, but not exactly to the point either. The point of the story is that vegetables *by themselves* would be considered an ascetic meal. 'Low and disdained' and 'paltry' are hyperbole to accentuate the point.  In reality vegetables were an important part of the ancient Greek diet, though not as important as in modern western cuisine.  The main component of the ancient Greek diet was grain, particularly barley and wheat (durum and aestivum), though also millet, rye, and oats.  The secondary components fall into three groups: (1) three important legumes, namely chickpeas, lentils, broad beans, and peas; (2) meat and fish, typically as flavourings or sauces to accompany the main ingredients; (3) olive oil and wine.  But there were plenty of tertiary foodstuffs alongside these, including fruits, nuts, seeds, eggs, cheese, honey (usually as an ingredient in baked goods), and yes, vegetables.  Peter Garnsey's *Food and society in classical antiquity* (1999) doesn't devote attention to these specifically, though he does mention vegetables frequently. A more focused discussion is in Victoria Tsoukala's PhD dissertation on *The social context of food preparation and consumption ...* (diss. Bryn Mawr, 2004), pp. 29-30, which suggests that the most common ones were celery, leek, beet, onion, cress, lettuce, and garlic. I'm a little uneasy that she relies on Andrew Dalby, but these do seem to be backed up by primary sources. I'm also aware that cabbage growing techniques are discussed at some length in Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder; and there were other cheaper or inferior options, e.g. cannabis could be used as an inferior replacement for cabbage.  Some striking *absences* from the list of vegetables used would be carrot, artichoke, and most of the modern varieties of Brassica. When I said 'cabbage' above, that didn't mean the modern cabbage, which wasn't developed until the Roman era. It may have meant something closer to kale. Most of the modern varieties of Brassica seem to have become differentiated from one another in ancient Italy rather than in Greece.  The idea of a vegetable-centred diet as ascetic can be seen in some ancient Christian documents. The *Life of Hilarion*, dating to the 390s CE, describes Hilarion's ascetic diet:  > ... from the time [Hilarion] was twenty-one until he was twenty-six, for three years he ate half a pint of lentils soaked in cold water and for the other three years he ate dry bread with salt and water.  > Then from the time he was twenty-seven until he was thirty-one, he sustained himself with wild herbs and uncooked roots of certain shrubs.  > From the time he was thirty-one until he was thirty-five his food consisted of six ounces of barley bread and lightly cooked vegetables without any oil.  > But when he sensed that his eyes were clouding over and that his whole body was contracting under the influence of impetigo and some kind of rough skin disease, he added oil to the diet just mentioned, and until the sixty-third year of his life he continued at this level of abstinence, tasting nothing else, neither fruit nor beans nor anything else.  (Quoted from Jason König's translation, in *Saints and symposiasts*, 2012, p. 342.)  So the upshot is that I'd read the Diogenes story as an indication of Diogenes' asceticism, rather than as a marker of social class.	1642728573.0	htjeglv	t3_s8mk5t	t3_s8mk5t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8mk5t/did_the_ancient_greeks_really_look_down_on_eating/htjeglv/

2ycwtyy0	So few people are receiving mail that it's not really an issue. If you're important enough to receive mail through this postal system, you're important enough that the couriers will know where you live or work.  Until about the 1800s or so, less than a third of all people in China are able to read and write, and the number of people who are important enough to use this sort of system are much fewer than that.  For example, if you're delivering an update on recent pirate attacks from a province on the eastern coast to Peking (modern-day Beijing), the courier might not know who "General Bao" (to make up a random person) is, but they know where the military barracks is at. More likely, though, the general receives mail regularly enough that the couriers know where he lives.  So let's say that General Bao doesn't get his letter, for whatever reason. Maybe the courier can't find him or no one has the proper authority to accept it on his behalf? In that case, the courier takes the letter back to the relay station and simply stores it for the general to collect later. The couriers are all strapped with loud clanging bells, so the idea that they might wander into the barracks and say "I'm looking for General Bao" and *no one* mentions it to him later was considered a relatively low risk. Alternatively, Bao might check the postal station somewhat regularly, or have a servant designated to do as such. If a month goes by without so much as a word from anyone about anything, that might be the cause of some suspicion for our hypothetical general.  Again, the system is designed with a very small number of people in mind. *Finding* the person was not considered a major obstacle, and most of their logistical concerns revolved around verifying that the letter wasn't intercepted or opened before reaching its destination.   If you're just wanting to write, for example, a poem to a particular lady in the next neighborhood over, there were certain merchants and couriers who made it their business to make sure it found its way to the intended recipient. In that case, there wasn't any real standardized system-- it primarily depended on who you paid to send the letter on its way. In that case, someone who carries people to that neighborhood  (via a sort of chair strapped to their back) might be willing to find your lovely lady and deliver her letter for you, but there is no standardized system by which that can be done. Which isn't to say that informal systems didn't exist!   Trade merchants were known to set up their *own* courier systems, and they were similarly known to be willing to deliver personal letters alongside their official correspondence, but the idea was still the same: Get to the neighborhood in question and then ask around. How these hand-offs happened and what the process was for finding the correct recipient varied widely, but the basic idea was always the same. Get the letter or parcel within the general area, and then locate the recipient.  Which isn't to say the system was *perfect* and always worked. Westerners visiting China in the early 1900s actually found this system incredibly frustrating. Not just because their correspondence had a nasty propensity for getting lost, but also because writing correspondence back to their home countries was particularly troublesome as well. If you're a missionary in Peking and you want to write back to beloved England, you pay a courier to get the letter to the coast (either directly via their deliveries for a merchant or via a series of hand-offs in an informal network of other couriers) and then hope that the captain of the ship is willing to take your letter to another ship which then takes it to another ship that eventually gets it to England.  If you're thinking to yourself that outside of very important military correspondence going to very important people that this sounds like a convoluted mess of hand-offs and hoping, you've got the right idea.	1642729153.0	htjft7n	t3_s88meg	t1_htj1io4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htjft7n/

ntc30	We've removed your post for the moment because it's not currently at our standards, but it definitely has the potential to fit within our rules with some work. We find that some answers that fall short of our standards can be successfully revised by considering the following questions, not all of which necessarily apply here:  * *Do you actually address the question asked by OP?* Sometimes answers get removed not because they fail to meet our standards, but because they don't get at what the OP is asking. If the question itself is flawed, you need to explain why, and how your answer addresses the underlying issues at hand.  * *What are the sources for your claims?* Sources aren't strictly necessary on /r/AskHistorians but the inclusion of sources is helpful for evaluating your knowledge base. If we can see that your answer is influenced by up-to-date academic secondary sources, it gives us more confidence in your answer and allows users to check where your ideas are coming from.  * *What level of detail do you go into about events?* Often it's hard to do justice to even seemingly simple subjects in a paragraph or two, and on /r/AskHistorians, the basics need to be explained within historical context, to avoid misleading intelligent but non-specialist readers.  In many cases, it's worth providing a broader historical framework, giving more of a sense of not just what happened, but why.  * *Do you downplay or ignore legitimate historical debate on the topic matter?* There is often more than one plausible interpretation of the historical record. While you might have your own views on which interpretation is correct, answers can often be improved by acknowledging alternative explanations from other scholars.   * *Further Reading*: [This Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7ffl8/rules_roundtable_ii_the_four_questions_what_does/) provides further exploration of the rules and expectations concerning answers so may be of interest.  If/when you edit your answer, [please reach out via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskHistorians) so we can re-evaluate it! We also welcome you getting in touch if you're unsure about how to improve your answer.	1642729575.0	htjgs9n	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjbo7f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjgs9n/

96gqp	That's very much getting into a what-if, but fortunately it's a well-trodden what-if. In a lot of ways the US was lucky that Japan sank their ships in a shallow harbor; of the U.S. battle line there that day, only _Arizona_ and _Oklahoma_ would be written off as total losses; many of the other ships that were sunk were raised and participated later in the war against Japan. Losing the carriers would have been a blow to the United States, but over the course of the war the US launched ~130 new carriers of all types; Japan converted or completed 13, including two liner conversions of dubious utility. The (potential) dearth of carriers available to the US might have caused a pause in carrier operations similar to, uh, let's say the pause in carrier operations between the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in late 1942 and the Marianas in June 1944. In either case, the American carriers coming online weren't available until early- to -mid-1944 and wouldn't have been in either case; we can imagine a not-Coral Sea and a not-Midway, but the first was a local operation anyhow and the second was designed to draw out and destroy our (hypothetically non-existent) carrier fleet, in which case it wouldn't have been carried out.   tl;dr: no, there was no way the American navy was going to be defeated in the Pacific; only perhaps delayed.	1642729961.0	htjho80	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htimgqq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjho80/

d9bl4mjs	Yes. Specifically in Los Angeles, Asian communities, but more specifically Koreans, emerged as something of a merchant middle-class, and would frequently open stores in areas with the lowest barrier to purchasing real-estate, which is to say low-income black-dominant neighborhoods where they often didn’t live themselves. This created a kind of material tension between the poor residents of an area and this local foreigners who controlled the majority of basic commerce. Each was threatened by the other, with the local black population feeling exploited and robbed of economic opportunity by the Asians who often did not hire black employees or contribute to local community projects, and the Asians feeling threatened by the black overwhelming population in more traditionally racist tropes or perhaps sensing this very real sense of aggrievement. Additionally, Korea is an extremely homogenous society that is largely unaware of the history of American race relations and immigrants from that country were particularly poorly equipped for the multiculturalism of urban America, which further provoked misunderstanding and tension. This was encapsulated by specific flashpoints, perhaps most infamously the murder of Latasha Harlins.	1642730500.0	htjiwd1	t3_s8n63s	t3_s8n63s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8n63s/in_the_movies_dont_be_a_menace_menace_ii_society/htjiwd1/

9c89xxn	>I've hypothesized from my teaching experience, and have written about, how teaching a too simplified version of the history of science might actually be detrimental to emerging scientists.  I think they are two distinct fields. The kind of history we teach scientists isn't really history as historians would use the term. It's focused on the science (what was the idea, how did it differ from the previous version) rather than on the person (how did the scientist came up with this idea, what was his context), or on society (what did his contemporaries think, how did they react and why, what influence did it have on society).  I don't think it's possible to give a historian's context to the student in science class, just as you wouldn't expect a historian to fully understand or appreciate the science. It's a specialized field where you need credentials in both science and history to do it justice. The focus in science classes is much more limited, for example, talking about Newtonian mechanics to show how Einstein's field equations change our understanding of how matter actually interacts with space and time. The instructor only has a passing interest in who Newton or Einstein were or the world they lived in, the point is to communicate that there was an increasing mismatch between what Newton predicted and what we actually observed, so there was a need to reconcile theory with observations.  I think this is what the previous comment referred to as the "march of winners", not in the sense of winners and losers as people, but rather ideas that "won" because they better explained the facts. Because the scientist isn't really interested in the people, they are just convenient names to hang ideas on. Instead, the "history" is just an account of how our understanding of some phenomenon proceeded from A to B, via steps X, Y and Z in between.  This kind of account absolutely does not replace history, but it's not meant to. It's just a consequence of the division of labor between scientist and historian, with the scientist providing an account of the evolution of an idea, and the historian providing the context surrounding the idea.	1642731428.0	htjl15x	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htixvc4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htjl15x/

8brve	I am not deeply steeped in the history of computing — it is its own sub-discipline, more associated with the history of technology than the history of science — but perhaps there are others with suggestions there. SIGCIS, an organization of scholars who study the history of computing, has a [really useful resource guide](vhttps://www.sigcis.org/resources) which a section of "Key Books and Articles on the History of Computing" that includes descriptions of the various books. The one book I tend to recommend to people who want to branch out of the version of the history of computing that computer scientists tell themselves is Paul Edwards' _The Closed World_, which is about the connections between the development of modern computers and the military-industrial complex in the Cold War and how to think about them not just as technical artifacts but as technopolitical systems that also inscribed certain ideologies into physical practice.   On the last question — there are sort of two ways to think about this. One is the issue of historians vs. scientists, which is sort of the old "Science Wars" approach. Most of that seems kind of passé at this point, largely because there aren't as many people blaming postmodernism for all of society's woes (now they blame people who teach about race, which is its own problem, obviously). The other is historians of science vs. other historians. My experience is that non-historians of science can often feel that historians of science are WAY too interested in the content of the science for their own good; they regard us as being much more technical (and they themselves are often pretty proudly ignorant of scientific matters). (Scientists, of course, never view us as technical-enough, so nobody is ever _that_ happy with us. I think this is an advantage, in the end; historians of science are born "boundary crossers" and pretty comfortable in all sorts of crowds. I work at a STEM school where practically all of the historians are historians of science/tech, so this is not an issue I have to confront much anymore.) Similarly, historians of science tend to get very annoyed when historians who haven't studied any history of science say very silly and unexamined things about science, which can happen all of the time. In general though, the history of science has done a good job, I think, in having many of its "big ideas" penetrate into the broader historical community at this point, so it is not as awkward as it might have been in the past.  I would note one thing though — today, most historians of science, while they may have had some training in science, almost always have substantial training in history. There are very few people who are "merely" former scientists anymore. That wasn't always the case (Kuhn was a physicist who became basically self-taught in history, for example), but it has been that way for the past several decades. It is a fairly mature historical field. Whereas the history of computing is still a field where, as you note, a lot of the people who write about it are basically "participants" — computer scientists first, without formal training in history. That isn't a totally bad thing, obviously; it does take considerable subject expertise to write a history well, and participants have that, and can learn to be good historians. But I do see it as a sign of an "immature" field when the ratio of former participants to people with PhDs in the subfield of history are skewed; it tends to lead to insufficient historiographical self-reflection, for example, and too much reiteration of internal stories of development at the expense of other ways to think about it. History of computing has come a long way in the last decade or two, though, so it may not be fair to characterize it this way; there is an ever-growing crop of younger historians of computing who have always been that.

96gqp	> 130 "carriers" not carriers.  Ok, if you want to be a pedant about this, we can go all day, bro.   In the period after Dec. 7, 1941, and bounded by September, 1945, the United States built something close to 130 aircraft carriers of all types. Of those, if we _only_ consider fleet carriers important, 24 Essex-class fleet carriers were completed during the war, with another eight canceled, two in mid-construction. During that time, if we discount the useless liner conversions and  escort carriers (as you seem to be doing with your sneering "carriers") Japan built only the Shinano (sunk by a submarine on her maiden voyage) and the Taihō, also sunk by a sub.   Does that materially change my point?	1642734694.0	htjskjr	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjnvfo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htjskjr/
itaexggd	What you write is undoubtedly true. What I was getting at, is that there's value in spending a little bit of time when teaching STEM subjects to remind students, hey, by the way, as much as you're speedrunning through the march of winning ideas in this course, that's not how it usually works. That legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers; that theoretical innovation which was useful for research at that time period turned out to have a devastating sociocultural impact, etc.	1642734843.0	htjswja	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htjl15x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htjswja/

itaexggd	Thank you for pointing out CIGCIS resource guide! Some of the books on the list are going to be on my ever-growing to-read list :P  Computing as a field, in general, is merely a century old so it makes sense that the history of computing, too, is a relatively new field.   I'm wondering, are you aware whether the history of computing/technology has had many interconnections with the philosophy of technology and/or technocriticism? I've read a little bit on the contemporary debate among computing professionals on the issues of technological instrumentalist and determinism, but surely the level of discussion among computing professionals would be lagging behind those who are philosophers first.	1642735454.0	htju9sy	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htjmjq2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htju9sy/

i6kyb	Hopefully /u/Iphikrates won't mind me butting in here, but I'll say that the medieval chapters are quite good. Christopher Allmand is one of the leading military historians of the late Middle Ages, which Bernard Bachrach has been the mainstay of Early Medieval military history for fifty years.  I will say that you should disregard some of Bachrach's biggest numbers. He's one of biggest proponents of big Carolingian armies and generally big High Medieval armies, but often he goes higher than the evidence allows. Charlemagne at his height, for instance, likely did have a pool of 35 000 mounted men to draw on, but there's relatively little evidence for large numbers of infantry (barring armed servants driving wagons, and even these often had no more than a club).   Similarly, the suggestion that Alfred the Great had a paid force of 27 000 men in his burhs is based on a tentative suggestion put forward by Nicholas Brooks (and subsequently made less tentative) that has, in recent years, been heavily criticised. Likely these men were primarily for the *maintenance* of the fortifications and might have served as garrisons in war time, but they're unlikely to have been a standing, paid force.  Still, Bachrach does well for the most part, so just be careful when he suggests numbers of more than 15-20 000 and look more at his descriptions of fortifications, the importance of infantry and the effect of political fragmentation on manpower available to an individual ruler.	1642736019.0	htjvirp	t3_s83m6b	t1_htif15v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/htjvirp/

2ycwtyy0	Definitely! As I said, Westerners living in China at the time found this whole process ***incredibly*** frustrating. The western powers were primarily concerned with getting mail into and out of the country reliably, so there were a number of post offices set up for western mail, but even then once it got there nobody really had any idea what to do with it beyond hand it off to a courier and hope for the best. This caused each nation to set up their own specific postal routes, policies, and practices, which just added to the confusion and frustration.   Sir Robert Hart (British) founded the Imperial Post in 1896, but I think the fact that China didn't join the International Postal Union until 1914 should give some insight into how confusing the entire thing was. The ancient courier relay system had served China perfectly well for hundreds of years precisely because only a very small elite class of people were able to utilize it. Once the Western powers began establishing their presence in large numbers in the late 1800s, though, it became clear that flaws which were easily manageable on a small scale created pretty significant problems on a larger scale.	1642741338.0	htk6klc	t3_s88meg	t1_htjmu20	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htk6klc/

izvvt	This is a bit of a broad question as many different historians in many different fields will use a variety of different historiographic theories, some more so than others. Some historians don't use a lot of theory in their work while others are incredibly theory-heavy.  In addition to that, Marxism and historical materialism as a theory itself has evolved and changed a lot over the past 50-60 years. I'll try and map some of those changes and show how aspects of historical materialism are still very much used in work published in my field, 20th-century Caribbean history, with an emphasis on Trinidad and Tobago. Other historians can answer how much Marxism is relevant in their own fields.   A common critique of historical materialism as a theory has been that it is too deterministic and does not give historical actors enough agency. In one of Karl Marx's most famous quotes in his 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, he states "Men make their own history but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past". Many Marxist historians have tried to introduce agency into their work, and show how the proletariat gains class consciousness. Arguably the most famous of these examples is E.P. Thoompsons *The making of the English working-class* published in 1963. In it, Thompson argues that the working class was "present at its own making" that "class is a relationship" and that Thompson's overarching goal was to rescue the working class from the "enormous condescension of posterity" Many consider Thompson's work the first piece of "cultural marxism" that shows that the proletariat forms itself when it feels that its rights are being trampled on, and that the working class does not simply form when economic conditions are poor, but that instead, class is formed by relationships of men between each other. The book has received its due criticism over the course of the past 60 years. The book is gender in a very male-dominated way and Thompson is incredibly hostile to the methodist church of England. However, it is arguably one of the most important pieces of Marxist texts and started to open the door for a more wide-ranging kind of Marxist history.   The famous gender historian Joan Scott began to tackle the issues of gender in Marxism in her work *Gender and the Politics of History* published in 1988. In it, Scott argues that   "Identity becomes not a reflection of some essential reality but a matter of political allegiance. Feminist history approached this way changes Thompson’s story. It refuses its teleology and retells it as a story of the creation of political identity through representations of sexual difference. Class and gender become inextricably linked in this telling—as representation, as identity, as social and political practice."  Scott is challenging the typically male-gendered nature of class and asking for a more analytical approach to working-class politics, "one that recasts our knowledge about gender and class." I'm not a gender historian but I bring this example up, along with the Thompson example, to show that Marxist historical analyses begins to be mixed with other kinds of historiography and that studies of class become intersectional with studies of race, gender, and post-colonialism  To breach now more into my field to show how Marxism is still very relevant in contemporary work on the Caribbean, and specifically Trinidad and Tobago. I'll try to keep this somewhat brief to the best of my ability as this section will read more as just examples of how Marxism is still used. I understand you would probably like a more broad-reaching answer to your question, but I can show how in my field Marxism is still very frequently used.   In writing about the Black Power Revolution in 1970 in Trinidad and Tobago, historian Brinsley Samaroo in the book *Black Power in the Caribbean,* published in 2019, argues   “The view among those who challenged the existing system was that the black-led government of the People’s National Movement (PNM) had concentrated on capturing the administrative machinery of power but had left economic control in the hands of the colonial (European) and neocolonial (North American) capitalist classes and the local comprador bourgeoisie"  Here you can see Samaroo uses a mix of Marxist and Post-Colonial ideology to argue that the Eric Williams-led PNM government of Trinidad and Tobago had sold out to colonial capitalist interests that would end up leading to a revolution taking place that had mixes of anti-capitalist sentiment and Black Power ideology. However, it should be noted that NJAC, the group that would lead this revolution, very much felt that they were a vanguard party of a socialist revolution in the country.   Kate Quinn, in the same book, points out how one of the strongest forces of Black Power in the Caribbean as a whole and in Trinidad and Tobago specifically, was its economic critiques. Quinn argues “The Black Power critique of Caribbean economies centered on two fundamental issues: foreign ownership and control of major resources and the domination of the local economy by minority local elites, who were mostly lighter-skinned.” Once again, here we see a mix of Marxist class critique mixed with decolonial language.   James Millette in examing the Black Power Revolution of Trinidad and Tobago takes on a more purely historical materialist perspective. Millette argues that Williams had abandoned the working class of Trinidad and Tobago when he was elected Prime Minister and that “Williams had signified his willingness to put himself at the head of the national bourgeoisie”.  Millette was a professor at the University of the West Indies at the time and was a leader of the NJAC group that would lead the revolution, so his perspective and bias should be called into question in his writing about the event decades later, but he very obviously believed that Black Power Revolution of 1970 was a socialist revolution that was going to overthrow Bourgouise capitalist interests in his nation.  These are just three small examples of how in my narrow field, Marxism and aspects of historical materialism are still very much in use. Pure Marxists and pure economic determinism has fallen out of favor, but in looking at elements of class formation, class relations, and aspects of revolutionary consciousness through a Marxist lens are still very much relevant, often with ties to post-colonialism.

i6kyb	Gerry Milligan's *Moral Combat: Women, Gender, and War in Italian Renaissance Literature* has been on my reading list for a while and would seem to be the most recent and up to date book on the topic, at least so far as cross-dressing women and warfare, but Margaret Tomalin's *The Fortunes of the Warrior Heroine in Italian Literature: An Index of Emancipation* and Lillian S. Robinson's *Monstrous Regiment: The Lady Knight in Sixteenth-century Epic* should also be on your list.  Although not directly related to women dressing as men, [this article](Is This Love? Same-Sex Marriages in Renaissance Rome) on a same-sex marriage in the 1570s includes a reference to men who dressed up as women during the ceremony, and you might find it profitable to look into same-sex communities of the time and see if cross-dressing was common beyond just the one known instance of a wedding ceremony. And speaking of the possibility of transwomen, there was possibly one in [mid-14th century Venice](https://www.ilgazzettino.it/nordest/venezia/rolandina_roncaglia_transgender-4416039.html), although you'll probably need to do some real digging to verify that.   How much Italian can you read? I suspect that most sources will be easiest to find if you know the right terms to search academia.edu and Google Scholar for Italian scholarship.	1642744143.0	htkbrmv	t3_s8pm4m	t3_s8pm4m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8pm4m/instances_of_female_crossdressing_in_renaissance/htkbrmv/

168sly	This is going to be difficult to answer not only because it's a "why didn't x happen" and because of the 20 year rule.  Keeping both in mind - as for why Ukraine didn't aspire to join NATO in the 1990s through 2002, during the period when countries like Poland, the Baltics, or the Czech Republic did have stated policies to join the alliance, there are a few factors in play. A major one is that it just scored incredibly low on Ukrainians' radars. Polls from the late 1990s showed that interest in NATO membership, or in joining pretty much any international organization, were incredibly low on regular Ukrainian people's minds compared to economic issues, which makes sense given that Ukraine was going through a massive economic disruption caused by the end of Soviet central planning (the Ukrainian economy still technically hasn't recovered to 1991 levels). This general lack of interest went hand-in-hand with low Ukrainian media coverage of such topics, and a feeling among the Ukrainian political elite that since membership was such a remote prospect (it should be noted that even Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were not invited to join NATO until 1997, and didn't become members until 1999 - Slovakia was noticeably not invited in this round because of perceived undemocratic tendencies of it's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar), it really wasn't an issue worth addressing. Even that NATO expansion was strongly opposed by Russia, which already also spoke of Ukraine (and other former Soviet states) in terms of a "Near Abroad", not quite separate from the Russian sphere. The West itself at this time didn't necessarily see Ukraine as completely independent from Russia, and usually subordinated concerns about the former to focus more directly on the latter.   On top of this, there was a consistent minority that was against NATO membership when pollsters pressed on the topic. When asked in 1997 if Russia's opposition to NATO expansion was justified, 24.8% of Ukrainian respondents said yes, 55.2% of respondents didn't know, and only 20% said no. Similar numbers said that NATO expansion to include Ukraine would be against Ukrainian interests and contradict its Non-Aligned status. Indifference really was the order of the day across the country, but on top of this resistance to Ukrainian membership in NATO was especially strong in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine (especially the Donetsk region) where almost 50% of respondents opposed NATO membership, while Western Ukraine showed much stronger favorability to NATO membership. Ethnic Russians - concentrated in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, also tended to be more hostile to the idea of NATO membership. Regardless of their feeling, Ukrainians who saw international relations as a pressing issue numbered in the single digits - it just wasn't a pressing concern.  On top of this, the political landscape of Ukraine was very different in the 1990s from today, and was very similar to what was happening in Russia at the time. In the 1994 and 1998 elections the largest number of party seats went to the Communist Party of Ukraine (86 out of 450 in 1994, and 121 out of 450 in 1998). The KPU (which was more heavily based in the Ukrainian south and east) looked very fondly on the Soviet period and not very fondly at all on the West. This was a major political bloc against greater integration with NATO and in favor of closer ties with Russia. Ironically, worsening Ukrainian-Russian relations led in part to the political downfall of President Leonid Kravchuk and his defeat in 1994 by Leonid Kuchma, elected with strong support from the south and east, and favoring better ties with Russia. Kuchma began to move towards a more independent-minded foreign policy, but moved towards unoffiical cooperation with NATO, joining the Partnership for Peace program and signing a partnership charter with the alliance in 1997. But still because of political considerations, the official position was that Ukraine was a neutral state, and even when President Kuchma (after his 1999 reelection) pushed for closer ties with the West, it was specifically with the EU rather than NATO, again reflection a greater popular concern about economic matters.  In short - there were big regional and ethnic constituencies opposing involvement with NATO in the 1990s and early 2000s in Ukraine, and most Ukrainians were far more concerned about economic issues than what were perceived as international matters.  As a postscript, even well into the 2000s there was close division in public opinion between supporters and opponents of NATO membership, and a clear and overwhelming majority favoring NATO membership is something that is *extremely* recent to Ukrainian public opinion - like, in the last year or so - and highly shaped by events since 2014 which are beyond the scope of this sub.  This information and more can be found in a 2000 study titled "The Effect of NATO Partnership with Ukraine on Inter-Ethnic Relations within the Country" by Sergey Khrychikov available [here](https://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/98-00/khrychikov.pdf)	1642746793.0	htkg7tw	t3_s9168p	t3_s9168p	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9168p/why_did_ukraine_not_join_nato_with_the_rest_of/htkg7tw/

mdu63	I summarized some surroundings on medieval liturgical candles of bee wax in later medieval Sweden  before in: [Were candles a purely cottage industry in the middle ages?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q3yhhl/were_candles_a_purely_cottage_industry_in_the/), but I'm not 100% sure to what extent these conditions were the same across Europe (at least there seemed to have been candle maker guilds for animal tallow candles in more urbanized parts of Europe).  +++    Some very basic summarized points of the linked post are:    * There were actually two kind of wax in medieval (pre-Reformation) Europe: While animal tallow were widely used also in secular buildings, the church used candles made of bee wax exclusively. These two kind of wax must had a bit different chemical traits like melting points as well as smells, but I have not unfortunately read any relevant primary texts or secondary literature that discuss which traits of bee wax (or candles of bee wax) was favored by medieval churchmen.      * Bee wax was certainly luxury, and it occupied considerable part of the total purchase of individual local (parish) churches as well as more rich churches like cathedral in 15th century Sweden.   * Account records from late medieval Sweden almost exclusively mention the purchase of bee wax itself. neither candles made of bee wax nor animal tallow. It means that the clergy probably made candles by themselves or by their own servants.	1642747245.0	htkgwv3	t3_s8yzy9	t3_s8yzy9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htkgwv3/
k55aq	> I realize that this is so common now it seems silly to describe, but it's tough to overstate how revolutionary the design was. The N64, with its weird trident shape had just one trigger and one stick, and its design meant that it was impossible to use all the buttons on the controller without moving your hand around it. You could use the analogue stick and pull the trigger or you could use the face buttons, but you couldn't do both at the same time. What the Xbox controller did was give players the ability to use both sticks and triggers at the same time — and still allow the user to use one stick and face buttons.  The original [Dualshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock) controller predates the release of the [XBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console\)) by 4 years. 3 years before [Microsoft's acquisition of Bungie & Halo's move to being an XBox exclusive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060501214618/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Jun00/BungiePR.mspx). And according to sources I can find, Microsoft didn't commit to making the XBox until after Sony had announced the PS2 in March of 1999. ([here](https://venturebeat.com/2011/11/14/making-of-the-xbox-1/2/), [here](https://www.ign.com/videos/2015/07/02/podcast-unlocked-201-3-xbox-bosses-share-secrets-of-the-consoles-past)).  > Bungie took this design and ran with it, creating a control scheme that was so brilliant that in retrospect it seems obvious. Left stick to move, right stick to aim, trigger to shoot. These are the primary verbs of the FPS, and for the first time on a console, players could do them without needing to move their hands — just like on a PC.  From [Gamespot's review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alien-resurrection-review/1900-2637344/) of Alien Resurrection for the original Playstation, which was released on October 11th, 2000, more than a year before the release of Halo:  > The game's control setup is its most terrifying element. The left analog stick moves you forward, back, and strafes right and left, while the right analog stick turns you and can be used to look up and down. Too often, you'll turn to face a foe and find that your weapon is aimed at the floor or ceiling while the alien gleefully hacks away at your midsection. Add to the mix a few other head scratchers - such as how the triangle button controls item and health use - and you'll be wondering how Sony let this get by without requesting a few different control configuration options.

9c89xxn	>That legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers  I wouldn't do that, because I wouldn't want the focus to be on the person, but on whatever work he did that's relevant to the topic. Same reason why I wouldn't mention if he cheated on his wife or beat his dog. I'm not trying to present a "fair and balanced" picture of the person, that's a job for biographies or tabloids. And if I were to bring up his other papers, I'd probably pick those foundational to science, not the ones that were "shitty". If they were wrong, they're not part of science anymore, and it seems a bit mean-spirited to bring them up just to say hey, look at this crap he wrote. "Fair and balanced" is a motto for news anchors, not a concern for science.  >that theoretical innovation which was useful for research at that time period turned out to have a devastating sociocultural impact  Again, that doesn't sit comfortably with me. I have a distaste for politicizing science, and "devastating sociocultural impact" is often not a clear cut objective fact, but has many nuances. It's a human tendency to assign blame, and it seems a bit wrong to give folks a target for hate, when in reality the picture is far more complex.  I'm not arguing that there's no value to these things, of course there is. But these are complicated topics that need a lot of context to explain, and even then, people may come to different conclusions because judgments are partly subjective. It would require a book or a proper class in history of science to treat them seriously, and I'm not sure a science lecture can do justice, or convey much more than the lecturer's own opinion. Which is at best worthless, and at worst, agenda-driven.	1642748203.0	htkiddz	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htjswja	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htkiddz/

1s8d9k78	Faith. Faith is an extremely powerful tool for a pope. Most Christian monarchs were genuinely faithful, felt like it was part of their duties to promote religion and support the Church, and believed in the legitimacy of the Pope. It's very hard to denounce or even attack someone you believe to be the messenger of you deity on earth, even if you personally disagree with them. Not to forget that your countrymen are faithful too, and that the local clergy is very influential; in any conflict between you and the Pope, you have no guarantee that the people will side with you. This is what happened during the Guelphs and Ghibellines era (XII and XIII centuries). Some towns and states sides with the Pope, others with the Holy Roman Emperor, and it created a conflict that lasted 50 years and had consequences for centuries more. For a long time, excommunication was also a very real threat to a monarch's power. And the Pope had exclusive control over that.  Even with taking faith out of the question, medieval and Renaissance Europe was very much a case of everyone knowing each other and having a web of political alliances, and this includes the Pope. Although Italy was not yet a state in itself and was divided in duchies, realms, princedoms and republics, there was still very much a sense of Italian nationality. Most popes were Italians, and most cardinals were as well. These men had (powerful) families which themselves had many alliances.  For example, Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) started his papacy with a tight alliance with the Sforza family, which controlled Milan. For this, he married off his daughter to a Sforza and named Ascanio Sforza Vice-Chancellor of the Church. When this fell through, Alexander VI remarried his daughter to the Aragon family of Naples, and one of his sons also married a member of that family. When this fell though again, he then allied himself to Louis XII of France through a partnership with his oldest (still living) son, Cesare. And Alexander VI was not a "popular" pope among his peers, a main reason for this being that he was a Spaniard and not Italian by birth. All this to show that no matter what, the Papacy always had allies who could fight with it. And while the Papal armies were far from being the most powerful at the time, they weren't a small force either. (Not to mention that any army wanting to attack the Vatican would have to cross Italy from either the north or the south, which had no chance of being welcome by the people ruling over those lands. Armies have a tendency to pillage and destroy towns on their way.)  So while military action against the Pope wasn't unheard of, it was a very risky endeavour that few monarchs dared to attempt.	1642752295.0	htko4ic	t3_s927c7	t3_s927c7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s927c7/historically_why_did_the_kings_tolerate_the_papacy/htko4ic/

They felt if they could turn it into a grind then the US would negotiate better terms with them and hopefully they could retain some of their imperial territories.

96gqp	No, that's literally the exact opposite of their war aims, [as I explained here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3dxlh4/what_did_japan_hope_to_accomplish_by_attacking/ct9l1wz/). The entire goal of their Navy, and the reason for their doctrine and tactical orientation during the interwar period, was to defeat the U.S. navy in one decisive battle (in which the U.S. navy would have been attrited steaming westward towards, say, the Philippines) after which the U.S. would have been forced to sue for peace. This is why they trained elite aviators, but few of them; this is why they practiced night fighting but not damage control; this is why they built a few super-battleships but not many of them -- because their industrial base could not sustain a long war.   To illustrate this: When Japanese A6 Zero fighters rolled off the production line, they were dragged by oxen to the airstrip where they flew off to the fleet.	1642757731.0	htkv7vu	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htjukyt	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htkv7vu/

itaexggd	I'll chew on your comment for a while. There are two aspects in which I don't agreeing with you, although I do agree that whether a scientist was a dog-beater is usually irrelevant.   First, I teach middle and high school students which brings about its own challenges. Their attention spans are shorter, and many do not want to be in the room. Grabbing the attention of a student sometimes involves history trivia. Furthermore, when teaching K-12 students, the pedagogical purpose of science courses is not merely for them to gain a precise understanding of scientific concepts, but also as a part of a holistic common education curriculum that tries to get students interested in things. This is purely my personal conjecture: a K-12 student who understands that scientists overcame many failures to reach discoveries will be more encouraged to experiment with ideas themselves. I find it to be highly educational to introduce students to a particular theory that turned out to be false, and to give them the challenge of designing an experiment to disprove it. Of course, the higher up in grade the students go, the less time a good teacher must spend on diversions.   Yet, I wonder, must nonscientific context always be removed from university-level courses as well? An introductory AI professor spent around 10 minutes of one of the lectures discussing incidents in which bias in AI caused societal issues. 10 minutes of a semester driving home the point that bias in AI is both an objective technological problem and a subjective ethics problem to a room full of potential AI developers is essential. Especially since the CS curriculum at my university does not mandate an ethics course. It is just too difficult to cram everything useful into a curriculum, so sometimes essential topics such as ethics in CS get relegated to the margins of introductory courses.   The second example is Morgan's canon, which states that one must choose the simplest possible explanation for an animal's behavior. Although Morgan's canon was useful in preventing anthropomorphic bias, it also prevented the scientific study of animals' emotions and intelligence for many decades, which in turn may have contributed to animal abuse, in both scientific experiments and in wider society. Surely, a quick mention of this historical context of the Morgan's canon in an introductory animal behavior class would not be irrelevant in a room full of potential biologists who may be conducting animal experiments in the future?	1642760153.0	htky6v5	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htkiddz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htky6v5/
7j9p6	So this might not be a "simple question" but I was looking at [[flying aces in WW2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_II_flying_aces) and well, it's shockingly German. Greatest non-German ace on that list is 94, yet the Germans had dozens of pilots all with over 100 kills to their name. The Germans ultimately lost the war. They lost the battle of Britain. As far as I know, the Germans were losing consistantly against the RAF with their raiding in the blitz in terms of aircraft killed.   So how come? Obviously aces only tell a small part of the story (well, as small as it can be when one man shoots down 200 aircraft) but it sure looks like the Germans were just better pilots overall.	1642761678.0	htl03db	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htl03db/

I can unfortunately answer neither of your follow-up questions (additional scent or regulations on the size) with certainty, based on my knowledge of narrow specialty.    +++  >additional scent to candles  Previous research of candles/ lighting tend to characteristic (burning smell) by main material like bees wax or tallow, or even spermaceti (whale oil) in the 18th century. While I don't have enough evidence to refute the possibility of adding scent completely, it would be not so realistic to negate the original negative smell of main material (the preference for commoners/ secular building was mainly determined by relative price of each material, so if additional scent cost too much, the merit of preferring a cheap but bad odored material itself would be annulled).   +++  >regulation on the size  As mentioned above, some English towns and boroughs had a guild of tallow chandlers (candle makers made of animal tallow) in Later Middle Ages, and city/town or borough ordinances regulated activity of guild members. Their "assizes" also stipulated the basic price, size and weight of some important dairy products like bread, and tallow candle seemed to have been no exception.    The following is an excerpt from [medieval document of chandlers guild in Leicester, England](https://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/tallowPagesfromVolume15.pdf):    >"Furthermore it is ordained that every occupier of the foresaid craft or occupation shall keep the price and assize[" prise and sise " in the original] accustomed that is to say when a pound candle is assized by the mayor for 1 d. that none of the said occupation of the town buy tallow above viii d. a stone And when a pound candle is assized at 1 1/4 d. none exceeding x d. a stone and when a pound candle is assized at 1 1/2 d. ls non exceeding xii d. the stone on pain of Forfeit every time any of the occupation known or found with the contrary vi s. viii d. thereof to remain with the masters iii s. iv d."    Here "stone" means the tallow part of the candle.    The entry of Mar. 19, 1300 of Mayor's Court Roll of London also alludes to the "Assize of Candles" stipulating the price, though it does not say directly about the size and weight of individual candles.    >"Thomas le Chaundeler was summoned to answer the Mayor and Aldermen in a plea that, whereas Matthew le Caundeler and his fellows were chosen to keep the Assize of Candles when Parliament was sitting, a certain Robert, servant of Sir John de Droknesford, wanted to buy a pound of candles for 3d, and the defendant refused the money; thereupon Robert had complained to Matthew, and the latter, in accordance with the ordinance made by the men of that craft, had caused the candles to be delivered to the servant for the above price, and afterwards the defendant had abused Matthew and struck him as he was standing in his shop. The defendant denied the offence, and a jury of Candelwykestrate was summoned for Tuesday, on which day the parties made agreement on terms that the defendant pledge five casks of wine, to be forfeited if he were convicted in the future of any trespass against Matthew. He was mainprised by Richard Fiz, ceynturer, and John le Chaundeler of Ismongerelane to come up for judgment quo et quando &c. for his trespass against the officers of the craft, and the Mayor and Aldermen."   Source: https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/mayor-court-rolls/1298-1307/pp46-91#h3-0049  On the other hand, as long as candle-making remained the domestic cottage industry as I illustrated above for medieval Sweden, it is likely that the size of individual candles was not uniform.	1642765748.0	htl5lxr	t3_s8yzy9	t1_htkjx5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htl5lxr/

yfege	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1642766052.0	htl62du	t3_s98a31	t3_s98a31	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s98a31/why_was_george_6th_and_wallis_simpsons_marriage_a/htl62du/

8k7p4	It seems like a strange combination: they at once realize they can't hope to outgun the US, yet hope to defeat them in a single climactic battle the likes of which is almost certain to go to the side with far superior firepower. Given the numbers you provide earlier, success seems so far beyond the realm of possibility that nobody would've banked on such a plan.  Were the Japanese misguided in terms of just how far-and-away the US could outproduce them (10:1 as mentioned earlier), or did they really just have such extraordinary opinions of their own prowess that they thought they could overcome those odds by training elites (despite presumably also having less experience with the equipment than the Americans; correct me if I'm wrong there).	1642759476.0	htkxd9i	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htkv7vu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htkxd9i/

The decision to attack the United States was not well judged in retrospect, but one has to keep in mind that conflicts with China and Russia had previously been decided by a decisive naval battle, after which the much larger country had been forced to grovel. The grand flaw in Japanese plans, of course, was the assumption that an attack on, say, the Philippines would immediately send the American fleet on a crash course to a decisive battle, but it's also the only way in which the strategy would have worked.   If -- and this is a very big if -- the Japanese had, say, formally declared war and "only" overrun the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in the Pacific, and if -- and this is a very big if -- Hitler had not unilaterally declared war on the US on the day after our hypothetical attack -- would the US have fought a more limited war in the Pacific, or not been a participant in Europe? We don't know, but given the drift towards war that was ongoing in the Atlantic/European theater, it seems likely that the United States would have been involved at some point, with a degree of public support that's debatable for any of those hypotheticals.	1642769965.0	htlciyv	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htkxd9i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htlciyv/

My objection was more to the formulation "that legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers", which can be interpreted in many ways, and some of them belittle the achievement. "Shitty papers" are only shitty if they show laziness or stupidity, not merely because they were wrong. We are not gifted with any magical insight. Each effort solves a bit of the puzzle, if only by ruling some things out.  I would have no problem explaining a sequence of events, such as "he tried this but it didn't work, so he thought some more and discovered a faulty assumption which he corrected in the next experiment, but it produced unexpected results so he realized there was something fundamentally wrong with his theory ..", and so on. There are wrong assumptions and failed experiments along the way, but nothing I would call "shitty". It's the opposite of shitty - it's the human intellect staring into the unknown, charting a path to a destination you can't see. The amazing thing isn't that you took some wrong turns along the way, but that you used each mistake to narrow down possibilities until you found the one thing that worked. It's a very deliberate process, mistakes and all.  >Science's tendency to regard animals as mindless automata may have contributed to animal abuse, in both scientific experiments and in wider society.  I'm not sure I agree. Morgan's Canon isn't exactly science, as in a discovery, invention, or explanation. It's just a reminder that one shouldn't draw conclusions in excess of the actual data. If you think an animal displayed an emotion, or reasoned its way through a problem, then show us what evidence you base that conclusion on. It's not enough to say "I would have felt that emotion" or "I'd have reasoned the same solution".  I don't think science has a "tendency" to regard animals as mindless automata; it's compatible with whatever position the evidence supports. Perhaps you are unhappy with the null hypothesis, to not assume things until we have reason to assume them. But it's really not possible to do it any other way.  Perhaps this did lead to some animal abuse (though I think science is incidental to such things, people have been both torturing and worshipping animals since long before Morgan was born), but science is really neutral about such things. Science can only say "biologists haven't provided any evidence yet that this species feels emotions", but if you take that to mean "therefore I can torture it and ignore the screams", that's on you. Science is not normative, it's people who are moral or amoral.	1642771513.0	htlfhc1	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htky6v5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htlfhc1/

j3tt7	Wow – thanks so much for this!  >What is the spectrum of professional opinion on the Kennedy assassination?   This is pretty much exactly what I was wondering.   I respect both of u/eternalkerri's responses you linked to, but they seem to focus more on *why JFK conspiracies are impossibl*e, and less about *citing actual opinions from modern historians about the assassination*.  In other words, I'm more interested in a meta-analysis of what historians think. I'm assuming there have to be some good books and sources out there on this topic but I'm having trouble finding them.	1642772171.0	htlgt2y	t3_s8zk8u	t1_htjuk8v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8zk8u/is_there_a_consensus_among_modern_historians/htlgt2y/

8brve	The area of overlap — again, from my not-extensive reading of things (honestly, most of my understanding of the "state of field" comes from having been on three job searches relating to the history and philosophy of computing, and reading a lot of CVs) — is that there are many philosophers now interested in things like ethics of AI, but they are mostly pretty abstract or, if they are not abstract, are purely interested in software implementations. Whereas in the history of computing, most of the work so far has been on hardware issues, but there is starting to be a small but growing group focused on software. Those historians who work on software (and algorithms, etc.) do spend a lot of time talking and thinking about the ethical dimensions of it (and that's a lot of their motivation — algorithmic bias, for example). But that's only one possible approach the philosophical aspects of it.   I think one thing I'd note is that while there are a lot of younger scholars branching into this area, a) the job market is rough, and b) a lot of the work of younger scholars is trying to achieve success on that market, so it is tweaked towards topics that are broadly already known to people and could be adapted to several different kinds of jobs (e.g., algorithmic bias is both "hot" and could be the way into several types of positions). I think in another decade or so we'll probably start to see a lot more variation as some subset of those scholars get comfortable and start working on less obvious, more risky things.	1642773675.0	htlk28h	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htju9sy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htlk28h/
2rzmr8ac	The answer is: flags.   Before Nelson's era, like in the 1600s, the English used a simple flag system.  *Fighting Instructions,* 1653. *Fighting Instructions* was a book of maritime tactics (21 in all), so there are only 2 pages dedicated to flag signaling in it I think.  I'm not sure the particulars, but it was something like a red flag meant attack, a blue flag meant retreat or follow me, etc.  This worked well enough when fleets were small and you only needed a few simple commands.    Over the next 100 years, they kept adding flags of different shapes and colors for more complex commands, and this got unruly.  The British Admiralty then adopted various codes; such as the Popham Code written by Admiral Popham around 1800.  This was sort of a visual flag code, and it allowed a fleet commander to spell entire words with flags.  So the infamous quote from Nelson at Trafalgar, "England expects that every man will do his duty", it was sent from ship to ship using a combination of flags in a flag code.  You can see a visual representation of that phrase here:  [https://sites.google.com/site/kidicrypt/poham-s](https://sites.google.com/site/kidicrypt/poham-s)  Note that even to signal the two letter word "do", you have to raise 3 flags.          Under the Popham code, there were 10 square colored flags and then some additional triangular penants.  There were about 1000 "words" and additionally any word could be spelled out letter-by-letter. Various combinations either represented a number, or a letter.   There were also codebooks (because the enemy could see your flags, too) and shortcuts; and each ship would have had identical codebooks and notes. These codebooks were sensitive military intelligence.   Also, you're probably aware of the phrase "ship of the line" and perhaps "crossing the T".  British doctrine at the time had warships usually going to battle in long lines.  That meant that a ship could really only see the ship directly in front of it when a fleet was in a long line.  So there was a long time lag between when the first ship ran up a flag signal and it was spotted by the 2nd, who then had to relay it to the third, etc.  Like the childhood game of "telephone," except that each ship had to raise somewhere between 3 and 27 flags to communicate a message.     At night they used lanterns hung from the masts or rear of the ship in various shapes to send signals. Later, ships adopted shuttered lights and used those to send code (and eventually Morse code) messages between ships at night.	1642773741.0	htlk7do	t3_s88vs3	t3_s88vs3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88vs3/how_would_have_a_naval_commander_in_the_19th/htlk7do/

m2k8u	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1642773929.0	htlkme5	t3_s9bb5g	t3_s9bb5g	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bb5g/are_there_any_examples_of_historical_figures_who/htlkme5/

And unfortunately we can't read his mind nor did he leave us some kind of extensive journals detailing his personal thoughts. So in the end all I can provide is the more or less official reasoning and what logical factors *may* have influenced this.     So Trotsky was, by far-and-away the biggest political rival to Stalin during effectively his entire tenure in office. It's pretty widely known that Lenin did not want Stalin to remain General Secretary and this meant that Trotsky was most likely to take the mantle of leadership in the party. Even once sidelined and forced into exile the fact still remained that Trotsky had probably the most "legitimate" claim to leadership of the Soviet Union, he merely lacked the skilled political maneuvering and friends in high places to make it a reality. But this was not a guaranteed constant. In exile Trotsky was basically defined by his near constant campaigning against Stalinism. While somewhat marginal compared to the influence of Stalin, it nonetheless represented the most notable opposition within the left to Stalin's near-monopoly in the communist sphere.     This was a large part of why Stalin wanted Trotsky dead already, to hopefully put an end to this leftist opposition to Stalinism. This motivation was likely exacerbated by Trotsky forming the Fourth International which was purposefully intended to be an alternative power-base for communists outside of the Stalin-led Comintern. While again the Comintern/Stalin still held decisively more power/influence than the 4th Intern/Trotsky, it did not mean that he was not still viewed as a threat. There's a variety of ways in which *potentially* the 4th Intern/Trotsky could throw a wrench into Stalin's plans or potentially even threaten his leadership of the Soviet Union. Whether or not they ever realistically could have done this is irrelevant, the fact of the matter as far as Stalin was concerned was that it was *possible*.     Notably in the Great Purges Stalin did not solely purge leftist/Trotskyists. He also purged rightists like Bukharin, Tomsky, and Rykov who had previously sided with him in his power struggles against Trotsky. Clearly Stalin was not above killing those he viewed as a threat, regardless of loyalties, politics, or even evidence. So why shouldn't he go out of his way to kill the person who was arguably the biggest threat to his rule. He killed plenty of notable Bolsheviks who did not publicly (or sometimes not even privately) criticize him or his rule, why shouldn't he kill a notable Bolshevik whose defining feature was criticizing him and trying to oust him from power? Not only that, but Trotsky was also, arguably, only second-to Lenin in terms of notable Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution and Civil War. We're talking about a seriously famous and influential figure, he may be exiled and erased from the history books, but he was certainly not *forgotten* by most anyone in the USSR.     So the crux of your question seems to me to be "Why was Stalin obsessed with killing him if he didn't realistically pose a big threat?" To which the answer, as best I could think of it, is that *to Stalin* Trotsky was the biggest threat. Even if he was not at present able to render much of a threat the fact remained that he *could* at some point in the future, and had already gone much further in organizing an anti-Stalin movement than arguably anyone else. So if Stalin was in the process of eliminating any and all threats to his rule (which he was) then Trotsky is a natural target.     I would recommend "Stalin: A New Biography of a Dictator" by Oleg Klevniuk for info on Stalin and his reign over the Soviet Union.  You could also read Trotsky's own words on the subject in ["Stalin Seeks My Death"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1940/05/stalin.htm) Where he explains basically what I did here: Stalin viewed the exile as a mistake and that Trotsky could still organize an opposition to his rule even from abroad and this had to be put to an end as soon as possible.	1642774016.0	htlktca	t3_s8xv1f	t3_s8xv1f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8xv1f/why_was_stalin_so_obsessed_with_assassinating/htlktca/

nz52j	> I don't agree with you that the historians are "furious",   Well, one of them is. To quote the linked article:  > “Het is waanzin om zo’n ernstige beschuldiging te baseren op iets wat iemand zegt gehoord te hebben, in het kader van zijn eigen berechting. Dat is flinterdun bewijs voor dit verhaal. Schokkend gewoon.” [...] “Ik kan mij hier echt over opwinden.”  - Bart van der Boom, lecturer at Leiden university.   My translation: "It is madness to base such a serious accusation on something someone claims to have heard, in the context of his own trial. That is paper-thin evidence for this story. Just shocking." [...] "I get truly worked up about this."  That sounds fairly furious to me. (Van der Boom did much of his research on the Jewish Council that features in this theory.)  But other reactions I've seen are much more measured, and indeed did include praise for finding the transcript of the original anonymous note, as well as more critical remarks.	1642775275.0	htlnoer	t3_s65cqd	t1_ht5vauc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s65cqd/what_is_the_current_consensus_on_recent_articles/htlnoer/
9i89m	Think of a village of 100, a fixed population, and not much traffic in and out of either goods or people. There's one baker, and he keeps the place supplied with bread. A worker trained in his shop sets up shop, and suddenly there's competition for the market of 100 bread eaters. First , prices are lowered, until both bakers are barely getting by. Then one baker begins to throw sawdust into the flour, make loaves just a tiny bit smaller. That doesn't work, so he sends his relatives to attack and smash up the other bakery. In the process, bread becomes terrible and often unavailable, and the village is divided into supporters of one or the other bakers. A  baker with a larger shop  miles away hears about this, and begins loading up a wagon with bread twice a week and sending it into the village: now, both of the village bakers are in trouble. Medieval trades tended to concentrate: Frankfurt had books, Nuremberg had metalworkers. Competition in a large city simply magnified all these problems.  It's to avoid all of these problems that guilds were created. They would be definitely a kind of cooperative: they would try to maintain a minimum price, and in their later forms could also provide services to their members- like, making sure they had a proper burial if they died, loaning them money for materials and supplies, providing a network for obtaining and assessing apprentices, journeymen. They would typically get a charter from the local ruler or government granting them the exclusive right to practice that trade in that town, and to get that charter they would argue the need to maintain quality standards. When for example, in the 16th c. the gunmakers in London applied for a charter, to be separate from the blacksmiths guild, they pled that imperfect barrels were being made that were dangerous, and there was a need for regulation by trained gunsmiths. After getting the charter, they were in charge of proofing barrels- testing them to make sure they were safe. At a time when government was quite limited, guilds provided a way to regulate a lot of the economy without having bureaucrats.  Guilds would also be social. This was a world filled with hierarchies, and guilds had their own. They would celebrate religious holidays or have feasts. There were some guilds that went out of existence as trade groups and simply because prestigious civic organizations like the Worshipful Company of Bowyers.  There was once a common belief that guilds discouraged technological innovation. This is not quite true- there are examples ( like the watchmakers of Geneva) where innovation happened with the support of the guild. But under it all was very much the medieval notion of a fixed market in one place: only so much room in the village for a baker. The industrial revolution changed all that, but , even before, as trade increased and technology improved, guilds had a harder and harder time being relevant. The Gunmakers Guild might have sway over all the guns made in London, but someone there could simply get a gun made somewhere else. The London gunmakers also would be able to load their guns onto ships and send them to distant markets. Paris watchmakers would out-compete English watchmakers, Geneva watchmakers out-compete Paris watchmakers, and watchmakers next door in the Jura would provide cheaper watches than Geneva. As economies became more international, markets more reachable and it was possible to production centers to move, guilds became more irrelevant.	1642775397.0	htlnyog	t3_s8t6ju	t3_s8t6ju	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8t6ju/maybe_a_rather_basic_question_but_what_were/htlnyog/
itaexggd	Your critique of my diction "shitty" is valid. I see now how it was sloppy.   I've thought long and hard about where our disagreements in the second point lie. I think it is because I'm talking about "science" as an institution that is composed of humans. You are talking about "science" purely as a methodology. When I say "science has a tendency to regard animals as mindless automata", I mean that scientists have a [bias](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36722977-underbug) to try to model animals as automata, even when that is not the best approach. When I say "science...may have contributed to animal abuse", I mean that the [way](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128092651/conceptual-breakthroughs-in-ethology-and-animal-behavior) scientists conduct science - in combination with other societal features - may have contributed to animal abuse.	1642775634.0	htloimy	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htlfhc1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htloimy/

8brve	All you need to track a solar year is some way of keeping track of how high the Sun rises and its movement over the course of the year. Which is nothing more complicated than a stick in the ground that casts a shadow (a gnomon), or even just a rock with a hole in it that you can view from a consistent angle from day to day (Stone Henge has alignments like this). Given the importance of the solar year to things like the seasons, and given the importance of the seasons to many aspects of prehistoric cultural and material existence, there are many reasons to suspect that this is a genuinely prehistoric thing and probably was figured out by many different people over many different periods of time. Certainly many prehistoric structures and artifacts display an awareness of equinoxes, solstices, and so on, which are exactly this phenomena.	1642777422.0	htlswhn	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htfa880	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htlswhn/

jt30f	I've discussed that question a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lrtsho/why_did_japan_believe_that_the_united_states/), but to summarise: there was absolutely a voice within Japan that called for occupying Southeast Asia without attacking the United States, but such a move was politically impossible within Japan, due to the Navy's desire to turn the Army's desired Southern Operation to its advantage.   The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had spent much of its existence fighting the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) for standing within Japan, first as a co-equal branch of the military, and--later on--for shares of resources. The IJN had--in particular--wanted an increased share of national resources (including defense budgets and portions of national steel production) for construction of an increasingly powerful fleet. At the same time, some officers in the IJA General Staff had wanted those same resources invested in building up Japan's domestic industrial base in the hopes of establishing an autarkic state in preparation for a potential war with the Soviet Union. However, the outbreak of the war in China changed the situation dramatically. What was supposed to be a quick sharp war to cow Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government and secure Japanese access to the resources of northern China evolved into a long, drawn out war that was rapidly consuming the very same resources IJA General Staff had wanted to be invested into developing the industrial base.  As with everything involving Japan in the late 1930s and early 1940s, nearly everything comes back to the war in China. The IJA sought several routes in an attempt to force the Nationalists to the negotiating table. First, by destroying Nationalist armies in the field, then by occupying the Nationalist economic heartland in the Lower Yangtze, and--when neither of those options brought Chiang to the negotiating table--the IJA ultimately identified foreign aid to China as the lifeline which sustained the Chinese war effort. Thus, the IJA began seeking out ways to cut off that foreign aid, by occupying remaining ports in Southern China, occupying northern Indochina (to cut the Haiphong-Yunnan Railway), and placing diplomatic pressure on the West. However, at the same time, the United States--which strongly disapproved of Japanese aggression in Asia--had been placing economic pressure on Japan in an effort to curtail Japanese activities. With the outbreak of the war in Europe, the Japanese sensed an opportunity in Southeast Asia to simultaneously seize the vital resources present there, but also to drive out the Western imperial powers, cutting off China from external aid, and thus--hopefully--bringing the war in China to an end on Japanese terms.   Interestingly, it was the IJA that began seriously pressing for a Southern Operation aimed at occupying Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. The IJA particularly was interested in doing so *without* expanding the war to include the Americans, but the IJN strenuously objected to this. There were a multitude of reasons for the Navy's objection, but first and foremost was a desire to use the Navy's support for the Army as a bargaining chip in internal political struggles for shares of national resources. The IJN had long justified its existence by pointing and comparing itself to the U.S. Navy. With the Army now interested in a southern operation, the Navy sensed an opportunity. The Navy insisted that war with British and the Dutch would have to mean war with the United States as well, and that if Japan was to go to war with the U.S. then the IJN would need both the resources and time for a massive building operation. While the Navy did not think it would be ready to challenge the U.S. fleet, the IJN was prepared to use the developing situation to its advantage by demanding major concessions from the IJA in exchange for support--concessions that it would not be able to demand if the war target did not include the United States. The Navy justified this position in a multitude of ways (which I discuss more in the above linked post), including highlighting the threat that American forces in the Philippines could pose to Japanese supply lines from the East Indies, but--ultimately--the inevitability of war with the United States was simply the stated view of the Navy. If the Army wanted the Navy's concurrence and support to carry out the Southern Operation, they would have to concede.   So, to answer your question: yes, there absolutely was a voice in Japan that called for only launching an attack against the British and Dutch, avoiding war with the United States, especially within the Army. However, the IJN had pre-determined that war with the United States was necessary, because the threat of the U.S. Navy was how the IJN had justified its own demands for increased funding. The IJN thus played for a larger share of Japan's domestic resources by making war with the U.S. a precondition for its support of the Army's hoped for Southern Operation.	1642778165.0	htlusld	t3_s8yukr	t3_s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/htlusld/

685yd	Just two observations regarding beeswax. Burning beeswax has an extremely intense smell. It would probably be difficult to significantly alter the characteristics.   I would think the easiest way to sent candels in older times would be by using oils that themselves had been used in liquid extraction of scent from whatever was desireble. However adding oil to wax would lower the melting point of the wax. Wikipedia gives the melting point of beeswax at 62 - 64 C. I believe that lowering their melting point much more would result in loss of physical integrity particularly when several candels where litt close to each other.  Question: In looking for why the church preferred bees wax have there been any references to the beeswax candels having an incense like function?	1642778449.0	htlviqp	t3_s8yzy9	t1_htkjx5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htlviqp/

47g7nn0v	It’s very possible that there are things like that we haven’t discovered yet, that’s what makes archaeology so exciting!   New sites are being discovered all the time, such as the mosaic of Achilles recently discovered in a farmer’s field in England. The mosaic wasn’t created in isolation—who knows what might be hiding in the area if the owners were to let the whole field be dug up?  Unfortunately, as you mention, not everything is as simple as excavating an open field. An example I like to bring up is Alexandria in Egypt which faces quite a few problems when it comes to this. First, the modern city is built directly on top of the Ancient one which makes it immensely difficult to find enough space and money to dig it up. The Citadel of Qaitbay was built on the ruins of the lighthouse and is in and of itself an object of important cultural heritage so the chances of a lighthouse excavation are nothing.   Another problem is that much of the ancient city is currently underwater, and would take an immense amount of time, effort, and money to make accessible. In recent years, the city has taken a great deal of interest in these underwater sections and made a big announcement for an underwater museum several years ago but have yet to actually do anything.   So, to answer your question, a huge possibility. There could be a manuscript containing the entire rest of the Iliad lurking somewhere. The trouble is actually getting to a point where you could find it.	1642778757.0	htlwbll	t3_s99g43	t3_s99g43	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99g43/whats_the_actual_possibility_that_there_are_still/htlwbll/
8za88	> unarguably one of the best medium tanks of the war.  I'll argue it. Cramped as all hell and was a dead end design, the last of a long line of Christie cruisers. The front line service life of the tank was extremely short, being replaced in short order by the far superior Centurion as soon as they could be built. The only saving grace was that the 77mm didn't suffer the same SVDS accuracy problems as 17pr, so at least the gun was reasonable (Which is in itself interesting as the projectiles were identical), but at that, you still get more 'bang' for out of a slightly (not much) less cramped Sherman Firefly.	1642779094.0	htlx7lt	t3_s89fqq	t1_htfnuco	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htlx7lt/
14m5kd	Oh boy James Bond! It's a pretty simple question to answer so upfront I'll just say: No there was not any kind of significant controversy surrounding the films portrayal of the Japanese as stalwart allies of the Western powers in the Cold War. And the reason for this is simple: they were our allies.     But that's a little boring on its own so I'll go into a bit more detail: Effectively at the end of WW2 occupation of the Axis powers and their territories were split between the Allied powers largely according to pre-made agreements at Yalta for territory and spheres in Europe. In Asia however the occupation zones and spheres were much more haphazard. The sudden entry of the USSR into the Pacific war threw a wrench into things that was not entirely anticipated. This led to the division of Korea, played a large role in the changing tide of the Chinese Civil War, and subsequently a realignment of the political order or East Asia. Unlike Germany however, the occupation of Japan was not split between East and West (not counting South Sakhalin which was incorporated directly into the USSR). Japan was solely occupied by the Western powers and particularly the United States.     The United States occupation of Japan had an issue with shifting goal posts. Firstly they wanted to stabilize the country and ensure a smooth transition to peacetime occupation. This involved an influx of grains and milk to combat the near-famine that Japan was experiencing and the disarmament of its massive military (which was not entirely successful as some small portions of the Japanese military stayed overseas frequently to participate in ongoing conflicts like the first Indochina war or the Chinese Civil War). Part of this goal included banning Japan from waging war at all, this is a clause still enshrined in the Japanese constitution and remains controversial, though it is still a largely popular clause in Japan today. It also included punishing those who had set up the militarist government and hopefully reforming Japanese institutions to make them less militarist or at least less capable of militarism.     However the rapidly developing Cold War meant that certain ideals would have to be brushed aside and certain steps would have to be taken to help make Japan a strong, western-aligned power in East Asia. This was represented in the "Reverse Course" wherein the US policy shifted to focus on strengthening Japan rather than punishing it. To this end, some figures who likely should have faced charges for war-crimes and crimes against humanity were let off the hook. Notable examples would include Nobusuke Kishi (known colloquially today as the "Monster of the Showa Era") who ran Manchuria with an iron fist, taking slaves by the tens of thousands and profiting heavily off the opium trade to finance his lavish lifestyle. He would later become Prime Minister of Japan from 1957-1960 and is the grandfather of recent prime minister Shinzo Abe. A more controversial "pardon" would be Emperor Hirohito, whose role and agency in the war are incredibly controversial topics in Japan today. Simply put: many figures of the Statist era would be reintegrated into the reformed Japanese government because they were either useful or expedient for the rapidly developing anti-soviet needs of US foreign policy.      With the victory of the Communists in China and the outbreak of the Korean War the US now was in a position wherein a militarily strong Japan was desirable. So a rearmament of Japan began, in a way that was still suitable to correspond with Article 9 (anti-war article). This is why today Japan has the eighth largest military budget despite not officially being able to declare war, in keeping with this the Japanese military is known as the "Self Defence Force". This military was formed in 1954, shortly after the end of occupation, but the basis of it originates from the start of the Korean War wherein the Japanese formed a "National Police Reserve" of tens of thousands of "police" with small arms.     So this was all done to make Japan into a strong economic and military power for the Cold War, a shift that was rapid and went against the grain of wartime rhetoric. But with the emergence of what was now being portrayed as an even greater threat (The Communists) it was not particularly hard to publicly justify this rapid pivot of opinion towards the Japanese. Indeed this is a recurring theme throughout the Cold War, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And it was not much more difficult to shift public opinion in favor of Japan than it was to shift public opinion against them during the war. There was now a great enemy threatening the US, and the Japanese were among the first and best defencive lines against them.     Thus in Cold War culture and spy films, the Japanese could effectively be portrayed as sort-of "the good guys" of Asia. They were the strongest allies to NATO in the region in terms of their economy, military, and politics and that was far more important than what "some crazy generals" did a few years ago.     For more reading a good general history would be "A Modern History of Japan" by Andrew Gordon.

The doctrine was official and in Pu36, but the training regulations of 1937 didn't even try to implement it.	1642779219.0	htlxjgp	t3_s89fqq	t1_htg0pln	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htlxjgp/

The official top speed was still a slow 15mph, same as Matilda II, but the vehicle had a lot of power reserves so didn't lose speed for obstacles or even curves. Combine with it being one of the most reliable British tanks to come out, and a unit of the things could get from A to B remarkably quickly compared to the expectations put out by tanks like Matilda II or A13.	1642779477.0	htly7sb	t3_s89fqq	t1_hthv8tg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s89fqq/was_the_britains_infantry_tank_doctrine_in_wwii/htly7sb/

yfege	* *Tampa Tribune*, 1954: "Mrs. Beulah Walker, 65, was arrested by City Detectives yesterday in connection an abortion on a 23-year-old woman. Police said the operation was performed with rusty wires broken from old coat hangers." * *The Shreveport Journal*, 1970: "Some women destroy not only the fetus but also themselves in attempting self-abortion. Coat hangers, umbrella ribs and knitting needles have been used. SO has a goose quill dipped in turpentine." * *Pub-Med*, 1993: "The self-induced abortion had been attempted with a coat hanger ... The reason for the attempt was lack of money for a therapeutic abortion."   Which is to say: yes. It's important to know, though, a wire hanger represented more than just a tool used to provide an abortion, it was used by activists to represent several of their core arguments for legalizing abortion: the desperation and risk created by anti-abortion laws. (I've used spoiler tags when quoting medical professionals or historians talking or writing about specific details related to illegal or unsafe abortions.)  ##A Symbol of Desperation  A wire coat hanger is an ubiquitous item, found in nearly every home and is easily recognizable to people of all genders. It's also a tool that could fulfill the basic function of an abortion - emptying the contents of a uterus. In effect, the image says, "imagine how desperate you'd have to be to put this inside your body?" The goal of this messaging was to make it plain that keeping abortion illegal didn't stop abortion - it just made desperate people more desperate. (More on the history of anti-abortion laws [here in this Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qkdhi8/megathread_roe_v_wade_and_abortion_in_america/) we did in December.)   The humble wire hanger served as a physical representation of that desperation and was used in all sorts of ways, including as [early clip art as seen in the header of this 1971 article](https://imgur.com/a/Sg0ZTH6) about a planning meeting for a national women's conference later that year. One of the participants, a founding member of the *[Women vs. Connecticut] project, (https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/womenvsconnecticut.html)* movement, Doctor Barbara Roberts, spoke about the desperation she saw:  > I have seen atrocities during medical school and in hospitals. >!I have seen a woman with half her bowel hanging out of her vagina from a criminal abortion. I've seen women in hospitals drunk, drug addicted, suicidal. I've seen battered and burned babies in morgues and emergency rooms. I have seen hysterical women in my own office...!< we must fight the sanctimonious friends of the fetus... the only good abortion law is no abortion law.   This desperation, though, wasn't felt equally by everyone seeking an abortion. Those with social and economic capital could usually acquire a safe one. A trustworthy personal doctor might manufacturer a health risk and recommend a hospital abortion (where the pregnant person may or may not be turned away, usually depending on the person working the admissions desk) or the person could pay a provider who was known to be safe and trustworthy. Networks such as *The Jane Collective* were formed to connect as many people seeking abortions as possible with providers who followed medical sanitation and were discrete, but even though they worked to keep the costs affordable, such solutions had other costs - time away from work and family, possibility of others finding out, travel costs, etc. Meanwhile, even if someone could find a safe abortionist they could trust to be discrete, the illegal nature of the service meant there was a power imbalance. from Leslie Reagan's foundational book, *[When Abortion Was a Crime](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520216570/when-abortion-was-a-crime)*:   > Some abortionists took advantage of their clients’ vulnerability in this increasingly secretive situation to sexually harass and exploit them. These men equated abortion with sexual availability and tried to turn their patients into prostitutes. >!One woman, who had an illegal abortion in the mid-1950s after being raped, recalled the humiliation she felt when the abortionist remarked, “ ‘You can take your pants down now, but you shoulda’—ha!ha!—kept’em on before.’ ” When he finished the abortion, for which he charged $1,000, he offered to return $20 if she would give him “a ‘quick blow job.’ ” Other abortionists insisted on a trade: sex for abortion. When one sixteen-year-old was propositioned, she walked out.!<   ##A Symbol of Risk  The wire coat hanger is not surgical equipment. They're often made of bare metal - uncoated. People who could afford to pay someone else to perform the abortion might be able to reduce the amount of risk they faced, but not always. Those who couldn't , had to make do with whatever they had access to:   > When domestic efforts to produce an abortion failed, pregnancies progressed and the danger of later instrumental abortions increased. Many women ended up in hospital emergency rooms. Some ended up in morgues. >!Dr. Maximillian Herzog, a professor of pathology at the Chicago Policlinic, asserted in 1900 that “by far the largest number of criminal abortions” were induced by women taking abortifacients, which caused hemorrhaging. Some women mixed their own home remedies.! One Chicago woman told of applying a mustard plaster to her abdomen to induce an abortion. Women employed a wide array of instruments found within their own homes to induce miscarriages, including knitting needles, crochet hooks, hairpins, scissors, and button hooks. One physician testified that patients at Cook County Hospital in Chicago used hairpins and cotton balls to irritate the cervix and induce abortions. A domestic servant resorted to using a bone stay out of her corset to induce a miscarriage. A farm woman used a chicken feather. Dr. G. D. Royston, who interviewed patients at a St. Louis dispensary in 1917, reported that “introduction of catheters, crochet needles, etc., by the patients themselves are first in frequency."... !<  Other medical providers reported that douching with soap or bleach was one common and frequently fatal method used by women trying to self-induce abortions. One man who worked at a hospital said he saw:   > >!... young women coming to the hospital who had taken pills or been “injected with lye” to induce abortions... Some aborted themselves with instruments found at home, including the now infamous coat hanger. One woman described taking ergotrate, then castor oil, then squatting in scalding hot water, then drinking Everclear alcohol. When these methods failed, she hammered at her stomach with a meat pulverizer before going to an illegal abortionist.!<  Finally, the wire coat hanger represented one of the central arguments behind anti-abortion laws: bodily autonomy. By using the coat hanger as a symbol, not only could activists speak to desperation and risk, they could represent the idea that regardless of the law or any possible punishment, people who are pregnant who do not want to be pregnant will do whatever it takes to end that pregnancy. This central idea, that we have the right to control how our body is used is reflected in the coat hanger as an activist symbol. That even when lawmakers and the government goes to great lengths to force a pregnant person to stay pregnant, they will do what they need to do to maintain control over how their body is used.   ___  Modern day update: It's important, I think - especially this weekend, the 49th anniversary of *Roe v. Wade* - to dip a bit into modern politics. Reproductive justice advocates began moving away from the imagine of the wire hanger as a way to represent self-induced abortions in the early 2000s, as medical abortions became safer and more affordable. Currently, a pregnant person who no longer wants to be pregnant can self-induce a medical abortion by taking a combination of two commonly-available gynecological medications, provided they learn of the pregnancy early enough.

7j3q5	The main thing is that Carthage couldn't.  They suceeded once (in 215, under Bomilcar) by sea, and tried several more times by Land - though the Romans successfully intercepted the reinforcing Army and defeated them (Metaurus River, in 207, and Insubria, in 203 - though notably, this was just a landing in Liguria, not a complete overland march across the alps.)  The first thing to consider is the strategic situation - there are ultimately two ways to get from Carthaginian territory to Italy, by Sea, or by overland via Carthaginian Spain, through Transalpine Gaul (Southern France), across the Alps, into Cisalpine Gaul  (Northern Italy/Po Valley) and then into the Italian Peninsula.  In normal circumstances, it is relatively easy to sail across the Mediterranean from Carthage to Rome.  However, during wartime, this is extremely difficult, and transports always are extremely vulnerable to hostile warships.  To get around, this you could escort them with warships - but Classical warships have an extremely limited operational range - they were very compact, and there was very little room on board other than for the rowers.  This meant that these warships could only spend a few days at sea before having to pull into land to restock/resupply.  Enough to sail from, say, Carthage to Sicily, or Carthage to Sardinia, but not enough to go all the way from Carthage to the Italian Peninsula and still fight at the end.  Rome won control of Sicily during the First Punic War, and stole Sardinia during a Mercenary revolt a few years later.  This meant that to get a fleet to Italy, Carthage would need to take one or the other.  While Carthage would make several attempts to attack Sardinia and Sicily (including supporting Syracuse during its revolt against Rome), they were ultimately unsuccessful, due to the local Roman naval superiority.  The other option, which is the one Hannibal (and eventually his brothers Hasdrubal and Mago took), was to do the overland route.  Hannibal managed this in 218 after capturing the Roman-allied city of Saguntum.  Hasdurbal and Mago would also eventually make this trip, over a decade layer - which is where we need to look at  Rome is doing outside Italy.   On his way to the Alps, Hannibal had bypassed a Roman army sent to intercept him on the Rhone, near Marseille,  under Publius Cornelius Scipio (The to-be Scipio Africanus's father) and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio (Africanus's uncle).   Publius sent the army on to Rome under Gnaeus, while he went back to Italy (to get wounded at the Ticinus, before rejoining his brother with reinforcments in 216).  During its time, this army, with its accompany navy, defeated the Carthaginian Fleet in Spain (Battle of the Ebro) and secured a foothold on the Northeast Spanish coast around Tarraco (modern Tarragona).  This therefore blocked the overland route from Spain to Italy.  This Roman presence was a major nuisance, and had even caused the diversion of a fleet intended to support Hannibal to Spain instead.  While the Scipio brothers were defeated in 211, they were replaced by Scipio the Younger (not Africanus yet), who had even more success in Spain (though notably, one of his victories, at Baecula, let Hasdrubal slip away to the North, which is how he ends up in Italy in 207 to get smashed by Nero and Livius at the Metaurus)  Some resources here:  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44079847.pdf](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/44079847.pdf) Steinby, C.

qrcu9	The year is 1380. A storm is gathering in Kulikovo. To face off against the innumerable heathen Tatar hordes are the 1.3 million noble knights of Muscovy and her allies, led by Prince Dmitry, whose glorious victory in this battle would have him go down in history forever as Dmitry Donskoy, or in English, Dmitry of the Don. Kulikovo is where the Russian nation has born, where the shattered heathen would never more dare steal from the righteous folk and their lands.  ...  If that sounds like a tall tale, you're on point dear reader. The caprices of High Medieval chronicling aside, the rise of Muscovy was not outlined by setpiece battles or daring acts of defiance. Indeed, many attempts from various Russian princes met negative results ranging from inconvenient to disastrous; more often the latter. In such an environment, Muscovy did not rise through acts of heroism, but through patience and... trade. And so, while Kulikovo was not an insignificant battle, we must go back further, before we can understand in what way it mattered, and what came after.  The Rus peoples' trial with the Tatars go further back than Muscovy, which itself was a vassal principality in a then insignificant part of modern Russia, little more than a trading settlement along a tribituary of a tribituary of the Volga. So for such a dark horse canditate to rise, you might be thinking that several things might have had to go right, and you'd be correct.   Muscovy was in luck for three reasons:  The first of these reasons was that the Mongol invasion and the subsequent, almost habitual razing of Rus centers of population and trade meant that the old centers of gravity for Rus culture no longer held their importance. Muscovy itself was also pillaged and set to torch in this period, but, owing to its remote position, and not much wealth and significance to begin with, it emerged relatively unscathed. From here on came the second reason for Muscovy's rise.  Muscovy had a series of wise princes; under the Tatar yoke, a prince had to be wise or he would not last long at all. The most significant one in the build-up to the Battle of Kulikovo, and the one I want to talk about, is Ivan I of Moscow, or as his pals and debtors called him, Ivan Kalita, or in English, Ivan the Moneybag. [Now I've talked about Kalita a bit in another question,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pamfct/comment/ha7itai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but to repeat myself, Kalita, after witnessing the execution of three of his predecessors for either insubordination or being victims of court intrigue at the hands of Öz Beg Khan, decided the best way to keep his head was to keep it down, avoid any military adventurism, and above all, pay his tribute in time and in full. To achieve this, he had to build a strong economy resilient to the usual adversities an agriculture-taxation based economy would have in the geographical conditions of Russia, and so he prioritized the promotion and expansion of trade and a vibrant city life, one that counted on a large and concentrated population. To achieve this, he purchased captured slaves from his Tatar overlords, invited refugees, and resettled people in his lands. Using these riches he was able to gather through his shrewd management of the economy as well as excellent diplomacy with his overlords (he managed to convince them to allow hereditary succession for Muscovy so that his son could succeed him), he engaged in what's curtly described as loan sharking to peacefully take over the nearby lands of Russian rulers small and larger. His successful diplomacy, willful obedience and economic cunning made him the earliest identifiable figure in the Russian ascendancy, and expansion of Russian soft power through these peaceful means would remain the only successful and viable way for the next 150 years.  Now that last sentence there may be a bit of a spoiler, as Ivan, being Dmitry Donskoy's grandfather, reigned only 18 years before him, so Kulikovo can't have accomplished all that much if, quoting myself, nothing much could have been accomplished outside peaceful means in this time period. But before we get there, I want to get the third reason why Muscovy was lucky out of the way:  The Golden Horde, the friendly neighborhood Mongol Empire remnant, had high levels of infighting. Now, any medieval polity had infighting, but nothing brought a people together than being subjugated by another, and nothing led to as much infighting as being a martially inclined society with few external opponents but several claimants, each of whom could muster massive armies. Kalita's rule saw Muscovy more or less subsume every significant Russian principality with the notable exceptions of Novgorod and her periphery, and the parts of Ukraine and Belarus which were conquered by the Poles and Lithuanians instead (not yet together, these were separate conquests and the two nations wouldn't come together until a hundred years from then on). So, Muscovy had grabbed all there was to grab, was slowly extracting concessions through obedience and timely payment of taxes, and their overlord was essentially having a crisis on every succession. All Muscovy really had to do, at this point, was to bide their time, and wait for the Golden Horde to crumble on its own.  In 1359, the Khan was killed, and the Golden Horde erupted into civil war. The Khan's son-in-law, a Warlord known as Mamai, played the role of a kingmaker in this time, and consolidated his control over a part of the horde. After a few Khans, he briefly installed his own wife as the Khanum, whom was replaced later with another puppet. So it is fair to say that he was the ruler of the Golden Horde in this period, though his hold would have been tenuous given that he was not a descendant of Genghis Khan, but simply someone who married one of his descendants. After Mamai consolidated enough power, he decided to punish Dmitry, who had refused orders from him to give up the throne of Vladimir. In 1378, this culminated in the Battle of Vozha River, which Dmitry won. Gathering a larger force, it would be in 1380 that the Battle of Kulikovo, the one I led with, would be fought. This was a larger battle with nevertheless indeterminate numbers; the million and change I led with is from a medieval source that is more dramatic than historical (as sources of the period wont to be), and the more likely number is far less than 100.000 on the Muscovite side. Nevertheless, Kulikovo was won, and it was significant; it was the first major victory of Moscow and is considered to have hinted the Tatar decline.   Unfortunately for Dmitry, the decline hadn't come fast enough. The defeat of Mamai in Muscovite hands made Tokhtamysh the undisputed ruler of the Golden Horde, who, after defeating Mamai handily in a battle, moved on to sack Moscow in 1382, and force Dmitry to once again give his oath of loyalty as a vassal. Does this mean all of this had been for nothing? Of course not! Dmitry's son, Vasily I, would be the first Grand Duke of Muscovy to accede to the throne without permission from the Golden Horde, and the Tatar hold would continue to decline over the next 100 years up to the Stand on the Ugra River, which, if such things are reasonable to have in the context of history, was the point at which it can be said that Muscovy was practically no longer under Tatar suzerainty. Between Kulikovo and the Stand (called as such because two armies met but retreated without a fight), Moscow was of course burned by Khans more than once, so it's difficult to say that things moved along in an entirely linear fashion. But the progress was there, and, though it took time, Muscovy went on to emerge as the dominant Russian principality.	1642780193.0	htm02yo	t3_s8r5cx	t3_s8r5cx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5cx/out_of_the_all_the_various_rus_princedoms_why_was/htm02yo/

tte85	It's hard to argue whether a calculated risk that doesn't work out was a good decision or not. Do you focus on the outcome, or what might have happened in fact, or what might have happened based on the information the actor had at the time? As a silly example, if someone offers you a coin toos bet where you have to win 2 out of 3, but have 10 to 1 odds, the good decision is to take that bet. Even if you lose, which you likely will, taking the bet was still a good decision (probably, depending on how much you wager).  Pearl Harbor ddn't work out for the Japanese's benefit in any way, but can't it be argued that it **could have**, and that the risk was worth it? They underestimated the risk, and it was never likely to succeed, but it was also the only possible path to the outcome they wanted and there were reasons to think it could possibly succeed.	1642779192.0	htlxgy9	t3_s8r0wm	t1_hti11bo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htlxgy9/

9c89xxn	As I said, perhaps early scientific theories did lead to some animal abuse. But I think it gives science too much credit, for both good and bad.  In the 1890's when Morgan proposed his "canon", flogging was still legal punishment for crimes, public hangings were common and often regarded as festive events to bring wives and family. Cockfighting, dog fighting, bear baiting were officially banned, but widespread as a semi-tolerated vice, often involving significant betting activity.  We have come from medieval torture dungeons, drawings and quarterings, beheadings and disembowelings, to a time when many countries have abolished capital punishment altogether, and even imprisonment is seen reformatory rather than punitive.  It seems a bit simplistic to me to ascribe the ill treatment of animals to Morgan's canon, when in fact society was much more tolerant of violence to both man and beast alike. Nor do I view the changes as some sort of progress of science, from a more brutish state towards enlightenment. There are numerous causes, including the democratization of society, affluence resulting from the industrial revolution which made hardship and deprivation less tolerable, the control of infectious diseases that made life less cheap than it used to be, the decline in birth rates, and a profusion of new ideas about the dignity of life. Just to mention a few. Science may be involved, but only incidentally.  I do not believe that animals were treated any better before Morgan's canon, or that it somehow made the situation worse. Perhaps it was used by some as justification for what they were already inclined to do, much as Darwin's theory led to "scientific racism". You could turn it the other way around and claim that science has in fact improved our behavior, shown us how violence does lasting damage to our mental health. Many countries banned corporal punishment of children in schools on such scientific grounds. But this would be simplistic too, I think.  I think such accounts are more in the nature of just-so stories we tell ourselves, conclusions we reach by starting from our biases and then cherry picking facts or explanations that tend to support them, ignoring the messy complexity all around.  >I mean that scientists have a bias to try to model animals as automata, even when that is not the best approach.  I am a neuroscientist by profession, and I don't know of any better approach. I don't believe in some immaterial soul or spirit, I think all we think or feel has a basis in physical, chemical, biological processes in the brain. Depending on which you turn off, people stop thinking, stop feeling, stop pretty much any mental activity they are capable of. True, there are many unanswered questions about cognitive phenomena, the nature of consciousness, the subjective experience of free will. But the answers are all there in the material of the brain, and we're trying to understand what there is in the nature of this "automata" that produces such things.  Not to get into philosophical arguments over determinism or not, this is pretty much how science proceeds.	1642781151.0	htm2lm3	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htloimy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htm2lm3/

mdu63	Really thank /u/LimesLemonsOranges for tagging me.    >In looking for why the church preferred bees wax have there been any references to the beeswax candels having an incense like function?    AFAIK there is no such a reference.    The majority of annotations ascribes this preference to the religious symbolism of bees' and bees wax as a sign of pureness in Christianity, rather than the symbolic meaning, rather than pragmatic concerns (Husberg 1994: 72-74). /u/wotan_weevil also pointed out the cultural tradition inherited from Roman one as another possible reason before in: [How did beeswax come to Europe in the Middle Ages?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/dh7bvw/how_did_beeswax_come_to_europe_in_the_middle_ages/)  It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that Catholic church in principle lifted the restriction of non bees wax candle for liturgical use, as also illustrated in [the classic entry of Catholic Encyclopedia (1907)](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01347a.htm)	1642781939.0	htm4ona	t3_s8yzy9	t1_htm0ct1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yzy9/how_valuable_or_expensive_were_candles_in/htm4ona/

bwnsx06	It is very unlikely that *entire* epic poems or other complete texts are lurking somewhere undiscovered, though not impossible. Ancient people largely used papyri or parchment scrolls, both of which are susceptible to degrade over time except in dry conditions. This is why so much papyri was found in Egypt. However, even the papyri found in Egypt were largely take from ancient "dumps" placed in a desert and were already fragmentary in nature. Practices of antiquities dealers like cutting up papyri or separating pages of codices to turn a higher profit also don't help this situation because manuscripts that were once larger or more intact are often separated today. Additionally, in the period when many papyri were initially excavated, the tactics were more "hit and run" than scientific, largely because, in addition to lax archaeological and cultural history standards, they were working against a rising water table (that would destroy the papyri) and the practice of harvesting *sebbakh*, a rich mud used for fertilizer in Egypt's exploding agricultural industry of the late 19th/early 20th century. *Sebbakh* was often found near archaeological ruins (which probably helped it be so rich) and was the type of soil in which papyri were often found. So while papyri fragments can still be found in Egypt, much of the material may have been destroyed even in the last 100 years due to environmental conditions and antiquities trafficking. There are certainly fragments of literary texts hiding in the huge collections of papyri in institutions and private collections around the world; usually the "flashiest" pieces are identified and published first, but there really is quite a bit of material to get through a limited number of people able to decipher these texts. So all in all, small pieces of ancient texts might be found, but it's unlikely that we find an entire collection.     It is true that archaeological methods are always improving, like with the Herculaneum scrolls. Techniques to read these charred papyri have allowed people to get at the texts without completely destroying them. That library mostly contains philosophic texts, not any epics. Another famous example from outside of Egypt are the Dead Sea Scrolls; these texts were mostly Hebrew Bible and Apocrypha. Both of these examples are from extraordinary archaeological contexts, one being the volcanically-preserved Herculaneum and the other being the Qumran desert caves. You are right to point out that many potential archaeological finds have been built over by succeeding generations. This is why the city of Rome has such a slow time of [expanding their subway system](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/22/630532760/romes-subway-expansion-reveals-artifacts-from-the-ancient-past)\--every time they dig to expand, they stop to consider the archaeological finds. So while there is a lot to be found under modern cities, it's not yet possible to unearth that material without a lot of destruction. Even if modern scholars could fully excavate anywhere they like, it's important to remember that the environmental strains of being under settlements (water, sewage, etc), in additional to the local weather, make it unlikely that fragile items like papyri or parchment would survive. Even if they did, it's unlikely they would survive to reveal anything in its entirety.  Sources  Davoli, Paola.

96gqp	The thing is that this was very much **not** the "only option" for Japan, and was in fact planned very late in the process (if one can call it that) of war planning for the IJN, with formal plans only starting in early 1941. During the interwar period (one should remember that Japan was allies with the Western powers in WWI), Japanese plans coalesced around a "decisive battle" in which a successful invasion of the Philippines would draw the American fleet west, to be attritted by Japanese long-range airpower and submarines, and then decisively defeated by large fast battleships. The Pearl Harbor attack as a pre-emptive strike against the fleet developed extremely late in strategic thinking, and was not in any way "necessary" -- one can imagine scenarios (as Japanese planners did) of simply attacking British or Dutch possessions in Borneo and Indonesia, and hoping the U.S. would stay out of the war; or of completing the invasions of Borneo, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines without the strike on Pearl Harbor.   For more reading on this, I would recommend David C. Evans and Mark Peattie, *Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887-1941*, and Peattie's follow-up volume *Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909-1941*.	1642783179.0	htm80l1	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htlxgy9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htm80l1/
a3bwx	The Continental Army didn't have to start from scratch, not entirely. The military system was quite a lot different from today's, and there was a built-in flexibility to take a people's military force from dormant to active by embodying the militia, and by recruiting regulars from the militia. This of course couldn't handle the full load of necessary recruitment, but it did help to ease the burden.  Early battles in the War for Independence were fought almost entirely by colonial militias and British regulars, and early, high-profile come-from-behind victories - or those that could be spun as victories - meant that there was a great deal of enthusiasm for the cause, which, while support had always been fairly high, waxed even more after Bunker Hill and the Siege of Boston. Before I get into mechanisms of recruitment, though, I want to speak to your point about *taking on a powerful empire with little hope of success*.  Men who looked to join the Continental Army didn't think of it that way. They saw their cause as *righteous*, it was about freedom from rhetorical slavery, about patriotism against brutal tyranny. The numbers looked bad on paper, but at the start of hostilities the British regulars were massively outnumbered even by the scattered patriot militias, and patriot forces, both militia and regular, typically maintained that numerical superiority throughout the war. It cost time and money and took a good deal of management to shift huge numbers of soldiers from England and other colonies into North America. It took naval superiority to disembark, support, and resupply them. So while one might have looked at numerical assessments of the strength of the empire, its actual ability to project that force was subject to a great deal of complexity. The patriot cause also had a rhetorical and philosophical advantage, which was itself a kind of irony: for all their rhetoric about brutal jackbooted tyranny, many patriots knew that righteous men in England would support them, and from the start, the War for Independence had some political allies even in British parliament. Their cause was *rational* and *righteous*, who but Providence might stand against them?  While most of the writing about the conflict from the patriot side comes from officers - whose perspective can be quite a bit different from enlisted men - there were some enlisted men who wrote about the war and their reasons for joining. Joseph Plumb Martin, one of the more well-known voices from the war, writes of his desire to "paint himself a soldier" in a humorous retelling:  > And notwithstanding I was told that the British army at that place was reinforced by 15,000 men, it made no alteration in my mind; I did not care if there had been 15 times 15,000, I should have gone just as soon as if there had been but 1,500. I never spent a thought about numbers; the Americans were invincible in my opinion. If anything affected me, it was a stronger desire to see them.  The numbers didn't matter. The cause was holy. Right was on their side. Patriots had already won several engagements, if anyone had believed British regulars invincible at the start of the war, they could be shown they were in error, even by the summer of '76.  All of which is to say that the reason many men joined was not simply because of pay, but because of a kind of patriotic fervor supposedly grounded in rational calculation and adherence to providence. If this sounds like it's an incoherent set of conflicting beliefs, it's because it is. Even Martin, whose reasons for joining were timelessly boyish - the desire for action and adventure, as well as patriotic ardor - describes vividly the appeal of cash bounties paid to enlistees when he first saw a recruiting station in a nearby town:  > I found most of the male kind of the people together; soldiers for Boston were in requisition. A dollar deposited upon the drumhead was taken up by someone as soon as placed there and the holder’s name taken, and he enrolled with orders to equip himself as quick as possible. My spirits began to revive at the sight of the money offered; the seeds of courage began to sprout; for, contrary to my knowledge, there was a scattering of them sowed, but they had not as yet germinated; I felt a strong inclination, when I found I had them, to cultivate them. O, thought I, if I were but old enough to put myself forward, I would be the possessor of one dollar, the dangers of war to the contrary notwithstanding.  To Martin, the cash bounty is connected irresistibly to the heroic cause. The sight of the recruitment bounty literally stirred the "seeds of courage" in him, and over the subsequent months he plots and schemes for a way to secure from his grandparents permission to join up. Eventually, he joined a regiment bound for New York on a six-month enlistment, hoping for "a primer" rather than the whole coat of paint. His enlistment is further encouraged by another omnipresent element of military recruitment: homosocial bonding. Martin runs into friends and acquaintances in town, all of them looking to go a-soldiering as well.   But for all his fervor, he hesitates when holding the pen to write his name on the papers. He makes several dry-runs, careful not to touch his pen to the paper, until another friend jostles his shoulder, and the nub scratches a line on the paper. "O, he has enlisted!" the man called. Martin then wrote his name fairly upon the paper and "now I was a *soldier*, in name at least, if not in practice."  This also shows us a little bit about how recruitment was actually done. There were a handful of more or less permanent recruitment offices. Samuel Nichols, the commander of the American marines, maintained an office throughout the war to recruit marines, and larger cities like Boston and Philadelphia maintained active recruitment stations as they could. But for the most part, recruitment was done as a sort of traveling show. An officer with a couple of senior non-commissioned officers would roll into town with a drummer and piper, play patriotic tunes as they marched down the street, and then set up shop at a convenient public place, usually on or near the commons or at a public house. As Martin described, the drum itself would become a sort of table and stage to display the cash bounties and sometimes even as a surface on which recruits could sign the articles. At various times during the war the enlistment bonus was increased to *far* more than the dollar that stirred the seeds of courage in young Martin - this became a problem for long-term veterans after a few years, because some of the enlistment bonuses were more than the already-enlisted soldiers were paid, and were especially hard to take when enlistment bonuses were handed to new soldiers and the veterans had their pay in arrears for *years* - but the promise of cash, right there and then, was a strong part of recruitment.  There's also a class element to recruitment. In a world where the political ideas were rooted in the community, the militia was looked upon as the more patriotic, balanced, laudable service, and the *regulars* were shifty, untrustworthy mercenaries who had to be motivated by *pay*. Rhetorical attacks against the British regulars often included the idea that the British regulars were automatons who had been beaten into an inhuman mechanical killers. To become a soldier was in some sense to surrender one's humanity for money. In this sense, it tended to be the young and impressionable - like Martin, who, remember, had a great anxiety over convincing his grandparents to give their permission for him to join - or the desperate or greedy. In later American conflicts, like the '98 crisis, when word got out that an army was being formed for a possible war with France, the secretary of the army's desk was flooded with *hundreds* of applications for the officer positions, but recruiting the enlisted men only ever attracted dozens.  And we should bear in mind that though the American Continental Army was molded into a very competent fighting force, the vast majority of fighting on both sides was done by militia. Patriot and Loyalist militias could embody quickly for a purpose and disband just as quickly, and their presence could make the difference in critical battles, such as at Saratoga, which is probably the rhetorical high point of the "minuteman" ideal.  So in answer to your last question, no, soldiering was not looked at as just another job. It was simultaneously a patriotic, adventuresome burden to bear for posterity and a righteous cause, and *also* an alluring, dangerous threat to the soul. The course of the War for Independence provided many different opportunities for men to serve, in violent capacities as well as non-violent, and joining up with the regulars was definitely not the only way to do so.  _____  I highly recommend reading Joseph Plumb Martin's memoir, it is a highly entertaining and emotional perspective on the conflict that's brimming with detail.

n4bht	That's really because there isn't a meta-analysis -- again, as I wrote, there are no serious historians who believe such.  If you're interested in the historiography of conspiracy theories, a pretty recent approach is  Conspiracy Theories and the People who Believe Them. (2018). United Kingdom: Oxford University Press.  although if you want to seriously study such things, you should step outside of the US-sphere, since conspiracy theories are quite a global phenomenon (you just don't hear about so many of the other local ones). One advantage to going global is it makes it easier to realize just how strange the perspective is; it's tempting if you are immersed in a culture to believe a sliver of some conspiracy theories, but when you start to learn about, say, South Africa believing Mandela died and was replaced by a clone double (as opposed to the Western theory of "some people went to an alternate universe"), it becomes more apparent that "believability" is simply being manufactured by culture. Try, for instance:  Roniger, L., Senkman, L. (2021). Conspiracy Theories and Latin American History: Lurking in the Shadows. United Kingdom: Taylor & Francis.  or one of my favorites to cite, the time in Java in 1999 there was a rash of "ninja-sorcerer" sightings causing 100+ people to get killed by people thinking they were witches.  Siegel, J. T. (2006). Naming the Witch. United States: Stanford University Press.	1642783999.0	htma9my	t3_s8zk8u	t1_htlgt2y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8zk8u/is_there_a_consensus_among_modern_historians/htma9my/

128xjc	Pretending for a moment that I have some expertise, I'd love a decent one about 17th century Canadian frontier. We kinda got one with the recent show Frontier but I wasn't super blown away. For a show about the fur trade it was just a fairly normal vengeance trope. Give me some Game of Thrones style political intrigue, but from the perspective of the Native American tribes. European explorers, fur trappers and missionaries are coming in but focus on the rest of the continent. No more pioneers and European armies battling it out.  Although on that topic, I'd also probably eat up a series on the War of 1812 and just how messy it could be.	1642785278.0	htmdqrn	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htmdqrn/

168sly	Oh this is actually an easy one.   HBO should make a season 2 of *Chernobyl* that covers the 1988 Gyumri earthquake in Armenia. Boris Shcherbina was in charge of the relief efforts in both so you even get to bring back Stellan Skarsgård.  Probably a series about the Russian Revolution/Civil War/basically World War I is long overdue, especially as the First World War has come back strong into popular memory, and the Russian Revolution needs to be placed back into that context (it long was treated as its own world historic event that WWI was a footnote/sideshow for). It would be very helpful to thread between being overtly anti- or pro-communist, which it seems like even contemporary films about the USSR really struggle to do (maybe *Chernobyl* comes closest but still falls into inaccurate tropes). I'm not even sure there has been a big Western film treatment of those events/period since *Dr. Zhivago* and *Reds*, except maybe the BBC *Zhivago* remake from 2002.	1642786207.0	htmgadd	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htmgadd/
4twq7	I remember reading somewhere that the US occupation of Japan lead to the American interest in sushi, anime, and Japanese culture in general, and the Japanese got a strong interest in baseball.

abfzitd7	>The grand flaw in Japanese plans, of course, was the assumption that an attack on, say, the Philippines would immediately send the American fleet on a crash course to a decisive battle, but it's also the only way in which the strategy would have worked.   It wasn't a flaw, it was part of American war plans like War Plan Orange that an attack on the Philippines would cause the US Fleet to steam across the Pacific thus playing into the Japanese hands.  This is why Pearl Harbor was such a big mistake for Japan; by forcing the Americans to rely on their carrier force it meant that there would be no steaming into decisive battle and instead a slow and methodical advance across the Pacific. As you point out, with no Pearl Harbor there would have been a limited war in the Pacific with unknown degree of public support for using American troops to protect European colonial possessions.	1642787092.0	htmipfo	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htlciyv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htmipfo/
96gqp	War Plan Orange was fairly continuously revised in the years leading up to Pearl Harbor, and while the American fleet was initially (say in the 1920s) committed to a full-scale retaliatory attack, planners and plans grew more nuanced as time went on and the importance of carriers (and/or the wildcard nature of carriers) became more known. The best book on the subject is probably still Edward Miller's *War Plan Orange: The U. S. Strategy To Defeat Japan, 1897-1945*; although I can't recommend it for entertaining reading, it is _highly_ detailed.	1642787863.0	htmkueh	t3_s8r0wm	t1_htmipfo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htmkueh/
14m5kd	The Baseball bit is absolutely true. Baseball is *huge* in Japan and notably is not a particularly popular or notable sport in the majority of countries outside North America. This was absolutely popularized through the occupation and spread like wildfire as a sort-of US sanctioned recreational activity. To this day Baseball is one of the most popular sports in Japan. So that bit is absolutely true.     As far as American interest in Sushi, anime, or Japanese culture. That's another story and much more complicated. The basic jist is that there has long been a fascination with Japanese culture in the Western world, dating all the way back from the opening of the country by Perry in the mid 19th century. There's even a term in the art world "Japonisme" for works and styles influenced by Japanese art and style which was incredibly popular in the later 19th century (even Van Gogh has several [paintings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Van_Gogh_-_la_courtisane.jpg) in a Japanese influenced style). This reflected a general western fascination with the country and east Asia in general. We would today know this as Orientalism. Even the secretary of war for the US in WWII: Henry Stimson, went on a honeymoon to Kyoto before the war. So there was a cultural fascination that had already existed around the world.     Sushi did not get popular in the US until long after the occupation, only really beginning to enter the mainstream of US cuisine in the 1980's (and even then was limited, mostly popular among travelling businessmen and rich/famous people, not something a family from New England would go get for dinner). It really entered mainstream popularity in the 21st century but I don't want to break the 20 year rule ;)     As for anime, anime as an industry largely did not exist prior to or even during the occupation, save for a few short films and one feature length propaganda film. The first anime tv series came about in the early 60's with things like Astro Boy and Gigantor. This would be about 10 years after the occupation ended. However these series would be broadcast in the United States in roughly the same time frame, of particular note was "Maha Go Go!" or as we know it "Speed Racer". So these three series would probably be the first major western exposure to Anime. But the popularity of anime would only start to emerge around the 80's with films like Akira and the advent of VHS tapes, though again this was still quite niche. The popularity of Anime in the US would only really explode with things like Toonami and specifically Dragon Ball Z in the late 90's and shortly after Disney purchasing the rights to Ghibli films. This basically overnight brought anime to a much wider audience than it had so far seen.     You'll note that both of these started to come to prominence in the 80's and later became popular in the 90's. This was an era in which the Japanese economy was booming and many in the US were anxious of the Japanese economy possibly overtaking our own (Japan was the second largest economy in the world by this point) and as such there was a new wave of both fascination with Japanese culture and a phobia of the Japanese. But this is all getting very far beyond the scope of the original question. In short: Baseball: yes. Sushi and anime: no.	1642787898.0	htmkxyb	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmgbg5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htmkxyb/

14m5kd	It's mentioned a little in some other books about the related conflicts (Indochina War and Chinese Civil War) but I could not tell you which at the moment. I should note that the number who stayed behind was quite small: a couple hundred in Vietnam, and a couple thousand in China/Korea. Not to mention the various Japanese holdouts in various islands and jungles across the south Pacific. This might sound like a lot but considering the massive size of the Japanese army its a fairly small number.     The Kwangtung army actually fought for an extra day after Hirohito's proclamation of surrender and a couple divisions continued the fight still for a few days after that (a common thread among the Japanese military officers in WWII: not following orders). Of this massive army that was spread over a massive and perilously thinly connected theater it was very easy for any soldier who wished to slip through the cracks to do so. The notable example of this is Imamura Hosaku who stayed behind with many of his unit to be basically mercenaries for the Nationalists in China. I'm afraid there's not a ton of sources or info on these Japanese "stay-behinds" as it were, it would seem this is largely because it was not really an organized/coherent effort but rather a couple disparate officers and units opting to do so.     I'll see if I can dig up some good books/sources on them but even my knowledge of them is pretty limited.	1642788626.0	htmmyiu	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmg2f8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htmmyiu/

51ju0t3o	Mystics. I want to see actors transform into sheep or walking on water.   More seriously, perhaps a drama about Dowager Guo of Wei. From important clan and an intelligent woman but sent to the palace as a hostage for region revolt, entering the harem of a prince who struggled to be heir. He would go from a quiet, intelligent young man to a flamboyant Emperor, she would grow closer to him and it caused friction to his marriage with first love Mao and eventually her death despite Guo's attempts to avoid trouble. Two years later, Cao Rui would die with Guo made Dowager. It would... not be a smooth time. There would be three young Emperors before her death in 264 with the empire falling three years later. There would philosophical tensions between the regents Cao Shuang and Sima Yi which saw Cao Shuang overthrown and killed and someone at court (perhaps Guo) using ranks to signal they doubted Sima Yi was being as loyal as claimed. There would be a series of miliatry revolts claiming doing it on her behalf to rescue the Empress Dowager, the Sima's would claim to be acting on her behalf, edicts blatantly written at sword-point and constant plots. She was unable to resist the deposing of Emperor Cao Fang but she outwitted Sima Shi in open court to install her choice of successor and keep her authority. Later Shi's younger brother Zhao would take the young Emperor Cao Mao and Dowager Guo (a rather unusual move) on camapign against the rebelling Zhuge Dan becuase he couldn't trust what they would do if left behind. Cao Mao would attempt a fightback in 254 and was killed in the streets, the Dowager's authority used to fabricate a series of farcical claims to downplay this but her power would be broken and her authority reduced.   Big characters, political plots, miliatry action at court and a wily brave woman who tried to save a dynasty against men who controlled the army.	1642788948.0	htmnuia	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htmnuia/

is2b2	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1642789116.0	htmob2v	t3_s9gxp0	t3_s9gxp0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9gxp0/what_are_some_lesser_known_but_highly_important/htmob2v/

for0hho1	In Nelson's case I think you have to supplement the "flags" answer with the extensive preparations the commander and captains made so they could fight without making many signals during combat.  Nelson regularly issued tactical memoranda explaining what he expected his subordinate captains to do in different types of situations. This established a body of doctrine. He also prepared written battle plans with sketches showing how he wanted anticipated engagements to unfold. These formal written communications were supplemented by meetings and conferences as well as personal correspondence and relationships with the captains, who formed a "band of brothers" around Nelson. The point of all this was to ensure that every captain knew how to handle his ship, knew the overall plan, and had a pretty good idea what the other captains would do, minimizing the need for communication, which as u/YouOr2 points out was somewhat time-consuming even using the Popham code (which was quite efficient for its time).   In some of his battle plans, Nelson spelled out alternatives or phases that were keyed to particular flag hoists. His general preference, though was to have his fleet go into action as rapidly and violently as possible without many preliminaries and without the captains ever waiting for orders once he had indicated it was time to fight. A famous sentence from [the memorandum Nelson issued shortly before Trafalgar](https://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106127.html): "But, in case Signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his Ship alongside that of an Enemy." Nelson encouraged aggression and initiative.  When the fleet was speeding into action at Trafalgar, Nelson's second-in-command Collingwood, aboard a different ship, saw that the flagship HMS *Victory* was hoisting a long signal and remarked to a staff officer, "I wish Nelson would make no more signals; we all understand what we have to do." Of course, that long signal was the "England expects" message which could be rendered in today's parlance "You got this." HMS *Victory* sent only one more signal until the battle's end: "Engage the enemy more closely," which Nelson characteristically hoisted during battles. That was the only order he felt necessary, such was his confidence.	1642789603.0	htmpncz	t3_s88vs3	t1_htlk7do	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88vs3/how_would_have_a_naval_commander_in_the_19th/htmpncz/

14m5kd	Actually, I've been rewatching the entire series with a friend recently (part of why I took this question) and one of the most interesting things about the Bond series is actually how little the actual Cold War factors into it. In all the Connery films Bond is squaring off against SPECTRE which exists outside of any individual state and is trying to extort both the East and West or otherwise goad them into a larger conflict. Similarly in later films Bonds almost always fighting some quasi-supervillain who has little to no direct relationship to the USSR or Red China. The closest the series comes to it is For Your Eyes Only (1981) wherein a UK encryption machine is trying to be fenced to the East by some villain. But here the Soviets are not portrayed as the villains, only the buyers. And in the next film Octopussy (1983) wherein the villain is a rogue Soviet general who's fed up with the Politburos passivity towards the West. There are even a few films wherein Bond works WITH the KGB such as The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and View to a Kill (1985)     Off-topic a bit and sort-of geeky but I thought it was interesting on rewatch just how little the Soviets are presented as the villains in the series. Ironically they only really started being portrayed that way with Goldeneye (1995). It's honestly bizarre considering the reputation the series has as a cold-war espionage.	1642789680.0	htmpv46	t3_s99rlz	t1_htmm9fh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htmpv46/
70uvo	I am coming to this real late, and I would just add to this outstanding answer that Great Auks don't need to be particularly delicious to be better than the ordinary fare on a transatlantic voyage. Regular accounts of food onboard do not exactly whet the appetite, and fresh meat was always sought-after. I'm thinking particularly of Shackleton's crew's account of finding dog meat to be just delightful after subsisting on penguin and seal, or Melville's account of the delicacy of whale. Compared to hardtack I'm sure all were in fact toothsome.	1642789879.0	htmqenm	t3_rezj7v	t1_hoe3ms2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rezj7v/i_have_heard_that_the_flightless_great_auk_of_the/htmqenm/
yfege	There are some, but it's very limited. From Reagan's book:   > Most disturbing, the number of women who died because of abortion increased. New York City data documented the worsening patterns of abortion. Between 1951 and 1962, the absolute number of abortion deaths nearly doubled in this eleven-year period, from twenty-seven deaths per year in the early 1950s to fifty-one per year in the early 1960s. [Graph](https://imgur.com/a/ExF3edy). The observed rise in abortion deaths was not simply a function of growing population. When standardized to one thousand live births, the rate of deaths as a result of abortion had practically doubled as well.* >  > *Vital statistics cannot be used to track mortality due to illegal abortions for a variety of reasons; see Christopher Tietze, “Abortion as a Cause of Death,” AJPH 38 (October 1948): 1434–1437. Abortion-related deaths are presumed to be undercounted because physicians protected their patients (and themselves) by assigning other causes of death on death certificates. These New York City data are the best we have.	1642789963.0	htmqmyq	t3_s8tr7p	t1_htmoen0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8tr7p/were_coat_hangers_ever_really_used_for_athome/htmqmyq/

52gm1	I just finished The Land of Enterprise and it definitely answers why toy companies were being acquired in the late 60s/early 70s. Waterhouse describes it as taking the idea of decentralized management to its extreme end--that you can run just about any company from afar the same way. I've emailed Waterhouse to ask about toy companies being sold off/let go to be independent in the 1980s, and in the meantime I'll start on An Extraordinary Time.

pmgxogo	Usually they're just called hostages. For example from [Encyclopedia Britannica:](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hostage-warfare)  >The practice of taking hostages is very ancient and has been used in cases of conquest, surrender, and armistice. The Romans often took the sons of tributary princes and educated them at Rome, thus holding a security for the continued loyalty of the conquered nation and also instilling a possible future ruler with ideas of Roman civilization. The British adopted this practice in the early period of the occupation of India, as did the French in their relations with the Arab states of North Africa. Hostages were detained as prisoners of war until treaty obligations were carried out (as was the case with John II during the Hundred Years’ War) or a king’s ransom was paid (as with Richard I). In ancient times they were punished or put to death in case of treachery or refusal to fulfill promises.  The entry is relatively archaic in some of the language used (basically unchanged from the 1911 edition) but the definition stands.	1642791871.0	htmvlgy	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htlutev	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/htmvlgy/

pmgxogo	Definitely not. While yogurt was probably invented in multiple places at different times, it has a long history in the Middle East going back to early Mesopotamian history, c. 2000 BCE, more than 1500 years before even the earliest plausible Turkic or partially-Turkic groups arrived in the region. Yogurt was easier to store and preserve than fresh milk and may have been the primary dairy product consumed by early Mesopotamian cultures.

7rvatyyv	I've posted about this before, but the life of Stalin pre-1917, essentially the book *Young Stalin* by Simon Sebag Montefiore turned into a series.  From being a student at a seminary who was kicked out for developing socialist thought, to an agitator in the Baku oil fields and then the Batum warehouses, to editing his own revolutionary newsletter, to his Siberian exile(s), meeting Lenin, Stalin (still known as Jughashvili) had a wild life before 1917, and it would be perfect for a series like that.	1642794639.0	htn37ru	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htn37ru/
9tg9p	I just wanted to provide a little addendum to explain a little bit of the martial arts community's internal role in these martial arts myths. As a historian and a martial artist myself (nidan, Shitou-ryuu karate) this is something that I've looked into in a semi-amateurish, semi-professional (in that I'm equipped with the historian's toolset) fashion, and the study of the self-perception of martial arts is a somewhat fertile, if limited, academic field right now. While nothing that I'm going to say I think is particularly groundbreaking, I think it's still worth saying because the discourse surrounding martial arts, especially in the western hemisphere and probably *particularly* in internet circles, often has a rather poor grasp on this admittedly somewhat emergent area of study. The work on this sort of thing is ongoing by people like Paul Bowman, his colleague and co-editor Benjamin Judkins (whose [blog](https://chinesemartialstudies.com/) I highly recommend to anyone interested), and others, many of whom are mentioned in your bibliography.  Pretty much all modern martial arts disciplines are based on some kind of internal conceit, usually to do with lineage and authenticity. There are practical reasons for this. It's important to demonstrate how your school or style has been battle-tested/is more effective/is derived from authentic techniques for the same reasons that it's important for a university to be accredited. This holds as true for East Asian martial arts, which typically demonstrate this authenticity with reference to lineages (even when they're imagined), as it is for the recent contemporary practice of HEMA, which in the absence of a living tradition to refer to instead utilizes period manuals and practical demonstrations to prove the same point. Martial arts styles are, at their core, systems of techniques built around a central philosophy for how hand-to-hand combat should work. Pretty much all modern martial arts systems, regardless of country of origin or type, are mixed systems, drawing from countless other systems that have in turn been influenced by the very same systems that they influence, or their predecessors. This is almost trivially easy to demonstrate, and has been shown repeatedly by Bowman et al. It's also acknowledged openly in many schools, although others downplay it. A textbook example is in karate, which is a combination (mainly) of indigenous Ryuukyuuan techniques, southern Chinese styles (predominantly Fujian White Crane), and indigenous Japanese techniques, among many others. Different periods of karate's development show a greater or lesser influence of different parts, and different styles emphasize or de-emphasize different elements. Many traditional Shoutoukan doujou, for example, de-emphasize the Chinese aspect of karate, while instead emphasizing the deep, stable stances and longer-range strikes that typify Shoutoukan as being "traditional" but which are relatively recent additions to the curriculum. In many ways a style like Shitou-ryuu, while being technically more recent, can claim to be more "authentic," in that its creators combined several different styles together and were to a certain extent trying to "recover" an older form of the martial art as it had been practiced in the Ryuukyuu Islands before coming to mainland Japan.   It's in this context that the imagined origins and lineage of karate develop. Many people have heard, for example, the myth that karate developed because Okinawan peasants were forbidden from owning weapons or practicing martial arts and instead developed empty-handed techniques that mimicked weapon techniques, which they hid in elaborate dance-like kata. Both parts of this are, of course, untrue: karate's traditional weapons are police weapons, not converted farming gear, and the martial art's Ryuukyuuan roots derive mostly from anti-riot techniques, which is why there's so much of an emphasis in most styles on multi-directional combat against poorly-armed opponents. Likewise, students are often surprised to discover that this supposedly Japanese (or at best, "Okinawan") martial art uses Chinese names for most of its high-ranking kata, and that the idea of the kata itself as practiced in karate (where it's a lengthy solo routine rather than a partner-based practice of a single technique as is typical in mainland Japanese martial arts) is a Chinese development--indeed, prior to Funakoshi-sensei's changing of the writing to the homophonic 空手 the name of the martial art was originally written 唐手 "Tang (i.e. Chinese) hand," which is still used by the Korean, Shoutoukan-derived martial art Tang Soo Do. Why isn't this better known in karate doujou? The origins of the habit are certainly to a large part nationalistic--Funakoshi-sensei found the Chinese influence, which at the time of karate's arrival in mainland Japan was very strong, on the martial art embarrassing, and more importantly a near-insurmountable obstacle to its adoption in Japan--but with karate a globally practiced martial art it's hard to see how this would continue to perpetuate. To a certain extent there are again practical explanations rooted in the evolution of martial arts. Contrary to the common view in the western hemisphere, which has long dismissed East Asian martial arts as impractical and rooted in unchanging traditions, these styles evolve, and they evolve quite rapidly. Within less than a generation of Funakoshi-sensei's rebranding of karate, much of the style's internal philosophy had changed, replacing much of the southern Chinese-derived dynamic movement and wide, circular motions with simpler, more powerful strikes and more of an emphasis on set piece movements, converting from its essentially combat-focused roots to a more competition-based form. In that sense, then, the mythical origin of karate as a populist, secret martial art that, the story goes, became increasingly more ritualized and frozen reinforces the martial art's own internal philosophy, regardless of whether it's actually true or not.	1642794809.0	htn3ox4	t3_s8ddl3	t1_hths5ox	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/htn3ox4/
2dsdz655	You might be thinking of the term "ward" which is a minor who under the protection of a guardian appointed by the parents or court.   It's used in fiction like Game of Thrones where Theon, the son of the Lord of the Iron Islands, is the ward of Ned Stark of Winterfell.  And famously Robin is the ward of Batman.

9tg9p	**2/2**  Another thing that happens is that many techniques in East Asian martial arts are very old, or because of the rapid evolution in fighting styles and warfare the circumstances under which they were developed quickly become irrelevant and the original purpose of the technique or feature of the style becomes obscure. One of my go-to examples is the tassels traditionally found on spears or swords in many Chinese styles. Western students often find these things very funny, and it's hard to explain why they're there, practically. The usual explanation, that they serve to distract the enemy, is obvious nonsense. These tassels are, of course, insignia or just plain decorations in origin, but that isn't especially important. What *is* important is that techniques, often quite effective, have developed around the interpretation that they're there for distraction, long after the practical purpose of the feature has been rendered irrelevant. In that sense, the myth becomes more important than the reality.   Here's an example that I've been doing some research on recently. Again, karate is a good example because of its highly mixed origins. Many kata have features that are totally obscure to modern practitioners, and which in many cases were already unclear in the 1930s. The kata Chinte--a Chinese kata, one of the oldest in the martial art--is so old that the point of several movements is disputed. The funny "eye poke" thing is one of them, but compare the [Shoutoukan version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou14EWbogB0) with the [Shitou-ryuu one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsPkdwqBgXE&t=10s). The Shoutoukan version has three hops added at the end of it not found in any other style to practice the kata. Why? Some Shoutoukan masters will say that it's an adaptation of an older movement that's lost its meaning and purpose. But this seems suspect, because there are cases where other styles have preserved older movements in more practical form than Shoutoukan. And indeed, the [Shourin-ryuu version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcdM7pW14ms) is substantially different, preserving several intermediate movements that are not found in either of the other two versions or that are significantly simplified, such as the insertion of a leg sweep and downward punches, the much slower version of the "eye poke," and the "windmilling" of what's just a low block in the other two versions, clearly some form of throw and takedown. So what happened here? Is this another case of Shoutoukan removing a Chinese influence that Shourin-ryuu (often considered more conservative) preserved and that Shitou-ryuu (founded at least in part as an attempt to "restore" older forms that had dropped out of many styles) "recovered?" Is Shoutoukan actually preserving, in modified form, an older version? Are the three hops there to return the martial artist to his start position, since in the Shoutoukan version you end the kata well in advance of where you started, which is considered bad form? Who the hell knows--what's important is that each style preserves its own justification for its own variation. And the justifications, mythical or not, encapsulate and reinforce lessons about the style, and the style's own philosophy. Shoutoukan, highly formalized and founded by a sensei whose overriding concern was not the practicality of the form but getting it accepted by mainstream Japanese society, claims either that the hops were added as a holdover from an earlier movement that was somehow forgotten, or were added for purely aesthetic, performance-based reasons. Shitou-ryuu, which often claims to have recovered techniques lost to other styles, usually points to the Chinese origin of the kata to explain its otherwise obscure movements. And Shourin-ryuu's version is almost entirely rooted in practical application. Regardless of the actual origin of the kata's movements, you can see how the different philosophies of the styles are reflected by how they interpret and then justify the kata. You get stuff like this all the time. The legendary origins of Fujian White Crane, that Fang Qiniang tried to hit a crane with a stick, are obviously mythical. But the way the story's told it emphasizes the basic philosophy of the style, which is to attack and defend in a single movement, even if it's unlikely in the extreme (to say the least) that the style was developed by watching cranes. Similarly, the existence of a mythical southern Shaolin temple helps many southern Chinese schools explain obvious Shaolin influence on their styles, despite Shaolin being considered a northern style. Combine this with nationalism, regionalism, the need to justify techniques with reference to practical application (most easily done by pointing out similarities with a tried-and-true style), and the constant mixing of martial arts styles and you've got a potent mix that's self-reinforcing.	1642794832.0	htn3r5r	t3_s8ddl3	t1_htn3ox4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8ddl3/the_destruction_of_the_southern_shaolin_temple_by/htn3r5r/

flouu	I'd love to see something about the 'seven men of Spandau' (or the Breda Four, but that's even more obscure). Nazis always get views, and this is one view of Nazis that has been seriously lacking. The viewers would be treated to the sight of Nazis bickering over nonsense as the Cold War rages overhead. The world has moved on, former allies are now bitter enemies - and yet, right in West Berlin, the epicentre of the Cold War, the USSR works together with the western powers in a cavernous prison built to hold 400 but now with a population of 7.  The miniseries 'Speer and Hitler' (specifically part 3) does an excellent job of showing what happened and I recommend it, but it only really covers the incarceration of Albert Speer, and there was so much other crazy stuff going on. You could start with the sentencings and the arguments over what exactly to do with them and then go through the next 40 years with flashbacks to how the prisoners got there, culminating with the prison getting knocked down after Hess' suicide. It would have to have a nuanced take on Cold War politics and be respectful of the Soviet side. Actually, it could just be an adaptation of Norman Goda's 'Tales from Spandau' and I'd watch it.	1642795789.0	htn6ddr	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htn6ddr/

acxhi	I have a question about the movie that’s been bugging me lately: The beginning of the movie goes to an awful lot of trouble to take eyes off Bond, going so far as to fake his death and burial at sea. They then immediately send him to  1960s Japan with no attempt to disguise him. How unusual would it be to see a white man in Japan in the 60s? I would have thought his race alone would draw considerable attention.	1642796024.0	htn70ds	t3_s99rlz	t3_s99rlz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htn70ds/

It always made sense for me for it to have been invented in southern latitudes particularly the Middle East where cattle were first domesticated. Its also important to note that the words for yogurt in Persian, Arabic and Sanskrit are not Turkic derived.         Also I see your flair is my area of interest.

1n19jp1g	I would make a series about Bess of Hardwick (1527-1608). She's quite an interesting historical figure - married multiple times, rising socially with each one, and of course her lifespan ran through the tumult of the 16th century, from Henry VIII's rupture with the Catholic Church and through all of his children's reigns. You could do a LOT with her life paralleling Elizabeth's; and rather than being a straightforward retelling of her biography, the main action could be when she and her husband had custody of Mary Stuart, jumping back and forth in time to show how she got to such a position. With SUMPTUOUS costuming.	1642796831.0	htn98kn	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htn98kn/

2ycwtyy0	So, at this point we are a bit outside of what I know off-hand so I apologize if this seems a little disorganized on my end. If, however, anything I say below is factually incorrect then hopefully someone will correct me.  The process of establishing a British-style postal system (i.e. each street within a postal office's purview is given a name, and each destination a numerical designation with odd numbers on one side and even numbers on the other) was very piecemeal-- there was no singular date at which it was done "all at once." Hong Kong was using a system similar to that as early as 1838, but even after the establishment of the Imperial Post in 1896 the issues with replacing the courier system were infamously difficult. A trade report from 1904 lists only 18 provinces which were using the system, and this is despite the fact that Sir Robert Hart had essentially made it his personal mission to sort out the mess and confusion that was Chinese mail delivery at that time.   While not strictly related to the question you asked, I think it naturally begs the question of why this was so difficult. The shortest possible answer to that is that due to the events of the time the Chinese tended to view foreigners with a large amount of hostility and resentment, and this combined with the monetary interests of the merchants and private couriers who made their living off of delivering things caused the Imperial Post to be seen as yet another form of undue foreign control and influence.   Here, I will let the aforementioned trade report of 1904 speak for itself:  &#x200B;  >\[The 1896 Imperial\] Decree created an Imperial Post for all China, to be modelled on Western lines, the organization and management of which were confided to Sir ROBERT HART, who from that date has acted in the double capacity of Inspector General of Customs and Posts.    Far more obstructive to rapid progress will Native postal agencies prove. These also have had a long life, but, unlike the *I Chan*, they are wholly independent; they consider letter traffic as their legitimate business, and live on it: they will die hard.   >   >\[...\]   >   >These agencies, unfettered by legislation, indispensable to the people, flourished undisturbed at all places till, some 50 years ago, the appearance of steam brought also for those working at places along the coast and the River a new order of things. Yet for a long time no particular notice was taken of their doings, and when supervision over them became necessary, they were found to have organised themselves into strong bodies holding a monopoly for the transmission by steamers of all inter-port Native correspondence.   >   >\[...\]   >   >In a country like China, where exchange is so erratic and banking transactions difficult and costly, \[...\] Native agencies flourish, and it helps them not a little to retain their customers for other postal operations. The Remittance Order of the Imperial Post Office is one of the means by which this traffic will be curtailed and the public freed from risk and capricious exactions.    ***- Returns of Trade and Trade Reports for the Year 1904; Report on the Working of the Post Office***	1642798279.0	htndaf4	t3_s88meg	t1_htmef0n	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s88meg/how_were_home_addresses_mail_delivery_handled_in/htndaf4/

Moreover it was an efficient means of providing fat to their diet, if not consumed as milk it could also be used to make cheese which is considerably lower in lactose than regular milk. I am not sure how much thought was given to the dietary norms of the Japanese, but milk was a common food item shipped because of the high production numbers in the US dairy industry, high-in-fat/calories, and use in other food preparation (cheese, baking).

A similar trend in the 60s seems like it would make more sense with the whole sexual revolution.	1642798851.0	htnevwr	t3_s8tr7p	t1_htmqmyq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8tr7p/were_coat_hangers_ever_really_used_for_athome/htnevwr/

14m5kd	Sorry yes, I was referring to the Japanese soldiers who "defected" to fight for the Nationalists. I *believe* and I could be wrong, that the majority of the Japanese fighting for the Communists were former POW's taken by the Red Army who "escaped" and signed up with the communists though I am not certain of this.      But as you said there's not a lot of info available and I think that's largely because of the less-than-official nature of this occurrence. So exact figures for either side are difficult to state, or in the very least are not my expertise, so I opted for a vague number for the Nationalists, which I've heard estimates of about 5-6,000 or possibly more. But lacking exact sources I wasn't willing to put a precise number on it. Thanks for the additional info though!	1642799322.0	htng7mi	t3_s99rlz	t1_htne9wx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htng7mi/
ph4ds	If I may interject, one of Richard Nixon’s books (maybe “Leaders”) introduced me to Shigeru Yoshida and the groundbreaking work he and Douglass MacArthur did in creating modern Japan post war. Sadly I’ve never followed up on this thread.

bwnsx06	I think it is possible, just because there is so much unpublished material, but it's going to be a rare occurrence. The early papyrologists were especially interested in literary texts, so that tended to be the first stuff published. There could definitely be things in private collections or less-studied institutional collections, but I want to make sure to emphasize the caveat of interest in literary texts early on. The controversy around Dirk Obbink and his "new Sappho" show that things can pop up, but they  generate a lot of questions when they do.	1642800105.0	htnidzd	t3_s99g43	t1_htmfu3o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99g43/whats_the_actual_possibility_that_there_are_still/htnidzd/

yfege	While there were a number of reasons, it's likely the most significant factor was that poor women, especially women of color, were no longer able to afford safe but illegal abortion as the cost of skyrocketed in the 1950s. The next paragraph in the book:  > The risk of dying from an abortion was closely linked to race and class. Nearly four times as many women of color as white women died as a result of abortions. Mortality data revealed the racial inequalities in access to safe abortions. Between 1951 and 1962, the number of abortion-related deaths of women of color more than doubled, from an average of nineteen abortion deaths per year to forty-one. In contrast, ten white women died per year because of abortion in the early 1960s. Abortion deaths accounted for half of the maternal deaths of women of color, compared to 25 percent of the maternal deaths of white women. >   This meant that their only affordable options were unsafe abortionists or self-inducing.	1642800839.0	htnkfmw	t3_s8tr7p	t1_htnevwr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8tr7p/were_coat_hangers_ever_really_used_for_athome/htnkfmw/

fsldsue9	I see, is your number previous to the defeat of the nationalists on the mainland(pre-1949ish)?   I think that the Japanese support for the nationalists has always been more official after the retreat to Taiwan given the nature of the alliance structure post-World War 2 and you have Japanese military advisors posted to Taiwan in official capacity after the nationalists' retreat to Taiwan for Operation "retaking of the mainland" and related internal security operations to root out communist operatives. Japan filled the role Germany played at one point as KMT's foreign military advisor after the retreat to Taiwan and before United States will also do the same later on. However, my reading on the subject seems to indicate that the KMT was much more adverse to using Japanese personnel previous to the retreat to Taiwan as offers of an unofficial stay behind plan by the Japanese was seen as just a prelude to more Japanese imperialism, but some local warlords under notation KMT command did so secretly. In addition, I think it depends on how you count the numbers since I think a number of Japanese personnel on both KMT and CPC side did not see active combat and were technical staff that kept the factories running and supply lines open rather than front line soldiers.   There were also the large number of collaborationist Chinese forces under Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China. Heck, there is even the participation by Koreans(ethnic Koreans or Korean-Chinese/Chinese-Korean) in People's Liberation Army during the Chinese civil war, which will form the backbone of the spearhead divisions by North Korea to take Seoul in the first wave of the Korean War. So the Chinese civil war was a giant multifaceted affair.	1642801009.0	htnkwuw	t3_s99rlz	t1_htng7mi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnkwuw/

i6kyb	I don't know who I'd cast, but I do have an idea of what I'd like to do in that scenario: the Crecy campaign, but from a French perspective. The first episode would start off with the Genoese leaving Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue due to a lack of payment, feature the English landing and the main POV would be a boy who is captured and forced to serve as a page for an English man-at-arms. Since the English vanguard sees most of the action, the man-at-arms will be part of Sir John Liston's retinue and he'll be constantly worried about an unpredictably violent and exceedingly petty young mounted archer named John Hawkwood and his best friend, the less unpredictable but very emotional William Gold.  The French side will mostly be told through the perspectives of Colins de Beaumont - a herald in the employ of Jean de Beaumont - and Louis the count of Blois. Through Colins we get to see the perspective of the men-at-arms and common soldiers of the army while through Louis we get to see the high level planning. The French side of things focuses on how the French are scrambling to scratch together an army to resist the English and slow/stop the English so that an army *can* be fielded. It's going to lean very heavily into the idea that the French basically had the right idea about slowing/stopping the English but struggled to execute it for various explicable, not comically incompetent, reasons.  The seventh episode is the battle of Crecy, and it's where Louis of Blois dies, along with a lot of the men-at-arms we've come to know through Colins. They mostly die in the first 20 minutes of the battle and the rest of the episode is the French trying to recover from the initial disaster and includes the King of Bohemia making a suicidal charge to try and extract the French vanguard after the English sallied and began to surround it.   Episode 8, the final episode, is all about the aftermath of the battle. The English are exhausted, and also a little horrified by the sheer slaughter in the area where the vanguard was destroyed, but the main focus is on Colins as he's sent with other heralds to identify the dead. As he finds the bodies of more and more friends, hears stories about how some were captured but then killed due to disagreements over who captured them and can't identify other bodies because of the damage done to their shields, surcoats/jupons and faces, he comes closer and close to breaking down. He eventually sites down and begins to write a poem about it.  >When the summer is in decline,  > >And the sun abandons its lofty course,  > >And the weather gets cold,  > >And the chill withers the foliage,  > >And renders the green trees yellow,  > >And one sees come to death  > >All the fruit that issued from the blossom.  The end for the boy is similarly bitter. After the battle he's release from service by the man-at-arms who forced his service back in episode one in what is meant as a kindly gesture but, hundreds of miles from home, having seen his countrymen killed, been randomly beaten by Hawkwood for minor mistakes, been forced to run arrows to the archers at Caen, looted peasant farms for what little food hasn't be taken or burnt, run arrows and waters to the archers at Crecy and then been forced to strip and bury the bodies from Crecy, he's at a loss for what to do. So, when a Norman man-at-arms arrives as part of an escort for a messenger and is asking about a friend of his from Caen, the boy attaches himself to the man-at-arms as a page, is given a spare sword and a poor horse and told that there's more fighting to be done, and this time he'll be on the winning side.	1642801283.0	htnloa0	t3_s9bcte	t1_htm06et	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htnloa0/

14m5kd	No I was referring to Imamura Hosaku who defected with a contingent of his unit to serve as Mercenaries. I believe you are correct that Japan did not officially support the Nationalists in a great capacity until after the Civil War was already effectively lost. The Japanese troops who fought for the Nationalists did so in an unofficial capacity, as-in joined or were hired by the NRA rather than be repatriated.      Again I must stress that Japanese volunteers in the Chinese Civil War are not my area of expertise and I'm still not certain of any good English language sources on them as they definitely seemed to exist but were not necessarily recruited or incorporated in the most orderly or documented fashion. I think that what we're both getting at here is that the Chinese Civil War was a very sprawling and messy conflict for which there are a lot of factors that are still quite difficult to fully parse.	1642801649.0	htnmoaw	t3_s99rlz	t1_htnkwuw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnmoaw/

ib0bk	I'm not sure I understand.  It's specific enough to be about Dong Zhuo in comparison to other warlords. We have details about what they did - Some I know, some I can't set into a bigger picture, and lots I don't know of. And someone who knows about this stuff can provide the context that, more or less, I'm asking for.  > lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  I don't see how this applies. At the core of the question, you can answer with "Yes, he was that terrible - While e.g. Cao Cao did X and Y, socities moral system at the time would find incedents like Dong Zhuo throwing spears at his servants more terrible". I'm assuming a historian about the time would have enough knowledge about how society worked to give a somewhat accurate picture of how Dong Zhuo's reception might differ from others. I find it feasible enough to find (no) support for the notion that he is a great scapegoat for modern media, but that's not the core question.  -------------  Is there a way to change the question to be more fitting?	1642801859.0	htnn9bw	t3_s9krg7	t1_htnkwdv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9krg7/in_the_chinese_three_kingdoms_period_was_dong/htnn9bw/
1n19jp1g	To add to /u/EdHistory101's point, I would note that your logic is a bit flawed. A significant amount of unprotected premarital/extramarital sex was occurring before the 1960s (the 1950s are also a high for illegitimate births); what we call the sexual revolution is the cultural changes resulting from the development of and increase in the availability of the Pill, which allowed women to have sex without the danger of a pregnancy - particularly the middle- and upper-class women who had a great deal to lose from a pregnancy out of wedlock. It didn't necessarily result in more unplanned pregnancies.

yfege	The challenge is that historians don't generally use words like "terrible" to describe historical figures. In effect, what you're asking is for someone to pass judgement, which isn't good historical practice. You're welcome to ask about Dong Zhuo's reputation when he was alive, especially in comparison to his contemporaries to his predecessors. We can't promise someone will answer, but that should get you closer to getting information regarding the context around him without getting into a special judgment.

While adults may have understood the scarcity situation and perhaps even appreciated that the occupiers were trying to provide food, did children understand this?  When I lived in Japan, starting in the 1990s, several older Japanese people told me they had been upset / angry that the USA "forced" milk, cheese, and iirc bread on them (instead of giving them rice, I believe) when they were young. No idea if this is a widely held belief, but maybe there is research on the Japanese populous' reactions to these foods?	1642804941.0	htnvjx8	t3_s99rlz	t1_htnejjy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99rlz/in_the_1967_film_you_only_live_twice_007_slept/htnvjx8/

7sxro	Absolutely. As a general rule, courts/legislatures/monarchs don't like to restrict how people dispose of their private property. It is a fundamental principle of property law that people are free to alienate their property (e.g., sell, lease, mortgage, devise, manumit their property) as they see fit, subject to few restrictions for public policy reasons.   Sure enough, "[s]laves were converted to Islam and frequently manumitted after several years' service, for such manumission counted as a pious act on the part of the slave owner." *Imperial Harem*, loc. 558. And it "is clear [] that women of means upheld the forms of Muslim *noblesse oblige* which required individuals of wealth and status–male and female alike–to contribute to the public welfare by endowing religious foundations, freeing their slaves, or undertaking other forms of charity."

kfhe9	**Content warning: depictions of rape and torture**  The recent book *La campagne d'Egypte* (2018) by historian Jacques-Olivier Boudon includes a chapter detailing the violence and war crimes that took place during the campaign of Egypt. Boudon cites the primary sources - letters et memoirs from French soldiers and civilians who participated in the campaign - that mentions the rape incidents, which are also featured in other recent accounts, notably Strathern, 2009 (that you cite) and Dwyer, 2014.  Some context first: in July 1798, French troops led by general Desaix marched across the desert from Alexandria to Cairo under a scorching heat. They were soon exhausted, suffering (and dying) from thirst and diseases, and found themselves in a guerilla war where they were harassed by enemies in hit-and-run attacks. A few times, terrified soldiers woke up at night believing they were under attack and shot at each other in the dark, killing several of their own and losing horses.   According to several testimonies, several straggling French soldiers and civilians were captured by the Bedouins (or "Arabs"). They were at best ransomed and released (after being mistreated and in some cases raped), at worse mutilated, tortured and killed.    Here's a roundup of the most significant ones (mostly drawn from Boudon):  **The testimonies**  The frankest testimony is found in the diary of Charles Antoine Morand, an officer who served under Desaix and was part of the march to Cairo.  > The Bedouins harassed us the whole way, which was only six miles, and killed several men. They were content to rob others. Others that were captured and taken were splendidly buggered [*enculés*] by the children of Ismail and then sent back; two dragoons of the 20th regiment were submitted to this rude ordeal [dated 2 July 1798]  Morand's testimony is the most direct and credible. This was a personal diary, where he gives the victims' unit, and uses a crude word for the act (rather than an euphemism drawn from classical literature). The word *enculés* would not have been published outside pornographic books. Morand is more precise (and even cruder) in another part of his diary:   > Woe to the unfortunate one who falls into their hands. They strip him and, before giving him death, they satisfy their abominable passion on him. Sometimes, opening the anus with a knife, they seek some horrible pleasure in the bloody wound. Or, inserting a rifle cartridge, they set fire to it before abandoning their victim.  Other members of the expedition also wrote about those incidents.  Diary of gunner Louis-Joseph Bricard:  > The Arabs, fearless with bladed weapons, but afraid of the cannon, did not dare to obstruct the march of our troops. But these brigands, mounted on small fast horses, flitted around the columns, stopped and massacred all those who strayed from them. Several who had been caught by these villains had the good fortune to escape and returned to Alexandria in the most appalling state, having for several days satisfied the cruel passion of these monsters. There was even a French woman who was among them.  Pierre Amédée Jaubert, orientalist and translator for Napoléon, in a letter to General Bruix, dated 9 July 1797:  > The Arabs and Mamelukes treated some of our prisoners as it is said that Socrates treated Alcibiades. One had to die or suffer it: a grenadier was killed. They had only beaten the women they had taken from us.  Captain Rozis, writing to his friend Grivet from Alexandria on 9 September 1798 (letter cited in Larchey, 1866):  > In principle, they [the Arabs, Mamluks, and Bedouins] took very few prisoners, and if any escaped death, they were reserved for their brutal passion.   From another officer, Jean-Gabriel Niello Sargy (memoirs published in 1825):  > We soon recognised how dangerous it was to deviate alone from the march of the columns without being escorted; it was to run the risk of being murdered, or of becoming the victim of an infamous passion very much in vogue in that country, especially on the part of the Bedouin-Arabs. Several of our grenadiers had been killed while resisting their violence; others had succumbed. Several Frenchmen, in the city of Alexandria itself, had been kidnapped at nightfall, and had suffered this dreadful fate.  Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne, Napoleon's secretary, tells in his memoirs published in 1830 how Napoleon interrogated one of the victims:  > The next day, a deal was struck with the Arabs for the release of the men they had abducted the day before; they were bought back for a hundred piastres: one of them, who was distinguished from the others by his manners, was summoned by the general-in-chief, who wished to obtain some information about these half-savage hordes. At the first question, how he had been treated, this man burst into tears: "Why are you crying?" He sobbed that he had experienced the treatment so well known in the Orient. "Big fool, you are very sick! You have paid for your imprudence; you should have stayed with your unit. Thank heaven that you are free so cheaply. Come, weep no more, and answer me." The few hours he had spent with the Arabs, and their conduct towards him, had prevented him from making the slightest observation. Nothing could be learned from him.  Bourrienne's memoirs (and memory) were heavily criticized at the time for being full of mistakes (a "fact-checking" book was even published, see A.B., 1830) but this particular story was not among those claimed to be fake by his critics.   The story told by Bourrienne is also found in Alexandre Dumas's memoirs (1863). Dumas's father had been part of campaign of Egypt (he left in March 1799 after coming into conflict with Napoléon). The novelist wrote extensively about his father (who died when he was 4). It is likely than Dumas drew from Bourriennes's account and embellished it, but he may also have been in contact with veterans who knew his legendary father well:  > About ten men were missing. The Bedouins were in the act of beheading their prisoners, and had already accomplished a third of their task, when they learned that there was a hundred piastres reward for each prisoner brought back alive. As men who put business first, and put commerce above all else, they stopped at once, and contented themselves with indulging in another amusement over their prisoners, less cruel, but more extraordinary, in the eyes of the captives, than that which they had at first feared.    >The result was that, when Bonaparte brought these prisoners before him for questioning, he was quite astonished to see them blush, turn away, and stammer like shameful young girls. At last, urged on by the general-in-chief, who, hearing always of the misfortunes that had befallen the captives, wanted absolutely to know what those misfortunes were, an old soldier told him, weeping with anger, that it had happened to him and his companions what would have happened to the angels of the Lord between Sodom and Gomorrah, if they, who had the advantage over our grenadiers of having wings, had not ascended to heaven without losing a moment.    > Imbecile! said Bonaparte, shrugging his shoulders, you are very sick. Come, come, thank heaven that you have been paid off so cheaply, and do not cry any more.  In his memoirs (written before 1823), Captain Charles-François François, a veteran of Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, does not mention the rapes suffered by French soldiers during the march to Cairo, but describes another incident where a group of French employees, soldiers, and bakers were killed in El Khanqah north of Cairo, early August 1798. These people had been tasked with setting up ovens to make bread for the army, but were left behind when French troops had to retreat for a few hours. When the soldiers returned, they found that the villagers had massacred those men:  > The peasants and Arabs, after having sodomised them, cut off their noses, ears, arms, legs, etc., and even their private parts. Those who escaped death after these operations were forced to heat the ovens they had set up and were put into them by these cannibals. On our arrival, I saw these unfortunate victims roasting in an oven.  Like Bourrienne's memoirs, those of François were criticized for their lack of verisimilude and for plagiarizing previous works (Caron, 1904). François seems to be the only source for the El Khanqah atrocities. Another officer, Jacques Miot, who had been in charge of setting up the ovens, barely mentions the incident in his own memoirs, only saying that the villagers of El Khanqah, described as "looking more like ferocious beasts than warriors", assassinated some workers and destroyed the ovens. Miot spends more time describing how he was attacked by his own camel! In his report to his superiors, Captain Malus is equally brief about the incident. He tells that the villagers had assassinated "our bakers and butchers", and only slightly damaged one oven, which could be quickly repaired. However, he also notes that the troops' morale was "badly shaken" and that "the soldiers were loudly expressing their concern", which could be explained by the horrors they discovered when returning to the village (letter of 6 August 1798, cited in La Jonquière, 1899).   It must be noted that other testimonies about the march do not mention rapes at all. This is the case of the memoirs of lieutenant Desvernois, general Belliard, and engineer Martin. Others only talk of abductions: the soldier Lacuée, in a letter to his uncle, mentions the "poor Desna, taken by the Bedouin more than a month ago" (letter cited in Larchey, 1866). An abduction featured in several memoirs is that of an officer named De Nanots (or Denano, or Delanau, allegedly a nephew of scientist Lacépède), made prisoner by the Bedouins and executed after his captors disagreed about who would get the ransom (Desvernois, Martin, Miot).  *-> Part 2*	1642808359.0	hto4dw8	t3_s5b2oe	t3_s5b2oe	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s5b2oe/the_violation_of_napoleons_troops_at_the_hands_of/hto4dw8/
logg879	In general, self identified feminist groups did not have much to say about the video game industry or its methods in these decades. However, the arguments which have dominated feminist criticism about games have existed since at least the era of the NES.  One exception to this general rule was the feminist-spurred protest aganst the selling of Custer’s Revenge by American Multiple Industries. My friend Kate Willaert touches on this point in a [Kotaku article](https://kotaku.com/porno-hustlers-of-the-atari-age-1847622176) on the subject. Groups like Women Against Pornography objected the the portrayals of sexual acts in the game and did legitimately succeed in getting some retailers to not carry it.  Beyond that, in the early 80s there were not many female protagonists but this didn’t seem to bother the majority of female players. I hesitate to give estimates about how much of the arcade playerbase was female, though I’ve seen some numbers. In general though, once both the arcade and home video game crashes hit (these were two different events) games centered around a hardcore audience which was predominantly male, in the child-to-young adult age bracket.  Conventional wisdom in the video game industry became that only those types of players would spend the type of money required to recoup the costs of an arcade cabinet or at retail for cartridge games. The reasons for this lay deep within consumer culture and the position of video games within the toy industry. However it’s a bit beyond my current ability to easily surmise, so just suffice to say that the male demographic became a noted focus when there once had been more marketing directed at general family activity.  While there was some lamentation of the loss of a female player base after no game came to follow up *Pac-Man*, *Frogger*, or *Ms. Pac-Man* in terms of broad appeal, the question of women in games did not become a specific issue again until the success of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo of America was not at all secretive about saying that its target market was 6-12 year old boys, brought about for the reasons of the Crash as stated above as well as their position within the toy market. They were happy for other people to buy their games or for other publishers to have different priorities, but Nintendo did not put any extraordinary effort towards appealing to markets other than the male child.  With the success of the NES came a litany of criticism about the types of players that Nintendo inspired. In what would become a repeated cycle of commentary about video game systems as they reached new heights of success, the major controversies would go as follows:  1. “Nintendo’s turning my kid into a zombie! Are video games making kids obsessed?” 2. “Violence is a major theme in video games and is being marketed to children. Should parents be worried?” 3. “Violent themes dissuade female players! What is the video game industry doing to change it?”  All of these steps are part of the continuum which honestly does repeat itself over and over again with future consoles. The earlier video game consoles had violent themes, but they didn’t have the representation aspect which was achievable on the NES. Atari 2600 cartridges could certainly drive people to obsessive lengths, but NES games challenged people to slog each game to reach an end. A few female characters and protagonists had appeared on the earlier consoles, but now in a world with realized characters which could differ from each other, some commentators noticed that the most popular games only featured female characters and in a periphery role.  You can take what you want from each of these criticisms, but they are all explicitly tied together. It was a social justification for the reaction to the NES and subsequent consoles, as well as a call to the game industry to change their approach to each of these subjects. However, these were not feminist groups advocating for the change. These were generally concerned individuals - likely some whom would identify themselves as feminist - but not a systematized critique on the medium.  The article “Guns and Barbies: Girls take shots at sexist beliefs about Nintendo” from the February 27, 1990 issue of The Baltimore Sun is a good example of this. More than just highlighting girls who played video games as a counter narrative, they place things in social terms.  >“For boys in this country between the ages of 8 and 15, not having a Nintendo is like not having a baseball bat,” says Rick Anguilla, former editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine.   >   >But for many girls a Nintendo is as important to their play as a Barbie doll.  This specific article commented more on the fact that the marketing was missing out on a segment of the population that was, nevertheless, gravitating to Nintendo’s product. The professionals quoted in this piece specifically refute the idea that women were turned off by the violence and were more than driven to compete.  >“The competitiveness is different,” said Kate Fenton, who works on a general pediatric floor. “The girls are just as skilled, but they play on an individual basis, competing with themselves. The boys are more likely to gather around, playing round robin in a group, competing against each other.”  The more persistent note was that of representation. More than one report made passing comments about Mario rescuing Princess Peach, which was a well known point of contention within feminist criticism of fairy tales. Few were going to the lengths of calling Nintendo outright sexist, but concern was being shared about the absence of females in protagonist positions.  Some companies, though, saw the market deficiency and took it as an opportunity.  >The development of entertainment software like “Little Mermaid” and “Barbie” \[for the NES\] is part of a larger trend in the video game business toward what’s known as “niche marketing,” or marketing for a specific group whose interests are different from that of the mass audience.  This need for representation was not universally shared among female players though.Not that the sparsity of female protagonists seems to bother most girls.  >“I don’t care what it is running around on that screen,” said Rosetta \[Moore, 10\], voicing a sentiment that girls seem to share. “I’m the one that’s playing it."  This isn’t easy to quantify. Again it’s part of the greater question of how media and marketing might fit into general society.  The harsher criticism accelerated at a crucial moment of change for the video game industry. As the era of the Genesis and Super Nintendo took off, games started to portray more realistic situations. The characters stopped being purely cartoon-like - to the American eye - and the violence stopped being quaint. The desires of game creators to take on the same style as Hollywood brought in complaints that the interactive nature of this media made it extra harmful to portray certain actions or ideas.  Charges of adverse effects on women in particular were not far behind. This scathing opinion piece on the question in the September 18, 1992 issue of the Sacramento Bee should be perfectly familiar to those familiar with feminist criticism of games today.  >“They’re horrendous,” says Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children’s Television. “It doesn’t take a lot of research to see that the images of women in these games are really negative.”   >   >“They perpetuate myths that women are helpless, need men to rescue them, or are ruthless in business,” says Charren, whose group promotes quality TV programming for children and who has studied video games as well.  Again, the lens of these quotes is not as part of explicitly feminist media but rather the greater movement of encouraging media to support what they saw as positive messages to young children. The organizations and people commenting on the industry came from a background of psychological study rather than an explicitly political standpoint. They pushed for regulation of content in games the same way that children’s television content had been regulated.	1642808528.0	hto4t1m	t3_s70fq3	t3_s70fq3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s70fq3/during_the_80s_and_90s_what_was_the_general/hto4t1m/

kfhe9	**Conclusion and additional remarks**  So, were French soldiers and civilians raped by Bedouins during the march to Cairo in July 1798 and in other occasions during the campaign of Egypt? To my knowledge, there is no direct evidence of these events, such as medical records: there is no mention of this in the memoir of Dr Larrey, the army's chief surgeon, who otherwise talks a lot about the health (of lack thereof) of soldiers's testicles. Still, it is very likely that the answer is yes. The testimonies of Morand and Bourrienne were based on their notes taken at the time. One notable aspect is that they are both quite accusatory against the victims, described as careless stragglers who basically "asked for it". There is little empathy directed towards the soldiers. While the Arabs/Bedouins/Turks/Mameluks are called half-savages and ferocious beasts by nearly everyone, the focus remains on those girly Frenchmen who got "splendidly buggered" (really) and could not stop weeping after that. Bourrienne's account shows a man suffering from serious PTSD and being mocked for it by his commander-in-chief. This is hardly something that shows the French army - and French soldiers - in a good light, so the propaganda aspect seems minimal. There are inconsistencies in the testimonies, about how many men were raped, and whether women were also raped, but one can guess that such sensitive, "shameful" stories circulated by word of mouth among the soldiers and civilians who took part in the campaign, with details being added, removed, embellished, or worsened.   I'm less convinced by François' account of the rapes and executions at El Khanqah, but it is possible that this actually happened but was less publicized, since in that case the victims were not mindless stragglers, but people had been literally left behind and were slaughtered as a result.   In any case, the campaign of Egypt was brutal, and those rapes should be put in a context of extreme violence, which was unsettling even to the many veteran soldiers in the army, causing some to desert or to commit suicide. As some men wrote in their letters, it was "worse than Vendée": the counter-revolution war in the Vendée in 1793-1796 had been particularly gruesome, with mass massacres of civilians and soldiers carried out by Republican and Royalist troops. Egypt was another level of awful.  Napoléon's promises regarding Egypt - that Egyptians would greet the French as liberators, and that French soldiers would find riches in Alexandria and Cairo - were unfulfilled. But the Republican soldiers, rather than bringing Revolutionary-style freedom to the Egyptians, found themselves in a merciless war where they were both perpetrators and victims of atrocities. In their reports and in private letters, soldiers and officers told about the horrors brought upon them - tortures, mutilations, and rape - and about those they committed themselves: the pillaging and burning of entire villages, the abduction and rape of women, and the mass killing of civilians. Captain Charles-François François describes one of these operations:  > We killed about 900 men, not including the women and children who remained in their houses, which we set on fire with our musketry and artillery [...]. Before leaving this village, we finished burning the remains of the houses or rather the huts in order to give a terrible example to this half-savage and barbaric people.  Napoléon quickly forgot about his initial pledge of respecting the local populations, their traditions, their women, and their livelihoods. He himself proudly wrote to his generals how he had "five to six heads" cut every day and then paraded through the streets of Cairo. When general Kebler was assassinated in June 1800 by a Syrian student, the latter had his hand burned and he was executed by impalement in the presence of French officers (Dr Larrey collected the corpse for examination).  The male-on-male rape issue must also be put in the context of the perception of homosexual relationships in the 18th century. In the Ancien Régime, (male) homosexuality was, with bestiality, an unspeakable "crime against nature" (and thus often spoken of in Latin) that was punishable by death at the stake. This had happened for the last time as recently as 1750, when Bruno Lenoir and Jean Diot were strangled and burned in the Place de Greve, after a watchman had spotted them having sex in the rue Montorgueil. In 1791, the Constituent Assembly had omitted "sodomy" from the Penal Code, making it *de facto* legal. Still, men who engaged same-sex relations could be fined or sentenced to jail if it was found that they committed a "public offense against decency". So, though tolerated officially, homosexuality remained extremely taboo and shameful. Of course, in the case of the soldiers in the story, we are talking about rape, not homosexuality, but it certainly looks from the testimonies that the victims were shamed for having "participated" in such acts and for not having chosen death instead (Sibalis, 2001).  Another related bit of context is the perception in the West of men in the "Orient" as being naturally "sodomites" (see Bleys, 1996). The philosopher and orientalist traveller Volney had published in 1787 an influential book about his travels in Egypt and Syria. Here is what he wrote about the Mamluks, the knightly military class of Egypt:  > They are especially given to that disgraceful kind which has always been the vice of the Greeks and the Tartars; it is the first lesson they receive from their master of arms. One does not know how to explain this taste, when one considers that they all have women, unless one supposes that they seek in one sex the piquancy of the refusals of which they have deprived the other; but it is no less true that there is not a single Mamluk without a stain; and their contagion has depraved the inhabitants of Kaire, even the Christians of Syria who remain there.  So not only the Mamluks were naturally depraved, but they "contaminated" the other inhabitants of the country!   Another French traveller, naturalist Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt, published in 1798 his own travel book about Egypt. Between considerations about gerbil anatomy and the preparation of coffee, he offered the following assessment of the sexual orientation of Egyptian men, this time described - all of them - as bisexuals with a preference for men.  > The inconceivable taste which disgraced the Greeks and Persians of antiquity, is the delight, or rather, the infamy of the Egyptians. It is not for women that their amorous songs are composed, it is not to them that they lavish tender caresses; other objects inflame them. Voluptuousness, for them, is no longer amiable, and their transports are no more than the convulsions of brutality. Such depravity, which, to the shame of civilised nations, is not foreign to them, is generally widespread in Egypt: the rich, as well as the poor, are infected with it; contrary to the effect that it produces in less warm climates, that of being exclusive, it is combined there with an inclination for women.  This particular strand of orientalism certainly informed the already unpleasant perception of the local populations by the French soldiers, and did inform the (later) colonial view of North African populations. Almost one century later, doctor Adolphe Kocher wrote in his treaty about criminality among Arabs in Algeria that "like all Oriental people, the Arab is a sodomite" (Kocher, 1884; Gouriou, 2010).  *-> Sources*	1642809084.0	hto67eo	t3_s5b2oe	t1_hto4dw8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s5b2oe/the_violation_of_napoleons_troops_at_the_hands_of/hto67eo/

logg879	This was one of the driving factors behind the famous [December 1993 Senate Hearings](https://www.filfre.net/2021/04/the-ratings-game-part-2-the-hearing/) on video game violence. The panel which was to oppose the video game industry was composed of people who were part of the regulating media movement. While the majority of focus was on the details of gory portrayals of violence (in the case of *Mortal Kombat*) and violence against women (see: *Night Trap*) there was also a strong tenor of opposition against general portrayals of women within these games.  Marilyn Droz, part of the National Coalition Against Television Violence, struck a moralistic tone when she opened her statement with “Shame on you!” directed at the video game manufacturers. Eugene Provenzo, author of the psychological study on video games *Video Kids: Making Sense of Nintendo*, also brought up the issue of gendered division.  >During the past decade, the videogame industry has developed games whose social content has been overwhelmingly violent, sexist, and racist, issues that I’ve addressed extensively in my research. For example, in Video Kids I explored the 47 most popular videogames in America. I found that 40 had violence as their main theme, and thirteen included scenarios in which women were kidnapped and had to be rescued — i.e., the idea of women as victims. Although men were often rescued in games too, they were never rescued by women. Videogames have a marked tradition of extreme violence which is also combined with gender discrimination.  (I must note that Provenzo has received a great [deal of criticism](http://blog.hardcoregaming101.net/2012/03/book-review-video-kids-making-sense-of.html) both in how he classifies violence and the conclusions he draws psychologically, based on his very limited data set.)  Ultimately the question of the particular effects of video games on women would be sidelined to the greater goal of indicating violent content. Not long after this hearing, the breakthrough in CD-ROM multimedia also created an opportunity for niche markets to find a broader audience. This had been difficult in the days of extreme expense at retail dealing in cartridges and floppy disks, but CD-ROM technology broadened the horizons of games that could be developed.  The November 10, 1994 issue of The News-Messenger shows an early glimpse into this market, highlighting products like King’s Quest VII, Hawaii High, and Hello Kitty interactive CD-ROM products. The breakthrough in this area though would be Barbie Fashion Designer in 1996. It became one of the biggest software products of the year and became a signal for what’s been titled the “Games for Girls movement”.  With a defined market segment that appealed directly to a female audience, much of the criticism would fall away for a while. There were certainly some concerns about popular female protagonists like Lara Croft and her conventionally attractive looks but in general the critics had received what they desired. It would only be with the broader mainstreaming of video games after the PlayStation 2 that there would be a unified commentary on female audiences and protagonists, this time under a more explicitly feminist lens.  \------  **Women in the Industry**  While we’re here in the games-for-girls movement though, it is worth discussing the other side of the coin here. Not the public reaction to video games in a feminist lens, but the role of women within the creative process of the industry through that perspective.  Women were not absent from the late 70s and early 80s period of video games. Notable programmers and designers like [Carol Shaw](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,52278/), [Roberta Williams](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,60/), and [Carla Meninsky](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,104056/) were present alongside those in supporting roles like [Connie Goldman](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,94538/), [Junko Ozawa](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,186082/), and [Anne Westfall](https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,241/). Within executive positions, women were found most in marketing at video game companies. The early profile “[Welcome to the club](https://archive.org/details/Video_Games_Volume_1_Number_06_1983-03_Pumpkin_Press_US/page/n50/)” in the March 1983 issue of *Video Games* covers this subject rather neatly.  It was true though that basically no video game companies were owned by women, nor did women tend to have particularly long careers as center stage game creators. Not many people did, but while there were plenty of male outliers, Roberta Williams was basically the only female one. Many factors can be attributed to this, but the world reacts to the trends rather than the reasons.  Several female-lead studios emerged after this period specifically to challenge that notion and capture the game audience for girls. Probably the first created to this end was [Rhiannon Software](https://www.mobygames.com/company/rhiannon-software), founded by Elizabeth Stott and Lucy Ewell. They created games specifically tailored to the female audience exclusively, a series of graphical Adventure games focused on puzzle solving.  In a 1985 article, they stated a more direct intention for their business model.  >“We’re clearly feminist,” Ms. Stott said. “It’s just that people misinterpret what that means. There’s this remedial effort needed. We’re going for the girls.”  Rhiannon Software saw it as their mission to get girls interested in computers to expand their career paths. A bit ironically, they didn’t credit their programmers, though that was the norm back in the day. It’s uncertain if they managed to put out their [initial four game set](https://twitter.com/katewillaert/status/1397942040114122754) commercially and the company collapsed before it got very far.  As stated above, some felt that the feminine influence was needed if games were to ever have proper representation. It was not enough to rely on the portrayals by men which they felt were almost universally problematic. To these critics, the lack of women in the sphere was keeping more women from entering computing. To the defendants, they were doing nothing unusual as far as the broader cultural values were concerned.  >\[Perrin\] Kaplan \[of Nintendo\] adds that most of the games were developed for that target audience of 8- to 15-year-old boys. “I don’t think anybody said, ‘Let’s make a sexist game.’ The ideas and the creation of the programs come from the designer.”   >   >That’s the point, says \[Stevanne\] Auberbach \[director of the Institute for Childhood Resources\]. “Why have they decided to ignore the girls? It goes back to who has the programming jobs that create the programs. Men. If more women were creating the programs… we would see more of a balance in the number of games for girls and more positive roles for girls. But traditionally, girls don’t go into programming because they’ve also been told they’re not good with computers. Because they’re not really given the same amount of exposure to computers as the boys. It’s a chicken and the egg thing.”   >   >The sexist stereotypes in the video games only reflect our culture, says \[Christopher\] Geist \[professor of pop culture at Bowling Green State University\].   >   >“We’ve always blamed the latest trend for promoting the wrong values,” says Geist. “In the ‘50s it was the comic books, now it’s video games… I’m not saying I approve, but you can’t blame video games for creating a cultural pattern which suggests women are weak. That has been part of our Western culture for a long time.”  How strong each of these takes can be evaluated again relies on bigger questions than can be answered here. The 1994 report actually says something rather interesting about how the quality of games can affect young girls’ perception towards computers.  >“If little girls don’t like a game on the computer, they aren’t going to say it’s the game they don’t like. They’ll say computers are ‘yucky.’ To them, the game and the computer are the same,” says Lucinda Finley, a professor of gender law at State University of New York, Buffalo.   >   >“This is part of the concern, given the increasing importance of computers to education and society and careers.”  I have no idea how true this is or what sort of data she was going off. What this should clearly demonstrate is that the questions have been tackled in rather nuanced ways even from this early period. Understanding the types of games that women like to play and their reactions to technology within the societal framework has shaped the conversation in the years since that moment.  The final case study to look at is HeR Interactive, the noted leader in the games for girls movement that still exists today. It was originally a subsidiary of the multimedia-focused arcade company American Laser Games, which gave them a head start on CD-ROM technology when it came to PCs. With such a strong focus on the female market, they were one of the first companies to properly identify the encroaching “casual” gaming market which would explode with the dawning of the internet. Games which could run on low powered PCs, could be engaged with on and off over many sessions, and didn’t apply intense pressure on its players like action games.  With the wave of PCs entering the homes of those not attuned to technology in the mid-90s, games which could appeal to this market had a massive “in” with the female sector as well. Their best known and best selling products have been the Nancy Drew-licensed “hidden object” style point-and-click adventures. The games found a massive appeal with that casual female audience and have continued to sustain them ever since, despite some rocky moments in their history.	1642809326.0	hto6syh	t3_s70fq3	t1_hto4t1m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s70fq3/during_the_80s_and_90s_what_was_the_general/hto6syh/

logg879	**Conclusions:**  Feminist criticism towards the content and creation of video games is not new, though it grew out of talking points not explicitly tied to feminist movements. Media critique, lobbying groups, psychologists, and marketing agents have long pointed out the distinct differences between the representation of men and women in the video game sphere. It grew out of larger social movements related to the regulation of content within media for what they felt was a positive effect on society. Sex-related criticism was only one piece of the larger puzzle in larger movement tackling video games as a medium and its social implications.  This subject is definitely interesting to me, but I feel it really does need to be approached from the standpoint of scientific data in order to be properly accessed. In the United States, we as a society have settled on a very light hand on regulating mass media content as a tool for bettering society. Other countries have placed their governments in a more active role on this front. Of course I don’t really have a great enough understanding of feminist movements in other countries or language skill to tackle this question in places other than the United States.  Certainly the gaming landscape has been enriched by the presence of female creators, but is it because they bring a distinctly different sensibility to male creators? Are the 80s and 90s so lacking in general diversity of content and situation as we accept as common wisdom? Has the games for girls movement as a distinct market been a positive benefit to the development of gaming as a whole? What about the changes in artistic design in the hopes to appeal to broader audiences?  These are questions we get left with when attempting to sum up the legacy of gender divides within the video game medium. I intend to tackle this in broader terms in the future, but thanks for asking the question! It was a nice way to collect together my resources on this.  &#x200B;  Speaking of!  Sources:  Ballou, E.

9ihz041v	Thank you both! This is very helpful and satisfies my curiosity.  You're right that it's not exactly on my question, but it pretty much answers it. I didn't know lip reading was that limited even among those who do it well. If that's the case, you're right, it probably wasn't ever something that was a big part of watching silent films.  I also did some more poking around in this sub since I asked that question and found this thread and the one it links to very interesting: [Did people talk through silent films (when shown in theatres)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7o30ir/did_people_talk_through_silent_films_when_shown/).  It mentions that (1) silent films weren't all that silent; (2) the philosophy of watching film was different, i.e. people came in and out as they pleased even in the middle of a film and cared more about the experience than following every element of the plot.	1642810795.0	htoaf3w	t3_s7gfn4	t1_htgjbgg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7gfn4/was_lip_reading_part_of_the_silent_filmwatching/htoaf3w/
gw25ofvm	This entirely depends on who you ask. Most modern scholars will not deny that Alexander had some form of relationship with Hephaestion, the extent and exact nature of that relationship is debated; older scholars such as Tarn 1948 often argued that any suggestion of Alexander's homosexuality had been invented and/or exaggerated in irder to portray Alexanderas "something less than a man", this view has been largely outgrown in the academic commimity but certainly seems to persist in the general public if the popular reviews of Stone's 2004 film are to be believed. Bosworth 2012 (in Worthington) outright calls Hephaestion Alexander's "lifelong friend, lover, and second in command"; Green 1991 is more ambiguous, reffering to Hephaestion as "his (Alexander's) inseperable companion". I assume the film you are referring to is Stone's 2004 film which portrays Hephaestion and Alexander as having "the most powerful emotional bond" (Baynham 2009 in Heckel and Tritle); Stone himself aslo stated that there initially was "some Bagoas stuff that we trimmed" (from the original cut of the film) which was removed to focus on "the more important relationship with Hephaestion".  Multiple scholars also highlight the Homeric parallels between Alexander and Hephaestion, and Achilles and Patroklos (Briant 2018, Green 1991, Ogden 2009, Heckel 1992, O'brien 1992, Wilcken 1932, Arrian). Alexander undoubtedly had a relationship with Alexander, it may have been mostly emotional, but it was there.   As to his relationships with females, he certainly had at least one sone so he did have a sexual relationship with at least one woman. He may well have been bisexual, although, there is some suggestion that he may have been indifferent to women and simply fulfilling his duty to produce an heir: this is shown in how late in his life he eventually produced an heir. O'brien 1992 recalls Alexander's apparant refusal "to take advantage of any tens of thousands of women" and that his "unconventional behaviour in the presence of women" has fuelled the debate over Alexander's sexuality. Carney 2009 (in Heckel and Tritle) suggests that Olympias and Philip II shared a "parental concern, Alexander's sexuality"; Green 1991 highlights Roxanne's pregnancy as "in the last year of his (Alexander's) life, after Hephaestion's death" the implication being that Alexander and Roxanne only shared a sexual relationship after Hephaestion's death. This suggestion is possibly supported by Philip II's exile of many of Alexander's inner circle, with the sole exception of Hephaestion, this is also referenced in Stone's 2004 film.	1642811299.0	htobntq	t3_plagoc	t3_plagoc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/plagoc/alexander_the_great/htobntq/

nt6eu	Slavery did not last until the Cuban Revolution. It was legally abolished in the 1880s and had long since been ended in all forms by the 1950s.  &#x200B;  Rural laborers were still exploited in various ways, of course, such as the colono system where big sugar cane mills would charge low prices for sugar from smallholders and sharecroppers, but this was different from slavery.   &#x200B;  I am guessing that the misconception here comes from the meme online that 'lol you are just mad that Fidel expropriated your family's slave plantation'. The meme started as an overstatement and I think that while the creators knew it was half jokingly calling large landholders slave owners, I don't think a lot of the people who come across those memes in the wild always get that it's meant to be partially joking. At most I've seen people defend it as 'wage slavery', but that is different from just calling it 'slavery' since normally that implies \*chattel slavery\*.  &#x200B;  It is true that the first big wave of post-1959 Cuban immigration was made up largely of middle class and wealthy Cubans, including many big landowners, but they were not slave owners.  &#x200B;  For a summary history of Cuban immigration to the US, you can read Felix Masud-Piloto's \*From Welcomed Exiles to Illegal Immigrants: Cuban Migration to the U.S., 1959-1995\*. For a broader history of the Cuban Revolution that covers this kind of thing, check out Aviva Chomsky's \*A History of the Cuban Revolution\*. I'm also more than happy to make even more specialized bibliography recommendations but for the purposes of this specific question I don't think it's necessary because the idea that slavery survived into the 1950s is patently false.	1642812830.0	htofebo	t3_s7bj7c	t3_s7bj7c	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7bj7c/why_did_it_take_as_long_as_the_cuban_revolution/htofebo/

653zd	This was a great answer! The few Marxists I know IRL had always led me to believe historical materialism was wholly discredited, so I’ll have to look into some of those sources.  Also, I hope this question isn’t too far afield, but would you recommend *The Making of the English Working Class* to someone looking for a broad introduction to early 19th-century British leftism, or is there a more recent book along similar lines that I should read instead? It’s been on my reading list for a long time, but I somehow never realized it was as old as it was. If it matters, I’m not a historian or coming from an academic background, but am comfortable reading denser/less accessible books as well as stuff written for the general public.	1642813568.0	htoh66g	t3_s8nnvk	t1_htka2ao	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htoh66g/

izvvt	*The making of the English working class* is usually required reading for a lot of historiography classes for first or second-year graduate history students. It's a bit of a tome and is quite dense, but as you said, if that's not something that bothers you, I'd give it a read. It's considered a pretty integral part of Marxist historiography and Thompson makes a strong argument, in my opinion, about how class formation is not just some sporadic thing that happens when certain economic conditions are met but instead, class consciousness is something that people form themselves and that elements of human relationships with one's own class are incredibly important.   Labor relations in England is not my field so I can't really recommend anything specific, but Thompsons' work is still referenced by a lot of Marxist and Non-Marxists historians.  I would say there are few pure historical materialists historians, but Marxism and its theories for history have evolved a lot over the past 60 years and that brings in a lot of mixing Marxist theories with other forms of historiography. I would recommend the Joan Scott book in my answer to anyone, even non-gender historians because it's incredibly powerful at showing the history and analytical structures of gender history and how it can be combined with other theories as well.	1642815292.0	htolbmh	t3_s8nnvk	t1_htoh66g	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8nnvk/is_marxian_historical_materialism_of_any/htolbmh/

8ea0h	So there are a few things to break down here. First with the Manhattan project it is impossible to uncouple it from the economy. The cost of the Nuclear project was on par with the cost of all small arms material not including ammunition by the US in WW2. Such a program is incredibly challenging to undertake without a strong economy. Also timing is important. By the time the fruits of the Manhattan project were deployed the war in Europe had been won and the outcome of the war in the pacific was no longer in doubt. The  All that was left was a question of how long the war would go on and how its length would affect the post war geopolitics as well as total casualties. As far as casualties u/restricteddata put together a pretty complete answer here [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q6cmsw/the\_estimated\_american\_casualties\_for\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/q6cmsw/the_estimated_american_casualties_for_the/).  &#x200B;  That leaves the code talkers which is a lot harder to quantify. Would the lack of code talkers have meant the US and allies lost WW2? Highly unlikely. There were only around 400 code talkers by the end of the war so many messages were still transmitted in other codes and languages yet operations without the code talkers still managed to succeed in their objectives. Yet the personnel anecdotes of those who served with them were very flattering of the code talkers. The signal officer of the 5th Marine division was quoted saying “Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.” Of course you have to take into account that this is an individual whos primary mission and focus is around communications and keeping them secure so his view of the code talkers is going to be influenced by that.  &#x200B;  So long story short, yes the economy was most likely more important then the code talkers and was for sure both essential to and overall more important then the Manhattan project.	1642815546.0	htolx1m	t3_s9olx6	t3_s9olx6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9olx6/did_new_mexico_play_a_crucial_role_in_the_outcome/htolx1m/

9c89xxn	To me, the examples you offered seem more illustrative of a lack of science, not the history of science. Anyone who's been in a rainfall knows that particles a lot bigger than 5 microns can travel farther than 6 feet. Perhaps the issue had been politicized already, as the WHO was at many points during COVID. Enforcing separation of over 6 feet essentially means shutting down all businesses and other establishments, which carries severe economic impact. Not to mention logistic problems such as how will people eat if grocery stores are closed.  It may have been policy issued from higher up in the organization to recommend 6 feet, which the folks lower down had to repeat. Or perhaps it was a more complicated issue, like "sure, particles bigger than 5 microns can travel that far, but those bigger particles will be trapped by the mask we're also asking people to wear, so it's the small ones that pass through makeshift masks that are the bigger concern." Or maybe "of course 6 feet of separation don't stop transmission, but our epidemiologists calculated that they will decrease transmission by this percentage and bring the R value down to more manageable levels." Bureaucracies have many levels of obfuscation, some of which are even well-intentioned in their own opinion. Of course, I am opposed to all levels of obfuscation because lies and half-truths eventually get discovered and lead to loss of credibility. Not to mention, the public isn't as stupid as some bureaucrats think, and can often make sense of complex information without the need to oversimplify it.  Returning to the topic, as I said, I am totally in favor of teaching the history of science. The question addressed the narrower point of teaching it in science classes. Or even narrower, where I explained in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htlfhc1/) that it was to a particular formulation of what teaching it involves.  I do agree that science needs to be more widely disseminated, which (besides science class at school) is usually done through popular books, documentaries, science journalism. I totally support all those endeavors; I've written a few science articles for the general public myself.	1642817587.0	htoqr0x	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htnjvbq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htoqr0x/

bkb37	I immediately thought of the Russian Revolution as well, and hopefully in a way that accurately captures the process of bureaucratization. The last thing I want is another *Trotsky* miniseries. I want a complex, embattled, hard-nosed and rhetorically ruthless but also kind and cheerful Lenin, you know, a gray blur efficient bureaucrat Stalin, and i want to see them slowly and anguishedly coming to the belief that they need to centralize the party and raise production and then institute the NEP to save the revolution. And if we're talking unlimited budget, I want the Red Army capturing Ungern-Sternberg in a thousand-yurt city in the middle of the most vast Mongolian grassland you can imagine, thousands of soldiers charging through a snowstorm across the Gulf of Finland towards Kronstadt, and a NEP-era jazz scene to rival Babylon Berlin.	1642818320.0	htoshlx	t3_s9bcte	t1_htmgadd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9bcte/friday_freeforall_january_21_2022/htoshlx/
4qz6gnsm	I can tell you to begin with that the question is going to be impossible to answer for a couple of reasons.  The first is that there is no existing record of the inception of any language from scratch.  The vast majority of evidence for Proto Indo European for example is lexical in nature rather than grammatical on a discourse scale because it is all extrapolated from a variety of different modern languages rather than having a primary source we can refer to.  The best we’ve got is that PIE was very likely to be inflectional and probably had a default Subject-Object-Verb word order.  Probably.  The second is because ‘complex’ in terms of comparing one language to another is kind of a vague notion.  Within a single language we talk about certain things being ‘marked’ as a kind of way to distinguish between what is basic and what is more complex, but that doesn’t really work cross linguistically.  For example, Japanese has a rather unusual alignment split from a typologically common nominative/accusative system to a less common direct/inverse system for their give/receive verbs.  This is notoriously difficult for new learners of the language and could be considered ‘complex’, but native speakers have no issue with it and it is productive and usable in every day life.  English speakers think it’s weird and complex; Japanese speakers think it’s just normal.    So that means that English uses a more simple system for expressing those same concepts right?  Well…no.  English has its own mess regarding primary and secondary objects and more vs. less marked structures.  For example, why can I say both “I gave a present to him” and “I gave him a present.”?  What is the difference on a functional level and which is more complex or basic?  Why am I not saying “I gave a present him” or “I gave to him a present”?  Why is that little ‘to’ so meaningful one way or the other?  It can be difficult for non-native speakers to master, but a native speaker might not even think about it because it feels so simple that it isn’t even noticeable to them.  Japanese doesn’t have this kind of distinction at all, so I’m that sense is less ‘complex.’  What I’m trying to explain, perhaps poorly, is that relative “complexity” of a language isn’t really a measurable thing, even when comparing a language to older versions of itself.  Each linguistic feature is connected to all others within the language and can’t be singled out and analyzed in a vacuum.  Language change over time is driven by the opposing forces of distinctiveness vs ease.  Humans are lazy, so they want to pronounce words as easily as they can and use as few words arranged as simply as possible as they can get away with, but at the same time they want to be unambiguously understood.  ‘Complexity’ typically comes from a need to disambiguate or create contrast.  This is one of the things that drives language change over time, so languages often trend towards simplicity via weird routes that create new complexity.  “Today’s morphology is yesterday’s syntax” is a fun quote I remember hearing a long time ago.  To give a current example, English has what is basically a syntactic future tense marker in the words “going to”, for example “I’m going to do this.”  Because we’re lazy, we often slur this into “I’m gunna do this” and everyone understands us.  But if “gunna” is just “going to” slurred together, why can’t you say “I’m gunna the store”?  This is grammaticalization and language change happening in front of us as “gunna” is splitting off from “going to” and becoming its own distinct form.  English currently has no future tense affix, but I have high hopes that hundreds of years from now we will be sticking the na- of “gunna” onto the beginnings of verbs to indicate future intent.  Or maybe it will die off.  No way to know right now.  I think I’ve gone way into left field about linguistics on a history sub, and my apologies for that.  My only defense of myself is that historical linguistics is my favorite linguistics, and language change over time is fascinating.  I would recommend reading more about the field of historical syntax and grammaticalization if this sounds interesting.  Thom Givon’s ‘Syntax’ and ‘Functionalism and Grammar’ are old favorites of mine that touch on the subject while also providing a much broader context for understanding it.  Some of the more focused literature might be a little obtuse without that context.  If you’re interested in the history of change over time in English (and English is the most absurd mutt of a language so there’s a lot to this) ‘A History of the English Language’ by Albert Baugh is good and maybe more in line with the spirit of this sub.  I am afraid I don’t have a recommendation for any literature that discusses the history of the discovery and development of our understanding of Proto Indo European from around the 1650’s when the idea of a common ancestor to a lot of languages first started appearing through modern times- if anyone does have such a recommendation I would be interested in reading it.	1642818344.0	htosjlf	t3_s9pspb	t3_s9pspb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9pspb/languages_seem_to_have_been_much_more_complex/htosjlf/

fz8r3	There was for about 15 years.  You can see [a couple answers to a related previous question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8tstbi/why_has_america_decided_youre_old_enough_to_vote/) on this by /u/BlossumButtDixie and /u/needledknitter which runs through the basic overview here.  In short, many states lowered the drinking age to 18 in concert with the 26th Amendment, road fatalities rose substantially in the 16-20 age bracket over the next decade, and a successful lobbying effort in the early 1980s prompted federal legislation to 'suggest' to states to raise it back by cutting off highway funds if they didn't.  South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two holdouts that finally folded in 1988; both did so extremely reluctantly but given the massive amount of their budgets that they'd lose they had no choice, which was the intention of the legislation.  For once, I'll make the rare choice to use three Wikipedia maps to illustrate the progression since they're vastly easier to see exactly how this worked (and since it's Friday and I really need a drink myself, also vastly easier than copying tables and formatting them for reddit.)  Here's [1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state#/media/File:Legal_drinking_age_in_1969.png), [1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state#/media/File:Legal_drinking_age_in_1975.png), and [1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state#/media/File:Legal_drinking_age_in_1983.png).  Note the West Coast being at 21 through all of this; this had a bit to do with both leftover alliances between the Progressive and Prohibition movements - one of my favorite pre-18th Amendment laws by the states was an 1873 one creating a 2 mile dry zone around UC Berkeley, which apparently worked well enough so it was expanded to other institutions of higher education - as well as concern over drinking off military bases by very junior enlisted that had to do with their experiences of World War II, like the [Zoot Suit Riots](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qo2gbr/during_school_i_was_taught_that_the_us_saw_world/hjvwvbd/).  While the lead up to Prohibition and then (more relevant to this question) its repeal created a whole state-by-state patchwork of changes to the drinking age as a whole and is more of a top level question, [this is a useful gif](https://vinepair.com/features/external/minimum-drinking-age-map.gif) that gives an overview of year by year changes since 1933.  A few interesting things from it: Oklahoma didn't allow hard liquor sales until 1959 for anyone (discriminatory policies against Native Americans played a huge role in this - they were legally barred from drinking off reservation until after World War II), Kansas didn't repeal Prohibition until 1949 (the Anti-Saloon League had strong support in it long before Prohibition - Charles Curtis made his early career enforcing state Prohibition laws as early as the 1880s) and Mississippi didn't repeal Prohibition until 1966, although that had far more to do with being able to selectively enforce it against African Americans as a Jim Crow law than not allowing Whites to drink.  Also a top level question is the whole history of the 26th Amendment; I've written very briefly on it before, but its history really dates back all the way to the late 1800s when Republicans started initiating voter registration laws to suppress Democratic turnout in the North, Midwest, and West; as such, it had a very different origin and supporters than Prohibition.  What changed in the late 1960s was both the the moral argument about the disenfranchisement of servicemembers in Vietnam as well as a belief by both parties that the very loud political activities by young Boomers would translate into electoral gains for their own party if they were just allowed to vote.  As it turned out, the latter belief was dramatically disproved over the years as the 18-25 cohort has been at a historically significant turnout deficit to other age groups.  It is probably fair to view some of the lowering of drinking ages following its adoption as political calculus to try to appeal to that hard-to-reach demographic, but unfortunately off the top of my head I don't know any sources that cover lobbying efforts and the history of the drinking age legislation introduced in the early 1970s that would provide good evidence of this.	1642819070.0	htou9va	t3_s9iuqi	t3_s9iuqi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9iuqi/the_us_lowered_the_federal_voting_age_to_18_in/htou9va/

3ovw7qc2	Russia permanently occupied eastern Europe after WWII, the west did not approve of this as these countries had always been free nations before WWII. This is what basically immideatly fired off the cold war, some would say the cold war already started before Berlin was even occupied with both armies rushing to be the first to capture it.   Ukraine is different having a lot of common history with Russia and having been part of the Russian empire prior to WWII. Ukrainians were nicknamed "little Russians" by Russia. That is not to say Russia and Ukraine were real buddies, as there were several instances where Ukraine tried to become independent.  Russia did a lot to supress Ukrainian culture+ language and of course there was also holodomor which did not help their relationship.   I think the only thing that both instances have in common is that the west feels countries should be able to pick their own destiny and that the west worries that Russia will once again try to dominate (parts of) eastern Europe trough hard and soft power.	1642820640.0	htoxzpp	t3_s9rjmb	t3_s9rjmb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9rjmb/how_does_the_current_situation_with_russia/htoxzpp/
9c89xxn	>The Wired article I linked is a good read. It answers this question and all of your hypotheticals.  I did read the article, and found no answers.  >it's about a woman who was already researching the 100 micron misconception a decade before COVID and her difficulties in convincing other scientists  On the contrary, it says she had no difficulties convincing other scientists, **until COVID**. It says that (a different branch of) WHO had no problem accepting that big particles hang around much longer, they had been accepting it for 20 years, but a different part of the WHO objected when the same argument was applied to COVID.  The article is a bit more ambiguous on other points, such as whether the person who was rude to her was actually a medical scientist. They use the generic term "experts", but WHO has "experts" from many fields, some unrelated to medicine or science. It's also non-specific about which medical textbooks she read that claim aerosol transmission doesn't occur via droplets bigger than 5 microns, because I looked up a couple of my textbooks on infectious diseases, and they don't make that claim at all.  Regardless, none of this relates to my objections. I am in favor of teaching more science, I am in favor of teaching more history of science. My initial comment was simply the observation that these are two different fields, and an expert in one is very likely not knowledgeable about the other. Furthermore, the focus in science class is to trace the evolution of a scientific idea, so any history they provide tends to be related to that rather than to its societal impact.  This would have been the end of it, because that's all I really had to say on the topic, but the discussion continued when I got the response "that legendary scientist whose theory you just learned published a bunch of shitty papers", because it doesn't seem relevant to science, it's more a "your idol has feet of clay" or "everyone's an asshole" kind of statement; saying more about the speaker than the science. From the science perspective, were those papers really "shitty", and if so, in what way?  As you say, it's unfortunate that the conversation has strayed into other areas, but that's how free-form discussions go, without a buzzer reminding us when we stray. I'll desist, I've already said pretty much what I wanted to say on the topic, anything else should probably involve a different forum since we seem to be abusing this one.	1642820928.0	htoyo3f	t3_s8kqxq	t1_htot94m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kqxq/how_should_i_do_history_as_a_scientist/htoyo3f/
4vpin	>  I hesitate to call any relationship with such a disparate power dynamic "true love,"  Not specifically to your position but do historians generally dismiss the possibility of "true love" in a disparate power dynamic ?   Human beings often seem to have multiple reasons and feelings mixed. Makes me wonder what is the definition of "true love" and the other gradations of love and if it is even useful to frame it like that.	1642820944.0	htoypgx	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htdd3de	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htoypgx/

8brve	Just a note — crediting New Mexico with the entire Manhattan Project is no more justified than crediting Washington State, or California, or Tennessee, with it. Many states made huge contributions to the project. The New Mexico component was substantial, but it is not necessarily "important" in the sense that if it had not taken place in New Mexico, it wouldn't have taken place elsewhere. There had been alternative sites considered for Los Alamos, there were even alternative sites considered for the Trinity test. New Mexico was largely chosen for its role in the Manhattan Project because Robert Oppenheimer had been there several times and liked it.	1642822141.0	htp1gff	t3_s9olx6	t3_s9olx6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9olx6/did_new_mexico_play_a_crucial_role_in_the_outcome/htp1gff/

hyiwj	I work in a fairly major museum, and let me tell you that "mundane" describes a pretty significant chunk of our collection. But don't discount the historical value of something mundane. Exciting, exceptional, noteworthy events and objects are a very small percentage of history. Pretty much all of human history occurred on everyday days.  My advice would be to write out absolutely everything you know about how your grandfather got the objects, even if that's just what you put in your post, take photos of as much of it as you can, and get in touch with any major museums nearby, or one that's big enough to be able to organise to have them picked up.	1642822761.0	htp2vbi	t3_s9qsbu	t3_s9qsbu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qsbu/how_do_i_ethically_get_rid_of_inherited_nazi/htp2vbi/

47g7nn0v	The main source is Venetus A which is a somewhat convoluted medieval manuscript containing (among other things) an excerpt from a much earlier work by someone named Proclus. This gives descriptions for every work in the Epic Cycle except for the Cypria which it did have at some point, but Venetus A was damaged and the Cypria description lost.   There are passing references to various parts of the Epic Cycle in other ancient works, but none tell us so much about the plots as Venetus A which is why the loss of the Cypria description is so annoying. We do have a fairly good idea of what happens as well as about fifty lines of the actual text, but there are still bits and pieces that we don’t know about.	1642829263.0	htpg9yq	t3_s99g43	t1_htpcikj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s99g43/whats_the_actual_possibility_that_there_are_still/htpg9yq/
hxfc4	As it happens, there is no direct mention of a right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution, amendments, or federal law although you are right that in many legal contexts privacy is talked about as a right. Probably the most interesting part of the discussion to be had here are all the *different* contexts in which something called privacy might come up and how it is conceptualized slightly differently in each but that's probably more interesting from a legal/philosophical view than a historical one. What's important to recognize is that *recognizing* a right is done by legislation or the courts and, in the US it was done by the courts.  The first really significant legal salvo in this direction was *The Right to Privacy* an article by Samuel D. Warren and the (incredibly influential and respected) Louis D. Brandeis published in the Harvard Law Review, Vol. 4, No. 5 (Dec. 15, 1890).   "It is our purpose to consider whether the existing law affords a principle which can properly be invoked to protect the privacy of the individual; and, if it does, what the nature and extent of such protection is." *id.* at 197. Before concluding that the law did, already, protect privacy the authors spoke of the "necessity" of privacy rights as the modern world of the 1890s was too hectic, with a press too invasive, for a person to navigate without some private retreat. As happens often in common law legal systems, the authors looked at prior case law for their point, largely drawing the right to privacy from **property** rights cases, specifically ones where someone asked the courts to prevent the dissemination of images taken of them (among these being *Prince Albert* [yes, THAT Prince Albert] *v. Strange*, 1 McN. & G. 25 (1849) regarding some private etchings the mere possession thereof was seen as a breach of privacy).  I'm not sure how interesting the various legal arguments they trace out are to you (can go into that if you'd like) but, to oversimplify almost to the point of taking it out of the legal realm, the article concluded at various points that while courts *claimed* to be resting their decisions on a property rights to images, or trade secrets, it was really the right to privacy which was driving these outcomes. Cites to property rights were a fig leaf of precedent the courts were using to get to just decisions, but the decisions were felt to be just because someone's privacy, not property, rights were violated.  Having concluded that we already recognize privacy rights, the authors then try to define the actual boundaries of this right (e.g. "The right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest." *id.*), and suggest some remedies, drawn from existing causes of action for defamation. Essentially they try to make it easy for the courts to start to openly recognize this right by providing them with tests and limits to it so the judges don't have to do it for themselves (and can cite the esteemed Brandeis in doing so).   So that's the first significant legal push for a legally recognized right to privacy in the US. Two things to notice. First - the authors first talk about the positive outcomes having a right to privacy would lead to and only then suggest that such a right has been there all along, if hiding behind the euphemism of property rights. Second - the discussion doesn't mention or rely on the U.S. Constitution generally or, more specifically, its Fourth Amendment. Although the right of the people to be secure in their papers from unreasonable government search and seizure sure sounds like the right to keep stuff private from the government, the start of the argument for property rights was to found it in English common law almost exclusively.  This was not the case with the Supreme Court decisions which 1) formally recognized a right to privacy; and 2) grounded that right in its interpretation of the U.S. Constitution rather than in common law.   The first of these is the little-talked-about today but in retrospect critically consequential decision *Pierce v. Society of Sisters*, 268 U.S. 510 (1925), where the State of Oregon tried to mandate every student attend public schools with no exceptions, and attempted to prohibit private schooling. The Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary was a private religious school that challenged the law on various grounds including that the law interfered with its property rights (there they are again) because its grounds were only suitable to be used as a school so outlawing that use amounted to taking their property (also outlawing the contracts between parents and school amounted to interference with right to contract). The court began by saying that, as a corporation, the school didn't get constitutional due process protections for its contracts if they were impaired by proper government action. But, looking to property law cases, the Court concluded that the Oregon law was *not* proper in that it interfered with freedoms of families and school.   The reason this case is such a huge deal is that this was the very first time the Supreme Court recognized 1) 14th amendment due process protected individual civil liberties; and 2) the first time the court explicitly (instead of in *dicta*) recognized constitutional rights applying to corporations.  The seminal case to truly cement privacy as a Constitutional right was Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), which held a Connecticut law criminalizing contraception illegal for violating the Constitutional Right to Privacy. The Court famously found this right in the 'penumbrae' of the amendments to the Constitution (1, 3, 4, 5, and 9, specifically). In doing so it cited past cases where Constitutional rights were held to have penumbrae. In *Griswold* the Court discussed how, for example, inherent to the freedom of association is the right to be private in who you associate with, how inherent in the 4th amendment's protection is the right to keep your papers private, etc. It concluded that making contraception illegal violated the right to "marital privacy."  It was about 75 years from the first article about a right to privacy until it was central to a major Supreme Court holding. Whether you consider that long or not, it doesn't seem to have been much of a battle - it was a right that was slowly recognized by the courts rather through a big public debate. The consequences and extent of that right to privacy **after** it was recognized is where the real debate and battle appears to have been, with it underpinning *Roe v. Wade* (and progeny) and *Lawrence v. Texas* (holding anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional).	1642829432.0	htpglg0	t3_s9gyk2	t3_s9gyk2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9gyk2/the_us_recognizes_a_right_to_privacy_how_did_we/htpglg0/
12vbngri	The south of Mexico was the least westernized region of Mexico. The Spanish during the colonial era didn’t conquer the Maya until the 18th century. Even then, their grip on power in the Yucatán peninsula was always weak and superficial.   It’s also important to note that the Maya are an enduring civilization and put up a big fight against the Spaniards. Spain always had a hard time “colonizing” Maya.	1642829771.0	htph95k	t3_s3loje	t3_s3loje	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s3loje/the_yucatan_peninsula_has_a_higher_rate_of_native/htph95k/

cs3ziqy3	The earliest domestication of animals (goats, pigs, sheep, cows) has been traced back to about 12 000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent (Catal Huyuk comes to mind). Other animals in other regions followed. The domestication of the Llama in Peru (~6 000 years ago) indicates the process happened independently, in multiple locations.  The linguistic evidence suggests that horse domestication in Eurasia was complete around 5000 BCE, when the Steppe Peoples brought horses and the Proto-Indo-European language to Europe.  Assuming that horses on the "American" Continent went extinct 10 000 years ago, there is not much of a "window" for domestication.	1642829861.0	htphffc	t3_s462tw	t1_hth8csg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s462tw/native_americans_and_horses_were_both_in_america/htphffc/

They also had a program started around 2010 to bring in Western (mainly American) teachers to work across the country: Teach and Learn with Georgia, or TLG. Though the plan was to have thousands of them, I think it peaked at a couple hundred (I was part of that program myself in 2014). After Saakashvili left office TLG was largely ignored by the government, who came from the opposition party.	1642830479.0	htpil8h	t3_s68982	t1_htp1hap	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htpil8h/

2tq3ork	It is something humans did around the world in a lot of places, but not in *all* times and places, and the factors that lead up to domestication events are one of those hotly debated things with no clear answer.    In fact, one theory (among many) is that the loss of megafauna made hunting much less rewarding and nudged humans towards the more effort-intensive strategies that eventually - in some places - led to domestication of crops and animals.

5zv5y	Based on the uniforms pictured and the machine gun, there are only two possibilities, Belgian or French. By 1917 (the year is written at the top of the first photo), the Belgian army had shifted to a khaki uniform cut in the style of the French uniform (though officer uniforms resembled that of British officers). The second photo contains the most clues as to the army of origin. The soldiers pictures including your Great Grandfather show them wearing Adrian helmets, the standard issue helmet for both the French and Belgian armies as of 1915. The same photo shows the soldiers posing with the *Fusil mitrailleur modele 1915 CSRG* or *Chauchat*, a notoriously poor quality light machine gun produced  by the French and was supplied to the Belgians.   The second photo shows a hint of the right most soldier's boot and to me it doesn't look French to my eye. The French, post-1915, utilised puttees to protect the wearer's feet form water. These were strips of cloth that would be wrapped tightly from the ankle to just below the knee, sealing the top of the boot. The Belgians instead used leather gaiters that would be buckled around the ankle and lower leg to achieve a similar result. I think I can see a hint of leather gaiter in the group photo. That and the cut of the great coat strongly suggests Belgian to me but I cannot not be 100% certain.	1642836562.0	htpsol5	t3_s9sn6i	t3_s9sn6i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9sn6i/does_anybody_know_anything_about_this_ww1_uniform/htpsol5/

a107fowh	One of the oddities of Pearl Harbor was that two Americans taught the Japanese to do it.  The second was President Theodore Roosevelt, who cheered on the Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Squadron at the Battle of Port Arthur of 8–9 February 1904. Ten Japanese motor torpedo boats made a surprise night attack inside the port, but the damage was limited by anti-torpedo nets and shore batteries that began to pound the Japanese into beating a hasty retreat.  The first was US Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan (September 27, 1840 – December 1, 1914) was a United States naval officer, historian, and, according to John Keegan "the most important American strategist of the nineteenth century."  His book *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History*, 1660–1783 (1890) was translated by Kanô Jigorô, the founder of *jûdô,* and his colleagues at the *Kaiji Kyôkai* Maritime Affairs Association within months of its publication; eventually many if not most of Mahan's works were translated into Japanese and were very influential upon the development of the Imperial Japanese Navy, where his concepts and histories were taught at all levels of professional development.  Mahan's strategic theory has been shortened from the three volumes essentially to  the concentration of a nation's fleet in order to seek out and destroy the enemy fleet in a decisive naval battle. Decisive naval battle in the early days of the 20th century meant large surface combatants, which were limited in the arms treaties Japan adhered to until the final one expired.  Only late in the game did the Japanese get interested in naval aviation - when then Captain Yamamoto Isoroku went to his assignment as the Japanese naval attaché (essentially an openly declared intelligence collector) for the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C., from 1926 to 1927, his predecessor advised him to pay attention to what the Americans were doing with naval aviation. His predecessor went back to Japan and become the brains behind Japan's naval aviation effort.  Mahan's 'decisive naval battle' in part led the Japanese to focus on large surface combatants, the culmination of which was the Yamato class super battleships. One aspect of their strategic planning was the correlation of forces - some Japanese took 1936 as the optimal time to attack the US Navy, when a number of new Japanese capital ships came online and before the production capability of America could be used to overpower Japan.  The focus on surface warfare diverted resources from other assets that probably would have served the Japanese better. The Yamato class superbattleships were hugely expensive, but obsolete before their keels were laid down.  Others have written well on the 'logic' or lack of it, but at some level it was meant to weaken the US Pacific Fleet before the 'decisive battle', no matter how unlikely it looks in retrospect. But Yamamoto himself warned against attacking Pearl Harbor; his time in America convinced him that Japan could never outproduce America if it mobilized its massive resources and industry.	1642830938.0	htpjf0k	t3_s8r0wm	t3_s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/htpjf0k/

tpoig	THANK YOU for this post.  I am usually the first one chiming on on donating them. You can get credit or donate anonymously and usually write off the value of the donated materials on your taxes.  Your job now is as u/Sir_Lord_Brit said, doing some homework on documentation about the person, the man and his military career, and how and where he got them and they came to you. (My neighbor was a secretary and stenographer during the trials.) This is all provenance and the context is needed for intellectual as well as legal reasons.  Then you will do some research into WWII museums, [there are a number of them out there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:World_War_II_museums_in_the_United_States), and specifically look for ones with strong archives. And, of course, there is always the Smithsonian, National Archives, and Presidential Libraries (NARA). Stanford and Harvard Law also have major collections specifically about the trials. Then look into their archive holdings for other Nuremberg materials or maybe even collections related to your g-g-grandfather's unit. (If you need help, DM me. I will need the details though. I have helped many manuscript materials get to good collections.)  Then you could pick one, or a few, and send them details about the collection to gauge their interest. They will know what will best fit with their collecting policy and what they can support and have room for. Where it eventually goes might depend on how much material there is and how complete it is as a research collection.  And if they turn it down, it is usually due to how it works with their collections—don't take it personally—but it will find a home.	1642828054.0	htpdy08	t3_s9qsbu	t1_htp2vbi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9qsbu/how_do_i_ethically_get_rid_of_inherited_nazi/htpdy08/

jh6xg	It seems you are asking about the background and reasons of anti-Jewish and/or antisemitic sentiment throughout history. Posts of this type are common on the subreddit, so we have this reply which is intended as a general response that provides an overview of the history of antisemitic thought and action.     The essential point that needs to be emphasized: the reason for anti-Jewish hatred and persecution has absolutely nothing to do with things Jewish men and women did, said or thought. Religious and racial persecution is not the fault of the victim but of the persecutor and antisemitism, like all prejudices, is inherently irrational. Framing history in a manner that places the reason for racial hatred with its victims is a technique frequently employed by racists to justify their hateful ideology.     The reasons why Jews specifically were persecuted, expelled, and discriminated against throughout mainly European history can vary greatly depending on time and place, but there are overarching historical factors that can help us understand the historical persecution of Jews - mainly that they often were the only minority available to scapegoat.     Christian majority societies as early as the Roman empire had an often strained and complicated relationship with the Jewish population that lived within their borders. Christian leaders instituted a policy that simultaneously included grudging permissions for Jews to live in certain areas and practice their faith under certain circumstances but at the same time subjected them to discriminatory measures such as restrictions where they could live and what professions they could practice. The Christian Churches – Catholic, Orthodox, and later Protestant – also begrudgingly viewed the Jews as the people of the Old Testament but used their dominant roles in society to make the Jewish population the target of intense proselytization and *other* them further by preaching their fault for the death of Jesus.    This dynamic meant that Jews were the most easily recognizable and visible minority to point fingers at during a crisis. This can be best observed with the frequent accusations of "blood libel" – an anti-Semitic canard alleging that Jews murdered Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals – in situations where Christian children or adults disappeared, the communal panic immediately channeling itself as Jew-hatred with tragic results. Similarly, religious, ideological, and economic reasons were often interwoven in the expulsion of Jews to whom medieval rulers and kings owed a lot of money; in fact, one intersection of crisis-blaming and financial motive occurred during the Black Death, when local rulers were able to cynically blame Jews for the plague as an excuse for murdering and expelling them.      These processes also often took place within negotiations between social and political elites over state formation. One of the best examples is the expulsion of the Jewish population from Spain by the rulers of Castile and Aragon after the Reconquista in 1491. Expulsion and forcible conversions progressed toward an institutionalized suspicion towards so-called New Christians – Jews who’d recently converted– based on their "blood". This was an unprecedented element in antisemitic attitudes that some scholars place within the context of Spanish rulers and nobility becoming engaged in a rather brutal state formation process. In order to define themselves, they chose to define and get rid of a group they painted as alien, foreign and different in a negative way – as the "other". Once again Jews were the easily available minority.     Jews long remained in this position of only available religious minority, and over time they were often made very visible as such: discriminatory measures introduced very early on included being forced to wear certain hats and clothing, be part of humiliating rituals, pay onerous taxes, live in restricted areas of towns – ghettos – and be separated from the majority population. All this further increased the sense of “other-ness” that majority societies experienced toward the Jews. They were made into the other by such measures.     This continued with the advent of modernity, especially in the context of nationalism. The 19th century is marked by a huge shift in ways to explain the world, especially in regards to factors such as nationalism, race, and science. To break it down to the essentials: the French Revolution and its aftermath delegitimized previously established explanations for why the world was the way it was – a new paradigm of “rationalism” took hold. People would now seek to explain differences in social organizations and ways of living between the various peoples of the world with this new paradigm.     Out of this endeavor to explain why people were different soon emerged what we today understand as modern racism, meaning not just theories on why people are different but constructing a dichotomy of worth out of these differences.    A shift took place from a religious othering to one based more on nationality - and thereby, in the minds of many, on race. In the tradition of *völkisch* thought, as formulated by thinkers such as Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, races as the main historical actors were seen as acting through the nation. Nations were their tool or outlet to take part in Social Darwinist competition between the races. The Jews were seen as a race without a nation - as their own race, which dates back to them being imperial subjects and older stereotypes of them as "the other" - and therefore acting internationally rather than nationally. Seen through this nationalistic lens, an individual Jew living in Germany, for example, was not seen as German but was seen as having no nation. For such Jews, this meant that the Jewish emancipation that Enlightenment brought provided unprecedented freedom and removed many of the barriers that they had previously experienced, the advent of scientific racism and volkisch thought meant that new barriers and prejudices simply replaced them.     Racist thinkers of the 19th century augmented these new barriers and prejudices with conspiratorial thinking. The best example for this antisemitic delusion are the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, a fake political treatise produced by the Tsarist Secret Police at some point in 1904/05 which pretends to be the minutes of a meeting of the leaders of a Jewish world conspiracy discussing plans to get rid of all the world's nations and take over the world. While the Protocols were quickly debunked as a forgery, they had a huge impact on many antisemitic and *völkisch* thinkers in Europe, including some whose writings were most likely read by the young Hitler.     The whole trope of the Jewish conspiracy as formulated by *völkisch* thought took on a whole new importance in the late 1910s, with the end of WWI, the Bolshevik revolution, and subsequent attempts at communist revolution in Germany and elsewhere. Jews during the 19th century had often embraced ideologies such as (classical) liberalism and communism, because they hoped these ideologies would propagate a world in which it didn’t matter whether you were a Jew or not. However, the idea of Jews being a driving force behind communism was clearly designed by Tsarist secret police and various racists in the Russian Empire as a way to discredit communism as an ideology. This trope of Jews being the main instigators behind communism and Bolshevism subsequently spread from the remnants of Tsarist Russia over the central powers all the way to Western Europe.      This delusion of an internationalist conspiracy would finally result in the Nazis’ Holocaust killing vast numbers of Jews and those made Jews by the Nazi’s racial laws. While this form of antisemitism lost some of its mass appeal in the years after 1945, forms of it still live on, mostly in the charge of conspiracy so central to the modern form of antisemitism: from instances such as the Moscow doctors’ trial, to prevalent discourses about Jews belonging to no nation, to discourses related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to the recent surges of antisemitic violence in various states – antisemitism didn’t disappear after the end of the Holocaust. Even the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the conspiratorial pamphlet debunked soon after it was written at the beginning of the 20th century, has been consistently in print throughout the world ever since.    Again, anti-Jewish persecution has never been caused by something the Jews did, said, or thought. It was and is caused by the hatred, delusions, and irrational prejudices harbored by those who carried out said persecution. After centuries of standing out due to religious and alleged racial difference, without defenders and prevented from defending themselves, Jews stood out as almost an ideal “other.” Whether the immediate cause at various points has been religious difference, conspiracy theory, ancestral memory of hatred, or simply obvious difference, Jews were and continue to be targeted by those who adhere to ideologies of hatred.

3qdt4v79	Barbarossa actually largely performed as expected it was prepared not by Hilter but by the German High Command so trained Generals.  The chief issue was poor intelligence and wishful thinking when that intelligence was found to be poor. Barbarossa was built around poor intelligence on the strength of the Soviets, particularly on the scale of their reserves, and wishful thinking based on a campaign plan that had mortgaged Germany's entire future on a war that would be over in 1941 and so made any suggestion of one that might stretch into 1942 and beyond unacceptable.                The poor intelligence dogged the Germans from the start and by August of 1941 it was clear to the Germans that their assessments of Soviet strength had been badly, and systemically, off. The Soviets continued to oppose the German invasion despite losses far greater than German intelligence had predicted they possessed and with troops and equipment that had come as complete surprises to the Germans. For example, pre-war estimates put the Soviet tank park at 10,000 vehicles, less than half its actual total. From the start, the Germans knew their intelligence on Soviet strength contained huge gaps and was constructed largely out of inference. It was also continually being revised upward. In August of 1940, when planning for Barbarossa began, the Germans estimated 170 Soviet divisions opposing their invasion. By February of 1941 this number had crept up to 180, but as pre-attack reconnaissance intensified it ballooned to 226 by the time of the invasion in June, as the Germans continually discovered heretofore unknown enemy formations. This level of new discovery clearly indicated the inadequacy of the intelligence but the Germans took their chances and attacked anyway.                Writing in early August, seven weeks into the invasion, OKH chief Franz Halder noted explicitly how badly they had underestimated the Soviets. Despite this awareness, the Germans continued to accept optimistic assessments that this time the Soviets were on their last legs. In September, they underestimated Soviet reserves before launching Operation Typhoon and then in October they overestimated the effect of the initial (admittedly amazing) success they achieved at Vyazma and Briansk in wiping out another half-a-million Soviet soldiers. This led them to conclude that Moscow was now theirs for the taking, and led to a string of poor decisions. German leaders would subsequently point out that the intelligence in October was telling them the Russians were finished but by then they should have known that such intelligence was based on guesses that had already been shown to be regularly wrong.                One of the reasons for this serial wishful thinking by the Germans was because doing otherwise would be admitting defeat, not just of the 1941 campaign, but for Germany and the entire war. By the summer of 1941 the German Reich, for all its size, was a precarious house of cards. Resources were stretched and the Germans needed a quick victory over the Soviets to allow them to demobilize a large chunk of the army, save on ammunition expenditures, and gain the oil necessary for the following naval and air campaign against the UK and USA (which Hitler considered a belligerent long before the official declaration of war). Even as the Panzers were rolling across the Soviet frontier, production was being shifted away from ammunition and tanks for the army, towards aircraft and ships for the following western conflict. In June of 1941 the Germans mortgaged their future on conquering the Soviets by the end of year. Were that not to happen all the subsequent finely balanced plans would collapse in on themselves and the future of the Reich's entire war effort would be placed in lethal jeopardy. As such the Germans were conditioned to grasp at any straw that seemed to offer the possibility of a victory in 1941, no matter how improbable. This conditioning was so bad that it remained the root of a lot of "if only we did X different, it would have worked" in memoir writing after the war, such as taking Moscow before the end of 1941, and endlessly repeated by pop-historians since.	1642858269.0	htqoe1j	t3_qynft7	t3_qynft7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/qynft7/why_did_the_germans_expect_the_invasion_of_the/htqoe1j/

96gqp	Hi there -- we've removed this question for being a what-if; the idea that DNA tells us something about someone's ethnicity is very much a modern creation, and we simply have no idea what a 23andMe profile would tell us about a given citizen of ancient Rome. (As an aside, in the modern day they aren't much use either; all they do is compare one's genes to people who live in what Benedict Anderson has so delightfully described as "imagined communities" which may or may not have any relevance to when our ancestors migrated.) You are welcome to ask about how a "Roman" identity formed, or the city-states that were granted Roman citizenship and how those ebbed and flowed over time. If you'd like help formulating such a question, you are welcome to send us a mod-mail to ask.	1642859556.0	htqqss8	t3_sa0uiv	t3_sa0uiv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa0uiv/if_23andme_and_other_dna_apps_existed_in_times_of/htqqss8/

kwbn6	First, thanks for the answer, which I found fortuitous as I just rewatched one of my favorite films yesterday, and it happens to take place within this time period: Andrey Rublev. Now, the film is by no means meant to be a history lesson (it wouldn't be a very interesting film if it were, and it definitely wouldn't start with a scene involving a hot air balloon a few centuries ahead of its time) but I'm curious to know if you have any thoughts on it (if you've seen it, but if you haven't and are at all interested in auteur-driven cinema, I very much recommend it), be they of a historical nature or not.	1642860151.0	htqrydd	t3_s8r5cx	t1_htm02yo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5cx/out_of_the_all_the_various_rus_princedoms_why_was/htqrydd/

8wwxj454	Hello. I’m a Masters student in the UK who’s has done a dissertation of the Levellers (with a heavy focus on the Putney Debates) and now doing my Masters on sedition in the reign of Charles I (with a chapter which will be dedicated to the Trial of the King). As far as I am personally aware I do not believe such a volume exists. However I would highly recommend J. P Kenyon ‘The Stuart Constitution’ which has a lot of primary documents for this team including some you have mentioned here, and it can usually be picked up second hand online for about £3. Also the the Levellers I would recommend Andrew Sharp’s ‘The English Levellers’ for most of the main Leveller texts. The Putney Debates and Trial of Charles are rather long documents (and both rather repetitive) so the segments you normally get in such collections should suffice for general reading, however if you want the full text then looking on Early English Books online should be your best option for the Trial of Charles I. For the Putney debates full transcript you would be best searching through the Clarke Papers which were edited and published by CH Firth. All the documents you’ve asked for though are available online for free (I believe) so not completely out of luck! Sorry I couldn’t exactly help when it comes to a complete collection, but hopefully this helps you track down the texts you wanted in some capacity.	1642861288.0	htqu7hd	t3_p6vu5o	t3_p6vu5o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/p6vu5o/asking_for_a_book_recommendation_collection_of/htqu7hd/

jduzx	The answer is no. There is no such evidence, and there is nothing that even comes close to suggesting anything romantic between the two. The way Engels and Marx wrote to each other, was well within the norm for how men wrote to each other at that time. This idea that Marx and Engels should've had some homoerotic affair has no foundation in reality. Furthermore, compare Karl's letters to Jenny with his letters to Engels; Marx is far, _far_ more romantic and loving in those letters, writing poems, describing her beauty, his longing, and so-on, even in periods where they were separated in less than a month. To Engels, you find maybe a "Dearest Friend" or "Life-friend," normal forms of address among 19th century German friends. Maybe signed a "yours truly" or "your friend," but nothing nearly as loving as we see with Jenny. The same goes the other way around; Engels wrote to Marx well within what was acceptable for the 19th century gentleman of Engels' standing. In addition, Engels was a known to have little respect for marriage, and had plenty of extra-marital affairs with other women; something that was at odds with Marx's far more romantic ideas about love, and at times meant that Jenny Marx wouldn't talk to him, if he brought his mistress to the Marx's home.  On the story of the illegitimate child, I assume you're referring to the child of *Lenchen*, aka Helene Demuth, the Marx family housekeeper, and Friedrich Engels. There is nothing that proves that Karl Marx should be father of Friedrich Demuth, the child, and Engels himself claimed fathership. We also know that Lenchen and Engels were each others confidants, that Engels wasn't the type to stay within the confines of his marriage, and that the two, later in life, formed a professional couple, along with Lenchen moving to the Engels estate, to take on the position of housekeeper. I'm repeating myself here, but there is nothing that, in any way, supports the claim that Marx should be the father of Friedrich Demuth.   The final point I want to raise, is that the idea that Engels' (and Helene Demuth's) work with publishing _Capital_ should be an expression of some love, makes no sense. Engels and Marx were lifelong companions and comrades, they worked on many of their works together. It was only obvious, that Engels would organise and publish the two other volumes of _Capital_. To claim that it was an expression of love, would you also say that the young Karl Kautsky, who met Marx in London, had some feeling of romantic or sexual attraction towards the older Marx, since Kautsky was responsible for publishing _Theories of Surplus Value_?  ***  Sources:  III.

9i89m	Robert Morris is an interesting figure, a very important person during the Revolutionary War and in the Confederation that followed it. He emigrated with his father to Maryland as a teenager in 1747, and when his father died was apprenticed to a merchant in Philadelphia, Charles Willing. He did well, and set up his own company with Willing's son when he was still quite young, and as the French and Indian War was breaking out. Morris quickly figured out how to make money from supplying that war, and afterwards kept making money, expanding business into the Caribbean and overseas, investing in projects like mines and mills. His firm would also invest in other merchants' projects: the colonial financial world was rather small, and there was a lot of pooling of resources, working connections-  marriages and bloodlines mixed up many if not most of the eastern merchants, and therefore some historians have referred to the Robert Morris group...there was Robert Morris, and there were the relatives, friends, associates he could call for help.  Unlike Jefferson or John Adams, Morris had little idealism, and it is a bit of a mystery whether his support for the revolt was mostly might have been based on his financial interests. He thought the new taxes imposed by Britain were an abomination, but he also allied himself initially with Dickinson in opposing separation. He abstained from voting for independence, but signed the Declaration of it. He also talked in glowing terms of how much money could be made from the War. Being in the Congress, and on the Secret Committee, gave him plenty of opportunities for doing that, and he did. That attracted plenty of negative comments from the idealists- Tom Paine denounced him as a profiteer.  But the hard truth was that the colonies needed an enormous amount of  stuff to fight their war- not only guns, gun powder etc but food, wagons, clothes, blanket. That stuff had to be found, purchased, and gotten into the armies, and Morris was able to work his connections and do that. That it was still not quite enough, that the army was still pretty ragged, ill-fed and badly equipped is true, as is  the charge Morris and his group took a fee from all those transactions that seemed more than patriotism would allow. But alone among the Continental Congress delegates, Morris seemed to know how to do it.  It's for that reason they made him Superintendant of Finance in 1781, and Morris was able to set conditions for accepting; he got broad powers to hire and fire and run his own business as well as the Congress'. He took away logistics of supply from the states; his plan was also to create a Bank of America that would assume at least some of the states' war debts in return. He also stopped paying soldiers- feeding them was going to be enough, and the Bank would pay them back after the War.   Now, all this was a Good Thing, and your tour guide and others have sometimes tried to make Morris the Man who Saved the Revolution. That's not really true- he took his job as Superintendent close to the end of the conflict, only a couple of months before the seige of Yorktown.  And after the British surrender at Yorktown,  Morris's plans to strengthen the credit of the US with a national mint and national Bank ran into trouble because the states didn't want devote money to fund it. He resigned in 1784, and would be a delegate at the Constitutional Convention, siding with the other Federalists for a stronger national government.  Alexander Hamilton would take his idea of the federal government assuming states' war debts and manage to implement it.   His mixing up of Congressional business and his own unfortunately became a problem when Congress asked him for his accounts during the War. Morris does not seem to have been admired or well-liked, and when he could not separate his group's private transactions from the public ones, there was no sympathy. In 1795 he was billed $93,312. Morris would join a number of other merchants who would get little gratitude.  Silas Deane, who put together the first shipment of goods from France, would also end up  ruined for his efforts when he could not justify his accounts( and to the same Delegate who went after Morris, Arthur Lee) and Oliver Pollock, of New Orleans.    Morris also then overextended himself in a number of bad ventures, mostly land speculation. As a result, Morris would lose everything and go to debtor's prison in 1799, be there for three years. Perhaps because of  embarrassment over the spectacle of such an important figure being in jail, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act of 1800, that did away with debtors' prisons.    For a detailed look at the web of businesses supplying the War, Robert A. East's * Business Enterprise in the American Revolutionary Era* is old but still interesting. For a general narrative of the Congress and the Revolutionary War, John Ferling's *A Leap in the Dark*  is also quite good.	1642862850.0	htqxi55	t3_s9puly	t3_s9puly	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9puly/how_much_power_did_robert_morris_have_over_the_us/htqxi55/

mdu63	Hello, sorry for very late response.   Since OP had apparently got some basic areal and chronological outlines of medieval fur trade centered at north-westernmost part of Eurasia (NW Russia~ Arctic circle~ Fennoscandia) in the cross-post in /r/askhistory, my following post focus on some not so well answered points of OP's original question.   +++  >Did they actually use traps or more bows and muskets?   Trap was the main means of hunting, together with bow with a special (blunt-tipped) arrow head either of iron or horn for small fur animals, at least in NW Russia from 10th to the 13th centuries (Makarov 2006: 126).    +++  >Was the primary quarry sable, hares, and harts? Or were there others?   Sable was certainly OK, but the most of the most important export of fur from medieval NW Eurasia are in fact missing from the suggested list: (Eurasian) beavers, (northern gray) squirrels, ermines and martens.   Scandinavians had also traded the fur with arctic hunter-gathering peoples, knowned as "the Finns" - not conflated with modern Finlanders, but usually identified with the Sámi people since the Viking Age, and the following account of the middle to late 12th century lists the fur animals living in Fenno-Scandia (now Finmark region in northern Norway):    >"Bordering the length of Norway is a vast wasteland, separating it from the pagan peoples. This waste is lived in by Lapps and by the wild animals whose flesh they eat half-raw and whose skins they wear. ......There is no limit to the number of wild animals there: bears, wolves, lynxes, foxes, sables, otters, badgers and beavers.......Among the Lapps are also a great many squirrels and ermines, and every year the Lapps pay the skins of all these animals as large tribute to the kings of Norway, whose subjects they are." (*History of Norway* (about 1150-1175): Translation is taken from [Kuninrans. 2001: 5f.]).    As numbers and good hunting places of beavers decreased in course of the High Middle Ages (12th and 13th centuries), the main export of fur from NW Russia shifted from beavers to northern squirrels, and Novgorod (a city in NW Russia) functioned as a hub of collecting fur from their tributary hunter-gatherers (up to the White Sea) as well as the export center to the Latin West (one of the the 4 trading posts of the Hanseatic merchants was located there).    [This famous map](https://imgur.com/CXXPTNq) shows the location of Novgrod's tribute taking stations (in forms of fur), based on the donation charter of Prince Sviatoslav of Novgorod in 1136 or 1137 (Martin 2004 (1986): 56). It was customary of counting furs by 40 (40 furs) as 1 *sorochok* in medieval NW Russia, and 436 *sorochoks* in total from these stations are mentioned in the charter - they consequently amounts to 17,400 furs. 174,00 hunted furs (probably of squirrels) were expected to be collected these stations alone, and also, in a single year (Noonan & Kovalev 2004: 654-56). In the 14th century (1320s), there was also a transaction record in Novgorod that trade the large-scale estate with 20,000 pelts of squirrel (Martin 2004 (1968): 68).   Medieval City Novgorod had a further unique kind of primary document, [Birch bark Document (linked one, no. 210 (middle of the 13th century) is unfortunately not relevant to fur trade at all)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Birch_bark_document_210.jpg). Some of the documents mention tribute-taking in form of fur, such as No. 683 (fragmentary text, middle to late 12th century): "......Novik's 6 *kunas* (unit of money in medieval Russia).....bag (sack) of squirrel pelts, 18 *sorochoks*, which he concealed in Onega region, are in the hand of Neshka......" (the translation is taken from Noonan & Kovalev 2004: 56).    This no. 683 is a kind of medieval business letter, excavated from the building of Novgorod's Mayor, and it also reveals that furs had already been counted by 40 (*sorochok*) and packed with the seal at individual stations before they were sent for Novgorod. And a researcher (Ianin, Russian authority of medieval archeology of City Novgorod) suggests that [these wooden cylinders (11th and 12th centuries)](https://imgur.com/sYfWLY7), with the place name of Onega river region (SE to the White Sea) were used to "seal" sacks of squirrel furs at the tribute-taking station.    As for popularity of these arctic furs, Martin cites some examples of medieval British royal members: Queen Philippa of Hainaut (wife of King Edward III) of England had five garments of northern squirrels for the banquet after her birth to their first son, and the namesake princess of King Henry IV of England put a gown with trimmed ermines and squirrels. Later medieval English sumptuary act tries to prohibit the use of northern gray squirrels (thus imported from NE Eurasia - non native in England) out of ranked nobility and upper stratum of knights (Martin 2004 (1986): 64).    On the other hands, sables, ermines and martens were also popular in Islamic world, and as shown in [this map (Favereau 2021: 157)](https://imgur.com/iy5XeSn), the Golden Horde (Jochid Ulus) took over the main trade route to SE Russia in the 13th century. Crimean Peninsula was another export hub of Russian fur trade, and Italian merchants like Genoa and Venice played a role of middlemen in the fur trade on this side in the Eastern Mediterranean. Though not the most popular one, one or two scholars had suggested that it was fleas hiding in the exported fur from Crimea by the Italian merchants that spread the Black Death across the Mediterranean (now grain export from Crimea became the latest popular culprit instead of fur - Cf. Favereau 2021: 248-49).   References:    * [Kunin, Devra (trans.) *A History of Norway and The Passion and Miracles of the Blessed Óláfr*, with an intro. and notes by Carl Phelpstead.

i0exqncy	Does anyone have recommendations on sources for medieval peasants hunting and trapping? By my understand, nobles hunted in large groups where everyone had a role, and it was more of a past time for socializing with other nobles. But how did peasants hunt?

4s4vd	No, he didn't have a role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. At this time he was working with Anatoly Sobchak who was a mayor of Saint-Petersbourg. So, you could say he was relatively important in Saint-Petersbourg but not country-level important at all.  If by "a coup against the government of the USSR" you mean GKCHP (ГКЧП), I think it'd be oversimplification to say that this event was organized by KGB. One of them truly was the head of KGB) but still, it didn't look like organized attempt at anything at that time and doesn't look like organized attempt at anything now. Anyway, Putin's boss, Anatoly Sobchak, didn't think he had to do what GKCHP wanted and Putin immediately quit KGB.  All of this happened 8 years before the beginning of Putin's presidency.  In 1996 Sobchak lost another round of elections, so Putin lost his job. After that he came to Moscow, where he was invited to work in Yeltsin's administration. Two years later he became a head of FSB (KGB successor). Three years later (1999) he became a prime minister.  It seems that the main role in his promotion was played by Valentin Yumashev, Yeltsin's son-in-law. Yeltsin and his closest associates were worried that after Yeltsin all the progress on the way to democracy would be lost. And maybe they were worried about their future fates also. Yeltsin as a politician wasn't in a good shape, he almost lost his own President elections in 1996 (and some says that he really lost it, but it's quite hard to say if it's true or not). Anyway, all these years there was a fear of communists' comeback, so Yeltsin's associates (sometimes this group of people is called Family, *Семья*) wanted to have a good successor. The one who wasn't communist, the one who owes them a lot, the one who wouldn't betray them. They wanted guarantees.  Putin at that time seemed for them as a good choice. He believed in democracy, he had his own code of honor, he was loyal to them. And he really owed them a lot. So, he was chosen not because he was an influential politic with a lot of connections or was a rich guy with a lot of money and power. He was chosen because he wasn't. For people he was a relatively unknown. He had worked just several months as a Prime minister, and before that he was a head of FSB (not a really TV celeb), and before that he was an official in Yeltsin's administration (not a really TV celeb also).  So, the question is: did it work for the Family? Yes, it mostly did. You can say a lot of bad things about Putin, but he is obviously loyal to those who is loyal to him. Valentin Yumashev is still his advisor. Roman Abramovich is still a billionaire and so on.  Some people who helped Putin on his way to presidency fell out of his favor though. The most prominent example is Boris Berezovsky, who wanted to control Putin right after the elections. It didn't work out for him. In 2006 he ran to London, after that he gradually lost a significant part (maybe, most) of his assets, and in 2013 he was found dead at his London house (suicide). But even Putin's critics won't say Putin betrayed Berezovsky. If there was a betrayal, it was the other way around, and after that there was a revenge.  Did it work for democracy? You know it didn't.  But, actually, during the first 8 years, it was quite okay although Putin tried to control the media right after he became a President and there was a quite strange and tragic story with Russian billionaire Mikhail Khodorkowsky. But democracy and freedom of speech didn't just disappear in one day, it was a slow and painful process.   Obviously, Putin's experience in secret service have some influence on his strategy and decisions, but I don't believe it was his plan from the beginning. He was very lucky because before him Russians were very poor, and during his first eight years they became much more richer and happy. If he quit, he'd be remembered as one of the best Russian rulers of all time (despite some of his mistakes and shortcomings). But he didn't quit, and he'd changed.   If you want to read more about this, I can recommend an excellent *All the Kremlin's Men: Inside the Court of Vladimir Putin* by Mikhail Zygar. Also, *Berezovsky's time* by Peter Aven (not sure if there is an english translation). But please bear in mind that this is still quite modern history for Russia, some parts of this history are literally dangerous to touch, a lot of people who could tell us something prefer to keep their silence, so there is a lot of gaps, and misunderstandings, and mistakes, and downright lies in all the books about that.	1642865721.0	htr3ydr	t3_s9k7qp	t3_s9k7qp	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9k7qp/did_vladímir_putin_have_a_special_role_during_the/htr3ydr/

fkjr8	Thank you, and yes, I tend to try and use BEF where appropriate as the term refers to all the forces of the British Empire in France and Flanders, including Commonwealth and Colonial contingents (and indeed quite a large number of Chinese labourers by 1918).  That said, its difficult sometimes to avoid just saying "British" for the sake of grammar.	1642867032.0	htr72ul	t3_rz9d5q	t1_htoj0pm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rz9d5q/what_was_the_role_of_the_usa_in_ww1_was_the/htr72ul/

7rvatyyv	I wouldn't call de Waal a "genocide denier" and don't think that is what the letter you linked here is saying. Their specific words is that he "contributed to denial of the Armenian Genocide," which is obviously still a serious charge.  That said, I am not a genocide scholar or expert, and certainly not one on the Armenian genocide, so take anything I say here with that in mind. But from what I've read of de Waal (and I've read nearly all his books and academic articles, if not all of them), have not found that to be true.  I should also note that most of the scholars signed onto that letter are of Armenian heritage (the surname ending -ian or -yan is Armenian), and while I certainly do not want to make any claims like that, it could be a case that they are more personally involved in the matter (de Waal has no family connection to Armenia or the Caucasus, as far as I'm aware). The Armenian Genocide is a very politicized topic, so it is not surprising to see people of Armenian heritage try to give it the prominence they feel it deserves (again not a critique, nor a denial of the genocide by any means). I would be interested to see if some non-Armenian scholars also feel this way, and am quite open to seeing if de Waal really does have some views that are less than savory.	1642867578.0	htr8dww	t3_s68982	t1_htpnk2d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htr8dww/
7rvatyyv	It was one of the first books published in English that was not written by someone either directly associated with the war, or related to Armenia or Azerbaijan (which are often biased to their side). Rather de Waal has been criticized by both sides for his coverage, in that each side feels he favours the other, and that is always something I consider a good sign.   It has also held up in terms of being used as a major source since it was published: nearly any reputable publication on the war will cite *Black Garden* (along with others, of course), and while that is of course not always a sign of someone supporting the works, that it continues to be referenced suggests it is at least worth looking at.	1642867733.0	htr8r8v	t3_s68982	t1_htpo3a6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htr8r8v/

3w4spkpx	> Rather de Waal has been criticized by both sides for his coverage, in that each side feels he favours the other, and that is always something I consider a good sign.   An analogy: do you know how the difference between Gaussian and equal distribution looks? Obviously they are not the same, but when you say that "both sides" criticizing somebody or that somebody being "in the middle" is a good sign, one would think you don't understand that.  Point being that usually one side is closer to the truth and another is farther from it, and standing in between is absolutely useless for determining anything if it is a conflict.  Also he is a genocide denier, as others said. For anybody familiar with the situation closer, he is obviously biased to the Azeri side, just insufficiently for Azeris. I don't see any reason to consider him a credible source, but some acquaintance is useful, of course.	1642868148.0	htr9ra4	t3_s68982	t1_htr8r8v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htr9ra4/

Anna was extremely brave journalist, but she wrote mostly about Chechnya and Chechen wars, so there is a very special angle in her work. It's not bad per se, but I'm not sure you'd get a full picture of Russia from her works, and she wasn't trying to do that.  I didn't read her *Putin's Russia* though. My impression about her is mostly based on her articles.	1642869171.0	htrc9sy	t3_s9k7qp	t1_htrapad	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9k7qp/did_vladímir_putin_have_a_special_role_during_the/htrc9sy/

You are wrong, "he said - she said" is not an argument.   >  I've also not seen any criticism of him being pro-Azerbaijan coming from anyone who isn't overtly pro-Armenian  That's like saying that a critique of works denying Holocaust always comes from people who are overtly pro-Jewish/pro-Allies/... - you get the point (I hope).

2m8yl53s	>“…in the world in which Islam was born, the Bible circulated orally in Arabic mainly in liturgical settings…such written biblical texts as may have been available in synagogues, churches, or monasteries in this milieu were in the liturgical languages of the several communities, Hebrew or Aramaic among the Jews, and Greek or Aramaic/Syriac among the Christians.” (Griffith, pg. 2)  Christians in the Near/Middle East, whether they were Arabs or not, used Greek and Syriac as their liturgical languages, and so they used Bibles written in those languages.  Greek wasn’t the native language of the region and it’s unrelated to the various native Semitic languages, but as the language of the eastern part of the Roman Empire, it was the common administrative language and even a common secondary spoken language for almost everyone, Christians or Jews. For Christians it had the added prestige of being the language the New Testament was written in. There was also an older Greek translation of the Tanakh and other Hebrew scriptures, the Septuagint, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC. The Septuagint was the basis of the Greek Old Testament for Christians, and it was also used by Hellenized, Greek-speaking Jews.  On the Semitic languages side, there was an early translation of Bible into Syriac, maybe dating to the 2nd century. The most common one today is the Peshitta but there were other translations circulating in antiquity. The Old Testament was probably translated from the Hebrew and the New Testament from the Greek (although maybe the whole thing was translated from the Greek). There was also other extra-Biblical literature in Syriac, notably the Diatesseron, which was sort of a summary of the Gospels.  Other Christian communities translated the Bible into their own languages too - the standard Latin translation (the Vulgate) was done in the 4th century, but there were earlier partial translations as well (the “Vetus Latina”, the “old Latin”). By the 5th century there were translations into Armenian (an Indo-European language like Greek and Latin) and Georgian (neither Indo-European or Semitic), as well as other Semitic liturgical languages, Coptic in Egypt and Ge’ez in Ethiopia.  By the 5th century, using a Bible in Greek or Syriac or any of these other languages also depended on the specific sect of Christianity and not necessarily a person’s native language or ethnic origin; among other things there were disputes over the exact nature of Christ’s humanity and divinity, and after the Council of Chalcedon in 451, there were the “Chalcedonian” churches in Constantinople and Rome, since they agreed with the conclusions of the council, and the “non-Chalcedonian” Syriac, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian churches who adhered to a slightly different interpretation. Syriac was also the liturgical language of the non-Chalcedonian Christian communities further east in Persia, central Asia, and India.  As a Semitic language, Syriac is closely related to Hebrew, and more distantly to Arabic. Syriac, or really the various dialects of it, are forms of Aramaic, which was the common spoken Semitic language all over the Near East and Middle East. There are even bits of Aramaic in the Bible, notably in the Book of Daniel, and a few words spoken by Jesus in the New Testament. The Jewish scriptures were written in Hebrew, but by the Roman period Hebrew was a liturgical language and Jewish people often spoke Greek and/or Aramaic instead. Some Jewish literature was also written in Aramaic (such as commentary on the Tanakh, which was known as the Targum, from the Aramaic word for “translation”).  Aramaic had its own script; the “imperial Aramaic” form was used as far east as Persia, and may have even influenced the development of the Brahmi scripts in India. Imperial Aramaic script developed into the Hebrew square script, which Jewish authors used to write both Hebrew and Aramaic. It also developed into the different Syriac scripts, the “classical” Estrangela, the eastern Syriac Madnhaya, and the western Syriac Serta, which were used for the various Aramaic/Syriac dialects in Palmyra, Nabataea, etc. The script used for the Nabataean dialect is probably also the origin of the Arabic script.  So, any Jews and Christians further south in Arabia who spoke Arabic already had Bibles and related literature in Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic/Syriac. Hebrew and Syriac are pretty close, but it's not quite the same as having a Bible in their own language. Could they have translated their scriptures into Arabic too? Maybe, but they probably didn't, at least not before the rise of Islam in the 6th and 7th centuries. The reason for that is simply that there were no books in Arabic before the Qur’an. Although there are short texts and inscriptions in pre-Islamic Arabic, it wasn’t considered a literary language and no one wrote any lengthy literature in it.  Jews and Christians must have transmitted Biblical literature orally though, and their fellow Arabs evidently learned about Biblical people and events from them. The Qur’an introduces older prophets (Noah, Moses, Jesus, etc) and situations without much or any explanation, as if the intended audience already knew about them. And while there are no surviving examples in Arabic, Christian communities in Europe often translated short passages or the bits that they considered most important, especially the Gospels and parts of the Old Testament like the Psalms. So there might also have been very short texts in Arabic, along with any other material that was primarily transmitted orally.  (I should also mention that the early Muslims could have encountered Biblical literature from the Ge’ez versions in Ethiopia, where they were welcomed after being temporarily expelled from Mecca, but I don’t think the Ge’ez version had much influence on Arabic Bibles.)  After the Qur’an was compiled and standardized in book form in the 7th century, Arabic was now seen as a worthy literary language, and Jewish and Christian Arabs now had a model for composing their own holy books in Arabic too. They probably started writing in Arabic soon afterwards in the 7th century, and definitely by the 8th and 9th centuries. We can be pretty sure that substantial (if not complete) translations existed by then because Muslim authors were also interested in them. They wanted to understand the Bible and show how Judaism and Christianity and their scriptures were deficient compared to Islam and the Qur’an. For example, the jurist Najm al-Din al-Tufi examined the Christian Gospels from a Muslim perspective in the early 8th century. He was presumably working with an Arabic translation.  Meanwhile, thanks to the spread of Islam, Arabic became the dominant language further north in the Near East and Egypt, although it probably wasn’t the majority language just as Islam probably wasn’t the majority religion. The population was still mostly Christian for a long time, and they still spoke Greek and Syriac, and Coptic in Egypt. But they gradually began to adopt Arabic, the language of the ruling class. While Muslims were translating Greek philosophy and literature into Arabic in the translation centres in Damascus and Baghdad, Christian communities were translating scriptures and all sorts of other works into Arabic too.  However,  >“Translations of the whole Bible into Arabic in one perhaps multivolume work seem not to have been undertaken under Christian auspices until the sixteenth century.” (Griffith, pg. 129)  So, in brief, Arab Christians and Jews had Bibles in Hebrew, Greek, and Syriac, which were the common liturgical languages in the Near East/Middle East at the time. They certainly transmitted Biblical stories orally in Arabic, even if they didn’t translate them in written texts until after the arrival of Islam, when Arabic became a literary language for the first time. By the 9th century, Christians and Jews were producing Bible translations in Arabic, but there probably wasn’t a full translation of the entire Christian Bible until relatively recently in the early modern period.

8xdm0	Thanks /u/keloyd for the detailed reply! Curious to hear your perspective on Asimov's tome when you have a chance to read it in full.   I will also take a look into Karen Armstrong's books. I certainly have interest beyond Christianity, so also helpful to know she has written more broadly on Judaeo-Christian history, including on Islam. As /u/MagratMakeTheTea mentioned below too, I appreciate the additional background on Armstrong as I agree trying to keep in mind the unavoidable biases of authors will be critical.   Also, lucky you can try and attend a class if you wanted close by!	1642870464.0	htrfjbv	t3_s68dfl	t1_ht2exhg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68dfl/what_are_some_updated_alternatives_to_issac/htrfjbv/
8xdm0	Thank you for the recommendation and your review! This seems like a decent option to consider starting with for a causal reader.

eb71vhfe	As historians such as E. H. Carr and Hayden White argue, historical inquiry is subjective and heavily dependent on what the inquirer chooses to look for and focus on, which shapes the historical knowledge "produced". Put simply, if you're looking to learn about the pre-industrial history of East Asian economies, you'll probably be searching for sources relating to pre-industrial East Asian economies, be writing historical publications about pre-industrial East Asian economies, and so on.  Why does this matter? Because much of our historical knowledge and primary historical sources are written by elite men, often heteronormative and cisnormative especially in the Western/European setting. This is generally because such people had the ability to do so which others did not: namely fluent literacy from good education, and influence and freedom in spreading their views due to social/political/economic power. They are mostly going to care about and write about topics relevant to *themselves*: your noble lord will concern himself more on collecting land taxes and managing military forces than on textile weaving methods used by peasant women. Thus in many historical fields, we often end up with huge amounts of historical knowledge relating to this demographic, and with lots of primary sources focusing on them then means lots of secondary and tertiary sources also focusing on them.  Studying and evaluating history with a deliberately different inquiries and approaches will then help us consider new perspectives, "forgotten" sources, and unique arguments. That diversity of knowledge in turn contributes to a "better understanding" of history, in the sense that history is once again a rather subjective field which relies on an understanding of how, how far, and why our historical knowledge is subjective.  For example, choosing to look at women's household work in agarian societies can direct us to searching for sources relating to that, especially if from and regarding women. On top of written texts that may be rather scarce, considering unconventional methods could provide extra insight, such as archeological discoveries of weaving tools in female graves. We can then hopefully put together a fresh narrative and learn new information: perhaps (as a hypothetical example) that certain aspects of postharvest processing were treated as household work, but varied across communities and over time!  Alternatively, we can try new readings of existing sources: perhaps to consider potential references to homosexuality in artworks and cultural artefacts, which may introduce contrasting viewpoints to common perceptions of the society in question. Could a "confusing" poem actually make sense if treated as a parody of conventional marriage expectations?  Finally, we can still gain a better understanding of the context of those elite men's sources. What does their portrayal and referencing of women and "effeminate" men tell us about their sociocultural values and biases? Why are female deities and elites treated differently than female peasants and slaves?  All these matter as they will shape and affect how we evaluate and handle such knowledge. It's also important to keep in mind that the influence of gender in the study of history can have big impacts in our present day: gender issues continue to affect lots of real people, and awareness about its past supports its modern prevalence and movements. Pop culture can also be quite an accessible medium to practice such skills: how do early Disney animations and Sean Connery's James Bond films depict women, and what can they suggest about expectations by their film creators?  For more in-depth reading, you can search for all kinds of gender historians and gender history publications. I think [Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1864376) by Joan Scott and [The Growth of Gender and Women's History](https://www.history.ox.ac.uk/growth-gender-and-womens-history) by Lyndal Roper are good starts!	1642871237.0	htrhjkv	t3_s97efi	t3_s97efi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s97efi/how_does_looking_at_gender_help_better_understand/htrhjkv/
8xdm0	Thank you for the range of suggestions and general advice when approaching this topic /u/MagratMakeTheTea !  I also appreciate my request was a difficult one. Asimov's Guide was hardly concise, and even then, a generally treacherous task for any single publication to handle such a large swath of recorded modern human history. I will keep in mind maybe trying to start with a smaller segment than "The Bible".  I also appreciate the additional background on Erhmann to keep in mind! Your recommendation at first pass, certainly does seem in line with Asimov's general attitude.	1642871452.0	htri3az	t3_s68dfl	t1_ht2xn4s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68dfl/what_are_some_updated_alternatives_to_issac/htri3az/

8xdm0	Thank you for the recommendation and some of the high-level summary. This was actually one book I came across when doing some searching of my own.    It seems like it might be interesting to read Dever as well as the recommendation for Erhman's *Misquoting Jesus* on textual criticism as it seems like Dever is highly focused on archeological evidence, almost to the exclusion of textual analysis. At least, that is my sense from a few reviews and having obviously not read it yet.	1642872132.0	htrju40	t3_s68dfl	t1_ht50we7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68dfl/what_are_some_updated_alternatives_to_issac/htrju40/

88vwr8h8	In the Tanakh (the Jewish Bible, known to Christians as the ‘Old Testament’), merchants and traders are always Canaanites, never Israelites. Later, in the 1st century CE, Josephus (the noted Jewish-Roman historian) recorded that Jews ‘do not indulge in commerce either by sea or otherwise’. The *Jewish Encyclopedia* (first published in 1906) also asserts that, in antiquity, ‘not much attention was paid to commerce’ by Jews. The encyclopedia cites, among other evidence, the fact that Jews didn’t mint their own coinage until the Maccabean era (beginning in the 2nd century BCE).  After the Jewish-Roman wars, the Roman conquest of Judea, and the destruction of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, Jews began to widely migrate throughout the Roman Empire. By the 5th century CE Jews were well-established in the lands of the Empire, particularly in the Western Roman Empire. In 476 CE the Germanic king Odoacer deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus, and the Western Roman Empire fell, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium) to take up its mantle.  In *Yiddish Civilisation: The Rise and Fall of a Forgotten Nation*, Paul Kriwaczek explains that:  > Roman trade had been largely under official control, but with the coming of the barbarians, the imperial economic bureaucrats had vanished back to their great hereditary farming estates and cultivated their own gardens, in the process establishing themselves as the new, local, nobility. Jewish smallholders, on the other hand, whose produce was insufficient to pay taxes to the king, whose faith prevented them from dedicating tithes to the local bishop and whose traditions were hostile to providing manpower for war - the three obligations placed on landowners in the new dispensation - faced the difficult prospect of either abandoning their property and retiring to the towns or fleeing overseas, otherwise finding themselves for ever tied to their patch as unfree serfs or villeins in a feudal system that became ever more rigid by the century and which, moreover, insisted on conformity to the Christian religion. It wasn't much of a choice and unsurprisingly most elected to leave the land. >  > The new kingdoms of Italy, Gaul and Spain, however, desperately needed experienced businessmen. The rough new lords of the West knew little about finance and less of economics, while the arcane art of bookkeeping, which had already been mastered by the Hebrews in Babylonian days (there are clay tablets to prove it from Marashu and Sons' banking and trading house of Nippur, Babylonia, in the fifth century BCE), and without which no commercial concern can successfully operate, must have seemed to beer-quaffing German warriors like so much magic. To them, the Jews of their kingdoms represented the highly valued last remaining survivors of Roman commercial practice.  These events marked the beginning of the European Jewish association with trade and finance. A notable example of such a a new lord of the West was the 9th century Frankish king Charlemagne.   Charlemagne invited Jews from the Mediterranean to settle in his agricultural lands of Provence and the Rhineland as royal clients, outside of the feudal system, and develop trading communities there. Most pre-WW2 Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Europe had their origins in the Jewish culture, language, and liturgy that developed in the Rhineland roughly a thousand years ago.  ---  During Charlemagne’s reign he instituted various financial reforms and did much to standardise currency in Europe. But economic development in medieval Europe was hampered by the fact that merchants typically needed to maintain a large amount of physical currency with which to trade. This was logistically impractical and also economically fragile: currency loses its value as inflation rises, which happened more-or-less constantly during this period. Currency can also be used to purchase assets which maintain their value, such as land. The drawback with the latter is that if one’s capital is tied up in assets, it cannot be quickly liquidated when extra currency is urgently needed. The solution? Investing in loans, and charging interest to compensate for the currency’s loss of value over time, ie. proto-banking.  Christian doctrine forbade lending money to fellow Christians and charging interest. But Jews could lend money to Christians and charge interest. This system was of vital importance for economic grown and development in Europe, and moneylending became increasingly indispensable in Europe, not just for monarchs but also nobles, merchants, and even peasants.  The Jewish religion is inherently community-oriented, requiring a *minyan* (a quorum of ten adult men) for many important prayers, and a need for locally-available kosher food and wine. This, combined with the widespread prohibition against Jewish land-ownership in medieval Europe, led to the majority of Jews to settle in urban areas. Trade guilds began to emerge in Europe in the Middle Ages, from which Jews were always excluded, thus forcing them out of the skilled and artisanal trades and crafts popular in cities and towns. Consequently Jews became vastly overrepresented in European commerce and moneylending, they had little choice.  ---  Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, William the Conqueror invited Jewish merchants from Normandy to settle in England, believing that their commercial knowledge and skill would help increase England’s prosperity. Later, under King Henry I (as in many kingdoms of mainland Europe at the time) the Jews of England were considered the property of the Crown.   English and other European kings frequently exploited Jews financially, using them as a source of income. For example, In England the office of Exchequer of the Jews was created, following the 1194 Ordnance of the Jewry. The Exchequer taxed all Jewish transactions on behalf of the King of England, essentially making the king a ‘sleeping partner’ in Jewish moneylending and trade. Furthermore, if the king’s courts and officers aided Jews in recovering debts, the king was entitled to ten percent of the sum recovered. Ever-increasing anti-Jewish violence (massacres, blood libels) and legislation (requiring Jews to wear badges, further monetary exploitation) in England ultimately culminated in the 1290 Edict of Expulsion, which expelled all Jews from England, seized their property, and ruled that all outstanding debts to Jews should be paid to the king. Jews were not able to return to England until the mid 17th century, under Oliver Cromwell.  ---  Countless books and dissertations have been written on this subject but, in short, Jewish involvement in finance and commerce was almost entirely involuntary. It developed over a long period of time and for manifold reasons related to their vulnerable minority status since the exile from Judea. Despite this fact, Jews became symbols of money and exploitation, and were frequently used as scapegoats by monarchs, nobility, and moneyed landowners to direct anger from serfs and peasants away from themselves. This ultimately resulted in Karl Marx (himself a Jew, albeit one remarkably ignorant about Jewish history) writing his antisemitic 1843 essay *On the Jewish Question*, in which he stated that ‘The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew’.	1642872719.0	htrldfb	t3_s4xi7r	t3_s4xi7r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4xi7r/were_jewish_people_in_medieval_europe_forced_into/htrldfb/
gh16flt8	Modern media does not do them justice, Hitlers speeches were notoriously exceptional, public speaking was his main great skill. This goes back to 1919 when xxxx picked him out whilst giving lectures to ‘nationalise the army’, and he was renowned from his very early days speaking in Munich, right up to the big rallies, that held hundreds of thousands of people. There were even instances of people convulsing and deficating in excitement at his rallies! Think like a political version of a televangelist.  However, why people voted NSDP was a different issue. It is a somewhat complicated issue, that is still researched and debated, but I will try to summarise what I see as a few key points.  In spite of how good he was at speaking, he was not a ‘pied piper’ who put people under his spell and magically got them to vote for him - they had their reasons, that Hitler snd the Nazis brilliantly exploited. However, that is not to say that the figure, and ‘charisma’ (in the Webian sense) of Hitler was not absolutely paramount to the regimes popularity, as Kershaws ‘The Hitler Myth’ has shown.  A key factor in the rise of the popularity of the NSDSP was the Great Depression. In 1928 the NSDSP received 2.6% of the vote in the Reichstag elections of that year - this increased to 37% in 1932! The Depression took a huge tole on a Germany, already ravaged by the hyper inflation of 1923, not to mention the war, and near civil war (with the extensive political chaos of the early 20’s). People, who had faced unemployment and economic ruin, were not only desperate for anything that could get them out of the mess, but they had lost all confidence in the status quo and conventional political parties in order to do so. So, whereas all the other parties (except the communist KPD, who were the only other party rise in popularity in this period) represented a resumption of the - perceivably failed - status quo, the NSDP offered something innovative, new, fresh, and untarnished by the perceived failures of the Weimar Republic.  In addition, the NSDAP was able to organise brilliantly (especially with the input of Gregor Strasser), and appeal to a wide range of the electorate, and therefore siphon votes from the more traditional parties - from socialists to conservatives - was absolutely key. Not to mention fully exploring the figure of Hitler, and his speaking, as the leader who could lead Germany not only out of the depression, but towards a national redemption, which could be seen as very appealing to a hitherto proud nation, that had experiences enormous political and economic strife.  They also managed to portray themselves as the party of law and order, and of national unity - ‘ein volk, ein reich, ein Fuhrer! Germany (a relatively new nation, politically speaking) was divided politically, something that was exacerbated considerably by the depression and chaos of the early 20’s. The Nazis however offered unity, and end to division and infighting, that all Germans were part of the ‘peoples community’ (volksgemeinschaft), which again was extremely appealing. Furthermore they stepped up violence against the communists on the streets, portraying them as an enemy of the German people (fully exploiting the terror in the Russian civil war of the early 20’s), so any violence against the communists was portrayed as the Nazis protecting the German people, as a necessary step in state security (this would also be used later to justify the ‘Reichstag Fire Decree’, and camps like Dachau for alleged political enemies).  What people did not vote for was antisemitism, racism, eugenics, war and extermination camps. During the early 1930’s, Nazi propaganda and political agitation about Jews was toned down considerably, as they knew it would be seen as being too extreme for all but the most right wing ideologue of the party.  In order to appeal to the masses, they again focused on the economy, denigrating other political parties, and protecting Germany from socialism and socialist revolution. It is worth remembering though, that although Hitler did not hypnotise people through his speaking, his figure, and the mythos that was quickly developing around his character (call, by Joseph Goebbles, his ‘greatest achievement’), was still a key element in appealing to the electorate, and as a means of addressing their dire needs.  Some books you may find useful are, Kershaw, I The Hitler Myth, and Rees, L The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler.	1642872844.0	htrlp57	t3_sa5xt5	t3_sa5xt5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa5xt5/were_hitlers_speeches_good_how_did_he_convince_so/htrlp57/

i2kk6jsw	Names were viewed differently during those times. A person would change their names multiple times, and the new names would have a new meaning attached to them. For instance, the Tokugawa clan was called the Matsudaira clan when they were serving the Imagawa and Tokugawa Ieyasu's name was Matsudaira Takechiyo.    In the case of artists, they usually adopted a name instead of using their real one and the name would change when the artist would switch their master(s) or school(s). Hokusai published his first prints under the name of Shunrō, which was bestowed on him by his master Shunshō. For a while, he was associated with the Tawaraya School and adopted the name Tawaraya Sōri to indicate the same. He later on gifted this name to one of his students. One of his future names, Katsushika Hokusai signified his birth place Katsushika.  His name before he died, Gakyō Rōjin Manji, meant 'old man mad about art'.    Hokusai's name changes are indicative of his different influential periods in his life, his art styles and/or emotions. This practice was quite common in Edo period and is said to have started in the Heian period, though the naming patterns were different for other professions and positions. However, Hokusai's monikers are more than that of any other prominent artist.

cw9zzhze	Yeah that really doesn’t say much. I never said that Jesus was born in Bethlehem. I said it was not intellectually up to snuff to say he wasn’t born there. We don’t know. We can’t know. I think most of the people say that are just looking for ways for the NT to be a bunch of made up stuff so they aren’t thinking about it in an unbiased way. He may very well not have been born there but we can never actually know.	1642879036.0	hts1lzr	t3_s31mcq	t1_htrykoq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s31mcq/the_ancient_christian_writer_justin_martyr_150_ad/hts1lzr/

I’ve read it, and I wanted to ask a question, but it was archived. So I came here to see if you could help me clarify something.  You mention that two famines were factors in the creation of a rural artisan industry. I don't fully understand the connection. Also, did they ever just export their metals (iron) as is, as in not as finished goods like weapons and muskets?	1642879766.0	hts3g6e	t3_s535wg	t1_hswwc5a	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s535wg/why_were_queens_seondeok_and_jindeok_and_their/hts3g6e/
8za88	Apparently a coincidence. From [https://www.liguorian.org/files/Liguorian\_JPII\_intro.pdf](https://www.liguorian.org/files/Liguorian_JPII_intro.pdf)  *THE COAT OF ARMS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II features a gold cross set against a blue backdrop. The cross represents the central Christian mystery of the Redemption. The vertical part of the cross has been shifted slightly to the left to make room for the majestic capital M, which reminds us of Mary’s presence at Jesus’ death on the cross. The motto of John Paul II, which accompanies his coat of arms and  expresses his devotion to Mary, is the simple Latin expression “Totus Tuus.” It means “Totally Yours!” Located directly behind the pontiff’s personal coat of arms are the symbols of papal authority: the tiara and the keys of Saint  Peter. The papal tiara, or triregnum, is formed of three crowns and symbolizes the triple power of the pope, for he is father of kings, governor of the world, and Vicar of Christ. The keys, which represent those given by Christ to the apostle Peter, are*    *crossed and tied with a cord. Since the fourteenth century, the two crossed keys have been the official insignia of the Holy See.*	1642879804.0	hts3jow	t3_sa5ygs	t3_sa5ygs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa5ygs/the_coat_of_arms_of_pope_john_paul_ii_was/hts3jow/
4qz6gnsm	This is a really good answer.  One thing that I would add is that this kind of thing is still practiced in modern Japan to some extent and isn’t something that is lost to the past, especially in artistic or cultural endeavors.  For example, someone who achieves a certain level of official certification in Tea Ceremony will be given a new name by the governing body that their own teacher is certified in.  For example, a woman named Ayumi might receive the ‘tea name’ Soumi, keeping just the ‘mi’ character from her own name and adding a somewhat archaic character to the name.  No one would ever call her this in daily life, but she would sign the name on anything tea related if necessary.  Sumo wrestler names are similar as well- they might change names multiple times in a career or sometimes not.  There is a retired Yokozuna whose birth name is Hanada Kouji- he started his sumo career under the name Takahanada with the understanding that he would be allowed to take his father’s ring name if he reached a high enough rank.  He did, and eventually surpassed his retired father’s rank under the same name, Takanohana.  He kept his ring name when he joined the council of sumo elders, but many choose to change their name when they join that group.  Publicly he is a celebrity known as Takanohana.  Privately it’s unlikely anyone calls him that.  That’s three names for one guy and he passed on a typical option of a fourth name.  And lastly there is the tradition of renaming someone after their death, which is still a very common practice.  Typically a family pays a Buddhist temple to provide a posthumous name to a deceased family member as part of funeral traditions.  TL;DR- Japanese renaming traditions still have a place in modern Japan and aren’t just a historical phenomenon.	1642879982.0	hts3zq3	t3_sa52pf	t1_htrv7sa	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa52pf/japanese_artist_hokusai_was_known_by_at_least/hts3zq3/

i2kk6jsw	Thank you for educating me. I've never really pursued any material pertaining to post-1945 Japan and assumed the naming patterns would be different today, which was a blunder on my part.   Would the example of Ayumi be reflecting the practice of giving youth names(developed in early Heian period and carried over in the later periods), _yōmyō_, which were only used until they came of age?

jt30f	The oil embargo--and, more particularly, the U.S. asset freeze--did the exact opposite of what the U.S. hoped, by solidifying Japanese decision makers around the need for a Southern Operation. Prior to the U.S. actions, while the predominant opinion within the IJA was for the Southern Operation, there were still groups of officers who instead argued for attacking the Soviet Union instead. However, when the U.S. asset freeze rolled out, even the most assertive of officers for war against the Soviet Union were forced to acknowledge the need for an attack against the south first prior to war with the Soviets (even if the German invasion briefly revived hopes of an attack north, before these too were put aside).   I'm a bit uncertain what you mean by the second part of your question. The Japanese had attempted to try and gain favorable trade concessions from the Dutch colonial government in Batavia (now Jakarta) prior to the outbreak of war, but these had been roundly rebuffed. Similarly, while the British had bent slightly to Japanese pressure by closing the Burma road, the British were also participating in economic efforts to curtail Japan, and were not about to hand over Malaya and Singapore to the Japanese. The reason the Japanese were interested in pressing the Southern Operation in the first place was because they saw that their diplomatic options had been played out, and saw the only way they could gain a strong enough position to insist on a new order in East Asia was war. The only question remained what war would take place, with the IJA hoping that war could be limited to the British and Dutch, while the IJN was adamant that any such war would have to include the United States as well.	1642881454.0	hts7mrw	t3_s8yukr	t1_htpno9r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/hts7mrw/

gkv5n	Sorry for the delay, took a little more digging than I expected and I'm still not 100% sure. Took a look through casualty records from 1963, and yes, quite a few of the officers' service numbers on them follow the pattern of O+five digits, same as the ones on the graduation list. The format of serial numbers seems to have changed rather often over the years, and I'm not seeing an immediately-available source on the formats other than Wikipedia (which suggests that serials starting with O were for "some Army specialist officers," but unhelpfully does not have a citation for its section on Vietnam-era service numbers). But based on the casualty lists from about the same time, seems likely that those are their serial numbers, at least until the next time the format changed.

4qz6gnsm	I don’t actually have an answer to that that I can support off the top of my head, but I’ll crack some books when I get a chance because it’s an interesting question.  I’m not familiar enough with childhood name conventions to really say, but I don’t know of any examples where a childhood name has a shared character that remains when a name is changed-  for example, I know that Tokugawa Ieyasu’s childhood name was Takechiyo, and the artist Toyokuni I was named Kumakichi or something similar as a child  My gut feeling based on that though is that the way the tea naming works is more descended from art school naming conventions though.  The ‘take one of your teacher’s characters and keep one of your own’ format for names is pretty well established in art.  The Utagawa school for example had teacher > student lineages like:  Toyokuni was the master of Kuniyoshi, Kunisada, and Toyoshige among others.  Kuniyoshi was the master of Yoshitoshi and Yoshiiku.    Kind of an aside, but the list of artist names of the students of the original Toyokuni is a glorious mess of different people taking the same name and changing back and forth to the point where you almost need a flow chart to keep it all straight.  If I can find anything more definitive regarding childhood names I’ll post again.	1642883479.0	htsckbo	t3_sa52pf	t1_hts78lz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa52pf/japanese_artist_hokusai_was_known_by_at_least/htsckbo/
6mgfuvle	Isn’t the President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars and Co-Editor of Genocide Studies International a good enough?   But of course targeting the ethnicity of the others is the best approach here.   Would you be also targeting Lempkin     as a Jew to have legalized this new type crime as genocides. Of course you would not. In some countries you would go to jail for that. The « charge » is clearly explained in the article, but of course ad-hominems is easier.   At the end of the day, bothsidism, minimization are tools to genocide denial and serve the aggressor and target the victims and their descendants further. As such de Waal is perfectly serving the 2 states in the world pushing this armenophobic policies.	1642883621.0	htscx3o	t3_s68982	t1_htr8dww	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htscx3o/

i0kro	[The text](https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/786967/22):*  Original Kanbun: >諸大名参勤作法之事   続日本紀制日　預不公事恣不得集己族　京裡二十騎以上不得集行云々　然則不可引卒多勢　百萬石以下二拾萬石以上不可過二十騎　十萬石以下可為其相應　蓋公役之時者可随其分限矣  Yomikudashi: >諸大名参勤作法ノ事。   続日本紀制シテ日ク、公事ニ預ラス、恣ニ己ガ族ヲ集ムルヲ得ズ。京裡二十騎以上集行スルヲ得ズ云々。然レハ則チ多勢ヲ引卒スベカラズ。百万石以下二拾万石以上二十騎ヲ過クベカラズ。十万石以下ハ其レ相応タルベシ、蓋シ公役ノ時ハ其分限ニ随フベシ。  Translation:   >The rule all daimyōs must follow when reporting for duty:   The rule as recorded in *Shoku Nihongi* says that unless entrusted with official duty one is not allowed to gather his clansmen as he wishes, and no more than twenty horsemen are allowed to gather in the capital. Therefore one is not permitted to lead a large force. Those below 1,000,000 koku and above 200,000 koku are not not allowed more than twenty horsemen. Those 100,000 koku and below are to have a proportional number. However, when on official business, one is to [have a number] appropriate to his rank.  The English translations I have on hand (including Wikipedia) interprets "capital" as Edo. However, as the article references *Shoku Nihongi*, the current academic consensus in Japan is that the "capital" is in fact Kyōtō. There's some disagreement on whether this would be to the Imperial Palace (the Emperor) or Fushimi Castle (the Edo Bakufu), but either way the regulation is for when reporting to Kyōtō.  As you can see above, the attendance part of alternate attendance goes way back in Japanese history to at least the Heian, if not the Nara period. Both Kamakura and Muromachi Bakufu had their own attendance rules. However, this article does not lay out the rule for the alternate  (*kōtai*) part of alternate attendance for Edo Bakufu. That does not appear in Bakufu law until [article 2 of the 1635 version](https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/786967/24):  Original Kanbun: >大名小名在江戸交替所相定也　毎歳夏四月中可致参勤　従者之員数近来甚多　且国郡之費且人民之労也 向後以其相應可減少　但上洛之節者任教令　公役者可随分限事　  Yomikudashi: >大名・小名在江戸交替相定ムル所ナリ。毎歳夏四月中参覲致スベシ。従者ノ員数近来甚ダ多シ、且ハ国郡ノ費、且ハ人民ノ労ナリ。向後ソノ相応ヲ以テコレヲ減少スベシ。但シ上洛ノ節ハ教令ニ任セ、公役ハ分限ニ随フベキ事。  Translation:   >It is not ruled that daimyōs and shōmyōs [small daimyō] are to alternate their location with Edo. They are to report for duty in the summer during the fourth month of every year. Lately the number of followers [to Edo] have been excessive. This depletes the provinces and districts, and exhaust the people. From hence forth, the number is to be appropriately reduced. However, when reporting to the capital one is to follow the rules [assumed to be article 9 of the 1615 version above] and when on official business to [have a number] appropriate to his rank.  From this we can see that by 1635, some sort of alternate attendance was *de facto* in place. It seems that prior to this, various daimyōs simply did it on their own accord to demonstrate their loyalty to the Edo Bakufu, as it was already the tradition for samurai to spend considerable amount of time in the service and have their family live at their lord's castle town, and as already mentioned, attendance laws go way back in history. The 1635 law simply sets out how it is supposed to be conducted.	1642884801.0	htsft8a	t3_sa4slo	t3_sa4slo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa4slo/what_is_the_meaning_of_article_9_from_the_1615/htsft8a/

1jn5r7q	In some respects this is answering a negative rather than a positive, because it is essentially "why DIDN'T rugby become similarly popular in Germany or Spain".  Rugby (pre-split) was played fairly widely around Europe, for instance Hannover 96 & Vfb Stuttgart in Germany & Servette in Switzerland were initially rugby sides, but no other country has a deep rugby culture like France's.  Rugby was seeded into France at multiple points principally through traders and ex-pats.  Le Harve formed as a dual code club (association & rugby football) by a British railway manger in 1872 & Bordeaux had a club formed by a British wine merchant & those in the textiles trade in the 1870s too.  Pierre Coubertin was a key figure, mainly remembered today for founding the Olympics, he also helped introduce rugby to France through his book *L'education Angleterre* which focused on the positive aspects of Rugby School under its famous headmaster Tom Arnold.  Following France's military defeat to Prussia in 1871 & the Paris Commune there was a serious crisis of culture, what had lead to this humiliating defeat and subsequent uprising and what could we do to stop it in the future?  Coubertin looked to Britain and the role sports played in its culture.  Many *lycees* took to the game and former pupils of Condorcet & Monge schools formed Racing club in 1882, while former pupils of Saint-Louis formed Stade Francais.  Both of these are still prominent clubs and recent French champions today.  France didn't have the hang ups on competition like the British did and thus formed a Club Championship in 1892 (first competed for by Stade & Racing).  This helped spread the game and by 1914 the titles are spread around the areas the game is strong today, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Bayonne, Lyon, Perpignan.  From the British newspaper archive we can see that in the Edwardian era the Leicester Alliance (local select side, not the main Tigers)  toured France but also Germany, while Rosslyn Park went to France but also Austria-Hungary (specifically Prague, Vienna & Budapest).   Here we get into the murkier reeds of motivations.  Casual readers need to understand British class and more specifically the professional/amateur split that happened in rugby in 1895.  This was a proper schism.  Prior to WW1 the "northern Union" (what would become rugby league) had almost as many members as the "Rugby Football Union".  The RFU was desperate to not lose any more ground to their opponents, we can see this in the handling of the 1908 professionalism allegations in the Midlands where Leicester, Coventry & Northampton were basically whitewashed of all the claims against them.  The committee investigating Leicester gave their verdict on the morning of an England international held in Leicester (that was awarded after the inquiry started).  France had lost to New Zealand by only 2 tries in 1906 and regular friendlies against first England then Wales & Ireland showed they were competitive and a draw for crowds, so one reading is purely to do with skill on the field.  France also had a popular club game where players' professional careers often coincidentally seemed to result in them moving to a job just where a top team needed a player. A strict interpretation would only result in them "going north", so they were to be kept in the tent and the excesses of their shamateurism overlooked in all but the worst cases.  There was no danger of Germany "going north" so they didn't need to be included.  We then get the Great War, this of course saw France as a major theatre of war and saw the mass importation of British Empire troops, there were games behind the lines between the ANZAC & British or locals, at the time Canadian football was not so different from rugby and the Canadians played too.  France as an ally was then included in all the victory games, while Germany was specifically banned from playing against the home unions.  In the 1920s rugby became part of France's national culture, the Championship game was first broadcast on the radio in 1923 and it was Bayonnais rugby fans who popularised the Beret (or inspired the popularisation).  This was also the decisive moment, US Quillian out right poached half the Perpignan team in 1927 and the game was burgeoning in Toulouse. "Professionalism" split the game into two competitions, the FFR with their relaxed atttude & the UFRA (Union Francais Rugby Amateur) which wanted, sort of, an amateur game. Perpignan (in the UFRA) said "in order to keep our players amateur we have to pay them twice as much").  In 1930 France came within 1 match of an historic Five Nations Championship and a crowd of 50,000 came to watch them play Wales.  But the 11-0 loss, with two tries (then worth 3 points + conversion) agitated the crowd so much the referee kept play going until it was naturally near the tunnel so as to safely escape the crowd.  In 1931 they were expelled until they enforced the amateur regulations & abolished their championship.  France had formed "FIRA" (Federation International Rugby Amateur), but Germany was a key member and the organisations official language was German.  In 1928 Germany beat France and in 1938 20,000 watched them play in Frankfurt where Germany won again.  Other than to France, Germany lost only 2 internationals in the 30s.  In both world wars lots of rugby internationals lost their lives but Germany was particularly hard hit in WW2 losing 16 internationals, the most of any nation.  FIRA helped spread the game in Italy, Romania and elsewhere in Europe.  France didn't return to the Five Nations Championship until after WW2, which as many can imagine changed things somewhat again.  French rugby in the second world war is a whole different kettle of fish (the Vichy government regarded Rugby union & league as the same game, so when they banned all professional sport and forced them amateur they rolled the league game wholly into Union).  There is a suggestion that the IRB was less than keen on FIRA and again invited France back in to try and (succesfully) decapitate the organisation.

n4bht	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1642886262.0	htsje3l	t3_sac70d	t3_sac70d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sac70d/what_historical_events_arent_talked_about/htsje3l/

820vw	There are two elements to your question, firstly "twisting a cord" and secondly "on Sunday morning".  To address the first, "twisting a cord" at Newton's time was a common way of strengthening twine or yarn for all kinds of uses. [String, twine, yarn, cord, rope etc](https://www.the-ropewalk.co.uk/ks2th2.pdf) were all part of the same continuum of  objects, because it is possible to make thicker rope by twisting together thinner ropes.   Cords were made as part of the making of whatever object the person wanted to have hold together. It could have been anything; his clothing, a wrapped parcel, documents, a cord to suspend something from his bedroom ceiling, we don't know and Newton himself would likely have considered doing that to be a mundane part of normal life. *Working* life.  Which brings us to the second element, the Sabbath. [Strict Sabbatarianism](https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.2307/3165251) was a Puritan doctrine however by Newton's youth it had become sufficiently widely accepted among English Christians to be practiced by Anglicans also, hence the presence of this, and "making a feather", "making a mousetrap", "making pies" etc in Newton's list.	1642888028.0	htsnqgf	t3_sa50ad	t3_sa50ad	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa50ad/what_does_newton_mean_when_he_mentioned_the_sin/htsnqgf/

11im0u	Thanks for the detailed answer. Would you mind expounding a bit on France "not having hang ups on competition like Britain did"? Does that have to do with the amateur/professional divide?	1642888207.0	htso694	t3_sa2hd5	t1_htshqdy	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa2hd5/how_and_why_did_france_become_the_odd_one_out_in/htso694/
7sxro	Thank you; I'm very glad you thought it was fascinating. So do I.  The answer is perhaps surprising: the dynasty did not kill itself off—not once from 1323 to 1922! It's pretty amazing, actually.   It's worth noting that the Ottomans experienced internecine (brother-on-brother) war for the throne between 1400-1450, and then officially practiced fratricide for 150 years between 1450 and 1595; it did not occur for the entire 600-year dynasty.  There is no evidence that the sultans had trouble siring heirs. Every sultan between 1400-1595 (except one) had to kill at least one brother in war or execute his infant/child siblings. The reason the practice of fratricide ended in 1595 is because Sultan Murad III had 7 consorts, 22 sons, and 28 daughters. His heir Mehmed III ascended the throne and immediately executed all 19 of his living infant brothers, which caused huge public outrage.	1642888672.0	htspars	t3_s7sm1l	t1_hter33y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htspars/
1jn5r7q	Yes, the people who ran the RFU believed that professionalism was an inevitable consequence of competition (and they were right really) and competitions even local ones were at best frowned upon and were actively discouraged.  The Calcutta cup (competed for by England and Scotland annually) was originally donated to be an equivalent to the FA cup, to be awarded to the best team in England but the RFU would not countenance that for another century more or less. The cup in England did not start until 1972 and the league until 1987.  There were big cups in Yorkshire and Lancashire that obviously declined post 1895 and the Midlands Counties Cup was a biggish thing until Leicestershire split from Warwickshire in 1920 but nothing else really until the 70s	1642889171.0	htsqjhf	t3_sa2hd5	t1_htso694	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa2hd5/how_and_why_did_france_become_the_odd_one_out_in/htsqjhf/

kfhe9	My turn of phrase was a little bit unclear: what makes the story credible (and not propagandistic) is that it showed those French soldiers as fundamentally weak: they not only got themselves captured, but they had let another man have his way with them, and then they cried about it. The death of general François Mireur on 9 July 1798 is another example of the reluctance of accepting "weakness": according to an officer (Desvernois) who claims to have found his body, Mireur committed suicide in the desert after criticizing in front of Napoleon the entire goal of the campaign, but official reports said the he had been assassinated by the Bedouins.   In any case, you're right about the fact that officers (in the letters at least) do not seem to express much sympathy for their soldiers. In the case of Mireur, Napoleon did claim in his memoirs that the general had been killed by those "wretches" and called him "one of the bravest men [he] had ever known" but he still blamed Mireur for his lack of prudence (letter to the Directoire, 24 July 1798).	1642889312.0	htsqw51	t3_s5b2oe	t1_htqlxgq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s5b2oe/the_violation_of_napoleons_troops_at_the_hands_of/htsqw51/

2nwv9ekt	I won't be able to provide an answer as detailed as the link already provided but I read a lot of books around life in the trenches and suicide in the trenches occured.  I can however tell you what I found on the French side.   First, suicide is commonly mentioned in most testimonies or fiction stories by veterans I have read in French:  - Memoires de poilus -Les croix de bois by Dorgelès  As per those testimonies, suicide could take several forms. Some men would put a bullet through their heads. Others would come out of the trench and run toward the enemy. Those ones would not be considered as having committed suicide even though by all witnesses is was clearly one. For this reason, it would be difficult to establish what is a suicide and what is not and thus, the numbers are always inaccurate.    As I saw your question I searched quickly in French to see if the topic had been covered.  What I found is this [article](https://www.france24.com/fr/20180815-premiere-guerre-mondiale-suicide-poilus-sante-mentale-rehabilitation) which seems rather well sourced (France24 is a rather legit media).   This article quotes several estimations based on samples. For example Xavier Trochu, a French historian checked 93000 soldier records. From that sample he estimated the amount of suicide in the french army at 4000.  The French historian Denis Rolland estimated between 4000 and 5000 suicides in the French army.  So one can assume it must be around this number.  Both historians explain the difficulty to trace this number. First, because some suicide will not be considered as such (as I explained above) but also because suicide was an extremely taboo topic. To the point where both historians mention that in hospitals doctors would not always acknowledge a suicide as such because it was seen by them as a failure of their own ability to help the patients. Finally, a suicide was seen as dishonorable. A suicided would not earn the title "Fallen for France" which would allow their relatives to receive money from the government. Some suicides were therefore hidden by the direct officers who would not deprive the families of their fallen men from that money.	1642890285.0	htstc7k	t3_s8dc4j	t3_s8dc4j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8dc4j/what_were_suicide_rates_in_the_trenches_during/htstc7k/

i8393	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1642892220.0	htsy4rv	t3_saehp4	t3_saehp4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saehp4/what_is_the_difference_in_the_nature_of/htsy4rv/

ft5sujfd	This is a great answer, thank you so much!  The role of superintendent of finance seems like he was very powerful, but that power was limited to carrying out the will of congress, which I assume was basically to win the war?  Was it controversial when he took logistics of supply from the states? That sounds like a major step towards the centralized authority that so many of the states feared at the time.   Finally, what was the secret committee?

nxyvc	Hey there,    Just to let you know, your question is fine, and we're letting it stand. However, you should be aware that questions framed as 'Why didn't X do Y' relatively often don't get an answer that meets our standards (in our experience as moderators). There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it often can be difficult to prove the counterfactual: historians know much more about what happened than what might have happened. Secondly, 'why didn't X do Y' questions are sometimes phrased in an ahistorical way. It's worth remembering that people in the past couldn't see into the future, and they generally didn't have all the information we now have about their situations; things that look obvious now didn't necessarily look that way at the time.    If you end up not getting a response after a day or two, [consider asking a new question focusing instead on why what happened did happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) (rather than why what didn't happen didn't happen) - this kind of question is more likely to get a response in our experience. Hope this helps!	1642895340.0	htt5o0m	t3_sa8msb	t3_sa8msb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa8msb/why_there_are_no_large_empire_in_moanda_congo/htt5o0m/
nxyvc	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1642895383.0	htt5rzr	t3_saep2w	t3_saep2w	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saep2w/what_is_the_difference_in_the_nature_of/htt5rzr/
nxyvc	**Please repost this question to the weekly "[Short Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASASQ)" thread stickied to the top of the subreddit, which will be the best place to get an answer to this question**; for that reason, we have removed your post here. Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.     Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642895435.0	htt5wp8	t3_sadiuc	t3_sadiuc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sadiuc/are_there_any_early_examples_of_the_assassination/htt5wp8/

7sxro	I asked myself the exact same question out of pure curiosity. Neither *The Imperial Harem* nor Kate Fleet's *The Cambridge History of Turkey, Vol. II: the Ottomans as a World Power 1453-1603* had a clear answer. I came to the same conclusion as you did: the Ottomans may have thought that executing one or two kids was just the price of doing business, but 19 infants was a bridge too far.   Fleet does mention in *History of Turkey* that “there are hints in some chronicles that the practice of fratricide always displeased the sultan's subjects….” P. 792. Likewise, when Suleiman the Magnificent's two sons began fighting for the throne before Suleiman's death, he said, “you may leave all to God, for it is not man's pleasure, but God's will, that disposes of kingdoms and their government. If He has decreed that you shall have the kingdom after me, no man living will be able to prevent it.” *Imperial Harem*, loc. 789. The more you read about it, the more it seems like the Ottomans considered fratricide an ugly necessity, not an objectively good idea. And yet... they practiced it for 200 years.  What happened to extra brothers after 1595? It “seems to have been public revulsion at the slaughter of [nineteen] princes that put an end to the custom of fratricide and to have initiated the practice of secluding princes so that they could not present a danger to the reigning sultan.” *History of Turkey*, p. 793. “Secluding” feels like a little bit of a euphemism there, because princes were kept under house-arrest in the kafes (Turkish for “cage”), the apartments within the royal harem where unwanted brothers languished under constant surveillance by palace guards. The last Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, took the throne at age 56; he had lived his entire life until then in the kafes!

7rvatyyv	My point in mentioning the background of the signatories is that when they are clearly biased towards one side like this, they are going to hold a strong opinion on it, and that should make readers take caution. It is similar to noting that the conferences Turkey hosts about the genocide (in which they simply call them "massacres" or some other lesser term): with the overwhelming body of Turkish academia supporting such a view, that is something to take note, and not accept at its face value.  That said, looking at the letter here does raise questions: the most glaring one that jumps out to me is they accuse de Waal of using a narrow scope of dates (1915-1916), while arguing that "most scholars" assert the dates should be much wider (1915-1923). This is far from the truth: most reputable sources would give a range of 1915-1916 or 1917. One of the most authoritative scholars on the genocide, Raymond Kevorkian, uses 1915-1916 in his *The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History* (2011), and as the letter concedes Ronald Grigor Suny uses 1915-1917 in his work on the topic (which I'm assuming refers to his *They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else* (2015); both are scholars of Armenian heritage I'll note, as well.   I'm quite interested in who is using such a late date, and what their justification is, seeing how by 1918 the war with Russia was over, and while the Ottoman forces were invading the Caucasus (en route to Baku), they were stopped by the forces of the First Armenian Republic in a series of battles in May 1918, as well as the diplomatic and military intervention of Germany. Most Armenians were long gone out of Anatolia by that point as well: either dead, dying in the Syrian desert, or as refugees in the newly-formed Armenian state, which was given diplomatic recognition by the Ottoman Empire in June 1918. While there was still some smaller massacres that continued, the focus had shifted as the Ottoman Empire was busy losing the First World War, and would subsequently turn it's attention to killing it's ethnic Greek population, fighting off a Greek invasion related to that, disputing the Treaty of Sevres, and then engaging in a civil war that ended with the formation of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923.	1642896784.0	htt98lo	t3_s68982	t1_htscx3o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htt98lo/

h8ny3uyr	I can’t speak about what the internal Church discussions about the excommunication were, hopefully someone else can.  I can add some information however:   The Catholic Church did do some excommunicating for being a Nazi leader, but it doesn’t appear as if Goebbels was specifically excommunicated for only that.   First, a some background:   Church excommunications of Nazis began in September 1930, when the bishop of Mainz excommunicated every Catholic member of the Nazi party in his diocese, banned uniformed groups from entering churches, and forbade Nazis from taking part in services and ceremonies.   In February 1931, the German bishops had their annual conferences and and decided to support the bishop of Mainz, but limited excommunications to Nazi leaders and activists, and exemptions “followers” who might have supported the Nazi Party for specific policies and without understanding the Nazis’ ultimate goals regarding religion.   In December 1931, Goebbels married. This was the time of his excommunication. While he had considering becoming a priest while younger, by this point he was already quite anti-Christianity, especially against the Catholic Church.   The Church eased its restrictions on Nazi party membership in 1933, at first to accommodate a law requiring all civil employees and union members to be party members, and then as part of maneuvers with the Nazis; cumulating in some public assurances by Hitler and the Reichsconcordant, an agreement signed in July 1933 between the Catholic Church and the German government ostensibly preserving the rights of the Church in Germany (note: Hitler became chancellor in January 1933, and seized full power in 1934). Some Catholics even helped Hitler take power, most prominently Franz von Papen.   With all of this in mind, while his own anti-Church rhetoric and string Nazis ties may well have been preexisting “strikes” that attracted Church attention, I do not believe they were the only reason Goebbels was excommunicated and here is why:  1. His excommunication was not during the general “we excommunicate Nazis leaders as a whole” time of February 1931. His excommunication occurred in at the time of his marriage, in December 1931,. It wasn’t explicitly lifted with the general ban in 1933 either, not even when the Church wasn’t excommunicating Catholics like van Papen for enabling the Nazis to take total power.   2. Geobbels wrote in his diary that he was excommunicated for his marriage, at the time of his marriage. He published an edited version that diary in 1933 before the Nazis took power and when they still the Catholic Church could have been a strong opponent, and then later had all of his diaries processed for posterity, so it is possible that he lied to maintain the fiction that a good Catholic could be a Nazi, but the original, handwritten versions remained, and were published in 2004. They say the same thing.   3. No other major Nazi leaders were excommunicated by name, not even Hitler. Some argue he doesn’t count as he had already made himself an apostate years before so the Church considered him not to be a member, but no one else was excommunicated by name either. If the only reason Geobbels was excommunicated was his Nazi leadership, then why weren’t other Nazis treated similarly?   4. His marriage was going to cause trouble. Catholic canon law from 1917-1983, specifically canon 2319 ​​§1, 1°, said that marrying, baptizing a child, or teaching a child in a belief other than Catholicism was cause for automatic excommunication.    Goebbels married a divorced Protestant, who was only a Protestant herself because she was a Catholic apostate who converted to Protestantism to marry her now ex-husband, in a civil ceremony filled with the leaders of an anti Catholic party, but no priests. This was enough for automatic excommunication, and the high profile of the wedding meant that the Church was sure to know about it.   So why didn’t the Church excommunicate more Nazis?  It is very late for me, and this is in an entire question itself, but the extremely brief answer is that there are two ways to be excommunicated. One didn’t apply most of the time and the other wasn’t worth it to the Church leadership at the time.   The fast way is the automatic way (latae sententiae) that Goebbels did it. Break the wrong church rule, and you get automatic excommunication the moment that you do it. Perhaps there may be some paperwork after the fact, but that is all that it is. You are already out.  Not a lot of what the Nazis did the the pre-war years were covered by these rules. They focused more on internal church matters.  The other is by trial (sententiae ferendae). This is rare, and the existing canon law didn’t apply perfectly to what the Nazis were doing.   Of course it could have been done in some form, as the 1930/31 decisions showed, but the ultimately failed efforts to maintain Church independence in Germany and some ambivalence about some Nazi policies by some in the Church made it not Really Worth It until it was way too late.  Then, the war was on, oppression was already great, Hitler’s ally Mussolini was also a strong church supporter at home in Italy and couldn’t be pushed too far, and then after that, the war was over.

9v6a6	In that case I would say neither. Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, specifically, is not good book in many ways. It is incredibly dated and reflects very outdated scholarship. It is quite an important book in understanding the evolution of historiography on the war, and also has some use as a *primary* source since Shirer was a witness to some of the events, and his presentation of events in the book reflects his own perception of them, but it just isn't useful as a general history of the Third Reich, long surpassed by any number of better works.  The best suggestion I would offer is the three volume 'Third Reich Trilogy' by Richard J. Evans. It is well researched, well written and engaging, and reflects current scholarship much better than Shirer.  As for Inferno, you could do a lot worse than Hastings, although it wouldn't be *my* personal recommendation. It actually is included on the subreddit booklist as one of the recommended introductory works (with praise from Evans, no less), but my preferred recommendation for introductory book on the war is Weinberg's *World at Arms*. Weinberg is a bit thicker a work though, so Hastings offers a lighter read if that is more your pace (and then Jeremy Black's *World War II* offers a even lighter one).  So if you are deadset on picking between those two, go with Hastings. If you are open to alternatives, Evans is definitely the one you would seem best served by.  [Check out the WWII section of the sub's booklist for more options](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/wwii) and some further commentary on the above.	1642904564.0	httrj6w	t3_s7qqa4	t1_httqhpz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/httrj6w/

gde6c	You might be interested in my [answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7adqkp/did_polygenism_play_a_role_in_the_devellopement/dpa291q).  To summarize the key takeaway, natural historians didn't claim to have "discovered" racial difference; the construction of racial categories began much earlier, in the political sphere. Rather, the earliest works of modern taxonomy (e.g. Linnaeus) already took these categories for granted. Physical anthropologists (e.g. Blumenbach) looked for evidence to identify "scientific" ways in which these self-evident categories might be delieanted. This was never a movement or school of thought; it was just part of regular science like everything else. Candie could have picked up most any book and found something with which to justify his views.	1642907588.0	httyf76	t3_sa9sl8	t3_sa9sl8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa9sl8/how_were_new_discoveries_claimed_in_1800s_racial/httyf76/

2rzmr8ac	This is an interesting question and I've seen versions of it posted several times.  If you define modern as 20th century, then there are numerous men from the American West, from 1805 until about 1870, who fall in this category.  They often held a mix of jobs, freelanced or did contract work, were soldiers, scouts, professional hunters and trappers, Indian fighters, etc.    Without knowing whether you're interested in them (or whether you're considering pre-modern to be before \~1500), I'm not sure how much detail to give.    The Lewis & Clark expedition was a government-funded expedition across the Northern Rocky Mountains  to the Oregon coast, and back, kicked off a boom in the fur trade, causing hundreds of men to start trapping, hunting, and exploring the Plains and the Rockies, starting in about 1807.    John Colter was a member of the expedition, and before the expedition got back, he was honorably discharged in North Dakota and joined up with two beaver trappers to lead them ***back*** into Montana. He later became, probably, the explored the area that is now the Grand Teton National Park, possibly parts of Yellowstone, and probably Jackson Hole.  He was probably the first White man to ever visit parts of Yellowstone, and he reported of unimaginable geothermal activity in that area.  He traveled hundreds of miles in the winter by himself.  He both traded and helped Native American tribes, and also fought other tribes.    Kit Carson was in the second wave of trappers. He was mostly in New Mexico and the southern Rockies.  He went on trapping expeditions, fought the Apache, explored into California and Colorado, went on rescue missions, etc. As a mountain man, he had to hunt for his food, and fought grizzly bears.  He worked as a professional hunter (shooting game to feed settlers) at one point, and was in the military during the Mexican-American War and for the Union during the Civil War (during the brief New Mexico campaign).  He was hired by the government as a professional scout for 3 of John Fremont's expeditions mapping the west.     He was involved in many skirmishes/battles with various Native American tribes, and was later an Indian Agent for the government.  He fought in the First Battle of Adobe Walls in Texas against the Kiowa tribe, and led some brutal/harsh campaigns against the Apache and Navajo (basically, genocide). He could not read or write but spoke English, Spanish, and several Native American languages. He was married thrice; his first wife was Arapaho and he fought a duel against a French-Canadian to win her hand in marriage.  His second wife was Cheyenne tribe.  His third wife was Hispanic/Mexican woman. Blood and Thunder by Hampton Sides tells his story; it's an epic tale and so crazy that it seems like fiction. [https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Thunder-Carson-Conquest-American/dp/1400031109](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Thunder-Carson-Conquest-American/dp/1400031109)      Jim Bridger spent about 20 years blazing trails, trapping, guiding, etc. all over the northern Rockies.  He was probably the first White man to see the geysers of Yellowstone.  He explored the Great Salt Lake.  He also fought bears (common thread with these guys). He was hired as a guide by various parties and was a scout for the government during Red Cloud's War.   These are just three of the dozen or so famous mountain men.  This era sorta closed by about 1840 or so, as the beaver population declined and the price of pelts collapsed because men's fashion turned to silk top hats rather than beaver pelt hats. After the Civil War, there were other waves of settlers and men who also provided various contract mercenary type skills (scouting, guiding, professional hunting, providing security to stage coaches, etc.).	1642909100.0	htu1r9m	t3_s9sy3h	t3_s9sy3h	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9sy3h/was_there_anything_in_the_premodern_era_esp/htu1r9m/

6mgfuvle	Please elaborate on the « background » of Henry Theriault who is the first signatory of this letter.   I see you are easily evading the point so I will ask again: would you dare writing that Lempkin is holding a strong opinion and has bias about Nazi Germany when he did his work about the genocide definition, as a Jew?  Many scholars have an armenian background because the whole world closed the topic after the Lausanne treaty. Genocide survivors and their child became the most knowledgeable on the topic for a lot of reasons (documents available in turkish or armenians for instance). During decades western countries were also blocking research on the topic themselves, whether in France or in the USA.   To focus on the actual topic: de Waal has been called out several times for not naming the genocide by its name until very recently. Literally a turkish state behavior, the rest of the world is passed this for decades already. Since then he had to adapt his language and now minimalize the crime or he would not be able to pose as a so-called expert of the region anymore.   Kevorkian and Ternon have been consolidating every piece of knowlege about the 1915-1923 from the beginning to the complete eradication of the armenian civilization, from the young turks to ataturk. The « smaller massacres » happening in 1917-1923 in the ottoman empire and also … in azerbaijan (echoing the repeat from the 2020 war), the laws confiscating the (very large) wealth of armenians are also included part of it. A genocide is not about small or large number of deads, but state planning, intention and actions.   https://www.amazon.com/M%C3%A9morial-g%C3%A9nocide-Arm%C3%A9niens-Raymond-K%C3%A9vorkian/dp/2021139409/ref=nodl_  You can see the french version of wikipedia using the new dates already.	1642910978.0	htu641e	t3_s68982	t1_htt98lo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htu641e/

pncvt	### I: The Weird Mess that is Manchu Demography  Population figures for the Manchus under Qing rule aren't difficult to reconstruct for a historian with access to the source material, but the secondary sources don't always do a lot of in-depth enumerating, particularly for certain periods like the late 18th century where a population figure might be very useful for comparative purposes. It has only been comparatively recently that there has been significant English-language scholarship looking into Manchu demography in depth. Before we continue it is worth pointing out that Manchu demography is tied up in broader Banner demography, producing a bit of a Russian nesting doll sort of issue: the Banners were divided into Manchu Banners, Mongol Banners, and Hanjun ('Martial Han') Banners, and even then the Manchu Banners included a handful of non-Manchu but broadly Tungusic peoples; there were also 'bondservant companies' not organised into full Banners but instead attached to the other Banners, primarily the Manchus. Not all the sources on population figures divide helpfully between those four categories, although the more detailed ones do.  In terms of sources, there are two broad sorts. The most regular are estimates in contemporary writings, which you would hope would give at least a good sense of trends over time. But these tend to vary heavily, in large part because they don't consistently choose the same metric: are they counting just Manchus, or all 'free' Bannermen, or the total population of Bannermen including enslaved and bonded people, and were they excluding unemployed Bannermen or and only counting those in military or civil service? Rarer, but more useful, are a few detailed surveys of the Banner population carried out at the court's behest.  While these surveys are very precise, they are, it should be noted, very precise on one particular bit of data, that being the number of *ding* 丁 (able-bodied males) in the Banners. What we don't know is the dependency ratio, where estimates range from as little as 1:3 to as much as 1:9, with the latter figure generally incorporating slaves and bondservants who formed their own households for some purposes, but were counted in 'free' Manchu households for others. Mark Elliott, in *The Manchu Way* (2001), opts to offer 1:3 as a low-end estimate, and 1:6 as a high-end estimate. Using the precise breakdowns found in Qing documents in 1648 and 1720, he gives the following figures:  Year | Manchus | Mongols | Hanjun | Bondservants and Others -|-|-|-|- 1648 | 206,961-389,436  | 107,729-202,712 | 171,591-322,881 | 812,002-1,527,937 1720 | 576,786-1,083,480 | 230,508-433,747 | 766,279-1,442,747 | 1,025,202-1,929,113  What complicates these figures further is that not all bondservants were Han. Indeed, perhaps half would have been Manchus at the time these sets of data were compiled. Which means that while the 'free' Manchu population would have gone from around 200-400k to 570k-1m, the *total* Manchu population would likely have been closer to 600k-1.1m in 1648, and 1.1m-2m in 1720.  David Porter carries the demographic data through into the nineteenth century, though he only counts *ding* and avoids the dependency issue; I've reproduce his data, in conjunction with An's, below:  Year | Manchus | Mongols | Hanjun | Bondservants and Slaves | 'Post-Conquest Han'* | Misc. Others* -|-|-|-|-|-|- 1648 | 55,330 | 28,785 | 45,849 | 216,967 |  1657 | 49,695 | 26,053 | 78,782 | 237,338 | 1720 | 154,117 | 61,562 | 204,870 | 239,494 | 34,440 | 5,577 1788 | 201,373 | 72,761 | 148,945 | 67,608 | 31,635 | 6,353 1818 | 222,968 | 72,128 | 143,554 | 50,163 | 29,893 | 4,346 1887 | 229,011 | 75,367 | 143,322 | 27,172 | 32,680 | 4,796  \* Where known  What is important to note is the decline in both Hanjun and bondservant categories there: the late Qianlong period saw a substantial effort to expel certain non-Manchus and Mongols from the Banners for reasons that are debated and which I won't really get into now; then in the nineteenth century there was a substantial reduction in numbers of bondservants and slaves in the Banners. This complicates things as far as Manchu demography goes. Porter suggests bondservants were overwhelmingly Han, which was probably true for his period of coverage in the later eighteenth into nineteenth centuries, but in the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods at least, it seems plausible enough – albeit near-impossible to definitively prove – that most bondservants were ethnically Manchu, but that there was a gradual move to elevate ethnic-Manchu bondservant companies into the ranks of the 'free' Manchu Banners. This, then, means that the shorthand of adding half the bondservants probably no longer works past a certain point, and there seems to be no clear answer on what the ethnic makeup of the bondservant companies was after their dramatic slashing in the Qianlong reign.  Still, assuming we can reuse the 1:3 to 1:6 dependency ratios, then I'd give as estimates for the Manchu population in 1788, 1818 and 1887, rounding to 3 significant figures:  Year | Excluding Bondservants | Assuming 50% of Bondservants are Manchu -|-|-  1788 | 805,000-1,410,000 | 941,000-1,650,000 1818 | 892,000-1,560,000 | 992,000-1,740,000 1887 | 916,000-1,600,000 | 970,000-1,700,000  With all that, then, it seems reasonable to say that by the end of the Qing, the Manchu population was somewhere in the realm of that 1887 estimate, probably a bit larger.  Now, a fair point that can be raised is that this is the *total* number of Manchus in the entirety of the Qing, not just those in China proper. Elliott, unfortunately, only looks at China Proper and doesn't give any figures for Bannermen in Manchuria/the Northeast or in Xinjiang. There is a breakdown of troop deployments by Rhoads, based on the 1887 Banner census and Thomas Wade's 1825 report on the Qing military, although he seems to use 'northwest China' to cover the garrisons in Xinjiang and Mongolia, not just what we would more conventionally term 'northwest China' (i.e. Gansu, Shaanxi, and environs). Per Rhoads, of 260,000 deployed Banner troops, 150,000 were in Beijing and 110,000 were not. Of these 110,000, 16,000 are placed by Rhoads in 'northwest China', and 37,000 in Manchuria. Checking Wade's figures, based on the 1825 Banner payrolls, of 236,000 privates there were about 13,600 in 'Turkestan' (i.e. presumably both Mongolia and Xinjiang) and 40,800 in Manchuria, which would seem to affirm the above read of Rhoads' categorisation. So in short, in 1887 there were around 207,000 Banner troops in China Proper and 53,000 in other parts of the empire; assuming (not entirely correctly) a homogeneous ethnic distribution, that'd mean 80% of the Banner population was in China proper, which in absolute numbers would be about 700,000-1,350,000 people.	1642923346.0	htusqfz	t3_s9ugbx	t3_s9ugbx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9ugbx/about_how_many_manchus_lived_in_china_proper/htusqfz/
pncvt	### II: Movement to China Proper  We need to understand that Manchus did not have a particularly substantial degree of economic or political freedom under Qing rule. Bannermen were, discursively, 'slaves of the emperor', though we need to comprehend this within broader Northeast Asian discourses of slavery. I discuss these at greater length [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jy7m9j/did_china_ever_have_slavery/gd2j5r1/), but in short, pre-conquest Jurchen/Manchu society was nominally organised as basically a pyramid of political and economic bondage, in which freeholders (*jušen*) were subordinated to elites (*irgen*) in what was understood to be the same way that slaves (*aha*) and household servants (*booi*) were themselves bonded to the freeholders; in turn, higher-level political leaders claimed to exercise the same kind of authority over the mid-level elites. While the stratification of Manchu society eroded considerably in the decades after the conquest of China, the discursive idea of bondage to the will of the leader remained: the emperor was understood as holding authority over the lives of the Bannermen at a fundamentally intimate level.  As such, Manchus didn't *choose* to migrate to China proper as such. Because all Manchus were in the Banners, they were, at least from a legal standpoint, bound to the emperor's will. As such, those who were not assigned to the Manchurian garrisons were *ordered* to relocate to China Proper and settle primarily in Beijing. The subsequent dispersal of the Banners into provincial garrisons is an interesting point in itself, as originally, Bannermen were supposed to be rotated in and out of these garrisons on the regular. The problem, however, was that this was not particularly practicable without state subsidies, and it also raised quite a serious *moral* problem because of the practicalities of, well, human mortality – like many other societies in the broader Asian region, Manchu burial practices emphasised burying families together, and if a member of a household died during a provincial posting and had to be buried there, the rest of the family would find themselves having to leave their loved one's grave behind. The eventual 'fixing' of the garrisons, then, was never fully intended, but emerged as a practical consequence of their creation in the first place.  Why have these garrisons at all? To put it simply, the Qing were basically an occupying force. With the Banners being the loyal soldier-administrator caste of the empire, their distribution in populous and/or strategically-vital locations was a critical part of maintaining state security. This was in fact not a fundamental Qing innovation, as earlier 'conquest dynasties', most prominently the Jurchen Jin and Mongol Yuan, had also established interior garrison forces, implicitly out of fear of domestic insurrection. Such fears were far from unfounded: rebellions of various origin would plague the Qing for most of their existence, and even if we only count Han uprisings, the longest reprieve was between 1683 and 1774 – a good run, to be sure, but one in which there were nevertheless notable revolt scares, particularly the Zeng Jing conspiracy of 1727 and the queue-cutting panic of 1768. As the elite mobile arm of the Qing military, the Banners were expected to be able to decisively respond to domestic crisis when called upon.  ### Sources and Further Reading  * Mark C.

This is not a judgement of your question, but to receive the answer you are looking for, it would be better suited to /r/AskAnthropology.

2i47exce	Ugh, I meant Mehmed who killed 19 brothers, not Murad.  I'm sorry to sound like a broken record, but wow...house arrest from birth. What kind of staff did the princes have and were they able to talk with people or have families at all, since they were kept in the harem?   You know, I remember hearing about a guy who was kept in a hole in the ground and when they needed him to become Sultan (I think), they hoisted him up and he was terrified to leave the only place he ever knew his whole life. It also doesn't seem like he got to talk with anyone or was educated at all. How was Sultan Mehmed VI after the kafes? I'll have to look him up...	1642927488.0	htuy9x8	t3_s7sm1l	t1_htt8ow5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7sm1l/what_was_the_purposestructure_of_a_harem/htuy9x8/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).  Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?" If you need some pointers, be sure to check out this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pbdv/rules_roundtable_viii_asking_better_questions_to/) on asking better questions.   Finally, don’t forget that there are many subreddits on Reddit aimed at answering your questions. Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642929306.0	htv0m1y	t3_sap5vh	t3_sap5vh	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sap5vh/who_is_the_most_ancient_person_to_be_referenced/htv0m1y/

3zulbep4	>explain why megafauna also went extinct around the globe in areas with prior interactions with humans  OK, one question. The last glacial period started 115,000 years ago.  The big migrations that led to modern homo sapiens sapiens populating the world started 70 kya.  These migrants seem to have been more sophisticated hunters than the Neanderthals and co.  Could this have made the difference, combined with the disruptive effects of the climatic changes?  Or was there something unusual about the most recent de-glaciation, to explain why the previous ones didn't cause the same level of extinction?  I realize anatomically modern humans made it into the Middle East before the previous interglacial, but from what I recall those were not as sophisticated as the later wave - their tools weren't much different from the Neanderthals.  I hope I didn't get any of that wrong.  It was a while ago that I read about most of it.	1642934905.0	htv7rgj	t3_s462tw	t1_htcu1t9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s462tw/native_americans_and_horses_were_both_in_america/htv7rgj/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there.

8rkx9	I have not run into this in primary sources dating to the nineteenth century. It does occur in later primary sources - movies and TV - but these have nothing to do with the actual West. Movies and TV are accurate primary sources when attempting to understand the "Wild West," a place that did not exist in the nineteenth century.  In 1859, [Hank Monk](https://www.academia.edu/40105570/Mark_Twains_Wild_West_and_the_Presidential_Election_of_1872) drove Horace Greeley across the Sierra 40 miles in four hours, but that was on a road that, while not perfect, was at least prepared to a certain extent.   Riding in a wehicle drawn by a team with horses changed every ten miles (every hour) is one thing, riding a horse is another. Similar surprising feats of speed were achieved by the Pony Express, but here again, riders changed horses throughout their ride as they covered considerable distances in a single day.  How far one could travel in a day on a single horse depended a lot of terrain, and the West is a very large place, so the answer to your question could vary a great deal depending on the circumstance.   People still talk about a certain town being "an hour away." That is understood locally because people tend to decribe the distances they know in terms of time rather then miles. That said, "an hour away" means something very different when considering traffic issues in the Los Angeles area (where "an hour away" might mean 5 miles away) as opposed to that same time in the rural intermountain West (where "an hour away" may translate into 70 miles). There are many Wests, and the asnwer to your question would depend on the local situation.	1642939339.0	htvdlty	t3_saj82j	t3_saj82j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saj82j/old_west_1800s_what_did_it_mean_when_some_one/htvdlty/

These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).

3rm66p	There was this anime about rakugo performers where a lot of emphasis is put on their names: the name they were given when they became apprentices, the one they were given (or chose) when they became full fledged performers, and the struggles about inheriting the master's name. Basically, the names define both who you are now and your vision of your art and future artistic routes. The Anime is set in the showa era, so very recent, but rakugo, sumo, tea cerimony, etc, those are all perceived traditional arts. Is this custom meaningful still in perceived modern or imported form of art?	1642943209.0	htvj7g6	t3_sa52pf	t1_hts3zq3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa52pf/japanese_artist_hokusai_was_known_by_at_least/htvj7g6/

hiag0s4	I think more can be said but here is a similar question with a good answer. (I assume the comparison is criminal organizations in other countries, but this might want to be clarified if it isn’t correct).   * [Why is organized crime such as Yakuza still thriving but Al-Capone style Italian mob disappeared?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/oir2xr/why_is_organized_crime_such_as_yakuza_still/) answered by u/blackflag415  The gist is that the government and others found the yakuza useful at times. Thus politics, business, and underworld elements interacted for their own ends. So echoing the answer, Japan is just structurally and institutionally different. Here is also an answer regarding the use of the yakuza.   * [I heard that the Japanese government in 60s/70s used the Yakuza to break up union strikes, fight against protesters, etc. Is there any truth to this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8vhl47/i_heard_that_the_japanese_government_in_60s70s/) answered by u/Vox-Triarii  In regards to the origin of the yakuza, I agree more with this answer than the idea the centuries old *samurai* lineage. Some of the modern organizations were just underworld developments, but like the answers (above) attest there isn’t one yakuza.   * [The origin of the yakuza is often cited to be ronin, or masterless samurai. To what extent is this true, and how did they make the transition from Edo-period samurai to modern-day criminal organizations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nlkiom/the_origin_of_the_yakuza_is_often_cited_to_be/) answered by u/foppery-andwhim	1642946094.0	htvo95w	t3_s648hv	t3_s648hv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s648hv/what_were_the_factors_that_allowed_the_yakuza_of/htvo95w/

7helxsbg	Thank you for the answer! So if I'm getting it right, it wasn't so much that medieval kings ever outright said "go do this job or we'll kill you," but due to a plethora of societal and legal restrictions it was the only real way for jewish people to make a decent living without also having to assimilate, and medieval christian rulers had an interest in keeping them pigeonholed in that role?	1642948371.0	htvso0m	t3_s4xi7r	t1_htrldfb	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4xi7r/were_jewish_people_in_medieval_europe_forced_into/htvso0m/

88vwr8h8	My pleasure! Broadly speaking, yes, your summation is correct.  Obviously my answer is very much looking at the ‘big picture’, and there were specific instances of some Jews having more or less liberty (than other Jews) in certain regions and under certain monarchs.  It’s also important to note than many Jews didn’t make a ‘decent’ living, but just managed to scrape by. And — As the 1290 expulsion from England illustrates so starkly — even the wealthiest Jews were always only one edict away from becoming destitute, or dead, with no recourse whatsoever.  Jews being explicitly forced to do literal ‘dirty work’ has been seen from time-to-time, but was actually more common in the lands of the Islamic Caliphate than in Christendom, eg. Jews were known to have sometimes been forced to clear animal carcasses from roads and towns, and to clean latrines of Muslims, exemplified by the so-called ‘dung-gatherers decree’ in 19th century Yemen.	1642949474.0	htvv0hu	t3_s4xi7r	t1_htvso0m	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4xi7r/were_jewish_people_in_medieval_europe_forced_into/htvv0hu/
7cg9y	While not utterly wrong, my answer there -- from seven years ago -- is certainly not up to snuff with current r/AskHistorians answers. I don't think you should link it.  I would not feel comfortable answering this question here today. If I did anyways, I would answer it fundamentally differently. E.g. I would put more emphasis on the imposition of imperial education in the British empire and the extent to which it often was not at all a free choice for schoolchildren to learn English as opposed to other languages.  The one-sentence answer is still that English became the global language because it was first the language of the British empire and afterwards the language of the American 'empire'. (And I'll stand by saying that any suggestion that it had something to do with the linguistic qualities of English is historical nonsense.)  But the five-paragraph answer needs to take into account the distinction between different spheres of communication. The history of English becoming the dominant language of science is different from that of English becoming the dominant language of diplomacy which is different from that of English becoming the dominant language of tourists, etc.  The history of Japan is an interesting example. Up until roughly 1858 the dominant European language being studied in Japan was Dutch, as part of the so-called *rangaku* where Western science was acquired by way of Dutch-language books. After the US deployed gunboat diplomacy to 'open' Japan to the world, English soon eclipsed Dutch, a switch later consolidated and entrenched by the US post-war occupation.  Every country/region in the world will have its own history with the English language. A proper answer needs to take that into account, which my old answer there really did not.	1642949560.0	htvv79m	t3_s8kn8b	t1_htvmuj6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8kn8b/how_did_english_become_a_global_language/htvv79m/

43nj0	  The Celts are a very broad term as you had Celtic peoples from Ireland to Turkey. But the Celts that we're talking about are the Gaels who populated Ireland, Man, and Scotland and whose descendants live there today.  According to historian Ronald Hutton in "The Stations of the Sun", evidence is scant on Samhain in pre-Christian times. We know from early Christian monks writing about the Irish that their folklore viewed Samhain to be significant. But that's about all we know.  It's likely that a great deal of the association with the dead and spooky things originated from the Christian festivals of All Saints Day and All Souls Day.  Despite modern Pagans believing otherwise, the historical record doesn't indicate that it was a Celtic New Year.  There just isn't enough information but as Hutton's work shows, it rarely validates the beliefs of modern NeoPagans.	1642951764.0	htw07hl	t3_sadqw0	t3_sadqw0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sadqw0/how_much_evidence_do_we_have_that_there_actually/htw07hl/

6i974xqw	I know that Wild West touring shows (Buffalo Bill Cody’s in particular, but presumably others as well) toured in Europe in the late 19th century. How were those types of shows received by Europeans? Was there already interest in the American West or were those traveling shows the beginning point? And if there was already an interest, where did it come from?

9jwvl	It's a privilege and honor that you're taken time to talk to us. Thank you so very much.  So, I know that China is outside of your expertise, but I was curious more about a general phenomenon I've seen occur in things like the Three Body Problem and more pop-cultural, Star Wars, where I've seen 2 seemingly disparate and interrelated philosophies and cultural mainstays blend and meld together, as if they were always a part of one another.  So, my question is: when a work of fiction gains a fandom in a new area or culture that may have some pretty significant cultural gaps from its origins, how are these stories able to form connections with fans in the new region or culture, and what are some of the reasons they don't?  To add on to that, how can things that the fandom in the new area or culture add to the original work that can then influence both the author and fandom where it was created? Also, what can prevent these new interpretations also fail to resonate?	1642952869.0	htw2wm3	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw2wm3/
kfhe9	In the case of French Indochina (and French colonies) I have answered a related question in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/n4zdis/during_the_colonial_era_did_european_nations_make/) that gives a general view of colonial education with a brief mention on those "natives" who were sent to France to study.  The reasons why colonial authorities wanted to send colonial subjects to study in France were multiple.   * They needed trustworthy, reliable, and well-trained native people to interface with the local populations. The colonial education systems were generally not up to the task when it came to higher education.   * It was a way to reward friendly elites for their collaboration with colonial powers: royal families, aristocrats, chiefs, administrators, mandarins, military officers, scholars, landowners, merchants, etc. Some of those families *wanted* to send their children to France, and it was good policy to satisfy them. In some cases, such families had already been rewarded with their naturalization as French citizens.   * In the early decades of colonisation, keeping in France the sons of local political figures ensured the compliance of the fathers: those "students" were to some extent "hostages" (in Africa, some early colonial schools were actually called, at first, "schools of hostages")  * French-educated *indigènes* were the proof that France wanted the best for its African and Asian subjects, and they could be paraded in colonial propaganda: the civilising mission was making progress. Even colonial newspapers praised those bright individuals who had obtained a doctorate in France or passed the difficult *agrégation* exam that allowed them to become professors in France.   Colonial authorities were well aware of the potential danger of sending their young subjects to study in the metropole. Many believed that educating colonized subjects above a certain level was fundamentally problematic. Informed by scientific racism, some colonial theorists were convinced that non-white people were at best "parrots" whose brains were not equipped to process the superior knowledge provided by Western education (there were also doubts of this sort about poor people and women). If colonized subjects were provided with the same education as regular French people, they would become *déclassés*, embittered and angry, and likely to turn against France. In 1889, explorer and anthropologist Gustave Le Bon reminded his audience at the *Congrès Colonial International* that "the war-cry of the educated Hindus instructed by the English [was] 'India for the Hindus'" (see my [previous answer here about the concept of assimilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pco9sz/this_fb_post_says_all_francophone_africans_know/hd6qrrd/)). Later, a figure like Nguyễn An Ninh, the Sorbonne-educated intellectual turned anticolonialist in the 1920s, was a perfect example of how the higher French education system could turn someone from a reliable background into a subversive. Meeting Ninh in 1924, the Governor of Cochinchina Maurice Cognacq told him bluntly that "we do not want intellectuals".   For French authorities, it was already difficult to control the education of colonial subjects in the colonies, but controlling those people *in France* was harder. Screening potential students was useless if they could be "contaminated" by the wrong ideas when they arrived on French soil. This was not just a problem with students: workers and soldiers (notably those who came to fight in WW1 and WW2) could become tainted too. In the metropole, colonial subjects were no longer ruled by the *code de l'indigénat* - the special penal code designed for the colonized - and could enjoy the full extent of the Liberty, Equality, Fraternity motto. And they did: colonial subjects in France were treated (almost) as normal human beings.  French authorities took serious precautions when it came to accepting colonial subjects in French metropolitan schools. Only a few candidates were granted access and they had to be vetted by colonial authorities. One could not just board a ship, go to France, and expect to be admitted in a French school, though this eventually happened in the 1920s. Typically, one had to be an individual exceptional enough to be given a scholarship, or/and to be from a family known to be friendly to colonial authorities.  This is demonstrated by the case of Hồ Chí Minh, who was *not* sent to France for his education: the son of minor mandarin, he went instead to the "Franco-Annamite" schools in Indochina that were set up for the colonized. He was eventually enrolled at the Quốc Học high school in Huế, a relatively prestigious establishment from which he was expelled for his political activities. He then left Indochina and travelled around the world as a sailor. In September 1911, while his ship was docked in Marseilles, he wrote a letter to the president of the French Republic, requiring assistance to be admitted in the Ecole Coloniale in Paris:  > I am entirely without resources and very eager to receive an education. I would like to become useful to France with regard to my compatriots, and at the same time to enable them to profit from instruction.  The Ecole Coloniale had been established in 1885 to train colonial admnistrators, and it included a "native" section for colonial subjects. Hồ's application was turned down by the school, on the ground that its regulations required that candidates had to be recommended by the governor-general of Indochina. This was obviously not the case for Hồ Chí Minh: not only he was already known as a potential rebel, but his father was disgraced, having spent time in jail for killing a man.   An example of exceptional individual who could be accepted in French schools was the painter Lê Văn Miến, who had been enrolled at the Ecole Coloniale and later at the Fine-Arts School in Paris in the late 1800s. Though Miến could be critical of colonial policies, he was appreciated (and protected) in colonial circles, and, back in Indochina as an art teacher at the Quốc Học high school, he spoke glowingly of France to his students... including to the young Hồ, which may explain the latter's willingness to go to France to receive a higher education at the Ecole Coloniale.    An example of collaborator family - among many - was that of Đỗ Hữu Phương, a rich civil administrator in Cholon, famous for organizing spectacular Franco-Vietnamese banquets. He married his daughter to a French lawyer and was able to send his sons to France to study in prestigious schools, such as Jeanson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand. His son Đỗ Hữu Vị was admitted in the Saint-Cyr military school and became a captain in the French army. He was the first Vietnamese aviator and fighter pilot.  I have written in a [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ot13h5/question_travel_from_africa_to_france_in_the_1880s/h9nuv6z/) of the situation of North/Subsaharan African students in France in the 19th century, and it fits this general pattern, with the additional twist that in some cases the students were also virtual "hostages" (at least in the mid to late 1800s).  So there was indeed an ongoing debate in colonial circles about the pros and cons of education, and particularly of higher education in France. In 1930, the demonstrations of Vietnamese left-wing activists in Paris resulted in the governement trying to stem the flow of *indigène* students and to control more tightly those already in France. This was partly successful, but to some extent too late, as anticolonialist ideas had already taken root.    In any case, most of those students did not turn into fiery revolutionaries. Some did, but many went to work for France, including in the colonial administration. The careers of Léopold Sédar Senghor and Amadou Lamine-Guèye in Sénégal, or of Nguyễn Văn Huyên in Vietnam, for instance, show how one could become part of the colonial apparatus, be critical of colonialism, and later play a major role in the newly independent governments.

nz52j	>  My book discusses the differences and similarities in how white Americans and Europeans saw the West and Indigenous cultures, and the fan communities that they built around Western stories, particularly those of best-selling German author Karl May and Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I too grew up in Europe reading these books, as well as their Dutch knock-off equivalents. But by the 80s, the impression I got was that Dutch children in my age group got most of their perception and understanding of the "wild west" from the (French) Lucky Luke comic books, which were incredibly popular. I was seen as a bit odd for reading the old-fashioned Laura and Old Shatterhand novels.  So my first question is: Did you study the influence of these comics on European perceptions in the post WW2 era? (I have no idea if these comics were popular in the US.) Or did these come too late to be covered by your research?  > My book discusses the differences and similarities in how white Americans and Europeans saw the West and Indigenous cultures  My second question is if you could elaborate a bit on these differences and similarities. My personal recollection is that as a child I read these books vaguely rooting for the Amerian Indian characters, which were often depicted in a kind of "noble savage" cliché way and seemed to be the underdogs. but I have no idea if that was a typical reaction, and if that was the same in Europe and the US or not.	1642953669.0	htw4ww0	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw4ww0/

bkb37	Thanks for joining us, Dr. Reagin!  Since you offered it up as a potential topic, I'd love to hear about how Indigenous people have  responded to US and German reenactment and fetishization of their culture, and if indeed their interaction might not be best described by a more active word than "reacted".  I also wondered, as someone interested in historical reenactment myself (and who wears a lot of vintage clothing), if you could shed any light on what the US and German reenactors have thought about reenactment philosophically and if that's evolved at all. In the WWII reenacting community, I've seen first-hand, there's a lot of talk of "respecting the guys" (yes, almost always "guys") who fought in the war, honoring their sacrifices and supposedly gaining a better historical understanding of their experience by experiencing similar physical hardship, when in fact there's always been an underlying element of wanting to go out and play soldier in some fun clothes in the woods with your friends for a weekend. (Not even going to touch on how worrying it is to hear things like that from the German reenactors.)  So what I wonder, then, is whether Western reenactors in the US and Germany make similar claims to authenticity? To they see their practice as a way of "doing history", of similar validity to actual historical analysis, the way WWII reenactors often do? What does "authenticity" look like to Western reenactors, and is attaining "authenticity", material or otherwise, supposed to generate an intimate understanding of the past in the same way WWII reenactors claim?	1642955006.0	htw895x	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw895x/

iovlhi6b	Thanks for that welcome!  I'm afraid that I haven't come across information about Western fans or reenactment in the Phillipines; my research has focused largely on these fandoms in Central Europe and the United States.  Civil War reenactment has become a global phenomenon, however, and it would not at all surprise me if there were groups in your country who pursue this hobby.  I'd recommend Stephen Gapp's work if you're interested in that topic.  He's an Australian historian and active reenactor who looks at the history of military historical reenactment in his nation and globally.  He notes that reenactment focused around another nation's history (and the US Civil War is a popular example) can seem less politically problematic to potential reenactment hobbyists, since it doesn't touch on politically controversial events or issues in the hobbyists's own national history.  That might be part of the explanation for the shift to Civil War reenactment among some German hobbyists, who were previously Western reenactors.  But I think that a stronger reason is that after 1990, the increasing presence and voices of Indigenous North Americans in Germany changed how East German hobbyists engaged with their hobbies.  Earlier generations of fans who reenacted both cowboy and Native American roles had often seen their recreations of Indigenous cultures as helping to preserve what most German Western fans saw as "dying" cultures.  Karl May, one of the most popular German authors of Westerns who had a huge fan following, introduced Indigenous cultures in his earliest works as "vanishing" peoples, who were being brutally eradicated by white American settlers.  But by the late 20th century, the increasing presence of Indigenous North Americans in reunified Germany made it clear that this was not the case, and that the recreation of Indigenous material culture would often be seen as inappropriate, and as cultural appropriation.  After 2000, many German Western reenactors drew back from the public sphere, or sometimes redefined their hobbies.  Some German Western reenactors have gravitated toward recreation of the American Civil War in recent decades. Civil War roleplay can serve the interpretive functions that many German reenactors now find most compelling.  Germans hobbyists from former East Germany  often take the role of Confederates in these reenactments, since Southerners (from their point of view) represent values that resonate with them.  One such hobbyist explained his preference for Confederate roles by saying that in East Germany before the fall of the Wall, he and his friends had been "rebels" against the East German state, and that "the Southerners were rebels."  Another person who grew up in East Germany's Western hobbyist fandom pointed out to me that a key part of their attraction to the fandom had been Western films, which inspired some fans to join reenactment groups.  In those films, he noted, the enemies of Native characters always wore Union uniforms; people who identified with Indigenous North Americans, he said, might gravitate to Confederate roles.  Of course, Southern white had violently displaced Indigenous cultures in the American Southeast well before the Civil War, but this never appeared in the films, he observed.   German hobbyists (like Civil War reenactors in other nations) can pick and choose from a menu of symbols, artifacts, and values associated with each side in the American Civil War and use them as vehicles to express their own regional and personal identities.	1642955313.0	htw90zc	t3_savz63	t1_htw168o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw90zc/

hr525	I've heard that Adolph Hitler was such a fan of Karl May's "Old Shatterhands" Westerns that he insisted people in his upper echelons should read (some of) them. Is that true, and what did others around him think of this insistence? Did Hitler make any known statements about how he felt this benefited or influenced any decisions in his government?

Also, do you have any favorite examples of Western style stories not explicitly set in the 19th century American west? Where the atmosphere and concepts are adopted but with a different setting.   3.

1liuwkln	Thanks for this; as a USian, I was surprised but also fascinated when I learned about the phenomenon you write about.  Now, I'm surprised to learn about the East German Civil War reenactors. I would have supposed that would have happened in a slightly earlier moment. Can you talk about the connections between race and the Cold War in the context of German western historical reenactment? And how did these differences play out different across East and West Germany? Did those differences manifest differently across decades (for example, cold war contestations about Jim Crow versus Apartheid)?	1642955688.0	htw9zrr	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htw9zrr/
iovlhi6b	Your cousins' responses were not unusual.  Representations of North American First Nations in German novels, films, and other entertainments were typically purely historical, and often romanticized and inaccurate.  The rise in the value of the German Mark compared to the dollar after 1980 and the end of travel restrictions on East Germans after Germany's reunification meant that many more ordinary Germans traveled to North America during the 1980s and 1990s, and were thus more exposed to modern Indigenous cultures.  Germans' perceptions of the Indigenous peoples they met challenged their earlier, historic or fictionalized stereotypes about these cultures, offering German tourists more modern images, including lifestyles that were not as different from their own as some might have hoped to see.  For more on this, I'd recommend H. Glenn Penny's *Kindred By Choice,* which has a lot of information about encounters between Germans and modern Indigenous North American people in recent decades.	1642955790.0	htwa96f	t3_savz63	t1_htw1sik	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwa96f/

Is it a fair assessment that L’Amour’s fandom has transcended generations—at least perhaps from the generation before Baby Boomers possibly to some of Gen X? Does he still have much of a fan base?

iovlhi6b	Good question, and I'd agree with your characterization of this as a "chicken and egg" question. Germans emigrated to many nations during the 19th century, but particularly to the U.S. and Canada, and these settlers became part of a transnational German culture.  They founded German-language presses, whose reports on Indigenous peoples were read in Germany. Some Germans, like author Rudolf Cronau,  visited the United States and met with Indigenous peoples, and then  embarked on lecture tours back home in Germany, or sold art depicting the West, or published successful novels and travel literature.  There was clearly an audience for these types of travel literature/lectures/art, Germans who had already read the novels of James Fenimore Cooper (whose *Leatherstocking Tales* were popular in Germany) along with readers of German authors of Westerns like Friedrich Gerstaecker and Balduin Moellhausen.   For more on the role of German settlers in a transnational German culture, I'd recommend H. Glenn Penny's *Kindred by Choice.*	1642956519.0	htwc4l3	t3_savz63	t1_htw1se0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwc4l3/

168sly	>" British South Africa vs Apartheid South Africa"  I will leave it to someone more knowledgeable to talk about Southeast Asia, but I feel like I need to speak up about southern Africa, because I think this is a false comparison.   If we're specifically talking about Apartheid South Africa, we're talking about a system of racial laws that were instituted after the 1948 South African elections, and dismantled in the late 1980s-early 1990s, more or less ending with the ANC victory in the 1994 election (although vast racial disparities continue to this day). I find it hard to specifically blame that on Dutch colonial rule given that the Dutch specifically only controlled a Cape colony (roughly similar in area to today's Western Cape), and that was occupied by the British in 1806, and formally ceded to Britain in 1814, almost a century and a half before 1948. The Dutch never controlled areas like KwaZulu-Natal, Transvaal or Free State.  Of course, those areas *were* conquered and settled by Afrikaner Voortrekkers in the 19th century. But there's two points here. It's inaccurate to call Afrikaners "Dutch" as if the two nationalities were synonymous. Afrikaans is a separate language from Dutch, not a regional dialect, and so while I personally can't speak to their mutual intelligibility between native speakers this is different even from, say, American English and British English, and even with that example it would be a little inaccurate if we were talking about Anglo American colonialism as synonymous with British Colonialism.   Another point of inaccuracy is that if we're talking about British South Africa as specifically South Africa as a British colony, versus Apartheid South Africa after 1948, it's not exactly different people. Meaning it's not like South Africa was run by Brits or English speakers prior to 1948 and Afrikaners after. It was mostly Afrikaners in both periods.   A specific example would be Jan Smuts. Smuts was born in Capetown, moved to Transvaal, and worked with the Transvaal government during the Second Boer War, eventually even commanding troops in the later stages of the war. After the war's end, the Union of South Africa was negotiated and initiated by 1910, which combined the then-four British colonies in South Africa into a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire, similar in ways to Canada, New Zealand or Australia. Louis Botha (a former Transvaal Prime Minister and Boer War general) became the first Prime Minister of the Union, but Smuts was part of his government, and would later be Prime Minister himself for huge chunks of the period before 1948. Which is to say, the British Empire Dominion was largely run by Afrikaners.  So what changed in 1948? Basically a paradigm-shifting election upset. Without getting too into the weeds, Smuts at the time was still Prime Minister, and in charge of the United Party. South Africa at this point had an almost completely whites-only electorate and quite a degree of segregation, but there were fears among segments of the white electorate that the United Party would give in to gradual changes to this. The National Party promised much stricter segregation, and won a legislative majority with a minority of the vote (much less than votes for the United Party), mostly by winning rural electoral districts. I leave it to the reader to draw any comparisons there to other countries and their elections. The National Party would go on to win every South African election until 1994, and to construct (and eventually dismantle) the legal framework for Apartheid.   Even a comparison between British *Southern* Africa (so not South Africa Proper) and Apartheid South Africa is probably not really useful. For most of the British possessions in Southern Africa had extremely tiny resident white populations, and the one exception - Southern Rhodesia - had a system of white rule that was similar to South Africa's. You could argue that Rhodesia was in many ways worse, as the white population was smaller - something like 5% of the total population at most, compared to white South Africans making up about 20% of the population in 1910 and 10% in 1990, and was very violent in its initial conquest of the territory and in the maintenance of control from 1965 to 1980.  So - I don't think we can really discuss Apartheid South Africa when comparing how the Dutch colonial and British colonial empires were run. Dutch colonial rule was restricted to the Cape Colony (a possession of the Dutch East India Company) from the 1650s to the early 19th century, and many of its particulars of that period (warfare against indigenous people, use of slave labor and an expanding settlement of white "free citizens") honestly wasn't qualitatively different from British colonies of the 17th and 18th centuries.	1642956715.0	htwcn48	t3_sakj6q	t3_sakj6q	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sakj6q/why_were_the_dutch_such_brutal_colonialists/htwcn48/
aqxu6	Thank you for this AMA!  Since you mention the post-reunification transition of German Western reenactors toward American Civil War reenactment, I'm very interested in your thoughts on [a disturbing and incendiary claim](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/06/confederates-on-the-rhine/239724) that Professor Wolfgang Hochbruck made about the motivations of some German reenactors who preferred to reenact the Confederate Army:  > Wolfgang Hochbruck, a Professor of American Studies at the University of Freiburg and a Union reenactor, is less charitable. "I think some of the Confederate reenactors in Germany are acting out Nazi fantasies of racial superiority," he told author Tony Horwitz. "They are obsessed with your war because they cannot celebrate their own vanquished racists." It's an unsettling thought.  Could you respond to Professor Hochbruck's claim? Do "fantasies of racial superiority" and a suppressed desire to celebrate Nazi achievements motivate a significant part of the German Confederate reenactor community? Or is the motivation to be found elsewhere? Are there any points of connection between German Confederate reenactment and far-right politics?

dmjyd	I've heard before that a lot of (white?) American stereotypes about Native people can be traced back to Tacitus' book "Germanica" and ideas he had about Germanic peoples. Do German reenactors themselves see or draw similarities between the Indigenous-colonizer dynamic and the German-Roman dynamic?	1642956968.0	htwdb5r	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwdb5r/
i8393	Dud rates between German and Allied bombs seem to have been roughly comparable. British bomb surveys indicate a roughly 10% rate of failure for German bombs over the country. Modern estimates, meanwhile, suggest that somewhere between 10-20% of Allied bombs dropped on Germany were duds. This similarity suggests that a disparity in the dud rates between Allied and German bombs can't explain why there are more stories about Allied duds in Germany than the opposite. To explain this, we have to look elsewhere.  The simplest answer is that many more bombs were dropped on Germany than on Britain. The Allied strategic bomber offensive in Europe dropped something in the region of 2.5 million tons of bombs. Of these, about 1.5 million were targeted on Germany. In return, the Germans dropped around 70,000 tons on the UK. Taking a dud rate of 10%, then we would expect to see 250,000 tons of dud bombs in Germany, and 7,000 in the UK. This means that (assuming a constant size of bomb) for every hundred dud bombs in Germany, we would expect to see just three in the UK.   Another factor is that the Allies dropped heavier bombs on Germany. The heaviest bombs dropped by the Germans, excluding the V1s and V2s, were the 2000lb (1000 kg) parachute mines. Most of the bombs dropped on the UK were 500kg or smaller. In comparison, the RAF routinely dropped 4000lb 'blockbuster' bombs, and deployed larger 8000lb and 12,000lb weapons. A larger UXB is more likely to make it into international news. It will require the evacuation of a larger area for safety, and, if a controlled demolition is needed, it will be more spectacular. A small bomb is much less likely to make a splash in the international news - [this 50kg bomb, found in the Thames in 2017](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-38682872) only made it into the local BBC news. A 2000lb bomb located in Exeter in 2021 [made it into international outlets](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/unexploded-bomb-wwii-was-safely-detonated-england-180977146/).  We must also consider the fuses of the bombs. Allied bombs mostly used mechanical fuses, while German bombs largely used electrical fuses. The electrical fuses used on German bombs become largely inert once the battery powering them runs down. The same is not the case for mechanical fuses. The clockwork inside can only be rendered inert by corrosion jamming the mechanism. It is largely impossible to know whether or not a mechanical fuse is jammed from the outside. This means that the British bomb disposal teams can be more confident when dealing with unexploded bombs (UXB); they can take less-newsworthy methods like removing the bomb to a safe location for a controlled detonation. German teams, meanwhile, have to take more risks. Blowing up the bomb in situ is much more likely the safest option. This, in turn, means newsworthy evacuations and explosions. There is also much greater risk when making preparations for dealing with the bomb, so German UXB disposal teams (and those civilians who locate UXB) are more likely to take casualties.   Finally, the British were more able to take steps to detect and remove UXB during the war and the immediate aftermath. From September 1940, the British set up a highly detailed system of bomb censuses. These aimed to count every bomb dropped on the UK. Bombs that didn't detonate would be counted by these censuses, and could be dealt with by bomb disposal teams. Germany, meanwhile, had less resilience in their systems for dealing with UXB. The heavy Allied raids often did serious damage to local administration, making it harder to detect UXB when they were dropped. The disruption caused by bombing made it harder for bomb disposal teams to reach the UXBs that were detected.	1642957097.0	htwdn85	t3_sar5v5	t3_sar5v5	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sar5v5/i_often_hear_about_the_discovery_of_unexploded/htwdn85/
hhxrz	There are so many factors involved in determining the distance a horse can travel in a day.   The horse's breeding is a huge factor in how far and fast it is able to travel,  heavy draft animals are slower but steady while thoroughbreds are faster but wear out quickly.  Cross breeds are all over the.map in their endurance capabilities.  Age and physical condition of the animal are important factors as are the quality of feed available and amount of drinking water along the route.  You must also consider the length of the trip and number of days you will be travelling and the terrain as hills and water crossings will slow you down.   An average horse can walk at 4 miles an hour.  With prodding you can bump this to around 6 miles per hour.  It can trot at speeds ranging between 10 and 15 miles per hour for an hour or so at a time.   So in ideal conditions with water stops along the road a horse in Prime condition  can walk about 40 to 50 miles in a ten hour day.   If it is in top condition and has lots of high protein feed it should be able to maintain its weight and health.   If the feed quality is lacking it will soon start losing weight and won't be able to  maintain this pace.  An average horse in good condition should be able to cover between 30 and 35 miles in a ten hour day on a good road.   If the trail has rivers and hills to cross the distance it can cover in a day begins to drop.   A hard days ride would include a mix of  trotting and walking.   Pushing it horse this way it would be possible to cover 60 to 70 miles over a ten hour day.   While horses can run at speeds over 30 miles per hour, forcing a horse into a gallop would be counter productive.   Most horses are unable to travel at a run for more than two miles and would quickly play out.   The Apaches were renown for their abilities to cover vast distances on horseback.   It was not uncommon for them to travel  over a hundred miles in a day or even twenty miles further.   But these horses would be worn out at the end of the day and many died during or at the end of these runs.  You could extend your range and help maintain your horses health by bringing another horse along.  Switching back and forth between them gives your mount a bit of a break which would keep them in better condition over a long trip.   Bringing a packhorse along greatly reduces the distance you can travel in a day if you care about your animals.   A rider if fluid moves with the horse as it walks while a pack is dead weight that hangs off each side.   Pushing a pack horse to a fast walk will cause it to get saddle sores.  The rubbing action of the saddle and pack against the horses side will rub through the hair and creates blisters.   Most pack trains seldom travelled more than 18 miles in a day while 12 to 15 miles was the norm.	1642957486.0	htwenf2	t3_saj82j	t3_saj82j	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saj82j/old_west_1800s_what_did_it_mean_when_some_one/htwenf2/
gde6c	Thanks so much for coming by!  Two questions:  1. Every modern fandom has those members who complain when their media becomes too "corporate" or when creators try to "pander" to the "mainstream." Is this something that happened in early pulp and Western fandoms? Were long-time fans contemptuous of the Rathbone and Bruce *Holmes* films, or did Western fans bemoan the Disney-fication of the genre after the success of *Davy Crockett*?  2. This might be a bit out of field, but, speaking of Disney, it's common for theme parks to have a Western themed area. Most every park from the 1955 opening of Disneyland through the '70s seems to have one, with already established parks like Cedar Point adding their own during the two decades. Is there any connection between these parks and earlier traveling Western shows, reenactment groups, or living history museums? Does this type of entertainment attraction, in which visitors enter a comic book version of a frontier town, predate the '50s?	1642957536.0	htwerx9	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwerx9/

9i89m	The Continental Congress was the only national government of the United States, but legislative bodies have problems doing executive functions. The Secret Committee and the Committee of Secret Correspondence were created almost at the outset of the conflict to look for funds and supplies , communicate with France, Spain, and the Netherlands to do so.  After muddling along for several years, in 1781 the Congress delegates- even those very much worried about states' rights- generally realized there had to be something stronger for a national executive, because there was too great a need to sort out the war finances and debts, and engage in real diplomacy. So, Morris was made Superintendant of Finance to do the first, Robert Livingston Secretary of Foreign Affairs, and General Benjamin Lincoln Secretary *at(* ( not of) War. All three came in pretty much after the Battle of Yorktown, so while Morris put forward his financial plan, Lincoln mostly worked on clerical matters , quartering and feeding the army, and Livingston mostly tried to deal with the French.  But even though Morris clearly foresaw that he was likely to be hindered and second-guessed by Congress when he demanded broad powers to do what he wanted, he still needed it to approve his national financial scheme, and in the end it wouldn't. Livingston would likewise discover that though he could talk to foreign diplomats, he wasn't given the authority to actually ask for or agree to anything.	1642957894.0	htwfp42	t3_s9puly	t1_htt3s9d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9puly/how_much_power_did_robert_morris_have_over_the_us/htwfp42/

iovlhi6b	Great questions!  German Western reenactors before 1939 commonly developed roles play around both white cowboy and Native roles or *personas;* the first generations of Western reenactors were often inspired by, and were fans of the novels of Karl May.  In West Germany, they continued to do so after 1945.  Indeed, in West Germany reenactors diversified their white roles, developing reenactment as fur trappers, mountain men, etc.  In East Germany after 1948, the fundamental problem with both May's novels and Western role reenactment was they were set in the United States, which was the opponent of the Soviet Union.  Karl May's stories were set in a time and place that East German authorities took a dim view of; stories that celebrated American characters and settings were thus very politically sticky in East Germany.  East German authorities did not allow May's novels to be republished in East Germany until the 1980s, and they could not be imported.  Thousands of East Germans did own copies already, however, and passed them from person to person.  And the Western reenacters applied for permission to refound their clubs and continue their hobbies.  When they first applied, East German reenactors ran into some resistance from authorities, who were taken aback by role play set in the United States.  Authorities suggested to reenactors who lived near Dresden that they might do better to study and recreate the lifestyles of Indigenous peoples in Siberia, who (under the leadership of Stalin) were allegedly marching towards a better future. But East German hobbyists persisted in their focus on the American West, and ultimately got permission to resume their hobby, as a sort of ethnological research on North American Indigenous cultures.    Cowboy role play did not fit well into this rationale, and in order to avoid pressure from the secret police, East German hobbyists gradually dropped the white Western roles, and focused only on the reenactment of Indigenous cultures and roles.  Some older members persisted in performing cowboy roles in private; "after it got dark," some recalled later, "we would take off the feather headdresses and put on the cowboy hats."  But the East German secret police confiscated their revolvers (seen as important for any cowboy role play) and raided their clubs.  Gradually, East German hobbyists dropped the cowboy role play, and became widely accepted by East German authorities, when they gave public performances or demonstrations in their Indigenous roles. As far as I was able to determine, these East German reenactors came from all walks of life in East Germany; involvement in clubs was seen by many of them as an escape daily life in East Germany.	1642958510.0	htwhcb7	t3_savz63	t1_htw1b8u	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwhcb7/

m2af3	The book doesn't seem to be entirely pseudoscience; but there's certainly some of it. The author specializes in "Historical Afrocentrism" and while this isn't always a bad idea, he's obviously not a trained historian or archeologist because there are various facts and dates which are quickly mentioned without any skepticism or parsing of the details (which trained historians and archeologists love to do).   Not every fact in the book is distorted, but there are many issues - notably, the book attempts to flip the Euro-American historical narrative by re-writing African history from an Afrocentrist perspective. Yet in doing so, it begins most of the first 50+ pages with only brief mentions of the paleolithic and neolithic periods and quickly moves on to dense chapters on detailed Egyptian and Nubian history. Asante's attempt to invert the popular narrative ironically perpetuates it, beginning African history with Egyptian history has become the tradition of Euro-American antiquarians since the late 19th century.   The most glaring pseudoscience is found in the first 3 pages of the introduction where he talks about the "Mpumalanga megaliths" in southern Africa, which he says are the oldest in the world being at least 75kyo and up to 200kyo. He assumes that all of the "megaliths" in the region are all from the same or a similar ancient culture, when in reality there are many different cultural groups associated with monuments in the area made ca. 500-1800's CE. "Adam's Calendar" is actually called the Blaauboschkraal ruins. This the term for a series of settlements built by the Koni people on the Mpumalanga escarpment from the 1500's or early 1600's til the 1830's. Below the escarpment are early medieval settlements of other farming societies from the 500's CE onward.   - [Blaauboschkraal stone ruins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaauboschkraal_stone_ruins)  - [The Bokoni Story Unearthed, Mail & Guardian](https://mg.co.za/article/2015-02-26-the-bokoni-story-unearthed/)  - [Prehistory of the Nelspruit Area, South African History Online](https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/prehistory-nelspruit-area)  M. K. Asante disparagingly cites Michael Tellinger, a pseudoscientific populizer of the site, because Tellinger suggests these were built via aliens. But ironically, he uses Tellinger's fantastical dates while rejecting the rest of his work! Instead, I'd suggest these sources for the area and time period:  - [The Lost African Metropolis Of Mapungubwe: Secrets Of The Sacred Hill, Timeline Documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szcuw-I2-WI)  - The Golden Rhinoceros: Histories of the African Middle Ages, by Francois-Xavier Fauvelle           - An African Classical Age: Eastern and Southern Africa in World History 1000 BC to AD 400, Christpher Ehret          - Bantu Africa: 3500 BE to Present, Fourshey & Gonzales                                 - The Archaeology and Ethnography of Central Africa, James Denbow    - African Dominion: A New History of Empire in Early and Medieval West Africa, Michael Gomez                                    - A Fistful of Shells: West Africa from the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution, Toby Green                                            ​  Being a historian requires a lot of reading, examining, and *thinking* about historical sources. This leads to skepticism, particularly about ancient historians and their obsession with citing outrageous troop numbers for famous battles and detailing elaborate histories of wide-ranging migrations for then-present populations. Historians should push back against these presumptions, so it is shocking that M. K. Asante uncritically cites Herodotus (pg. 12) to say that the *"...Phoenicians, who were also probably black according to their land of origin...[they] appeared in the 16th century BCE in the land that is today called Somalia."* This is absurd, the Phoenicians are the iron age descendants of bronze age Canaanites in the Levant (basically what is now Lebanon), not "appearing" in the 1500's BCE nor coming from Somalia and regardless that wouldn't make them "black" either.   No trained historian would make such a ridiculous assertion, nor should anyone uncritically accept Herodotus' account of migrations (which he says he got from Persian historians, so he's hearing it second-hand). Actually, in the opening of his *Histories*, he says they migrated from the *Erythraean Sea*. This was a vague term which referred to anywhere from the southern half of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and to the northwestern Indian Ocean - a huge area covering the Horn of Africa, the southern and eastern coasts of Arabia, and even coastal Pakistan and Gujarat. Not simply *from Somalia*, it is obvious Asante omits these details for the sake of Afrocentrism.	1642959209.0	htwj5i8	t3_s4hi4s	t3_s4hi4s	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4hi4s/is_thr_book_the_history_of_africa_by_molefi_ketr/htwj5i8/
m2af3	M. K. Asante talks a bit about African rock art and this is wonderful, as you can probably tell I'm *very* into the subject and always am glad to see it mentioned since it is so commonly left out of history and art history books. And yet, Asante doesn't go into much detail, and on pg. 17 says that rock art tells us about *"...people who believed in communication and had some idea about how to record their thoughts, ideas, and activities."* Rock art as a method of communication and a record of ideas isn't necessarily a wrong-headed conception but I think it's overly simplistic. Rock art is the history of religion and mythology, it is a record of sacred landscapes, and the re-use of sites over thousands of years speaks to understanding large-scale cultural change. Rock art is sometimes very detailed, for whatever reason (perhaps narrative reasons?), and at other times rock art is very "unornamented" - painted with fingers and symbols being only simple geometrics. And yet these are the most fascinating, as the most abstract are the most metaphorical - sometimes a line may represent an entire concept.   Sure, Asante is correct in his overview, but he obsesses over its range and the number of sites and then moves on. Instead, I'd suggest these sources for details on African rock art:  - Rock Art in Africa, Jean-Loic Le Quellec  - Round Heads: The Earliest Rock Paintings in the Sahara, Jitka Soukopova  - The People of Iheren and Tahilahi, Hallier & Hallier   - Rock Art in Southern Africa, Anne Solomon  - The Rock Art of /Ui-//aes (Twyfelfontein), John Kinahan  - [The African Rock Art Digital Archive](http://www.sarada.co.za/#/library/)  - [Round Head Catalogue: The Earliest Rock Art of the Sahara](https://roundheadsahara.com/)  - [Trust for African Rock Art](https://africanrockart.org/)   Asante mentions Nabta Playa, as one must when talking about ancient African achievements. This is a neolithic pastoralist astronomical stone circle and field of monuments built ca. 7-5kya in the western desert of Egypt/Sudan. This is generally contemporary with the Badarian and Naqadian periods in nearby Upper Egypt. Yet Asante cites Bauval and Brophy's *Black Genesis* (2011) to say the site is 12-14kyo, adding people found ceramics at Nabta Playa "which seem to be among the oldest ever found." He even says Bauval and Brophy "wrote eloquently" about the site (pg. 18).   Yes there are early ceramics in the Nabta Playa region, but there are also just as early if not earlier ceramics at Ounjougou in Nigeria; suggesting that ceramics spread across the Sahara generally in the early Holocene period from these two centers - The Nile and the Lakes Region of West Africa. This early Holocene spread is around the same time they became prevalent in the Near East (ca. 8000 BCE). This larger narrative, the semi-contemporaneous regional spread of ceramics, as far as I've noted isn't mentioned in his work. He mentions Nabtan ceramics as more evidence of early African technological innovation, and this is true; but he's leaving out other important information in my view - Such as that the Diepkloof shelter in southern Africa has eggshell sherds (ostrich eggshell containers) from 45-130kya. And at around 60kya they begin to be decorated. Asante is right, materials innovation is fascinating; but I find it much more fascinating that these innovators were at the tail end of a long line of Southern African foragers who had container storage - some 100k+ years before anyone in Africa had ceramics.   [Thomas G. Brophy](https://www.cihs.edu/team/thomas-g.-brophy%2C-ph.d.) seems to have a foot in both worlds, one foot in science and another (perhaps deeper) in pseudoscience. It's not often that one laughs when reading academic papers, but Malville et al. (2007) got me when they dryly cited Brophy's theories about Nabta Playa's *true* age and *esoteric* meaning...  > Brophy has also suggested that the table rock of Complex Structure A is a map of the Milky Way galaxy dating from 17500 BC...[it] represents maps of the stars of Orion as early as 16500 BC. These extremely early dates as well as the proposition that the nomads had contact with extra-galactic aliens are inconsistent with the archeological record.  > - Astronomy of Nabta Playa, J. Malville et al. (2007) http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~libell/1nabta_africa.html  Besides Malville's paper, here's a few other sources on Nabta Playa.  - [Late Neolithic Megalithic Structures at Nabta Playa (Sahara), Southwestern Egypt, Wendorf & Schild](https://web.archive.org/web/20110806140123/http:/www.comp-archaeology.org/WendorfSAA98.html)  - [Tracing the Origins of the Ancient Egyptian Cattle Cult, Michael Brass](https://web.archive.org/web/20060831041649/http://antiquityofman.com/brass_EEF2002.pdf)  Brophy isn't a reliable source of information on African prehistory. As Carl Feagans notes, another pseudoscientist Mark H. Gaffney summarizes Brophy's *The Origin Map* (2002) in saying that Nabta Playa stone positionings "represent on-the-ground analogs of star positions from up to 19[kya]." This is a little strange, since Feagans also notes that Brophy and Rosen's *Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry* (2005) says something else - that these megaliths were constructed "more than 8[kya]." This is a radical difference, and ca. 8kya is a reasonable range for megaliths in the earliest period of pastoralist occupation. Why would Brophy change his opinions one year to the next, change his dates from one publication audience to another publication audience? It is suspicious of an academic, to say the least.  - [Forbidden Archaeology? Pseudo-archaeology and the Exaggeration of the Antiquity of Man, Carl Feagans](https://ahotcupofjoe.net/2018/07/forbidden-archaeology-pseudo-archaeology-and-the-exaggeration-of-the-antiquity-of-man-2/)	1642959254.0	htwj9qn	t3_s4hi4s	t1_htwj5i8	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s4hi4s/is_thr_book_the_history_of_africa_by_molefi_ketr/htwj9qn/
m2af3	Perhaps M. K. Asante's most shocking statement (besides that the Phoenicians are black), is his comment about Berber/Amazigh people on page 20.   > Prior to 2000 BCE, all of the people of northern Africa were black in color. Furthermore, before the seventh century CE, North Africa was peopled mainly by black people and people who migrated from Europe in the ninth century BCE. There were no large populations of Arabs in North Africa before the rise of Islam and the religious movement that gave rise to the fervor for making converts of other people. Actually, the Amazigh (so-called Berber) people have been in Africa much longer than the Arabs, but certainly not as long as the indigenous Africans.  This is a strange passage. He's referring to the late neolithic desiccation of the Sahara - the end of the Green Sahara period ca. 5-4kya (til 2000 BCE). During this time, pastoralists who'd lived in the central Sahara migrated in all directions though mostly south and west. For a while the Sahara was largely unpeopled, until the iron age domestication of the camel (ca. 3-2.5kya, early to mid 1st millennium BCE). This allowed people, mostly Berber speaking northern Saharans, to fully populate the central Sahara again. This was the beginning of those famous cross-Saharan trade networks. The modern descendants of the Saharan migrations are the Fulani people across western and central Africa.   Asante is suggesting that these Fulani ancestors were "black", and "non-black" i.e. Berber and Arab speaking peoples only entered the Sahara with the spread of Islamic traders. And so, in his terminology, "indigenous Africans" are black and have the longest connection to the land whereas lighter toned Berber speakers don't have as much. This is an absurd conclusion, not only is his distinction between black-indigenous vs. non-black/not-as-indigenous; but suggesting that Berber speakers and Maghrebi's aren't *as African* as Sub-Saharans. Maghrebi's helped populate the central Sahara when the Green Sahara period started in the early Holocene, and the Proto-Afro-Asiatic language ancestor to the Berber languages arose ca. the early Holocene in northeast Africa. East Africans and north Africans have a wider range of skin tones than west and central Africans - this has no correlation to their indigeneity or Africanity; in these passages Asante's "Afrocentrism" takes on racial undertones that is decidedly unacademic.   In the end M. K. Asante's book isn't terrible, his sections on ancient Egyptian and Nubian history seem okay as do his sections on western and central African history from the medieval period onward. The latter half of the book is about modern African issues which I didn't analyze. But there are some problems and flaws with the book, such as his inclusion of pseudo-scientists.

iovlhi6b	The short answer is that Buffalo Bill's touring show, and similar entertainments, were extremely popular across Europe.  These entertainments could capitalize on the fact that Western novels (both pulp fiction and more "serious" Western authors) had been popular for decades.  James Fenimore Cooper's *Leatherstocking Tales* were widely read in 19th century Germany, for example, and there were successful German Western authors who fed Germans' appetite for Western tales with best-selling fiction and non-fiction.  Germans were also familiar with the American West because there were often letters, newspaper reports, or travel literature from the German settlers who had emigrated to the American West, or from Germans who had visited there.  William Cody's Wild West show toured Europe from Wales to Ukraine, attracting hundreds of thousands of European visitors.  For more on Buffalo Bill in Europe, I'd recommend Louis Warren's *Buffalo Bill's America,* Robert Rydell and Rob Kroes, *Buffalo Bill in Bologna*, and Julia Stetler, *Buffalo Bill's Wild West in Germany.*  For a discussion of the experience of Indigenous performers in these shows, and how they saw Western entertainments, I'd recommend George Moses' *Wild West Shows*.  These shows, along with exposure to the novels of Karl May and other Western authors, were often cited by German Western fans as key moments that drew them into the fandom.	1642959455.0	htwjsja	t3_savz63	t1_htw23de	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwjsja/

u8x4k	I guess a lot is being talked about to impact of Karl May’s work.  1. why do you think is there a strong focus on the America setting („durchs Wilde Kurdistan“ for example is set in the near east, etc) 2. is there any relationship between post-war interest in the western setting and denazification?

5wkhi4e5	Hello Dr Reagin! I would be interested to hear your thoughts on how/if European notions of North American First Nation Indigeneity have influenced ideas about European Indigeneity, especially as seen in music groups like Wadruna or Heilung that utilize a shamanistic aesthetic that appears (to a Canadian like me) to be appropriating First Nations culture/traditions to reenact imagined Norse/Germanic traditions.	1642961368.0	htwotgn	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwotgn/
iovlhi6b	Thanks for this--these are two interesting entry points into the discussion.  You're right that "reacting" doesn't capture the active and very diverse responses of Indigenous visitors to Germany, when they are exposed to German hobbyists' creations.  Their responses varied enormously, and changed over time.  Before 1939, some German Western clubs had long cultivated ties and exchanges of materials for handicrafts (e.g., feathers and beads) with particular Indigenous communities in the United States, usually Lakota communities.  After the division of Germany in 1948 and particularly after 1970, East German hobbyists and Western fans developed regular exchanges with Indigenous activists in the United States, offering them support in their struggle against the U.S. government for more autonomy and rights.  Some did fundraising for the American Indian Movement, and AIM leaders visited East Germany and met with some hobbyists.  But after German reunification, contacts between Indigenous North Americans and hobbyists (and ordinary Germans) became more frequent, and the responses of the visitors changed and varied, captured in the many interviews with Indigenous people who visited Germany reprinted in *Indianthusiasm: Indigenous Responses*, edited by Helmut Lutz and Renae Watchman.  Some Indigenous visitors to Germany said that they had positive experiences and were treated with respect by German hobbyists, who hoped to deepen their understanding of Indigenous cultures.  Other visitors found the reenactment of their cultures inappropriate and unwelcome, and said so; they often objected to hobbyists' focus on historic lifestyles and material culture, which they perceived as erasing their modern Indigenous identities. Many were bemused or critical of the way that the Plains Indigenous cultures remained the gold standard for Germans' perception of Indigeneity.  One visiting Anishinaabe writer from Curve Lake First Nation, Drew Harden Taylor, commented that "They're \[the Germans\] obsessive about Plains Indians.  Tipis! You never see a longhouse; you never see a wigwam, it has to be Plains, and of Lakota if at all possible. You know, I think that the Lakota had a better publicist or something."  These responses might be one reason that German hobbyists increasingly withdrew from the public sphere after 2000, and many switched to other types of historical reenactment.  To answer your second question, yes, Western reenactors in Germany and the United States pursue "authenticity" in the ways that you describe for your groups.  They do see it as a way of "doing" history, and many went to enormous lengths to ensure painstaking accuracy in their reproductions of historical costumes and artifacts.  Stephen Gapps (a historian who is also active in military historical reenactment) has published some very perceptive work on what authenticity means to reenactors, commenting that it "is a key term in our symbolic vocabulary and often thought of as being part of our 'special responsibility.'  . . . if historians do two things---compose elegant paragraphs and pursue erudition---reenactors craft a theater of history through authentic props and costumes."	1642961590.0	htwpefb	t3_savz63	t1_htw895x	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwpefb/

2m8yl53s	There are various suggestions - St. Elmo's fire, smoke, some kind of strange weather maybe. But it was regarded as a sign of impending doom by Greek and Latin Christian sources (who were all writing in hindsight, even if it was only a couple of days after the city fell), and the Ottoman sources don't mention it at all. So it might be more of a supernatural event than an historical one, and therefore not really within our jurisdiction!  I wrote a little bit about it in the past: [“Light” on the dome of the Hagia Sophia in 1453?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/eujtfa/light_on_the_dome_of_the_hagia_sophia_in_1453/ffrbvya/)	1642962532.0	htwrvtc	t3_sayrbi	t3_sayrbi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sayrbi/just_before_the_fall_of_constantinople_in_1453/htwrvtc/
7helxsbg	So, one of the most common images of the mythical wild west is the lone gunslinger wandering around the west. But I noticed, growing up on franco-belgian western comics, that this figure was commonly either used for comedy (Lucky Luke) or not used as the focus at all (Les Tuniques Bleues, Buddy Longway.) But at the same time, they are obviously rather central to spaghetti westerns. So I was wondering, have you noticed any big national differences between the US, Germany and perhaps some other countries, in how central the lone gunslinger figure was to their conception of the west and how he was depicted? And has this changed over time?	1642962654.0	htws71o	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htws71o/

iovlhi6b	>My personal recollection is that as a child I read these books vaguely rooting for the Amerian Indian characters, which were often depicted in a kind of "noble savage" cliché way and seemed to be the underdogs.   You had a lot of company among Germans who read Westerns written by German authors like Karl May, Lieselotte Welskopf-Henrich, and others (and fans of the films based on their novels).  May and some other authors offered romanticized and often very inaccurate portrayals of Indigenous characters, but they were usually rooting for them.  German fans of the West generally differed from their American counterparts in their critical response to white settlers and the treatment of Indigenous peoples by the U.S. government.    I'm afraid I can't comment too much on the comics.  I do know that simplified versions of May's stories (and other Western authors) were used as the basis for best-selling comic books in both West and East Germany, and I think that you're correct that their audience was probably younger than the novel readers were.	1642962816.0	htwsmfs	t3_savz63	t1_htw4ww0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwsmfs/

iwanf	From a pure Jewish law perspective insulin isn't really a question.  Jewish dietary law prohibits eating pigs, but not other ways of benefitting from pigs^(1,2).  This is unlike, say, forbidden mixtures of milk and meat, which are not only forbidden foods but are also forbidden to eat.  Even if insulin were "eaten", people who need insulin are at serious risk of developing dangerous health conditions if they don't take it, and one is allowed to eat forbidden foods if one will otherwise be in danger^(3).  This is without getting into the gelatin debate about whether heavily modified derivatives of non-kosher animals lose their status as being from the original animal--even if it were universally agreed that gelatin is totally not kosher^(4), insulin would be fairly clearly permitted.  As a historical question, though, one could ask whether this raised questions of Jewish law that were posed to Rabbis.  The issue here is that unless something is truly earth-shattering, most questions are asked and answered orally.  Because there's very little novel in the question of insulin, it's not the sort of question which would necessarily be put into writing.  "Can I take this medication without while I will be in serious danger" is an important question, but not one that requires the sort of complex answer that requires being put into writing.  There's already discussion in Jewish law from much earlier periods about medicinal forbidden foods, so insulin really breaks no new ground.  I am personally unaware of any written evidence of the question even being asked about insulin, and cannot find any in a cursory search.  It probably was asked to Rabbis, but the answers not put in writing.  I suspect it would have been asked is that Jews often have an aversion to pork products that goes beyond the technical limits of Jewish law^(5).  Generally the sorts of questions for which there's written evidence is when one Rabbi asks a difficult question to another Rabbi who is "up the chain" and is a widely respected authority, but this isn't the sort of question that requires one Rabbi send a question to another Rabbi.  1. There are Rabbinic restrictions on pigs in other ways--there's a general prohibition on making a living by selling forbidden foods, but for pigs there isn't a prohibition on non-eating benefit, which is not really a relevant concern here. * See, for example, Teshuvot Achiezer 3:61 by R Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, which permits ingesting forbidden foods via a feeding tube because that isn't really "eating".  The person who asked the question thought it ought to be forbidden, but R Chaim Ozer disagreed, and I believe R Chaim Ozer's position is the consensus here.  Certainly an injection is far less eating-like than a feeding tube, and *a fortiori* should be permitted. * For example, *Peninei Halakha, Zemanim 7:5*, which rules that diabetics can eat on Yom Kippur to manage their insulin levels--eating on Yom Kippur is a much more serious issue than eating non-kosher food, generally speaking.  Or *Contemporary Halakhic Problems* Vol 6 Chapter 6 by R J David Bleich, discussing a diabetic person testing their glucose levels on Shabbat, which is also (potentially) a more serious issue than eating pork * Which is the consensus position in the US nowadays * See [here](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/599037), for example	1642963330.0	htwtxlz	t3_sautz9	t3_sautz9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htwtxlz/

iovlhi6b	>So, my question is: when a work of fiction gains a fandom in a new area or culture that may have some pretty significant cultural gaps from its origins, how are these stories able to form connections with fans in the new region or culture, and what are some of the reasons they don't?  Thank you for that warm welcome, and that insight.  Your question could really be the basis for another book.  It falls into the academic field known as fan studies, and it would be interesting to see work on audience reception that focused on how people respond to fictional worlds based on their culture, that were written by an author from another culture and which is not an accurate depiction of their culture.  This isn't something I've read a lot about, but I can offer one example of this phenomenon, which might help to answer your question.  Karl May is often said to be the best-selling author in modern German history; I'm not sure if that can be verified, but his books sold hundreds of millions of copies during the 20th century, and have been translated into 46 languages, at last count.  But May never visited the American West; indeed, he only visited the U.S. once, late in life, and got no further West than NY State.  His fictional West was based on his ethnological and anthropological research, and of course his own imagination.  And one nation where he has never found a broad readership is the United States; I had never heard of him before I lived in Germany, and I don't think his translations have sold well in the U.S.  His lack of popularity in the U.S. originally might have had something to do with the fact that his novels generally sympathized with Indigenous cultures and condemned rapacious Anglo-American settlers and their government.  He thus inverted American Western's view of who was the "hero" in these stories, and I suspect that dampened sales in the United States, at least among white Americans.    But I'm not aware of any examples similar to what you mention at the end of your query, where fans in the culture being described from the outside, influence or amend the world-building of the author.  I suspect it can and has happened, but I'm not aware of an example.	1642964061.0	htwvsz7	t3_savz63	t1_htw2wm3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwvsz7/

iovlhi6b	I think that your observation was true for many Germans, earlier in the 20th century.  Tacitus's book had considerable impact on how 19th and early 20th century Germans saw the history of their nation and national identity.  I have actually never read that Tacitus had a big impact on Americans' stereotypes, however.  As you probably know, Tacitus describes the Germanic peoples of his day as a tribal culture, and one that valued warriors.  Some 19th century Germans who read this, centuries later, made the connection between Tacitus's description of the German tribes (fighting against Roman colonization) and Indigenous North Americans' struggles against the U.S. government.  Although it might seem very odd to us, many Germans felt a sense of kinship with Indigenous Americans; see H.Glenn Penny's *Kindred By Choice* for a lot more information about this.	1642965004.0	htwy871	t3_savz63	t1_htwdb5r	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htwy871/

iovlhi6b	That wasn't a key question in my research, but I think one part of my response would be that the "lone gunslinger" is usually a white character.  And as I noted above in some of my other responses, German fans tended to have much more sympathy for (or even identification with) Indigenous characters and cultures than US fans did.   The lone white character is generally not so important, although in Karl May's Westerns, he was often paired with an Indigenous character who was his partner.	1642965887.0	htx0gp8	t3_savz63	t1_htws71o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx0gp8/
9jwvl	Yeah, that story about Karl May reminds me of a show called Avatar: the Last Airbender, which is hugely popular, critically acclaimed, and lauded for its portrayal of traditional East Asian culture.  Never caught on over here, though, and it could be because it uses a dichotomy of good and evil, which isn't how it's viewed here, where good and evil are both complementary and opposing forces. It could be because of marketing. It's a really interesting topic for sure.  Same with SW, it was based in Eastern philosophies and characters, but it then never really caught on here (except for a few pockets of devoted fans) because again that dichotomy of good vs evil compared to having to naturally balance the opposing forces within oneself that then extends to the rest of society and government.  I actually have heard that ronin films and Western films have had kind of a back and forth where they both have actually come out to influence one another. Don't quote me here, haha but I think Westerns were made first, then were imported to Japan after WW2 because of the occupation. It helped to influence ronin films, which then led for their influence to then be carried back across the Pacific to the US, which then had Western pictures evolve further.  I really find it fascinating because as someone who's kind of between two worlds that are vastly different, I'm always curious as to why something like the Marvel movies are hugely popular, but Star Wars isn't. Sci-fi has taken off here, even influencing some really great local authors, but other genres haven't.  I really appreciate your insights, and if you listened to me rambling, also that :)	1642965921.0	htx0js9	t3_savz63	t1_htwvsz7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx0js9/

8uf2h	LARP and reenactment share a lot of common features but a distinguishing feature of LARP is that there's an expectation it include some kind of in-character game element, from competitive athletic combat to unscripted intrigue. I won't pretend the line is super bright, but I think it's usually possible to categorize an activity as either LARP or reenactment. While LARPs come in all kinds of settings, western frontier LARPs are a small minority.   Why has western reenactment generally not included game elements? What's the history of cross pollination, or lack thereof, between the western reenactment and LARP fandoms?	1642966761.0	htx2o2v	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx2o2v/

iovlhi6b	It's a bit out of my topic area, but I'll share what I can.    L'Amour can be seen as the successor (in a way) to Zane Grey.  Grey was the one of the most popular writers of Westerns in the U.S. during the period between WWI and WWII, and more than 100 Hollywood films were based on his novels, in the period between the wars.  L'Amour emerged as the dominant postwar Western writer.  As you probably know, he sold more than 200 million copies during his lifetime and at least 30 films were based on his novels. I think that among fans of Westerns, he still has a big following.  But we would need to see that within the context of the (relative) decline in Westerns' popularity.  For much of the 20th century, Western stories, films, and TV shows had a huge footprint in American popular culture, and were one of our most important cultural exports, globally.  I've read that about 1/3 of Hollywood movies made before 1960 were Westerns, and there were 17 prime time Western series in the U.S. during the mid-1960s.  *Bonanza* was a global hit, and in Germany, it was so popular that I've seen German cultural historians refer to the 1960s as the "Bonanza decade."  So L'Amour was riding a huge cultural wave, so to speak.  There was a rapid decline in Westerns' popularity in the U.S. and Europe after the 1980s.  Very few Westerns were filmed during the 1980s, perhaps due to the epic financial disaster of Heaven's Gate. There was some revival after 1990, but depictions of white settlement changed in many films.  Westerns still have a following, but they are no longer the dominant pop culture genre; instead, they persist on dedicated cable channels like the Turner Broadcasting Network, and have inspired arcade and video games, and other entertainments.  But overall, the genre is not as popular as it was 50 years ago.  The decline in Western fans must impact the following of Western authors, even mega-successful ones like L'Amour.  Nowadays, I suspect that fantasy and science fiction films have replaced Westerns, as the dominant category of US cultural exports.	1642966961.0	htx364o	t3_savz63	t1_htwc2za	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx364o/

iovlhi6b	It's actually not my genre.  I am a historian of popular culture, and a life-long fan of science fiction, fantasy, and Sherlock Holmes.  But I didn't want to focus my book on a fandom that I myself am part of.  Instead, I chose to look at Western fans because while I understand the dynamics and histories of literary fandoms as a whole, this was not my own fan community.

iovlhi6b	Karl May is always interesting to talk about!  I haven't even scraped the surface here.  You're right that his Western novels get a lot more attention nowadays (and, I think, even in the beginning) compared to his Orientalist novels.  I've discussed this with people who are leading members of the May fandom in Germany, and they commented that in general, fans were more focused on the Western stories. I could offer some speculations about why.  First, Winnetou.  He is such a powerfully appealing character for fans, as is Old Shatterhand.  I think that the attraction of those characters for many fans meant that the Western novels attracted more attention.  And second, the popularity of Westerns in Germany even before May.  There were many best-selling Western authors in Germany before May (both English-speaking and German), including James Fenimore Cooper, Balduin Moellhausen, and Friedrich Gerstaecker.  In entering this cultural market, May was latching on to what was already a big wave, in terms of the genre's popularity, so I'm not surprised his Western novels benefitted.  I'm not sure about the connection between denazification and Westerns.  That's because of the enormous continuity in the popularity of Westerns with Germans, since the early 19th century (the authors i list above are only a small fraction of this phenomenon) and also the genre popularity in both East and West Germany.  Germans' attraction to Indigenous cultures and the West is what historian Glenn Penny has referred to as a longue	1642967758.0	htx574g	t3_savz63	t1_htwm7i0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx574g/

f9ocu9u6	I'd argue this is built primarily around the Old Testament concept of the sacrificial lamb. At the time right before Exodus called the Passover, the family had to sacrifice the lamb, spread is blood on the door, and the entire lamb had to be consumed by the family and whatever other people were with them in the house.  As a parallel, John calls Jesus the Lamb of God. Jesus Himself is placed on the cross (his blood spread in a way on the wood), and He is consumed by Catholics in the Eucharist/Communion. In this way we are joined as close to God as possible on Earth, which is why the Catechism says the Eucharist is the source and summit our faith. It's no mistake that Jesus has the Last Supper on Passover.  This was an idea rejected by some even in the Bible, as can be seen in John 6:66.	1642968013.0	htx5up1	t3_sa4oxw	t3_sa4oxw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa4oxw/catholics_believe_in_transubstantiation_the_bread/htx5up1/

lmoso	The Imams’ attitude was covered in Halil Inalcik’s book The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age.  The background was that the Ottoman state never had a tradition that the eldest son was by default the only legally valid successor.  Instead the idea was that the most powerful son would take over. This led to civil was with massive death.   The Imams were needed to legitimize the execution of Sultans’ siblings. They were were brought onboard because in Islamic law there is a principle that an evil can be made permissible to avoid a greater evil.  In this case, if the murder of the sultan’s siblings would prevent civil wars where thousands or tens of thousands of citizens would die, then the murders were the lesser of the evil and would be allowed.  The Imams thus backed this succession practice as an exceptional circumstance.	1642968625.0	htx7eu2	t3_sa2mg6	t3_sa2mg6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa2mg6/for_about_200_years_new_ottoman_sultans_killed/htx7eu2/
iovlhi6b	Those are smart, interesting questions, that I wish I knew more about!    But I'll share what I know.  I can easily imagine that like fans everywhere, there were some fans who felt that the Karl May films weren't completely faithful to the novels (I mean, they really were not, in some cases), but I haven't seen those discussions among May fans.  Similarly, I'd love to know what the Baker Street Irregulars or the Sherlock Holmes Society (among the earliest Holmes fan orgs) made of the Bruce and Rathbone films.  It would have been a treat to be a fly on the wall, when they discussed them; I am imagining that the comments might have been scathing (I mean, Sherlock Holmes tracks down Nazis?).  But sadly, I don't know of any research on that; I'd read it, if there was!  There are clear connections between traveling Western entertainments and theme parks.  But I don't know of any such comic book version before 1945 in Germany, at least.  Western clubs sometimes had their own private grounds, where they met and practiced handicrafts and role play, but these were rarely open to the public.  Today, there is a Western theme park in Germany, south of Munich, "Pullman City," offers visitors a potpourri of fictionalized sites associated with various eras of North American history.  It's on my bucket list.	1642968914.0	htx851f	t3_savz63	t1_htwerx9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htx851f/

hdag0	This is fascinating stuff, thank you so much for sharing! My mother's family is German, from Dewitt County. Both of my grandparents spoke German, though not in public, and my mother(b. '54) knew some German from her childhood. I've inherited German-language bibles and a few books from her grandmother. They were proud of their heritage and I never would have ever guessed the tribulations you've detailed here, but surely they would have been aware of it. Fascinating stuff.   I always found it amusing that my grandmother's biggest complaint when I got married(to a black man) was that a) we cohabitated before marriage and b) we eloped instead of a proper church marriage, contrasting to my paternal family who were much less enthused about me marrying a "colored boy", but I guess it might make more sense considering the cultural differences(northern Louisiana Scotch-Irish vs South Texan Germans).

This type of feed essentially just skips the mouth and esophagus, but all other digestive processes still occur as usual.

8antg3zz	>The Ossetians are ethnically related to Iranians, and speak a language related to Iranian, and are historically relatively new to the Caucasus (most historians would agree they arrived around the 13/14th century, while some nationalist Georgian historians argue as recently as the 18th century). Compounding the issue was that directly north of this Oblast was the North Ossetia Autonomous Republic, which was part of Russia (the regions were connected by a 3.7km Roki Tunnel, built in the 1960s).  The Ossetians in the Caucasus are still mentioned in the 5th century when they were defeated by the Iberian king Vakhtang Gorgasali.  But Ossetians settled in Georgia in small numbers in the 16th century by Lord Machabeli because Kartli was partly uninhabited (depopulation due to wars).  There was no uprising in South Ossetia because of Gamsakhurdia's remarks, this is a lie.

69l7d	Archaeology and the forensic analysis of human remains can tell us a lot about the health of individuals, while not perfect bones can be used to provide solid guesses for such things as age at death, nutritional deficiencies (particularly childhood malnutrition), stresses of daily life (such as repetitive labor) and some diseases like tuberculosis. Likewise under the right conditions the analysis of soil linked to latrines can provide evidence for the nutritional intake of the population and parasite presence (for example, there has been some interesting work done on this [in Pompeii](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/110623-ancient-rome-human-waste-herculaneum-science-diet-excrement-italy)).  This is all a way of saying that, theoretically, there are tools that could provide pretty illuminating answers to this question, but I am not aware of this work having been done yet (I would be thrilled to be wrong, of course). In general this sort of work on standards of living in the Roman empire is in its infancy, and getting to a level of analysis fine grained enough to distinguish specific sectors (even one as visible as the soldiery) is quite a bit of work. At the moment, probably the best sketch comes from surviving documents that let us know, for a handful of legions, for a handful of years, how many soldiers completed their service of twenty five years and were given an honorable discharge. This is pretty thin evidence to make sweeping claims, but from it we can say that [the rate of mortality of soldiers was not significantly different than the civilian population](http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/110509.pdf). If you factor in the existence of combat mortality this may mean that soldiers were a bit less likely to die of natural causes, and thus were a bit healthier than the population as a whole, but it was probably broadly comparable.  For their physical fitness in terms of "were they swole" rather than "were they healthy" our best evidence comes from *De rei militari*, a military manual written by Vegetius describing the army of the early imperial period. It is problematic because it is not descriptive but rather proscriptive--in other words he is making an argument for what armies should be like based on his understanding of the early imperial army rather than something like a survey work to understand what actual military practice was. That said the book is not fantasy, and is probably a reliable guide to what can be called "docterine". And given this, the emphasis on training and exercise (taking up much of book 1) is striking. [For example](https://digitalattic.org/home/war/vegetius/index.php#b109):  >We are informed by the writings of the ancients that, among their other exercises, they had that of the post. They gave their recruits round bucklers woven with willows, twice as heavy as those used on real service, and wooden swords double the weight of the common ones. They exercised them with these at the post both morning and afternoon.  >This is an invention of the greatest use, not only to soldiers, but also to gladiators. No man of either profession ever distinguished himself in the circus or field of battle, who was not perfect in this kind of exercise. Every soldier, therefore, fixed a post firmly in the ground, about the height of six feet. Against this, as against a real enemy, the recruit was exercised with the above mentioned arms, as it were with the common shield and sword, sometimes aiming At the head or face, sometimes at the sides, at others endeavoring to strike at the thighs or legs. He was instructed in what manner to advance and retire, and in short how to take every advantage of his adversary; but was thus above all particularly cautioned not to lay himself open to his antagonist while aiming his stroke at him.  This is solid exercise, particularly when combined with swimming, jumping, running, carrying heavy packs, etc that is also recommended. It is hard to know exactly how closely this training regimen was actually followed, but at the very least physical fitness was at least considered important.	1642970444.0	htxc4kw	t3_saswy0	t3_saswy0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saswy0/how_physically_fit_were_roman_soldiers_in_the/htxc4kw/

4qjou698	Hi! Thanks for being here!   I am unsure if this fits into your acumen, but perhaps you could point me in the right direction if it doesn’t.    My great uncle was a scout leader for the Boy Scouts of America in the 50s and 60s.  According to family lore and newspaper clippings from the time, he dedicated quite a bit of his life to “researching“ indigenous people in the American southwest, learning things like silversmithing, beadwork, dance rituals, music, and other traditions - particularly those of the Sioux tribe.  He apparently worked with tribes in the southwest and shared his knowledge with them, along with his Boy Scouts troop Who would tour around and perform mock traditional Sioux dances, complete with costumes and music.    The newspaper articles and the old letters thanking my uncle for his work all indicate that there was a sense of respect for indigenous Americans at this time, but I think this was more of “the noble savage“ flavor.    Do you know much about the glorification of American tribes by the BSA?    Was this as well-intentioned yet misguided and offensive as I have a feeling it was?    I have some costume/dance materials that he made (leather and beadwork), and I’m unsure how to feel about holding onto (let alone displaying) them, though they are beautiful and well-crafted.	1642971709.0	htxfgvh	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htxfgvh/

9i89m	Before mass media it was harder for someone to become inundated with tunes: music was manually produced, sung or played live. So, the average person would not be trying to memorize a playlist of thousands of songs.  However, there were "ear worms", catchy melodies that became popular. We know this because once those melodies became popular,  musicians would use them for other things. In medieval music they were called "contrafacta", and a very famous one is the song *L'Homme Armé*, that appeared anonymously around the time of the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453. It was then picked up and used as a melody for offices of the mass by composers like Guillaume Dufay.  Similarly, at a market in England in the 17th c. there would likely be someone selling ballads. Written on various topical themes or humorous narratives, they're now generically called broadside ballads, as they would be printed on single long sheets of paper, and draped over the arm of the person hawking them. There would not be music written out under the lyrics: instead, at the top would be a note as to the melody, like " to be sung to the burden of *Greensleeves* " or "to be sung to the burden of *Packington's Pound*" . As there would be no point in setting the ballad to something obscure,  a surviving broadside ballad gives us an indication as to whether a tune was popular.  Another clue comes from the musical game of theme and variation that would be a standard form for western musicians of the Renaissance and Baroque. A lutenist would be asked to do variations to show off her technique, and of course she would tend to use popular tunes for her themes. Just as Greensleeves and Packington's Pound would be common for English broadside ballads, they were commonly written into English lute books as well.  But you also raise the point about how anyone could remember a lot of tunes? They could of course sometimes be able to write them down. But music written on paper was not always practical, so there was also the Guidonian Hand, a system of memorizing a musical part by referring to different parts of the hand. You can see some singers doing it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmR716ZTqL8). Coincidentally, they're singing *"l'Homme Armé*  Lastly, tunes got memorized better if they had names. If you take a look at traditional Irish music, you'll notice names like My Honest Dear Neighbor I Never Killed your Cat, and traditional Appalachian fiddle tunes can have names like Hog Went for the Fence Yoke and All.   Makes them harder to forget.	1642975649.0	htxpsgi	t3_sawjho	t3_sawjho	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sawjho/did_people_get_music_stuck_in_their_heads_as/htxpsgi/

76o33	This article answers your question although this is going to be a Halakahic answer (that is about Jewish law primarily with some history so I apologize for that mods, but this is what was asked)  Now also to explain this one must understand that there are 2 main sources of law, one is from the Torah and the other is from the Oral Law (also called Rabbinic), which in traditional Jewish ideas is seen to have been given to Moses at Sinai with the Torah. This is from the Rabbinic tradition.   So in order to explain that you need a little history, the dependence on interpretation from Rabbis is called Rabbinic Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism is the primary form of Judaism today, and the major Jewish movements are all Rabbinic in origin there are a few exceptions but they are small comparatively. In Judaism typically the more conservative one is the more one believes that this interpretation is the literal 'Word of God' and the more liberal one is the more one would believe that it was all crafted by humans.   The Pharisees mentioned in the Chrisitan Bible are the originators of this tradition, they first appear in the Second Century after John Macabee (from the Channukah story) takes over and replaces the priesthood with the Hasmonean Dynasty. Although the source for this is Josephus he says that they were experts in the law. They are in contrast to (the name comes from the word sperate/part in Aramaic/Hebrew) the Hasmonean priesthood.    This Oral law is codified in the Talmud which is really made up of the law (Mishan) then the discussion around it (Gemara), of which there are two versions, one made in Babylon (modern-day Iraq-ish) where there was a Jewish Diaspora since around 586 BCE. The other was made in Roman Judea/Israel/Palestine both of these were initially collected and written down around 400/500 CE. But there are many debates codified in the Talmud about what some of these items mean, or how to do things properly. it is best described as a sort of legalistic tradition, which has many similarities to Islamic law.    The Babylonian Talmud is considered the authoritative one if the two disagree. It is more robust in its discussions and Jewish life had shifted towards Babylone especially after the Romans sacked Jerusalem and the Temple, enslaved tens of thousand Jews, and forced many out of the area. Prior to writing these were passed from generation to generation (hence it being called 'Oral Law') but after the destruction of the Second Temple, it was decided that it should be written down for fear of losing it.  As I mentioned this is a legalistic tradition so one has law and precedent, and also one looks to see how earlier generations interpreted it. There can also be disputes about how these are interpreted and seen via different people, much as lawyers would debate a law in court. So what you have is sort of a debate across centuries about the 'correct way' to do things.  So to pull an article using the source mentioned above by /u/gingeryid   https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/artificial-feeding-on-yom-kippur-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter  *"Rav Chaim Ozer responded that nonetheless Halacha defines only oral ingestion as eating.  He cites the Gemara’s discussion (Yoma 74b) of the source of the assumption that when the Torah commands us to “afflict ourselves on Yom Kippur” it refers to refraining from food and drink.  The Gemara refers to the verse (Devarim 8:3) that states that first Hashem afflicted us and then he fed us the manna.  We see that the term “affliction” as used in the Torah refers to not eating or drinking.  Rav Chaim Ozer argues that since the Torah records that Hashem fed us the manna to satisfy our hunger, we see that only oral ingestion of food satisfies hunger.  Thus, Halacha defines one as afflicting himself if he does not ingest food or drink orally.  Indeed, people do not find artificial feeding particularly satisfying. "*  So we see in a basic answer to your question that no it is not classified as eating via a tube. This particular answer is about Yom Kippur where the (Jewish) laws of fasting prevent the intake of food or water for about 25 hours, as a side note here the Jewish day (and Islamic one) start at Sunset so you get a little overlap of time where the sun starts to set until it completely sets counting as the end of one day and the start of the new day, hence 25 hours. Although it is an indirect example as the question here is should one use an IV to avoid eating via the mouth if needed.   There are other opinions listed and elsewhere that say it is eating, in case you are interested, for example, this here which specifically asks the question of feeding via tubes  http://download.yutorah.org/1985/1053/735697.pdf  To point out, and tie in the longer discussion above, the first article mentioned both the Gemara and the Torah as 'proof' cases for this particular example. The Gemara source can be read here:  https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.74b.1?lang=bi  This particular passage is about the laws of Yom Kippur the Talmud is divided into several sections one of these sections is about proper observance of holidays.   The Torah proof they use is Devarim 8:3 which would be Numbers for those used to the English/Greek terms although the name in Hebrew here means things which comes from the first words of this section (אֵ֣לֶּה הַדְּבָרִ֗ים) "Here are the things". The proof quote is "He subjected you to the hardship of hunger and then gave you manna to eat", the Talmud again has its own way of interpreting and reading these laws, which some Jews study for many years to get aquatinted with.    However, hopefully, that answers your question.	1642978553.0	htxxexj	t3_sautz9	t1_htx9jsz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htxxexj/

168sly	Because of the soapboxing rule and the 20 year rule I can't and won't discuss contemporary politics, but there are plural democratic countries that come to mind that have single member legislative districts with first past the post elections where a party can be relatively rural and also a minority of the total votes cast, yet win solid legislative majorities.	1642981215.0	hty4gzn	t3_sakj6q	t1_htwzdu0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sakj6q/why_were_the_dutch_such_brutal_colonialists/hty4gzn/

nxyvc	Warry is no more than a brief introduction; there isn't much space to go into depth on any of the controversies. As such, it's a fairly bland consensus piece (nice pictures though). It is, therefore, just as dated, though without quite as much of an axe to grind about the traditional view being unquestionably correct. It would be better to go for a more recent general work like *The Ancient World at War* (ed. Philip de Souza) or *The Oxford Handbook to Warfare in the Classical World* (ed. Campbell & Tritle). Sidebottom's *Ancient Warfare: A Very Short Introduction* openly takes aim at Hanson.	1642981343.0	hty4sg6	t3_s83m6b	t1_htokcyv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s83m6b/did_ancient_greek_city_states_actually_determine/hty4sg6/
5cvxk	This is a pretty simplistic question that's perhaps more of a linguist thing, but what's relative prevalence and history of the term "Fandom" vs "Fanbase"?  Growing up (I'm in my late 20's now, in the eastern US) I always heard the latter term, but then maybe around a decade ago the former seemed to become more prevalent for me. Wondering how representative that is or not!	1642981421.0	hty4z9d	t3_savz63	t3_savz63	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hty4z9d/

177u1k	This submission has been removed because it violates the [rule on poll-type questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_no_.22poll.22-type_questions). These questions do not lend themselves to answers with a firm foundation in sources and research, and the resulting threads usually turn into monsters with enormous speculation and little focused discussion. Questions about the "most", the "worst", "unknown", or other value judgments usually lead to vague, subjective, and speculative answers.  For further information, please consult [this Roundtable discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7fhjf/rules_roundtable_iii_no_example_seeking_or/).    For questions of this type, we ask that you redirect them to more appropriate subreddits, such as /r/history or /r/askhistory.	1642984318.0	htyc0de	t3_sb8acc	t3_sb8acc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8acc/who_are_the_top_9_best_presidents_in_your_opinion/htyc0de/

Standalone questions are [intended to be seeking detailed, comprehensive answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth), and we ask that [questions looking for a name, a number, a date or time, a location, the origin of a word, the first/last instance of a specific phenomenon, or a simple list of examples or facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_basic_facts) be contained to that thread as they are more likely to receive an answer there. For more information on this rule, [please see this Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g3pdjp/rules_roundtable_ix_the_basics_facts_rule_and/).    Alternatively, if you didn't mean to ask a question seeking a short answer or a list of examples, but have a more complex question in mind, feel free to repost a reworded question. Examples of questions appropriate for the 'Short Answers' thread would be "Who won the 1932 election?" or "What are some famous natural disasters from the past?". Versions more appropriate as standalone questions would be "How did FDR win the 1932 election?", or "In your area of expertise, how did people deal with natural disasters?"

Consider /r/AskHistory (which has lighter moderation but similar topic matter to /r/AskHistorians), /r/explainlikeimfive (which is specifically aimed at simple and easily digested answers), or /r/etymology (which focuses on the origins of words and phrases).	1642984570.0	htyclzz	t3_sb8fkv	t3_sb8fkv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8fkv/watching_the_prestige_im_wondering_who_was_first/htyclzz/

djlwk	That is a very good school curriculum if it gets to discussing Manifest Destiny when speaking of the shared history of the US and the Philippines. I always was of the impression that MD as a concept was limited to the geographical limits of the North American continent, particularly the expansion from east to west. A rethinking of the idea is always a nice discussion to have.   Out of curiosity, what particular school are you talking about? I don't quite remember my relatives who attended Ateneo in high school talking about this particular thing, but then again you also did say that it's a fairly recent development. I suppose I'm just happy to know that there are good history curriculums in *some* areas of the Philippines, because it seems so much like I'm the only person I know around me that has any interest, let alone what meager knowledge I have, in it.	1642987323.0	htyj5k2	t3_savz63	t1_htw168o	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/htyj5k2/

7rvatyyv	Thanks for the clarification about the arrival of the Ossetians. Like I said there's a lot of discrepancy in sources (largely politically-motivated), which doesn't help with that.  And I should word myself better about Gamsakhurdia: while he didn't directly cause the Ossetians to want to leave (they obviously were looking for an out before), his remarks (or supposed remarks, as I mentioned) only made things worse, as did his later actions. He was really not the best option to lead a newly-independent Georgia, and I do have to wonder what could have happened had Kostava not died before then.	1642991782.0	htytzdm	t3_s68982	t1_htxaxo1	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htytzdm/

7rvatyyv	I would not comment on Theriault, as I'm not familiar with him, but as I mentioned initially, my concern was that nearly all signatories were of Armenian background, which I felt is worth noting.   Regarding Lemkin, he didn't focus on the Holocaust exclusively, and neither did the UN (and the other international bodies) when crafting the definition of genocide, so I don't think that needs to be further discussed.  As I wrote in another comment, if de Waal has been called out for misinterpreting facts then that is fine; I'll be happy to review that and see what the issue is, as I'm far from an ardent defender of him. All I initially wrote was that *Black Garden* is probably the best English-language book on the Karabakh conflict. I still stand by that as most other works on the subject are written by people on one or the other sides of the conflict, and inherently biased as a result. If there is something else you'd suggest in lieu of that please do let me know, and I will gladly take a look (I've been to Stepanakert and Shushi, and really enjoyed visiting the region as a whole, by the way).  Lastly, I'll conclude that it's interesting to see the 1923 date used in the French-language text, and I'm curious to see how Kevorkian and Ternon analyze things. My French is not strong enough to read something like that, but from what I can tell this is not a translation of *The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History*, but a new book, no?  I'll conclude here by noting that we are kind of off-topic from the original post, though I do welcome your feedback. Like I mentioned in other posts, I'm not looking to downplay the genocide or be pro or anti one side, so I hope I don't come off that way. I know it is a difficult topic for a lot of people, one I can't pretend to understand, and don't mean to offend if that was what happened in anything I wrote.	1642992407.0	htyvkkf	t3_s68982	t1_htu641e	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htyvkkf/
iwanf	Indeed it is, but my understanding is that it is far from the norm in the manufacturing world.  If one buys random marshmallows in a grocery store it will almost certainly be from non-kosher sources of gelatin (unless it is kosher marshmallows, which usually you only find in the kosher aisle, not with the other marshmallows).  And if one buys random gel-caps from a pharmacy my understanding is it is not going to be from kosher gelatin, even if the manufacturer could theoretically have purchased kosher gelatin.  If that second bit is wrong a lot of Rabbis would very much like to know about it...  Note that there was/is an intermediate position in gelatin kashrut--that gelatin needs to be from a kosher animal, but not from one that is actually permitted to eat.  I.e. you can eat beef gelatin even if the animals were not slaughtered and inspected in accordance with Jewish dietary laws, but not gelatin from pigs.  There are even kosher agencies that hold this position that certify gelatin as being from cows and not pigs, though not in the US.  Strictly-kosher gelatin plus beef-only gelatin combined might make up a decent share of the gelatin production in the world.  However, my understanding is that at some point in the US non-kosher gelatin went from mostly cows to mostly pigs, which contributed to the strict position winning the day.	1642992477.0	htyvrio	t3_sautz9	t1_htx9trx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htyvrio/

13ovwf	I can discuss the history of Japanese Educational systems, and so in this response I will.  As you know, education didn't start with the adoption of the western education system, and indeed in the case of Japan goes back much farther to at least the 6th century, with the introduction of Chinese models for society and the increase in Japanese going to China and returning with new knowledge to teach to their fellow countrymen. Education develops from there through the Heian era (794-1185) with  the establishment of government institutions for study, aimed at the upper class. It is also likely that some people not in the upper class had ways of studying but at that point in time records are scarce as they relate to the lifestyle of commoners.   Skipping forward in time to the Edo Era, which is classified as the Early Modern Era and lasted from 1603 until 1867, the educational systems experienced a great growth for all people regardless of social status.   At the time, the government was organized so that the Tokugawa Family (from which Shoguns were chosen), had direct control over large parts of the country, but still most of the land was controlled by various Daimyo, prominent samurai families who passed their titles and control of their territories through their respective families. The Shogun had the power to remove Daimyo who failed to uphold standards of behavior and rule, and also retained the power to manage foreign affairs amongst other things, but the Daimyo were left otherwise to govern their domains in accordance with their own principles. The result of this is that there was not one unified government sponsored education system, nor a unified private system throughout the country. However, individual domains generally followed the lead of the Tokugawa Shogunate and so their systems in practice are similar.   The first type of school was the Hankou, official schools ran by individual domains and aimed at members of the samurai class. These were run very similarly to the Shogunate schools ran by the Shogunate, so for the purposes of this response you can consider them as essentially identical. These included various levels of education, of which some were similar to western universities in that they accepted adults who were looking for a higher education to advance their career or were otherwise interested in studies for personal reasons. They all had a basis in confician ideology, and taught many subjects, including writing skills, literature, geography, math, economics, foreign language, technology, etc... The yushima seido in edo, which was the most prominent school run by the Shogunate, is a famous example which produced many famous scholars and academics.   The second type were Terakoya, which were aimed at non-samurai children and run privately, most often by the teacher. They had no specific curriculum, but generally taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and history, and were usually attended by children who would now be elementary school age. Boys and girls could attend together, and teachers could be commoners, samurai, doctors, monks, priests, and so on. Schools particularly for certain skills, like music or art also existed, and schools specializing in teaching useful household skills to girls existed as well.   The last major group is the Gougaku, government run schools of various kinds that were seperate from the main Hankou. Some provided education to samurai, some to commoners, and some to a mixed group of both. They are distinguished from Terakoya and private institutions because they were established with government support.   Beyond that, various private institutions and personal tutors also existed, but that has changed little to this day.   So, what changed?   1. The majority of these institutions disappeared when their government backing disappeared, or in the case of Terakoya, when universal education supported by the government came into existence.   2. The subjects and methods of teaching changed in many ways with the adoption of western ideas which challenged confucianism.   3. Admissions practices changed, with the new universities being open to anyone in the country regardless of status or place of residence.   4. The internal structure, with concepts like choosing a major and graduating with degrees such as a bachelor's degree, a graduate degree, a masters degree or equivalent was a new addition not present in the previous system.   5. The idea of paying a fixed fee for a set course was introduced   As a result, essentially every educational institution in Japan is based on the western model and very few remain from before then. Additionally, since the naming schemes are different, the first college in Japan would be the first place to be called a college, regardless of the existence of any equivalent institutions.   Therefore, even with a long history of education, the modern system derives mostly from the western system, and thus the institution of higher education in Japan that based itself on a western model to some extent is the first college.   Incidentally, that would be Keio University, founded in the final years of the Edo Era.	1642994152.0	htz03en	t3_s6wkwl	t3_s6wkwl	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s6wkwl/chinas_first_university_the_imperial_university/htz03en/

iwanf	> Would you be willing to elaborate on this point? When I think of the term "feeding tube" I think of enteral feeds like a nasal gastric tube or orogastric. This type of feed essentially just skips the mouth and esophagus, but all other digestive processes still occur as usual. Is this distinction between chewing/tasting, and digestion the key factor?  Basically correct.  To give a much narrower answer than /u/ummmbacon, Jewish dietary laws are often concerned with taste as determinant of dietary law.  This is true in a variety of contexts--both prohibited foods^1 and other ritual food contexts^(2,3).  In some contexts being satiated matters^(4).  One could, theoretically, think that because a feeding tube provides nutrients it should be considered like swallowing a food without chewing or tasting it (that is, that it is "incomplete" eating in some sense--or in Jewish legal terminology, "unusual eating").  But the stuff in a feeding tube isn't really food, and people fed by feeding tubes don't feel "satiated" really, so the consensus became that it is not considered eating at all.  1. In prohibited foods, for example, a mixture where a prohibited food added in small measure to a permitted food is forbidden only if the prohibited food can be tasted in the resulting mixture (though since this is difficult to assess, for most purposes 1/60 is used).  Where a prohibited food tastes the same as the permitted food, the laws of mixtures are different * A person who eats matza on passover by throwing it directly into the back of their mouth without tasting it, for example, has not fulfilled the commandment of eating matza * A person who drinks water to alleviate thirst recites a blessing on it, but not a person who has something stuck in their throat to clear, since they are not trying to benefit from the hydration of the water at all * For example, for reciting the blessing after eating a bread-based meal	1642996056.0	htz4hd0	t3_sautz9	t1_htx9jsz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/htz4hd0/
2236wuem	u/udreaudsurarea provides an answer that covers this (and to be specific, we're talking about the Neo-Assyrian empire from about the 8th century on - the largest empire in the world at that time - a scale that was unparalleled before and certainly influences their reputation):  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pxlpdw/what\_caused\_the\_assyrians\_to\_and\_i\_believe\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/pxlpdw/what_caused_the_assyrians_to_and_i_believe_this/)  To be clear, their reputation was not undeserved, the answer discusses how they weren't necessarily as exceptionally violent as their reputation suggests. That said, they were a militaristic society from top to bottom. Their kings were expected to regularly wage war (and there was no shortage of conflict due to regular rebellions), to the point that each year was named after a campaign (although it was unlikely they campaigned literally every year so this is an example of a tradition that may give them a more warlike reputation than they really were). Their kings, in the Mesopotamian tradition dating back thousands of years, wrote inscriptions both public and votive detailing their successes and accomplishments. Here's the thing though - most of this writing is intended to be propaganda. If you take royal inscriptions at face value, the entire history of the Ancient Near East is a steady progression of strong genius warrior kings who never lost a battle. This is obviously not true (especially since they fought each other! Hittite and Egyptian inscriptions about the battle of Qadesh both claim victory, for example. Obviously, someone is lying, or at least stretching the definition of victory). The leaders certainly omitted details when things didn't go their way. Sennacherib certainly besieged Jerusalem, in the bible his army is slain by angels. Sennacherib doesn't bother to mention why they didn't sack Jerusalem (indeed they had just violently pacified Lachish). Perhaps it was disease, perhaps the siege was too expensive, or perhaps they just came to terms with Jerusalem and it wasn't worth writing about.  The Assyrians also practiced something called "calculated frightfulness." This wasn't unique to them, even at that time, but their execution of it was noteworthy. Their own tendency to describe their exploits and the extremely violent retribution on rebels (true or not) was certainly a part of this. Sieges are expensive and time-consuming and it was more reliable to kill people in a city's hinterlands and put their corpses on display as an act of intimidation to cow a city into surrender (with surely better terms than if it were taken by force). It must be understood then that a lot of their writing wasn't just propaganda for its subjects but intended to frighten would-be rebels or other opponents. It was in the Assyrian's best interest to be as scary as possible; a good way to win a battle is to scare your enemy into surrendering.  Assyria's reputation for violence is often contrasted against their famous neighbors to the South, the kingdom of Babylonia. Part of this is that due to Assyrian tradition and culture their royal inscriptions focused on their military exploits while Babylonian inscriptions focused on building and religious activities. This didn't mean that the Assyrians only waged war, and it certainly doesn't mean the Babylonians didn't! Nineveh was by all accounts an impressive imperial capital just like Babylon would become under Nebuchadnezzar shortly after Assyria's fall. Nebuchadnezzar led the infamous sack of Jerusalem that led to the mass deportation of many Jewish people and left a significant impact on their history, as reflected in the Hebrew Bible. There aren't any detailed Babylonian inscriptions detailing the sack and ensuing violence and deportation, like there would likely be if the Assyrians had done it, but the event left a lasting cultural memory. The writers of Psalm 137 of the Bible certainly were not fans:  >Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,    happy is the one who repays you    according to what you have done to us.    9 Happy is the one who seizes your infants    and dashes them against the rocks.	1642996217.0	htz4um8	t3_s9mr1v	t3_s9mr1v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s9mr1v/how_did_the_assyrians_get_the_reputation_of_being/htz4um8/

n4bht	The first thing to remember is that this wasn't Nixon's first run for President. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was a VP nominee alongside Nixon in 1960, and was in fact under consideration by Eisenhower for his 1952 run; he was a prominent and certainly unsurprising pick, but Nixon lost. Part of the issue with the campaign was a lack of coordination, as Lodge didn't take to a round-the-country touring schedule and sometimes cancelled appearances. Some of his attempts at television went so badly the footage was simply scrapped and never went to air. He additionally was from Massachusetts, and Nixon was running against JFK from the same home state (who had beaten Lodge before, in the 1952 Senate election!) so there was no extra help from that front.  Agnew, by contrast, was still a relatively low-level political operator after being tapped by Nixon, and was grateful for his elevation and was much more willing to work and coordinate with Nixon on overall strategy.  Regarding the home state, Agnew was not picked _just_ for Maryland, but as part of Nixon's entire Southern strategy. So while George Wallace still got Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the Nixon/Agnew ticket managed to grab both Carolinas plus Florida as well as four of the border states.   Agnew was not picked in _contrast_ with Nixon's positioning (who considered himself conservative centrist, and certainly was compared to Goldwater from 1964, with musings about tactical use of nuclear weapons and an acceptance speech about how "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice"). Agnew, though, still had a tough-on-crime stance, and was vocal enough pushing against certain elements of the civil rights movement to make the South happy. Agnew, during the 1968 riots in Baltimore:  >People are fed up with the riots. I’ve tried to be liberal, but at some point you have to stop leading the people and start following them.  and in fact spoke so strongly against black community leaders in Baltimore a former governor (McKeldon) stated "That speech made him the darling of the Strom Thurmond set."  As far as Agnew's loud poltical posture, that was all part of the plan, with Agnew as lightning rod, and while Nixon did not screen his comments, they did meet regularly enough that he wasn't just being a loose cannon when he said things like "if you’ve seen one slum you’ve seen them all". During the Presidency a portrait hung on Agnew's wall signed by Nixon: "To Vice President Ted Agnew, who has demonstrated his character in the ultimate tests of political combat. From his friend, Richard Nixon." Agnew was vocalizing for, as Nixon termed it, the Silent Majority.  This is all consistent with Nixon's own comments in his memoirs about the choice of Agnew:  >Though [Agnew] had no foreign policy experience, his instincts in this area appeared to parallel mine. He had a good record as a moderate, progressive, effective governor. He took a forward-looking stance on civil rights, but he had firmly opposed those who resorted to violence in promoting their cause. As a former county executive….he had a keen interest in local as well as state government. He expressed deep concern about the plight of the nation’s urban areas. He appeared to have presence, poise, and dignity, which would contribute greatly to his effectiveness both as a candidate and, if we should win, as Vice President. From a strictly political standpoint, Agnew fit perfectly with the strategy we had devised for the November election. With George Wallace in the race, I could not hope to sweep the South. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to win the entire rimland of the South – the border states – as well as the major states of the Midwest and West. Agnew fit the bill geographically, and as a political moderate he fit it philosophically.  Certainly everyone still wasn't happy, and Nixon himself eventually soured, and according to Haldeman he pushed for an entirely different VP for his second run (Treasury Secretary John B. Connally) but as noted in the question, that's a story for a different time.  ...

8ey69pyk	It is merely a translation that is not to be taken literally and one that requires context. The passage in that page is from Bernardino de Sahagún’s Florentine Codex, where he lists nahuatl culinary terms and some ingredients sold at markets such as the pre-Hispanic Tlaltelolco here. In this case, “bird excrement sauce” is the literal translation from Nahuatl *totocuitlatl molli*. Although *totocuitlatl* is “bird excrement” in Nahuatl, it was also another name for the chiltepin pepper (*Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum*). Specifically, these names are briefly described to designate a “very small spice” in the Crónica Mexicana, which discusses the history of the Mexica (Aztec would rather be an anachronistic term here). It is likely that this chili pepper’s small size and roundness, reminiscent to that of fecal sacs, is what earned it its name. To compare, there is a similar case with the plant *Ornithogalum umbellatum*, whose edible bulbs were referred to as “dove’s dung,” due to its resemblance to the excrement itself, according to Fernald in Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America.  About the chiltepin pepper, this common name also pertains to nahuatl *chiltecpin*, or roughly “chili pepper flea,” due to its tiny size and high spice content being comparable to that of a flea bite. Unfortunately, nahuatl terms and names are often mistranslated or require context, such as the commonly accepted etymology for the avocado.	1643001185.0	htzes8i	t3_sam5zs	t3_sam5zs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sam5zs/what_is_this_aztec_bird_excrement_sauce/htzes8i/

Same thing as calling Artsakh a conflict as there are genocidal intent already on its indegenous population. Staying « neutral » repeat the same mistakes post WWI, leading to Hitler’s rise and liberty of actions.    Great book about this mechanism:  https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674504790   The book I mentioned is indeed a new book, combining their work to cover the full period and end the topic. I could not find an english translation of it yet, unfortunately. The points (simplified, obviously) are the ones I put on my previous post: the attempt from ataturk to liquidate the survivors of the 1915-1916 by chasing them to Caucasus, trying to prevent the creation of armenia as an independent country (for obvious reasons), the massacres, and finally the spoliation of the wealth and erasing any cultural trace of the armenian civilization (down to scientific names of animal species in latin).	1643001490.0	htzfbq9	t3_s68982	t1_htyvkkf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/htzfbq9/

I do know that simplified versions of May's stories (and other Western authors) were used as the basis for best-selling comic books in both West and East Germany, and I think that you're correct that their audience was probably younger than the novel readers were.

e49gp06y	Depends what exactly you mean. Are you asking for who financed Hitler before the NSDAP? Or who financed Hitler and the Nazis? The first one is a bit harder to answer since Hitler tried (and succeeded) to eradicate a lot of evidence about his own past to simply be able to paint a much more favorable picture of said past. While he was in Vienna and Munich he mostly lived of a mixture Orphan's allowance (half at first because of his father having been dead already and full extend after his mother had died because he successfully claimed to be a Student of Art despite not being one) as well as some financial help from his Mother and Aunt while they were still alive. But he kept running out of money more and more and eventually held himself above water bei moving into a boarding house for men (yes, that was a thing) and started selling some copies of paintings or other famous motives. Often with the help of, ironically enough, a lot of jewish people who helped him sell those.  In 1913 he then got paid out the full inheritance of his fathers fortune (or, well, his share of it) and used that Money to move to Munich. That's where he got caught by the german police because he dodged Austrian military Service. So in the end he was pulled in anyway. So from 1914 to 1920 he was pretty much financed by the Army.  He took part in the Munich Council Republic in 1919 where he even became a Councilor himself but as soon as the Freikorps came in at Mai of that year he pretty much denounced all of his comrades in an instance in order to save his own neck. And career. The Reichswehr pretty much paid him as well for being a contact (known in German as "V-Mann") among the Socialists in the Council Republic and then send him off to take part in seminars against "Bolchewik-Propaganda".  He was released from the Army (Reichswehr) on April 1st 1920 and from thereon he was pretty much making a living of holding Speeches (yes, he got paid for that) and his general work within the NSDAP.  Now the NSDAP throughout the 20s had a multitude of supporters. Many of them members of the aristocracy among which Wilhelm III was a very enthusiastic Nazi who supported the NSDAP and Hitler quite a lot financially or, of course, as well as Industrialists like Fritz Tyssen or Emil Kirdorf. The Nazis really had no lack of powerful an rich supporters.

fw2hd	To start with, while it is generally claimed that in the second half of 16th century the overland route through the Middle East had revived and possibly surpassed Portuguese Cape route, it most likely wasn't by three times. Here is an example, Anthony Reid's [estimate](https://imgur.com/SllqXXX) of pepper exports to Europe, from his article *An 'Age of Commerce' in Southeast Asian History, page 16*. For 1585 his estimate is 1170 tons via Cape route, and 1600 tons via overland route via Levant which is more, but not three times more. And I must mention that his findings are challenged, for example by C. H. H. Wake, who thinks the volumes Reid gives are maximums and only happened when Portuguese failed to nake their delivery (which in close of 16th century happened more often with shipwrecks and piracy). But, it's not really an important issue to be honest, but from it we can make out two things: for one - we really don't have a good way to estimate spice flow to Europe through Middle East, and two - what we can see doesn't really reflect such a large disparity as written in your quoted book.  Now, all this is actually peripheral to your main question, which is:  > I find a hard time believing merchants found it more advantageous to sail around an entire continent than to buy spices from the Middle East. Couldn't European traders just buy spices from the Middle East sail that far to trade directly from India. Couldn't European traders just buy spices from the Middle East sail that far to trade directly from India? Was it really worth it?  First to note is that for centuries, Europeans have been doing exactly that: getting spices in the Middle East. Venetians as the most famous actors but also Genoese, French, Catalans, others have been sailing  to Egypt and Levant and buying spices there. There were some hassles, obstacles and short interruptions but generally speaking this trade was continuously flowing and profitable for all involved. However, what is important is that the prices in Egypt (Alexandria) were substantially higher then prices in India (origin of pepper). M.N. Paerson in his book *Portuguese in India, page 41* gives an [example](https://imgur.com/uscIARO): "a kilo of pepper would cost 1 - 2 grams of silver at production point, 10-14 grams of silver in Alexandria, 14-18 in Venice and 20-30 across Europe. that's a huge difference! Just between India and Alexandria was 10-14 times! Why so much? Due to nature of the transport to take the spice there. Taken from this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ak4cc/as_i_understand_it_columbus_was_trying_to_create/d11syma/) the route looked like this: across the Indian Ocean to Aden, where goods would be transferred from larger ocean going vessels to smaller ships to navigate the more dangerous Red Sea to (Mamluk) Egypt, or branched to other directions like Ormuz and Persian gulf or East African Swahili coast.In Egypt, land caravans from Seuz would take the goods to Cairo, then ship them down the Nile to Alexandria where Venetian traders would buy them and distribute them throughout Europe. It was quite a complicated and established set up, with many middle men, many different transport costs - large ships, small ships, caravans with many camels, cost of loading/unloading. Add many borders and taxes and duties and you get a huge price at Alexandria. And then you need to add cost of distribution from Alexandria and European middle men.    How did this cost compare to the Cape route: well, quite unfavorably actually. While this route was a longer trip, it was a single trip, with no stops, no loading/unloading, no extra borders and duties, no middle men. Not to mention cost of transport on ship was much the cheapest around, much cheaper than transport by camels/horses a caravan through Middle East would take. I've discussed the profitability in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bzuzs8/during_the_17th_century_what_was_worth_more_the/eqxy2ar/). Let's just take from there the relevant part:   > Portuguese cost of carrack that can carry 1000 toneladas of cargo to be 50,000 cruzados (Portuguese gold coins) but the prices fluctuated widely. At the same time, pepper (the cheapest commodity) could be sold in Europe at prices of 28-45 cruzado per quintal (around 51 or 58 kg). If we account for losses and round down that 1 tonelada can fit 15 quintals of pepper, each quintal being worth minimum of 28 cruzados, we get that a 1000 toneladas carrack can have pepper on board worth 420,000 cruzados, almost 8 times the worth!   As said there, a great source for the investigation of profitability is [*Decay or defeat ? : an inquiry into the Portuguese decline in Asia 1580-1645*](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/15783) by Ernst van Veen, who analyzed the Portuguese and Dutch voyages of around year 1600. I can't recommend this article enough for anybody who wants raw number analysis.  To sum up: the Middle East route was expensive. Many middle men, many transfers of cargo on different means of transport, not least of all land transport via caravans, on top of all duties, taxes and customs of numerous borders, as well as personal cuts of all the parties involved made the spices really expensive by the time they reached Europe. In contrast a ship buying at the source and selling at the same prices as these Middle Eastern prices could basically keep it all this profit and expenses for itself (minus the expenses of the trip itself, which was not as gigantic as you might think). With the amounts of spices arriving in thousands of tons, this would pay itself.   Still it was actually a close race (as evidenced that 16th century revival of the overland route) not least due to Portuguese keeping a high price of peppers to maximize their earning, and the Europeans making the Cape Route did not count only on the economic and financial viability of the route to give them advantage, but effectively used force to control the areas of production and monopolize it and prevent competition. They weren't completely successful in it to be perfectly honest. Especially the Portuguese, but stacked together and more and more Europeans joining in the ocean route, the grip was tightening. And when the Dutch finally dumped prices in late 17th century and flooded the market with quantity, the overland route became unprofitable and unviable	1643016177.0	hu00e5j	t3_sbfuea	t3_sbfuea	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbfuea/why_did_europeans_take_over_the_indian_spice/hu00e5j/
8antg3zz	>And I should word myself better about Gamsakhurdia: while he didn't directly cause the Ossetians to want to leave (they obviously were looking for an out before), his remarks (or supposed remarks, as I mentioned) only made things worse, as did his later actions. He was really not the best option to lead a newly-independent Georgia, and I do have to wonder what could have happened had Kostava not died before then.  Nothing would change, as Russia repeatedly threatened Georgia during that period.  The Georgian army was bombed several times, and Yeltsin also threatened Shevardnadze or Gamsakhurdia (I do not remember which one) to bomb Tbilisi if they invaded South Ossetia.  South Ossetia is strategically important for Russia because it is very close to Tbilisi.	1643016797.0	hu014h1	t3_s68982	t1_htytzdm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s68982/after_the_fall_of_the_ussr_why_have_armenia_and/hu014h1/

6hr4g	Given that the "alt right" movements like AfD fare well in Eastern Germany and that Confederate imagery is fairly common in modern alt-right imagery, do you think that the lack of self-admitted link might be due to self-censorship?  Another possible reason for the difference in perception between the treatment of natives and that of blacks in Western / Civil War settings could be that they can identify better with the "natives" being overwhelmed by invaders. By contrast, "blacks" would by seen by those alt-right east Germans as similar to the Middle-Eastern immigrants coming to Europe?	1643017012.0	hu01dqc	t3_savz63	t1_htwpzgg	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu01dqc/

nxyvc	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643018142.0	hu02px1	t3_sbhwli	t3_sbhwli	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbhwli/how_did_debatespeech_play_a_part_in_diplomacy_and/hu02px1/

Was the average citizen explicitly aware that Nazis were antisemites? If so, did they agree with it? If so, to what extent? Did they want or expect anything close to outright ethnic cleansing, or was the expectation maybe more in line with Jim Crow laws?

nxyvc	Since this question obviously isn't about the advent of names or individual identities but about the use of writing to record them, the real question you're asking is one of documents: What is the oldest piece of writing to include a human name?  Inevitably the answer is going to fluctuate based on how we date pieces of writing and whether a particular label should be seen as a name. You can see in the Kushim article that there is some debate over whether Kushim is actually a name or just a title of office (imagine archaeologists of the distant future asserting that the earliest recorded human name is "Manager"). There is more agreement on Iry-Hor (32nd century BC), as u/kookingpot explains in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3gsvqn/i_recently_read_a_quote_saying_people_die_twice/cu170wv/).	1643021581.0	hu06xiu	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htwhnta	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu06xiu/

4dsoyqkx	Not a Historian but a resident with a fable for local history here.   The site where the Cathedral stands now has had a church standing there since at least 812, possibly longer back to the 5th century. The impetus for starting to build the gothic Cathedral we are now familiar with came when the Archbishop of Cologne in 1164 managed to transfer the bones of the Magi, the three wise kings of the east from the story of christs birth, to Cologne from Milan.   The Cathedral is not the only building in the city that is related to the event by the way , several archways were constructed on the way that the reliquary was carried, i know of at least one still visible today.   Anyway, the presence of the bones lead to a massive influx of pilgrim, Cologne became what we call a "Wallfarhtsort", a holy site that is a destination for pilgrim. The old dhurch from the 8th century proved insufficient for the masses, and in 1248 the foundation was laid for the current building. Progress was financed by donations from locals and the revenue that the pilgrim created.   Progress was very slow, but not unusually so by the standarts of the time. The first parts to be completed were the choir facing the Rhine that houses the reliquary. and the central cross area. I hope someone else can fill in exact details why progress eventually stopped (I suspect it was loss of fervor because progress literally took decades, + the advent of the reformation). But in the the early 16th century work was stopped and the towers were left unfinished with a crane on top.   That crane by the way became a symbol of the city, you will see it on a lot of graphics and pictures from the time, we even have a local saying the the apocalypse will come when the Cathedral is finished.   Construction resumed because Cologne became part of a wealthy new power looking for a prestige project, Prussia. in 1842 Wilhelm Frederick the 4th restarted the project officially. Which was supposed to serve as a symbol of national unity. Important to note that by that point Restoration work and training of a new generation of stoneworkers had gone on since the end of the french occupation in1812. Afterwards it still took 40 years to complete the Cathedral. An important new technology was the use of Steel to build the girder structure for the roof. This prevented the Cathedral from burning down when it was bombed in the second world war.  The building is still not finished today. Attached to it is a place called the "Dombauhütte", a workshop for the Masons that still constantly duplicate and replace parts of the Stonework because of environmental damage. Interestingly the Cathedral used to be white yellowish in colour. The black we are familiar with is the result from it standing next to the central station and decades of coal smoke and environmental polution.	1643022238.0	hu07rn7	t3_saxaeo	t3_saxaeo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saxaeo/generations_of_workers_spent_312_years_building/hu07rn7/
l6to6	My comment will be based purely on linguistics, so this may not be what you are looking for, it still answers your question in a certain way, but not fully.  Both Celtic and Germanic languages are part of Indo-European languages, like most other languages in Europe are. Inside the Indo-European family, different language subdivisions hold different proximity to eachother. For example Baltic and Slavic languages are closer to each other than for example Germanic and Celtic, which is deducted by similarities between the languages, and archeological evidence where possible. By following different languages through time, and looking at new inventions, we find out approximately when a language group split off into two. According to Chang, Will; Chundra, Cathcart (2015) article, Germanic languages split of from Italo-Celtic first, followed later by the split of Italo-Celtic a few centuries later. Another article from 2013 groups Balto-Slavic as the closest group to Germanic, and Italo-Celtic as the second closest. (Also do note that Italo-Celtic has a history of going in and out of favour with linguists and there is no consensus of its existence). I haven't seen a modern study that would link Celtic and Germanic as the closest relatives of each other, and none that would put Germanic as a "descendant" of Celtic, as consensus is, that Germanic languages emerged before Celtic ones.  So to answer your question: no, Germanic people are not descendents of Celtic people, atleast not linguistically. There might be generic evidence that show a different picture (Celts assimilating into Germanic), or there might be archeological evidence that show relation between the people that would explain the possible incorporation of Celtic gods into Germanic pantheon, be it with trade, war or some other way. There are many cases in history where foreign gods got incorporated into new religions, so that might be the answer you are looking for.	1643022262.0	hu07sso	t3_sb6ppa	t3_sb6ppa	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb6ppa/were_the_celts_and_the_germanic_peoples_related/hu07sso/

nxyvc	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding.

dg00c	> He took part in the Munich Council Republic in 1919 where he even became a Councilor himself  This is somewhat true but it's important to be clear what this means. Hitler continued to serve as a soldier throughout the Republic, from when he returned to Munich from Traunstein in February 1919, to when the Republic collapsed at the end of April 1919. He was stationed in the Second Infantry Regiment's Second Demobilization Company. He was not a politician at this point, and had no involvement in Munich government politics.  However, within the army, Hitler did get elected to serve as a representative of his fellow soldiers. He was elected at some time prior to April by the soldiers of his company to serve as their *Vertrauensmann* (Soldier's representative). This was a minor position which was intended to facilitate the smooth running of the regiment.    On April 15 Hitler stood for the *Bataillons‐Rat* (Batallion Councillor) elections and was elected by his company as *Ersatz‐Bataillons‐Rat* (Deputy Batallion Councillor). This again was a soldiers council, not part of the Munich Council. He acted as his company's deputy representative on the council of their Batallion. While technically this can be said to have give him a position of influence within the Munich regime, it was a very minor position, and any influence or authority he had was exclusively within his own military unit. This lasted until the Freikorps arrested him on May 1st as they invaded the city.  >as soon as the Freikorps came in at Mai of that year he pretty much denounced all of his comrades in an instance in order to save his own neck. And career. The Reichswehr pretty much paid him as well for being a contact (known in German as "V-Mann") among the Socialists in the Council Republic  After being released, on May 19th Hitler, in an effort to stay in the Army as his current batalion was being disbanded, volunteered to serve on the 'Investigation and Decommissioning Board' of the Second Infantry Regiment. He did inform on the men of his old company, and used his knowledge as his company's old V-Mann or *Vertrauensmann* and *Ersatz‐Bataillons‐Rat* to provide informaiton to the board about his old comrades political leanings. But he had been transfered out of his old company at this point, and so wasn't a spy within their ranks.	1643023048.0	hu08tlb	t3_sbczey	t1_htzzrbw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu08tlb/

e49gp06y	Sorry, by Wilhelm III I mean Crown Prince Wilhelm the son of Wilhelm II. He is the very reason the Hohenzollern won't get their former property back because it was proven by a very in depth and detailed assessment in Germany that the Crown Prince was substantially supporting and aiding the Nazis to their rise to power. Including financially. I can give you a links to all four assessments but I'm afraid they are all in German\^\^   And, yes, sorry. Thyssen. Little typo there. And, yup, that is that very Thyssen. There are many big German Industrialists who supported the Nazis. Even if a lot were hesitant and only got more cozy with the Nazis after 1933.	1643023492.0	hu09f1j	t3_sbczey	t1_hu048i9	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu09f1j/

e49gp06y	Oh absolutely. The best example of that wouldn't even be Germany however but rather the USA. The successful Revolution and the subsequent Takeover of the Bolsheviki just added even more to that. Especially in Germany which already saw it's own Revolution in 1918 and 1919 which, however, failed even if the Communists and Socialists didn't really give up on it until much later. The KPD remained a very prominent Party in the Reichstag and had pretty consistently good turnouts and results.	1643024117.0	hu0a992	t3_sbczey	t1_hu018jo	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0a992/

e49gp06y	A Meeting held by the (back then) "DAP" (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei) on February 24th 1920 in the "Hofbräuhaus" in Munich decided two very important things. First of all that they would be renamed into NSDAP and second of all their new electoral program called the "25-Point-Program".   Point 4 in this Program reads:   "Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently, no Jew can be a member of the race."  Points 5-8 don't make the point much better because they very much talk about Jews because of the precedent set in point 4. So in a way the NSDAP was clearly motivated and influenced by Antisemitism from the very moment on it even became the NSDAP. After that there are a multitude of speeches Hitler held in the Hofbräuhaus and elsewhere which make his intentions towards Jews clear beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Well as you can see the intentions of the NSDAP were very obvious and very clear for everybody to see. In addition you have "Mein Kampf" in 1925 which makes this issue even clearer. Everybody who supported the Nazis had every opportunity to know exactly what the Nazis stood for. Even in the 1920's you had to have looked away very deliberately already to not notice the Nazi's antisemitism.    Considering that Antisemitism was an extremely widespread issue at the time I'd say people who supported them agreed with that very much. It's nothing that can be empirically proven of course. Especially because many just lied about it after the war or actually because disillusioned.   Segregation was already a given with the 25-Points-Program but point 8 made an even more definitive statement:   "8. Any further immigration of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since the 2 August 1914, be forced immediately to leave the Reich."    The implication of the first stages of an ethnic cleansing can already be seen in this. Further there are the speeches of Hitler himself which give an even clearer indication. Quote:   "We don't want to be sentimental anti-Semites who want to create a pogrom mood, rather we are inspired by the unrelenting determination to get to the root of the evil and eradicate it root and branch. In order to reach our goal, we must use any means, even if we have to associate with the devil."   Speech held on April 6th 1920  In a Letter to Konstantin Hierl, Hitler wrote on the 3rd of Juli 1920:    "As little as I can blame a tubercle bacterium for an activity that means destruction for people but means life for them, I am also compelled and entitled to fight tuberculosis for the sake of my personal existence by destroying its pathogen. The Jew, however, has become the racial tuberculosis of the people through thousands of years. To fight it means to remove it."  Granted nobody could read that letter but it's not like Hitler held anything of this back in his speeches as can be seen in the first quote. The NSDAP arguably grew bolder in their actions and words against the jewish population but something amounting to an ethnic cleansing was definitely foreseeable.  "Did the party have much support among voters who weren't antisemitic but overlooked the antisemitic rhetoric to prioritize other parts of their platform?"   It's hard to make a definite statement on how many percent of NSDAP-Voters or Supporters were Antisemites and how many were not since most people would've simply lied about having ever supported the NSDAP at a time where this question could've been asked and incorporated into a study. And even if they said to have voted for the NSDAP, they would've never admitted to being an Antisemite.    However...   I would say for absolutely sure that there were many people all too willing to overlook this blatant Antisemitism simply for their own goals. After all there were organizations made up of Jews who actually supported Hitler and the NSDAP.	1643026645.0	hu0dx1o	t3_sbczey	t1_hu04b06	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0dx1o/

e49gp06y	Yup. He was pressured multiple times by members of his family to start an apprenticeship. He was even offered one as a Screen Painter for Theaters by Alfred Roller but he refused because he understood himself as an Artist and didn't want to do "Bread-Work" since he felt it was beneath him. He lied to his own family about it multiple times in order to keep receiving the orphan's pension which otherwise would've gone towards his Sister Paula.   On that note I suggest "Hitler's Vienna" by Brigitte Hamann.

88vwr8h8	The Sykes-Picot Agreement (1916) was a treaty signed between France and Britain, in the midst of the First World War, to essentially agree on which nation would take control of what, *when* the Ottomans conceded defeat. The agreement resolved that Britain would be given control of the area which today includes Israel, Palestine, Jordan and southern Iraq. While France would control the area. which today includes Syria, Lebanon and northern Iraq.  I think you are conflating the Paris Peace Conference (1919-1920) with the Treaty of Versailles, which was only one of several treaties signed at the conference. The Treaty of Versailles was specifically the peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the German Empire. It was also at the Paris Peace Conference that the League of Nations was established, which was succeeded by the United Nations in 1946.  Also signed at the Paris Peace Conference was the Treaty of Sèvres (the terms of which were also discussed at the 1920 Conference of London), between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire. This treaty ceded Ottoman land in the Levant to the Allied Powers, but was never ratified.  The parts of the Treaty of Sévres dealing with the Levant were essentially incorporated into the later Treaty of Lausanne, agreed between The Allies and the Ottomans following the Turkish War of Independence. The Treaty of Lausanne was ratified in 1923, and came into force in 1924.  It was at the San Remo conference (1920) that a final partition of the previously Ottoman-controlled Levant was agreed by the Allies, broadly along the lines agreed between Britain and France in the Sykes-Picot Agreement.  This is an extremely dense and complicated topic, dealing with numerous national aspirations, and many international conferences, peace treaties and other agreements. My answer is therefore painted with fairly broad strokes.  But, one of the key distinctions to note is that the Sykes-Picot agreement was basically a ‘private’ arrangement between Britain and France, with some oversight by Italy and Russia. Whereas San Remo was a League of Nations conference, which passed a League of Nations resolution.  Just as two nations today could make an agreement with one-another behind closed doors, this is not the same as having the terms of this agreement passed as a resolution by the UN.	1643028669.0	hu0h7o6	t3_sa9mb7	t3_sa9mb7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sa9mb7/what_did_the_treaty_of_versailles_do_to_the/hu0h7o6/

Suzdal, at the time more important than what would be Moscow, was also damaged, but maintained its relevance as the capital of a rump principality (Vladimir-Suzdal) after Kievan Rus fell apart. Vladimir-Suzdal, in turn, broke up to several pieces.  In general, what was left of important cities ended up becoming the capitals of principalities; like Smolensk, Chernigov, Polotsk, Halych-Volhynia (these ended up under Lithuania/Poland and so were not in a position to challenge Muscovy).  So not only did eastern centers get dealt worse hands during the Mongol Invasions, they were subjugated by Poles and Lithuanians.	1643029223.0	hu0i69n	t3_s8r5cx	t1_hty96x3	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5cx/out_of_the_all_the_various_rus_princedoms_why_was/hu0i69n/

Are you able to tell me if this "preservation of life" is the basis of the (and I think I am right here) reason that Chief Rabbi of the UK made it clear that, for the duration of WW2, jewish people were allowed to eat pork products?  *^(All I know about this is from a bit of oral history from a local lady, who told me about her two little evacuees from London. She and her husband had a pig farm and the two sad, little waifs she had collected turned out to be jewish. She wrote to the nearest synagog to ask what rules they, a non jewish couple, should abide by for the sake of "their two boys" and was told that she should just raise them as they were her own for the duration of the war. They decided the children should read the old testament on Saturdays and then went to Methodist Sunday school whilst she and her husband went to chapel!

yfege	A topic I'm always delighted to write about! I've answered similar questions about American schools so I'll be pulling from those answers. To the second part of your question, public education in the 1910s was fairly chaotic in general, especially in the American south. The first few decades of the 20th century saw the convergence of a number of policy and funding shifts that would eventually lead to the modern structure of tax-payer funded school districts and the expectation that children would spend their day in the company of other children, under the supervision of adults they weren't related to. These shifts included the passage of anti-child labor laws as compulsory school attendance laws moved from being laws in theory to laws in practice, the merger of schoolhouses into school districts with attendance boundaries, and the creation of funding structures that linked a school's budget to the count of children attending the school. It's possible some schools elected to hold children back a grade but generally speaking, grade retention was fairly uncommon and students moved through all 8 years (kindergarten was only just beginning to take shape and a high school diploma wasn't yet an essential criteria for adulthood) fairly unencumbered.   These shifts, plus the solidification of the modern liberal arts curriculum, happened across the country at difference rates and meant that what happened at school (or college) during the Spanish Flu was highly, highly dependent on local context.  First, to colleges. From an older response:   > One thing to establish is that in 1918, attending college was a fairly uncommon event in a young person's life. According to the [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf), there were 1,041 designated institutions of higher education in 1918. By 1992, there were 3600. Also according to NCES, 3.4% of 18 to 24-year-olds were enrolled in college in 1917-1918, 4.7% in 1918-1919. By 1991, the percentage was up to 51% (but also, in 1990, 44% of enrolled students were over the age of 24.) In contrast, there were hundreds, if not thousands of schools in some cities and states as districts were only just beginning to merge. >  > In addition, Fall semester of American colleges doesn't nearly track onto the Fall months. Many colleges of the era started in mid to late-August and ended after Thanksgiving or in mid-December, meaning young people arrived during a lull in the pandemic while others were attending college near where they lived. It's safe to say everything that happened at universities during the pandemic was fairly idiosyncratic. However, we can see a few patterns and it looks like most colleges made the call to quarantine sick students, require masks, and teach outdoors when possible. >  > Genevive Carlton did a nice round-up [here](https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/higher-education-and-pandemics/) of different moves at different colleges. Her findings are interesting and speak to what was happening around the country: >  > [Stanford was hit hard](https://news.stanford.edu/thedish/2018/03/15/100-years-ago-the-spanish-flu-hit-the-stanford-campus/) by World War I, which impacted how the college operated > University of Montana held classes in the open > [University of North Carolina](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/03/spanish-flu-1918-0317) went into lockdown and quarantined as many students as possible, with limited success > "[At Elon College](https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2020/03/24/weve-been-here-before-elon-the-spanish-flu-of-1918/), the influenza epidemic struck in mere days, spreading to 75% of the students. With no time to close campus, the college transformed its gym into a makeshift infirmary, with healthy students nursing those who fell ill." > One thing that I think can't be separated from the pandemic is the impact of World War I on student populations. It looks like there was a policy for closing schools due to Student Army Training Corp activities, concurrent to the flu so it's possible there were schools that closed for the activities, which helped reduce the spread. >  > From the *K-State Collegian* on Oct. 18, 1918: >  > > The Aggie football schedule has been interrupted to quite an extent due to the epidemic of the Spanish influenza. The Aggies have been unable to carry out their schedule this season, because of the orders of military authorities, which forbade teams in a valley school where there is an [Student Army Training Corp training] to leave their school for more than a day. The closing of the schools throughout the valley has likewise made it impossible to schedule games with teams within one day‘s traveling distances. > >  > > It had been planned by Coach Clevenger to have Kansas University here this Saturday for a game, but the closing of the school made it necessary to cancel this game. It is currently being planned to schedule a game for a week from Saturday here with either Kansas University, the Haskell Indians or Washburn. A page from the 1918-1919 Royal Purple Yearbook about the "Big Five" - the players expected to lead the team for the season limited by the formation of the Student Army Training Corp and eventually, the Spanish flu epidemic. >  > Only one Aggie starter has been in the hospital, and it was reported this afternoon that is was fullback Azel Husted. Husted has been quite ill during the past week, but is now starting to improve and is expected to be out of the hospital within the next few days.  With regards to K-12 schools, a lot came down to teachers' health but again, each school/district/city handled it a little bit differently. Boston stayed open, NYC closed. Meanwhile, I found multiple instances of short notices in local papers announcing that school would reopen or had reopened following the Christmas holiday because the teacher no longer had the flu. One listing read simply:  > Centennial school in Hamilton township opened on Monday. The teacher, Miss Minnie Coble, has recovered from the flu.  Most of the re-opening notices that I found appeared to be clustered around January, 1919 but there were multiple instances where a school announced re-opening in the Fall of 1918 after a short closing and a second re-opening announcement appeared in December 1918 or early 1919.  Some schools did try to stay open during the pandemic but faced resistance from teachers. In November 1918 while the Anne Arundel County (Annapolis, Maryland) County Health Advisor was announcing that schools were going to open, a group of teachers in Pennsylvania refused to go to work as some of their colleagues had gone to a conference and contracted the flu. By August and September 1919, Spanish Flu had pretty much burned itself out and schools opened normally.  [In this longer answer,](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fcxn1q/how_did_american_schools_handle_outbreaks_of_the/fjgxcfn/) I get into more about cleaning routines and procedures but one thing that's worth stressing is that part of the responding to the Spanish Flu was responding to the deaths of hundreds of children. From the piece:  > To us in the modern era, it can be overwhelming to look at the statistics around the Spanish Flu (195,000 American deaths in just October 1918) and have difficulty connecting to the human impact. While looking for articles about schools' responses to the Spanish Flu, I came across dozens of funeral notices in local papers for children who died, even some from families that lost multiple children in one week or day. School can sometimes feel like an impersonal space but those notices serve as a reminder that the adults working in them have long tried to do what they feel is best for the children they're responsible for, making the best decisions they can with the information they have.  Although there's limited evidence of specific day to day practices in schools of the era, we do know that teachers had to deal with the losses and help their students through that loss.	1643030713.0	hu0kw7h	t3_sbauq0	t3_sbauq0	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbauq0/how_was_education_k12_or_college_impacted_during/hu0kw7h/
pbs83	> Were families of WWII soldiers who were designated MIA or POW paid their salary?  Yes. Public Law 77-490, popularly known as the "Missing Persons Act," was passed by Congress on 7 March 1942. Sections 2 and 3 provided that any service member listed as missing in service, missing in action (combat), interned in a neutral country, or held as a prisoner of war, would have base pay, allowances, and allotments of pay to dependents continued from the point of their absence. Proper authorities were permitted "for the well-being and protection of dependents of persons in active service" to unilaterally adjust allotments of pay to dependents, "subject in all cases" to termination only by request of the absent person. If a person was absent without proper authority, they would be indebted to the U.S. government for the funds accrued during their absence.  > SEC. 2. Any person who is in active service and is officially reported as missing, missing in action, interned in a neutral country, or captured by an enemy shall, while so absent, be entitled to receive or to have credited to his account the same pay and allowances to which such person was entitled at the time of the beginning of the absence or may become entitled to thereafter:   > *Provided*, That such person shall not have been officially reported as having been absent from his post of duty without authority:   > *Provided further*, That expiration of the agreed term of service during the period of such absence shall not operate to terminate the right to receive such pay and allowances:  >  *And provided further*, That should proper authority subsequently determine that the person concerned had been absent from his post of duty without authority, such person shall be indebted to the Government in the amount for which payments have been made or pay and allowances credited to his account in accordance with the provisions of this Act during such absence.  > SEC. 3. Any person entitled under section 2 of this Act to receive pay and allowances, and who has made an allotment of pay for the support of dependents or for the payment of insurance premiums, shall be entitled to have such allotments for dependents or insurance premiums as he previously may have executed continued for a period of twelve months from date of commencement of absence, notwithstanding that the period for which the allotments had been executed may have expired during such twelve months' period, and the proper disbursing officer shall so continue the allotments during such absence:   > *Provided*, That in the absence of a previously executed allotment, or where the allotment made is not sufficient for reasonable support of a dependent and for the payment of insurance premiums, the head of the department concerned may direct that an allotment not to exceed the base pay, plus longevity of the person concerned, shall be paid by the appropriate disbursing officer to the insurer or such dependent as has been designated in official records or, in the absence of such designation, to such person as may be determined by the head of the department concerned, or by such person as he may designate, to be a bona fide dependent within the meaning of section 1 (c):   > *Provided further*, That for the initial period of six months, unless prior decision as to status is made, a monthly allotment for support of such dependent shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the monthly base pay, plus longevity, without regard to the fact that the six months' death gratuity may be paid later:   > *Provided further*, That at the expiration of the initial six months' period, no further decision having been made as to status, the payment as heretofore provided shall continue for an additional period not to exceed six months; any payment paid to a dependent for a period subsequent to date of death, if death occurred subsequent to the expiration of the first six months' period, shall be deducted from the six months' gratuity:   > *Provided further*, That the premiums on insurance issued on the life of the person paid by the Government subsequent to the declared date of death and unearned shall revert to the appropriations of the department concerned:   > *And provided further*, That the total of all payments made under this section, including those for insurance premiums, shall not exceed the total pay and longevity pay due.	1643030810.0	hu0l2v0	t3_saxumz	t3_saxumz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/saxumz/were_families_of_wwii_soldiers_who_were/hu0l2v0/

9x5qn2xl	Christianity very much did spread to Britain. The council of Arles in 314, was attended by three British bishops, representing British communities. We are not certain if there was British bishops in the council of Nicaea called by Constantine, but we know there were British bishops in the Council of Serdica in 345 and Council of Arminium in 359. Britain even managed to produce its own unique Christian heresy called Pelagianism that was very popular within Britain and led Saint Augustine to spend some of his time refuting, so it can be assumed that Christianity was well-established in Britain.   However, Britain was unique in one regard. It was invaded by barbarians that didn’t immediately convert to Christianity. Goths, Franks, Vandals, Burgundians, Suebi, lombards etc converted to Christianity almost immediately upon entering the Roman Empire or even before they entered Roman Empire although many largely converted to the Arian variety Christianity. Either way, the Roman Christian writers never referred to the Goths as being ‘pagans’. Instead Goths were always branded as heretics by Christian Roman writers. For instance, the Roman Christian writer Orosius writes with extreme hostility in the early 5th century that:  >“The Goths had petitioned through ambassadors that bishops be sent to them from whom they might learn the rule of the Christian faith. In fatal perverseness the emperor Valens sent teachers of the Arian doctrine, and the Goths continued to believe what they first learned concerning the basic principles of the faith. Therefore, by the just judgment of God Himself, Valens was burned alive by the very men who, through his action, will burn hereafter for their heresy.”      On the other hand, the sources we have that come from Romano-British writers refers to the Anglo-Saxon invaders as being unquestionably ‘pagan’ of course. This is strongly emphasised by the British priest Gildas, so when he extorts the western British lords to drive back the Anglo-Saxon invaders, he does so by referring to the invaders as being pagan. This is clearly an appeal made to what is presumed to be a largely Christian audience (the lords of western Britain), so we can assume upper echelons would have been Christianised by the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions.    But why didn’t Anglo-Saxons immediately convert to Christianity like other Barbarians? It can’t be said with any certainty, but it might simply because no one had bothered to convert them until Pope Gregory sent missionaries. The Goths were likely converted by a combination of the Arian missionary Ulfilas and Emperor Valens. The other Germanic tribes were converted by the Goths. The Goths showed a markedly greater missionary fervour in the 5th century than the Roman Catholics  and successfully sent missionaries to a number of pagan Germanic tribes to convert to Arian Christianity. For instance in the 5th century, the Visigothic king, Theodoric II, successfully sent the missionary Ajax to convert the Suevi to Arianism.   On the other hand, Roman Catholics were rarely interested in converting non-Roman citizens to their Christianity, especially those living outside of the empire. Although the Goths heretical tendencies were regarded with some hostility, it was also regarded with some relief by the Romans as it differentiated them religiously from the Barbarians and helped to draw a divide. The exception being Franks who converted to Catholic Christianity to gain vital support from the Gauls against the Arian Goths after the western Roman Empire had already fallen.   So Roman Catholics for most of the 4th and 5th century were largely uninterested in converting non-Romans. It was only in the 6th century that Catholic missionary activity picked up, which is why you have St. Gregory sending missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons. The 8th century Anglo-Saxon writer Bede records that the ‘Britons’ (that is the Welsh) always remained Christian, but speaks contemptuously of them because of their past refusal to convert Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.  Bede writes:   >“Among the other unspeakable crimes, recorded with sorrow by their own historian Gildas, they added this – that they never preached the Faith to the Saxons or Angles who dwelt with them in Britain. But God in his goodness did not utterly abandon the people whom he had chosen; for he remembered them, and sent this nation more worthy preachers of truth to bring them to the Faith.”  Welsh bishops were even asked by one of St. Gregory’s missionary named Augustine to help them convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity, but they refused.   Therefore, Christianity was certain widespread in Britain by the 4th and 5th century and the Britons remained Christian (the unconquered western parts that is now known as well Wales at least) throughout Anglo-Saxon domination of Britain. The Anglo-Saxons likely remained pagan for almost two centuries due to a lack of Catholic missionary zeal and the fact that Christian welsh (the Christians closest to them) were extremely hostile to Anglo-Saxons and had no desire to convert them to Christianity as pointed out by Bede.

yfege	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643033146.0	hu0pr9y	t3_sblxe2	t3_sblxe2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sblxe2/what_are_some_recent/hu0pr9y/
yfege	Hi there - we're happy to approve your question related to your creative project, and we are happy for people to answer. However, we should warn you that many flairs have become reluctant to answer questions for aspiring novelists and the like, based on past experience: some people working on creative projects have a tendency to try to pump historians for trivia while ignoring the bigger points they were making, while others have a tendency to argue with historians when the historical reality does not line up with what's needed for a particular scene or characterization. Please respect the answers of people who have generously given you their time, even if it's not always what you want to hear.     Additionally, as amazing as our flair panel is, we should also point out that /r/AskHistorians is not a professional historical consultation service. If you're asking a question here because you need vital research for a future commercial product such as a historical novel, you may be better off engaging a historical consultant at a fair hourly rate to answer these questions for you. We don't know what the going rate for consultancy work would be in your locality, but it may be worth looking into that if you have in-depth or highly plot-reliant questions for this project. Some /r/AskHistorians flairs could be receptive to working as a consultant in this way.

Was antisemitism already a growing popular thing he just latched onto? Did something happen to him previously?   Was the holocaust a byproduct of the war or did Hitler take the war full scale in an attempt to completely eradicate the Jewish people/create a master German race?

As a young Metis person this seemed very strange but cool as well - these guys had been to Dakota communities, and some looked the part even. It was trippy.

wnefu	Interestingly while this general dispensation is part of my Jewish wife’s oral history, all the searches I’ve done for it are to secondary sources which simply accept it as true. This source: http://www.jewishmag.com/136mag/uk_rationing/uk_rationing.htm#FOOTNOTE%2011 seems to indicate that a general dispensation from The Chief Rabbi never happened. My wife’s grandmother once told me that their family rabbi had told her that while they were evacuated, they should eat whatever was given to them and I imagine that many other such conversations must have happened.	1643035713.0	hu0veoq	t3_sautz9	t1_hu0rb9t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sautz9/when_insulin_first_became_available_it_was_made/hu0veoq/
2fnid1f1	Whilie I can't answer the second part of your question, I can shed some light on the first.   To understand Hitler's own individual antisemitism and the antisemitism the Nazi's espoused, you have to take a look at the broader German/Austrian, and European context. Western Europe, at this time, was a pretty antisemitic place, and it had been in various forms for centuries. While the earlier antisemitism (during the pre-modern times) was mainly religious and xenophobic in nature, the 19th century saw the rise of so-called "scientific antisemitism", which sought to explain and proof these firmly rooted beliefs with a combination of history, biology and other (social) siences. While these beliefs were by no means exclusive to Austria, by the turn of the century, and certainly after the First World War, Vienna and other cities in the South-German space became a true hotbed for this new antisemitism, were at became an almost legitimate, albeit fringe, political stance, with a lot of parties, clubs, and various political movements dedicated in some way, shape or form to it. They often combined anti-semitic tought with radical nationalism, and what was know as the 'völkischer' tought, which focused on the 'Volk', the People, the ethnic tribe if you will. This is the context in which rise of  the NSDAP as a party and Hitler needs to be seen.  Being anti-jew was a main propaganda point for both the party and Hitler, but I wouldn't say they latched on to a thing growing in popularity. They were a biproduct of something that already was very, very popular.   Given this context, it is very possible Hitler did actually believe that the jewish people were a scroun in Europe, and while he maybe did not believe the old myths about jewish people (cannibalism, disecrating holy objects, poisining wells,...) he almost certainly believed that Jews were, as a people, less to the Germans/Europeans. This was ofcourse combined with the more modern  theories about the larger Jewish conspiracy in the banks, media world, literature and culture, which ties in to the whole back stab theory about the First World War. There is (some) biographical proof about the development of Hitlers toughts and his slow radicalisation from a standard right-wing nationalist into something much more extreme, but the difficulty with this is that most of it is based on statements made after the war by personal friends and accquintances, who are always serving some sort of agenda. It is fair to assume he was, and had been, an antisemite long before he saw the political oppurtunity of it, because lots of accounts, including his own, talk about this. Also, as stated before, this wouldnt've been a weird or unseen stance in Bavaria at the time.   Lastly, I personally think it's rather dangerous to place the source on something "happening" to Hitler, thus causing his beliefs. There is, ofcourse, no compelling evidence that he ever would have had such a horrible experience with a presumed Jewish person that it would cause him to hate them all. This places the burden of what has happened solely on him, while the horrible events of the Holocaust and the Second World War are a result of a lot of political and historic factors. It's far to easy to just blame it on the mad-man Adolf.   Evidence about the source of Hitler's own beliefs is very hard to find, but in Ian Kershaw's biography about Hitler there is a fair bit dedicated to it. I'd recommend it if you really want to dive deeper into this subject.	1643035739.0	hu0vgth	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0qcsj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu0vgth/

7xgnjo	Once again the flakeyness of the comment editor means I lose a fair bit of response for reasons I can't quite fathom. If there's something weird going on in the post it's because am trying to copy/paste into it and I don't know what it's doing.  In short, the ability to sneak around with cavalry was rather limited, especially in the context of jumping on artillery. Cannon were not deployed behind your battle lines, but actually more likely in front of them.The majority of artillery tended to be deployed front and centre for the simple reason that your troops will be rather unwilling to be the first to be hit by a cannonball ploughing through their backs on their path toward the enemy. Cannon can't shoot over your own troops unless they are physically placed above them. Or so far back that the cannon will be severely limited in range and there will still be friendly fire incidents. Cannon ranges are fairly modest as things go. We are deep into the 1800s before we get effective howitzers and they only really come into their own in the 1900s which solves the range and direct fire problem of artillery. Effectively all modern artillery are howitzers and not cannon. The solution to this dilemma of course is to park cannons on a hill or other elevated position, but there is no guarantee you will be able to pick your battlefield. The other issue is that artillery for most of the period wasn't easily moved so if there is too much moving around you might no longer have placed the cannon in a position they could be effectively used. This means there is a lot of jockeying about where a battle will take place and often if you found too good a spot the enemy simply chose to not engage you. Furthermore, as your cannon require good line of sight to fire, their placement tends to be in spots that aren't easily approached without being seen in return. The other side of the coins is that cannons can't easily be moved. So there are battles where cannon change hands several times, even being used by both sides, durign the course of the battle.Another aspect is that until the 1800s battlefields are fairly limited in scope, communications and armysizes simply didn't allow too much spreading around or you risk losing control of your forces. With few accurate maps and no GPS it's not easy to actually sneak around. Coordination wasn't easy in the best of times and successful cavalry actions has several times turned victory into defeat when cavalrytroops follow the enemy off the field or end up looting the baggage train. Basically letting your cavalry off the leash too much risks them not being where they are needed. You normally do not want your cavalry to be "behind enemy lines" because that's not where the enemy cavarly is and the end result may be that you are losing the battle due to not having cavarly of your own, especailly in the 1600-1700s where the side whose cavalry prevailed in the (usual) cavalry battle on the wings of the battleline could then destroy the enemy infantry centre at leisure.Sometimes it worked though, in the battle of Wittstock 1636 Swedish commander Banér had his left wing cavalry perform a long circuitous movement while the centre and right attacked with right hook movement that forced the Imperial army to redeploy. This let the Swedish left effectively sneak up on the Imperial  army and flank them. Amongst other things according to Montecuccoli capturing the Saxon artillery without it having fired a shot. However, they had had more trouble finding their way and only arrived in the nick of time when the right was about to break and the Swedish force suffered considerable causalities and could well have lost the battle had the flankers been delayed even an hour more or even less. Note that the Imperial artillery at this battle had originally been deployed centrally but ended up exposed as the battleline had to shift.As to the question of artillery guards, yes they existed, among the first troops to be issued non-matchlock muskets were the guards of the artillery train (due to the firehazards). But these troops aren't exactly numerous enough to stop a determined cavarly charge, their job was security from sabotage and during marches and camps. Being too close to artillery was dangerous, cannons could blow themselves up and there was a lot of gunpowder that could explode so you don't want too many troops too close to the artillery. The cannon themselves are more likely to stop cavalry using canister and grapeshot provided they can be handled in time. As you would deploy cannon fairly centrally to some degree the entire rest of your army was effectively the guards of the artillery. More so the further we go in history, few battles in the 1600s were decided majorly by cannon, but by the time of Napoleon they are becoming battle deciders, AFAIK. The amount of cannon used by armies increased substantially over time. At Breitenfel 1631 the Imperials had about a dozen guns of various caliber, at Nördlingen 1634 34 heavy guns and 116 light pieces.Finally, do note that the crew of the cannon could fairly easily escape. Cavalry might not be able to take their time to properly spike the cannon (and that means literally driving spikes into the fireinghole to render them useless for the battle) and of course you might not want to if you are expecting to win the battle and capture the cannon for yourself. There are many examples where the crew can re-man their cannon if only limitedly spiked, or indeed the enemy can use the captured cannon against their former owners like at Lützen in 1632.Rather than sneaking around the battlefield capturing cannon, the more likely actions was what the Light Brigade were famously tasked with in 1854 at Balaclava. To prevent the enemy from using a captured artillery emplacement. What they instead did was to frontally charge a well emplaced and protected different artillery battery with tragic consequences for the troops. Even so the light brigade did reach the cannon and scared the artillery men away. Temporarily. In other words it's quite possible to charge, successfully (or not), enemy cannon without sneaking at all.	1643038329.0	hu11olb	t3_sb8okf	t3_sb8okf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8okf/was_cavalry_often_used_to_sneak_back_behind_enemy/hu11olb/

n4bht	I'm not sure if "attack dog" is the best metaphor, but what you are talking about is essentially what I discussed in my paragraph about he Silent Majority. A [fairly good example is Agnew's famous speech on television](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/spiroagnewtvnewscoverage.htm) after a Nixon speech on Vietnam.  >The audience of 70 million Americans gathered to hear the President of the United States was inherited by a small band of network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed in one way or another their hostility to what he had to say.  This message was more effectively delivered from an outside source; if Nixon had complained in the same way about the response to his own speech it would come off as weaker.	1643038431.0	hu11xo3	t3_sb8hmj	t1_hu10cvf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8hmj/why_did_nixon_choose_agnew_in_1968/hu11xo3/

nxyvc	History is often relevant as a mirror for the present, but we are at pains to keep discussion of modern politics off our sub. When a question requires direct comparison with the present, the thread will inevitably be derailed by discussions of what things are like today and how it affects people, rather than focusing on the historical information that our experts can provide. It is more productive to ask about this in a more historical way, and draw your own conclusions about what that might mean for the present.  You're welcome to ask about the role of the media in the escalation of a particular historical conflict, or about the views of mass media *about* the start of wars in the 20th century, for example.	1643038850.0	hu12zhr	t3_sblk3w	t1_hu0k5op	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sblk3w/is_there_a_pattern_in_news_outlets_leading_up_to/hu12zhr/

5fhew	> That's where he got caught by the german police because he dodged Austrian military Service. So in the end he was pulled in anyway.  It was my understanding that he was eager to enlist in the German army for ideological reasons (he viewed himself as a German and detested the "multiculturalism" of Austria-Hungary). You seem to be implying that he resisted military service altogether.

pncvt	So, to be rather pedantic, there are photos of one emperor who reigned in the 19th century, albeit taken in the 20th: a French photographer for the periodical *L'Illustration* snapped the Guangxu Emperor disembarking from a sedan chair in 1908, the year before the emperor's death – you can see this photo on [page 21 of this PDF scan of the relevant publication](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/L%27illustration_19081121_a.pdf). Now, this photo was taken somewhat illicitly by what seems to have been a prototype paparazzo, so obviously wasn't a commissioned photographic portrait. Yet as you may be aware, a substantial number of Qing nobles and officials were photographed – [Zuo Zongtang](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Zuo_Zongtang_1875.jpg), [Prince Gong](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/%E6%81%AD%E4%BA%B2%E7%8E%8B%E5%A5%95%E8%A8%A2_Prince_Gong_Yi_Xin_%28AI_repair%29.jpg/1920px-%E6%81%AD%E4%BA%B2%E7%8E%8B%E5%A5%95%E8%A8%A2_Prince_Gong_Yi_Xin_%28AI_repair%29.jpg), and [Dowager Empress Cixi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/The_Ci-Xi_Imperial_Dowager_Empress_%285%29.JPG), to name a few; even the Guangxu Emperor's consorts, [Zhen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/%E5%85%89%E7%BB%AA%E7%8F%8D%E5%A6%83.jpg) and [Jin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/The_Imperial_Consort_Jin_in_her_old_days.jpg), were photographed. So why not the emperor himself?  This is something with no firm explanation: simply put, people tend to give more reasons for the few things they do, than the many things they don't. However, if we look at the history of Qing imperial portraiture, that of Qing court photography, and that of Qing coup attempts, we do get a few ideas as to why the Guangxu Emperor in particular seems to have gone unphotographed.  Imperial portraiture was always slightly symbolic, and never intended to depict the exact, actual appearance of the emperor at a given time. The face was generally left unchanged, but otherwise emperors were generally shown in peak bodily health and sometimes in exaggerated stature relative to their surroundings. Moreover, these portraits were primarily for use within the imperial clan, and especially the emperor himself; the image of the monarch was not really something for mass distribution in a way comparable to European monarchies. Photographs, then, didn't necessarily fulfil the functions that painted portraits did, at least not any better: they couldn't (yet) be 'brushed up' to emphasise the idealised self-image of the emperor, and their arguably greater reproducibility wasn't a particular draw either.  More importantly, perhaps, is the simple fact that photographs of imperial family members were generally taken at those people's behest. With the exception of Felix Beato's 1860 photograph of Prince Gong (which took place during the negotiations for the Convention of Peking that ended the Second Opium War), the photographs we have of the Xianfeng Emperor's brothers, Princes Gong and Chun, were taken without significant duress – indeed, Prince Chun, the Guangxu Emperor's father, was particularly photogenic and made a point to pose in casual dress for several photographic portraits, taken principally by Liang Shitai (also known as Seetay). The Dowager Empress Cixi's photographic portraits, taken between 1903 and 1904 by a Manchu photographer named Xunling, were themselves of a particular context, as the Qing re-established relations with the foreign powers after the 1900 Boxer Uprising. This period saw Cixi apparently seeking to reap the benefits of adopting Western-style depictions, leading to oil portraits by [Katharine Karl](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/The_Empress_Dowager%2C_Tze_Hsi%2C_of_China%2C_by_Katharine_Carl%2C_1904..jpg) in 1904 and [Hubert Vos](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Hubert_Vos%27s_painting_of_the_Dowager_Empress_Cixi_%28Tzu_Hsi%29.jpg) in 1905, as well as the photographs taken by Xunling. Princess Zhen seems, herself, to have had an interest in photography that led to her being photographed at some point in the late 1890s.  By the time that Xunling was photographing Cixi, though, the Guangxu Emperor was not exactly in a position of substantial power. Indeed, he had been effectively deposed in a coup in 1898 and placed under house arrest, with his contact with the outside world kept to a minimum. It is unlikely that Cixi, who deposed him, would have been interested in sending over her court photographer to take a few shots, nor would she have been particularly keen on permitting the arrival of a foreign photographer either. Of course, the Guangxu Emperor did hold power before the coup, having reached a reasonable age of majority in 1889 (when he turned 18), but at this stage his father's photographer, Seetay, seems to have ceased activity, so unless he was particularly interested in getting his photograph taken – which, as noted above, was far from a guarantee – there wasn't anyone around able to take one whenever.  In short, portrait photographs are the sort of thing you want to get taken, and during the nine years he was actually ruling, the Guangxu Emperor just didn't really bother getting a photograph done. And by the time there was a decently active court photographer, he was living under house arrest so it didn't really matter what he wanted.  ### Sources and Further Reading  * Ying-Chen Peng, 'Lingering Between Tradition and Innovation: Photographic Portraits of Empress Dowager Cixi.' *Ars Orientalis* 43 (2013)  * Claire Roberts, 'The Empress Dowager's Birthday: The Photographs of Cixi's Long Life Without End.' *Ars Orientalis* 43 (2013)  * Yi Gu, 'Prince Chun Through the Lens: Negotiating the Photographic Medium in Royal Images.' *Ars Orientalis* 43 (2013)	1643040481.0	hu176m3	t3_sbjd7t	t3_sbjd7t	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjd7t/why_are_there_no_photographs_of_19th_century/hu176m3/

Yours, on the other hand, is more speculative as you're talking about pretty big factors in Louis's execution. I think you could try asking whether there was much political will for Louis's execution before the Flight to Varennes instead.	1643040745.0	hu17vcm	t3_sbnu3k	t1_hu0xy67	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbnu3k/had_king_louis_xvi_not_attempted_to_escape_and/hu17vcm/

kq9b0	Thanks Snowblizz, that was a really interesting answer.  I was partly curious about this as I I play the Age of Empires 3 strategy game where cannons are a major part of the game dynamics especially in late game, and cavalry can be used as quite an efficient anti-artillery force that however has to manouver its way to the cannons to destroy them (there are also anti-artillery cannons, "culverins"), and so there's always an intensive competition to take down the other player's cannons first.  Also, now that I mentioned the culverin, were there actually any "anti-artillery" cannons?I.e. accurately aiming cannons that could (maybe) outrange the enemy's anti-infantry artillery to take it out?

6xfkem5f	Hi! I am an undergraduate history student from India. The school syllabus here primary covers Indian history. World history is also covered but not in as in-depth a manner as Indian history. The world history portion of my syllabus included the Mesopotamian civilisation, ancient Rome, feudal Europe, the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and the history of modern Japan and China.  In my college syllabus, we have two courses of Indian history and one paper of world history in each semester. The courses are ordered chronogically, beginning with the prehistoric world in the first semester and ending with modern history in the final one. Apart from this, there are also elective courses which are region-specific, such as History of the USSR, History of USA, History of Africa, History of China and so on.	1643041844.0	hu1apmy	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hu08z44	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu1apmy/

mdu63	While much more can always more to be said, I hope my previous answers below might be useful to consider OP's question:    * [Was Slavery A Part Of The Hanseatic Trade?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/al76kx/was_slavery_a_part_of_the_hanseatic_trade/) * [How did the Christianization of the Norse affect their relationship with slavery?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kzg4li/how_did_the_christianization_of_the_norse_affect/)    +++    A) Very brief answer to your individual assumptions, with possible links to the relevant post by other users and by me in this subreddit.    Generally speaking, all of OP assumptions listed below are more or less correct.    >* Assumption #05: Around the same time the slave trade in Europe declined dramatically.  Late 11th century also saw the decline of the slavery in Northern Europe, especially around the Irish sea areas, though to what extent it might have been able to be ascribed to the single historical event like the Norman Conquest, it is still room to debate.   * [How extensive was the slave trade in pre norman Ireland](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pn7u6/how_extensive_was_the_slave_trade_in_pre_norman/) by /u/textandtrowel * [Who were the slaves in medieval England?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/f7zn37/who_were_the_slaves_in_medieval_england/) by /u/Steelcan909 * [Did the Norman Conquest result in enslavement of the natives and how was the plunder-land divided up or was it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lgl9h1/did_the_norman_conquest_result_in_enslavement_of/) by /u/BRIStoneman * [Did William the Conqueror abolish slavery in England?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/23s9eo/did_william_the_conqueror_abolish_slavery_in/) by /u/Mediaevumed  +++  >b. if they do, how come the norse slave trade died out?   Possible answers are mainly twofold.   The first one is, as I explained before in these two posts linked above, the structural change of society within post-Viking Age Scandinavia that would lead to be that of less dependent on the unfree labors.    The second possible hypothesis, although intricately intertwined with the first one, is the change of Norse (or Scandinavian) direct access to the possible market of slave on demand side, preferably with enough wealth for slaves.    Several recent studies focus on the inflow of Islamic silver into north-western Europe, especially in form of the hoard from Viking Age Scandinavia. The majority of them dates back to the 9th and early 10th centuries, that is to say, the early Viking Age, and the scientific analysis (metal like bismuth) suggests that some of silver in these coins actually come far from central Asia like now Afghanistan. Rus' merchants exchanged slaves from NW Europe/ Eurasia with these eastern silvers, and Russian waterways up to Caspian Sea was, so to speak, crossroads of these silver and slaves, as I also introduced before in: [Where did the Piast dynasty originate from?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j4dhqb/where_did_the_piast_dynasty_originate_from/). The imbalance of the price of slaves between Western and Middle-Central Eurasia in the 8th and 9th century, possibly due either to the slavery-based social social structure or/and the regional variance of the demography impact of successive waves of the First Pandemic of Y. Pestis, is also pointed out (in *the Origin of European Economy* by M. McCormick). Coupled the high demand/price of slaves with the abundant supply of silvers, the slave trade from the West to the East in early Middle Ages was probably really lucrative business.   One possible important point is, however, that this inflow of Islamic silver in Scandinavia by way of Russian waterways stopped in the middle to late 10th century - probably due to the decline of silver production in mines in central Asia (especially under the Samanid Emirates). In short, Norse slave traders lost, or at least was cut from their traditional very profitable slave market by the end of the 1st millennium.    Thus, while some Russians kept on raiding (whose motive was to get slaves as loot, at least partly), the Norse couldn't exploit the raiding/ slave trading as a source of wealth anymore after the 11th century that would eventually lead to the declining trend of slavery in their homeland, though some people still had domestic thralls even in the end of the 12th century.

There are many articles like [this one from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar) which seem to indicate Bush *was* involved, but it is unclear *how* much.

lpht4c8	>What held Grant back, and what held both the Confederacy and the Union back throughout the war, was the state of professionalism in the wartime armies. Many of the Generals who fought in the American Civil War, on both sides, really werent generals at all. Lee was a Colonel before the war, Grant was a washed up Captain, Winfield Scott Hancock was a quartermaster, Sherman was a Colonel at First Bull Run, etc. Nobody really had the command experience required to maneuver large forces either strategically, or tactically. Unlike in Europe, where generals learnt how to be generals for decades before a war put their training to the test, in America, these men had to learn on the job. What that meant was that those with natural talent, like Lee, Grant, and Sherman, floated to the top, while everyone else made a mockery of warfighting. And when a commander would be wounded, or worse promoted, their subordinates would have to come up to fill the gap, regardless of skill or training. The Armies needed officers, and it was too late to shove a new batch through West-Point to make a general staff.  This is a great point that I'd never thought of, though it reminds of Joshua Chamberlain, a professor of rhetoric, who was offered a position as a full colonel when he enlisted simply because he was educated and could read/write (he declined, asking for a lower rank where he could learn the ropes - they gave him the rank of lieutenant colonel).	1643043520.0	hu1f6x0	t3_sb6is0	t1_hty0br7	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb6is0/did_the_confederates_really_had_better_generals/hu1f6x0/
177u1k	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643043638.0	hu1fiie	t3_sbpztw	t3_sbpztw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbpztw/what_are_many_ways_classical_greek_civilization/hu1fiie/

177u1k	Apologies, but we have removed your question in its current form as it breaks our [rules concerning the scope of questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_scope_and_depth). However, it might be that an altered version of your question would fit within our rules, and we encourage you to reword your question to fit the rule. While we do allow questions which ask about general topics without specific bounding by time or space, we do ask that they be clearly phrased and presented in a way that can be answered by an individual historian focusing on only one example which they can write about in good detail.     So for example, if you wanted to ask, "*Have people always rebelled against health rules in pandemics?*" we would remove the question. As phrased, it asks broadly about many places collectively. However if you ask "*In the time and place you study, how did people rebel against health rules in a pandemic?*" we would allow the question. As phrased, while still asking broadly, it does so in a way that clearly invites a given expert to write exclusively about their topic of focus! We encourage you to think about rewording your question to fit this rule, and thank you for your understanding. If you are unsure of how best to reshape your question to fit these requirements, [please reach out to us for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/AskHistorians).	1643043809.0	hu1fz2g	t3_sbpq9b	t3_sbpq9b	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbpq9b/how_long_have_we_been_insulting_each_other_by/hu1fz2g/
amsnx9lh	That's a very black and white question. Procopius' work in general was a huge game changer when it comes to perception of Justinian's reign, as he is the only major dissident whose works remained to this day. You must take into account that Procopius was a part of senatorial oligarchy and was opposed to men of low standing like Justin and Justinian, on top of genuine disagreements about policy, such as border defense, loss of autonomy in cities, higher taxes in them (and less money for local projects) and treatment of heretics. Some aspects of his criticism, such as the massacre of Nika rioters and the suppression of dissidents, are well attested in other sources, and Procopius is not only well-educated but, as a legal advisor of Belisarius during his campaigns, often well-informed about intricacies of the system and an eyewitness of many major events (like Justinian's plague in Constantinople,  where he brings us a first hand account (although his tendency to blame Justinian for it is very questionable)). But when it comes to more personal matters, a large chunk of Procopius' Secret History does follow rhetorical conventions for slander (or invective), and as such the work as a whole has to be taken with a massive grain of salt. It's also important to note that Procopius' other major work, History of the Wars, is likewise full of hidden criticism, which is expressed in typical classical fashion: through omissions and analogies with the classical past.  If you're familiar with various invective texts from the classical period, you will run into a fair share of recurring tropes, clichés and so on that appear in Procopius' work as well. An obvious example -- there's one very cursed part about Theodora using all of her holes (to emphasize her promiscuity and thus emasculate her husband, common invective) and cursing god for not giving her a few more -- what's interesting about this is that there are multiple iterations of this exact invective. One is from "On Types of Style" by Hermogenes, which reports a version of the Demosthenic speech "Against Neaera" by Apollodoros of Acharnae where it is said that she "plied her trade through three orifices". But according to Tzetzes, this is an amplification of accusations made by Lysias against Antiope, which was later amplified even further by Procopius. The history of this obvious invective shows that there's little to no truth to it, it's a rhetorical device made to humiliate Theodora, and by extension Justinian. There's also a fair share of references and allusions to earlier sexually themed slander (like Juvenal) as well as some literary tropes from the likes of Aristophanes. Another obvious example would be the narrative about Belisarius. The story goes that Belisarius and Antonina adopted a stepson who essentially cuckolded Belisarius. Belisarius tried to capture and kill him after being in denial for god knows how long despite practically having caught them in the act, but then he was falsely accused of treason and his wife and Theodora plotted and convinced him that Antonina is the reason why he didn't get a death sentence. The chapter itself is called Gynocracy and goes to show Belisarius as an emasculated slave to his wife. This is, by the way, a very common type of slander. Think of Tacitus', Suetonius' and Juvenal's description of Claudius and Messalina. It left such a mark that Messalina became synonymous with an insatiable nympho. For example, slanderers of Catherine the Great called her Messalina of the Neva. These slanderous pieces are often inserted to amplify the effect of verifiable, actual policies of Justinian. For example, the BDSM-ish part about Belisarius licking Antonina's feet (also a common element, from Suetonius off the top of my head) is very cleverly placed, as immediately afterwards Procopius goes on with how Justinian introduced proskynesis, something generally associated with Eastern despots (thus, negative connotations in a Roman society). He also makes comparisons and analogies with classical historians writing about, let's say, Cambyses II, as well as comparisons with Khosrow with whom they were warring at the time, and other Easterners. Also comparisons with Domitian, one of the least favorite (if not THE least favorite) Roman Emperors. It was in general pretty common for Roman historians to use past rulers as surrogates for criticism of current ones (Tacitus using Tiberius to criticize Hadrian, Ammianus using Julian for Theodosius I and so on). In his History of the Wars, his criticisms of the ruthless crushing of the Nika riot are expressed merely through parallels with Diodorus Siculus and tyrants of Syracuse.   But in defense of Procopius, it's a historically attested fact that Theodora was an actress, and back then actresses were a profession strongly associated with prostitution, often for a good reason. Most surviving sources ascribe this background to her. Even among monophysite sources, which are favorable of the empress, some like John of Ephesus bring up her problematic past. Whether she actually engaged in prostitution or not is an open question, but it is very likely that she did, and even if she didn't, as a former actress, her social standing before she rose to power was only a notch above prostitutes anyway. Additionally, performing indecent acts on stage, like the ones described by Procopius, would be by no means unusual. Another interesting addition to these claims is that right before he got married to Theodora, Justinian made it legal for the senatorial class to marry prostitutes.   To sum it up, Procopius' Secret History \*is\* a biased account. Nonetheless, it certainly also contains a nucleus of truth, but it's very far from something that can be taken for granted.	1643043966.0	hu1ge6g	t3_sbjkf6	t3_sbjkf6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbjkf6/roman_historians_is_procopius_secret_history_a/hu1ge6g/

g43fx4pr	Not sure about that, but Lenin did supposedly say the following to Anatoliy Lunacharsk:  > You’re famous as a patron of the arts, then you must firmly remember, that film for us is the most important of the arts.  Both Lenin and Stalin also understood how movies could be used to push their ideologies to their people and foreigners. [You should check out this Russia Beyond article.](https://www.rbth.com/arts/330983-soviet-comedy-films) Here's a quote from it:  > It was Lenin who first identified cinema as the most important of the arts, yet in practice the Soviet movie industry was launched by his successor, Joseph Stalin. Uncle Joe simply adored cinema, and often invited the party elite to private screenings. He wanted Soviet cinema to keep pace with the development of Soviet industry as a whole.  > “Stalin assumed the role of super-producer,” writes Solomon Volkov in his book Modern Moscow, published by Elena Shubina publications, AST. The dictator himself appointed and dismissed cinematic bosses, personally overseeing the creation of “important” films, reading scripts, and watching all pictures. What’s more, the world’s first film school was set up in the USSR!	1643045132.0	hu1jju5	t3_sbfkiv	t3_sbfkiv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbfkiv/did_stalin_ever_say_if_i_had_hollywood_i_wouldnt/hu1jju5/

iovlhi6b	Periodization (the "start" and "end" dates assigned to what is seen in retrospect as a historical era) are always subject to debate.  The first answer that comes to mind for me, for this particular question, is 1890.  That was the date that the US Census office declared the "frontier" to be "closed," since the Census Bureau felt that the population across the West was sufficiently dense that they did not consider it to qualify as a "frontier."  But my expertise lies in European, not American history, so Western historians might define it differently.	1643049023.0	hu1u5hl	t3_savz63	t1_hu040mw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu1u5hl/

For me, "fanbase" refers to the audience for a particular work: the people who are committed enough to a series/team/author, that they are going to read it or watch it.  "Fandom" is usually used in ways that imply a sense of community or organization (or at least communication) among the fans.	1643049159.0	hu1uipd	t3_savz63	t1_hty4z9d	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu1uipd/

b7cbr4dh	Just to add a small tidbit that u/triscuitsrule didn’t address because they stated a desire not to address Lost Cause mythology: the economic argument of taking better care of property than hired labor was both a core piece of Deep South/confederate/KKK propaganda and remains so to this day. As a moral argument it has force because of the horrific treatment of wage-labor but is/has been constantly used opportunistically to valorize the actions and statements of what we now call white-nationalists. This includes the allusions to other slave societies, especially the noble and venerable example of Ancient Rome which Europeans (western euro whites especially) LOVE to make reference to for anything. It is no accident that this argument came to your head and that you were unaware of the facts of the population boom, how it happened and its connection to the ban on the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. You can thank the Daughters of the Confederacy and their extremely successful campaigns ~~against national public education standards~~ to have fair and balanced representation in regards to civil war history. I am from the south and have been listening to more and less eloquent versions of this argument all my life. This is true background of the Critical Race Theory “debate” and is another aspect of the South losing the war but winning the peace. That is to say, we should all try to minimize amplifying white nationalist talking points.	1643049339.0	hu1uzv6	t3_ri7v2u	t1_ht3d4at	/r/AskHistorians/comments/ri7v2u/were_black_african_slaves_in_the_united_states/hu1uzv6/
7xgnjo	>Also, now that I mentioned the culverin, were there actually any "anti-artillery" cannons?I.e. accurately aiming cannons that could (maybe) outrange the enemy's anti-infantry artillery to take it out?  Well first, "culverin" is really just a name for a long barrelled cannon. By and large names of cannon shouldn't be taken to mean too much over the years. There are loads of names, they aren't really standardized and sometimes one country adopts a name from another for a fairly different weapon and sometimes names don't meaningfully map to any specific meaning. A saker, culverin and falconet can be exactly the same thing really, or even more confusingly be of different caliber and weight of shot compared to another gun named the same. So e.g. Charles V Holy Roman Emperor "standardized" his guns to only 7(!) calibers. In 1609 the Spanish reduced it even further to only four: 48-, 24-, 12- and 6-pounders, noted by Uffano in his 1613 manual as a remarkable feat. The 48 pounder being referred to as  a "full cannon" and the other usually as fractions thereof. The 48 and 24 pounders was mostly for sieges. This reduction of calibers was continued and e.g. the Swedish army made do with only 24-, 12- and 3-pounders. The last a regimental gun cast from bronze and light enough to actually be literally man handled and advance with the infantry.  So we see here that artillery as we go on tend to become less specialised and more general purpose to simplify logistics. Basically, it doesn't quite make sense to make special anti-artillery artillery. At the battle of Rain in 1632, where the Swedish army forced a crossing of the river Lech, one of few battles in the period where artillery alone was decisive, there is contemporary illustrations showing that they had successfully performed counterbattery work. As mentioned above the Swedish had very heavily reduced the number of calibers so we must conclude they could do this without special purpose-built guns.  Now likewise we don't exactly have "anti-infantry" guns either (at least not in field battles, naval ships and fortresses could have things like swivel guns that are mostly concerned with anti-infantry work). Though the category of "regimental guns" (which really only means they are operated as part of regiment, but it does imply a lighter gun) is mostly against enemy troops, this does include being used against cavalry, hence they aren't solely anti-\*infantry\* weapons strictly speaking. In fact providing extra firepower against cavalry was a large part of the attraction of the regimental gun. Even a 3-pounder will deliver shot or better yet grapeshot, of sufficient force that armour is rendered basically meaningless. In so far as depending on how you want to see it, we could say that yes you have artillery outreaching anti-infantry artillery. But there's a lot of caveats to make it so. During the 1600s at least, where am most knowledgeable, cannon generally was somewhat inaccurate. Although ins killed hands it could be occasionally devastating. The Swedish commander, later fieldmarshal, Lennart Torstensson was fairly celebrated for his use of artillery unsurprising for a man who was colonel of (all) the artillery and later general of artillery. How inaccurate it could be however is demonstrated by the unfortunate artilleryman who during the siege of Regensburg in 1634 managed to miss a tower 24 successive times and was hanged for his incompetence.	1643049348.0	hu1v0ob	t3_sb8okf	t1_hu199wk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb8okf/was_cavalry_often_used_to_sneak_back_behind_enemy/hu1v0ob/

iovlhi6b	The Western reenactors have been active in Germany for over a century, which is longer than LARP fans have existed (as far as I know), so I'm not sure if there's much of a history of cross-pollination.

But in practice, they did often host competitive combats and performances of different types  (e.g., knife throwing competitions).	1643049641.0	hu1vt1a	t3_savz63	t1_htx2o2v	/r/AskHistorians/comments/savz63/im_dr_nancy_reagin_author_of_reliving_the/hu1vt1a/

2m8yl53s	That's a fair point - I was being a bit facetious, which sometimes doesn't come across very well here. What I mean is sometimes there are statements about miraculous or supernatural events in the historical record, and as historians we can confirm that that's what the record said, but there's no way for us to confirm that the event literally happened or not.  In this case it comes from a Russian source attributed to an author named "Nestor-Iskander":  >"On the twenty-first day of May there was, for our sins, a frightful sign in the city. As a consequence, on the eve of Friday, the entire city was illuminated. The sentinels, who saw the light, ran to see what had happened, for they were under the impression that the Turks were burning the city. They cried with a great voice. Many people gathered and saw on the Church of the Wisdom \[=Hagia Sophia\], at the top of the window, a large flame of fire issuing forth. It encircled the entire neck of the church for a long time. The flame gathered in tone; its flame altered, and there was an indescribable light. At once it took to the sky. Those who had seen it were benumbed. They began to wail and cried out in Greek: "Lord have mercy!" The light itself has gone up to heaven; the gates of heaven were opened; the light was received; and again they were closed." (translated in Philippides and Hanak, pg. 222)  This event is part of other apocalyptic signs recorded by the Russian author - for him this was clearly the end times, the end of the empire if not the entire world. It was almost the year 7000 on the Byzantine calendar and that had apocalyptic significance as well.  "Nestor-Iskander" used to be considered an Ottoman source since whoever wrote it seems to have been in the Ottoman camp (and that's where the name Iskander comes from, a Turkish or Arabic form of Alexander), but the author knows a lot about what was happening inside Constantinople as well, so maybe they defected during the siege? In any case the author's Russian literary style and knowledge of Christian apocalyptic literature probably means they were a monk or a priest, and "Nestor-Iskander" might be a pseudonym or invented character.  Other sources mention unusual weather or darkness. A Greek source, Michael Kritovoulos, says there was an unexpected hailstorm, and  >"...at daybreak a deep cloud covered the entire city from very early in the morning until evening. This sign declared everywhere that the deity had departed from the city. She was left totally by herself as the deity irrevocably turned away from her. When the deity comes or goes away, it does so within a cloud. And so it happened. Let none doubt it. There are so many witnesses, both residents and foreigners." (translated in Philippides and Hanak, pg. 224)  This all happened after an icon of the Virgin Mary was accidentally dropped while it was being carried around the walls of the city. That was definitely a bad omen in the eyes of the Greeks.  There are other Greek, Italian, and Turkish sources but only the Russian account mentions the light on the dome specifically. So is it a good source? It was written by someone inside Constantinople and who also had knowledge of the Ottoman camp. It wasn't published immediately, but we don't really have sources like a daily newspaper from the 15th century, so this is pretty reliable for the time. Is Kritovoulous a good source? He wasn't actually in the city at the time but he interviewed people who were. He was actually working for the Ottomans, writing a biography of Sultan Mehmed in the years after the conquest, so he had access to Ottoman eyewitnesses too.  The question still remains, did the light really appear on Hagia Sophia? Was there really bad weather and other bad omens? Can they be explained objectively? As I mentioned in the other answer there are some suggestions for what the light could have been, if it really happened:  “This fire may well have been what is today identified as St. Elmo's fire, caused by unusual atmospheric conditions, perhaps an accumulation of debris particles, smoke from the cannons, and weather phenomena, and giving off discharges of atmospheric electricity.” (Philippides and Hanak, p. 223, note 93)  But whether the light was really there or not, maybe the more important thing is to remember that Kritovoulos and "Nestor-Iskander" were writing in the context of something that was disastrous for Orthodox Christians, and something they could only describe in apocalyptic, prophetic terms.  My main source for this is:  Marios Philippides and Walter K. Hanak, *The Siege and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453: Historiography, Topography, and Military Studies* (Ashgate, 2011)	1643050243.0	hu1xfna	t3_sayrbi	t1_hu0zemf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sayrbi/just_before_the_fall_of_constantinople_in_1453/hu1xfna/
8brve	It's worth noting that it was a subset of the militarists in Japan who felt this way — not all of them. Some of them were more "rational" in their desire to hold out: they believed that the US population and politicians would tire of the bloodletting, and that this would drive the US to the negotiating table (for something other than "unconditional surrender," which they felt they could not accept). The "rational" view is still pretty awful, but at least it is fairly easy to understand.  Those who believed in a more "irrational" approach — e.g., holding out with the desperate hope of reversal (however improbable), or basically going down with the ship — did so because of a mixture of what we might call cultural factors. I would describe these less as "religious fanaticism regarding the sanctity of the imperial family" (and probably not "personal pride"), and more of a deep sense of military and civic honor. They believed that to accept surrender would be doing a deep disservice to the honor of Japan, and sure, that is tied up with all sorts of complicated ideas about it means to be "Japanese" and "Japan," which are wrapped up in questions about the Imperial House, divinity, and all of that. But it's ultimately a less alien and more relatable concept of national honor that seems to have been at stake.  And when I say, "less alien and more relatable," I don't mean "to every person" (certainly not to me!). What I mean is, we can see this kind of "meme" in the heads of many people across history, and even today. How many movies valorize the person who goes into a suicidal situation, rather than be subjugated to some foreign evil-doer? How many times have we seen scenes where the brave soldier stays behind with the grenade in order to take a few of the enemy out with him? How many times in Western culture do people kill over ideas about honor, whether it be about disrespect of their person, their family, their loved ones, what have you? These are not uncommon ideas, however un-relatable they may be to me or you personally.   What is uncommon, rather is, that these became national policy in Japan, and that is because a group of honor-fanatics essentially took over Japan in the 1930s. They were, again, not representative of all Japanese high-command thought. But they were in positions of great influence, and nearly led Japan over a cliff. Such things do occasionally happen, but they seem to have happened to much greater effect in the 20th-century than previously (I am fond of Eric Hobsbawm's term for the "short 20th century" spanning World War I through the Cold War: "The Age of Extremes").   I would just add that I think it is important to be cautious about the claims of suicidal Japanese. Yes, some were, including the civilians who believed — wrongly — that if they did not kill themselves while defending their homeland, there would be even worse fates in store. (Again, how many Western movies valorize civilians who fight against invaders and oppressors, to the point of death? It is not an alien idea at all.) Many did not but had no opportunity to voice disagreement; the military junta that ran Japan had, for over a decade at that point, worked to suppress dissidence and disagreements of any sort.  The reason I point all of this out, and work to make it a little more "relatable," is because the alleged savageness of the Japanese was used then and now as a justification for the whole-scale targeting of Japanese civilians. And I think we should be wary of this, and resist adopting that terminology (and justification) ourselves.	1643050341.0	hu1xpes	t3_sb1ijs	t3_sb1ijs	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb1ijs/ww2_why_were_the_japanese_generals_so_stubbornly/hu1xpes/

10r6sn	On your initial, more etymological question, he was either using "Tweens" as a shortened term for "tweenage" a word that is a combination of "between" and "teenage" typically used to refer to the early teens (websters dictionary says between 8-12, others say 10-15). It's never been a particularly "popular" word but it is in dictionaries. There are conflicting accounts though on when the word was coined, with some saying in the 40's, some saying the 80's, and still others saying that Tolkien himself was the first to use it in the 50's. The other option is that he was referring to his "Between years" ie: between childhood and adulthood.   On the question of when the modern idea of a "teenager" came to be, I would point you to the book "Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture 1874–1945" by Jon Savage. In it, he proposes that the modern idea of a teenager was created in the mid 40's in the United States as a marketing term for companies trying to target products towards that age group. Tolkien wrote "The Lord of the Rings" throughout the late 30's and into the late 40's, so it is certainly possible, though unconfirmed, if he was aware of the term and the growing modern idea of a "teenager"	1643051272.0	hu2074t	t3_sbmmxn	t3_sbmmxn	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbmmxn/was_tolkien_referencing_teens_with_tweens/hu2074t/

But it's been proven by today to also be highly ineffective, being more likely to yield an insane subject or the answers you want to hear rather than any truth. Now, there are people who still don't understand this today, and I know in the ancient and medieval eras torture was considered fairly standard and reliable, even necessary a procedure in cases. However, even if the science disproving its effectiveness is relatively recent in the grand scale, I'm sure there must have been earlier philosophers or thinkers who would have realised that torture can't really be that reliable. Who is the first person we have records of opining thus?	1643053399.0	hu25tl4	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu25tl4/

d9khg	The meeting between King Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud and President Roosevelt on board the *USS Quincy* was memorialized in an official memorandum which both the King and the President signed off on. The State Department has a copy of it [here](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1945v08/d2). At the very least, this document demonstrates what the participants were contemporaneously comfortable stating what occurred at the meeting.  There is no mention of Bavaria. Instead, we have this exchange:  >The President asked His Majesty for his advice regarding the problem of Jewish refugees driven from their homes in Europe. His Majesty replied that in his opinion the Jews should return to live in the lands from which they were driven. The Jews whose homes were completely destroyed and who have no chance of livelihood in their homelands should be given living space in the Axis countries which oppressed them. The President remarked that Poland might be considered a case in point. The Germans appear to have killed three million Polish Jews, by which count there should be space in Poland for the resettlement of many homeless Jews.  So where does Riedel's mention of Bavaria originate from? In Riedel's book *Kings and Presidents*, he describes the meeting at more length than in his article. Riedel quotes the King as stating: "It is the Christian Germans who stole their homes and lives. Let the Germans pay. ... Give them [the Jewish survivors] and their descendants the choicest lands and homes of the Germans who oppressed them."  Given that Riedel does not mention the King suggesting that a Jewish homeland be set up in Bavaria in his more comprehensive account of the meeting, the use of "Bavaria" appears to be synecdoche for choice land in Germany and the Axis countries.	1643053487.0	hu261xb	t3_sboeq2	t3_sboeq2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sboeq2/in_a_meeting_with_fdr_ibn_saud_reportedly/hu261xb/

35tw5l1o	The notion that the Germans were "destroying" the Soviets before the battle of Stalingrad is simply not true. Although the sixth Army did inflict more casualties on the Soviets than vice-versa, it itself was also severely weakened by the continuous fighting since the start of the German summer offensive. By the time they reached the city and even moreso when Uranus kicked off, it was nothing more than a ragtag force with shortages of everything, including reinforcements. I should note here that there was action along the entire front, not just in the southern sector which is why Paulus didn't receive more support. The German army was engaged with the enemy from Leningrad in the north to Rzhev in the centre down to the oil fields of Georgia and Azerbaijan while Rommel in North Africa faced of with British and commonwealth forces. The territory Germany controlled/fought in was growing too large for them to handle and increased partisan activity didn't help either. Another aspect that arguably contributed to the precarious supply situation  was the split of Army Group South in AG A advancing into the caucasus and AG B advancing onto Stalingrad.  Overconfidence defintely did play a role in the minds of the upper echelons of the German command because they a) thought of slavs as subhumans and b) the Red Army had been defeated so badly in 1941 and thus nobody expected them to basically rebuild the entire army that quickly. This lead them to believe that the Soviets could not possibly mount any more counterattacks in late 1942. However, front commanders were obviously much better at assessing the circumstances than some guys sitting 2000 km away in Berlin. Paulus' staff actually registered a build up of Soviet forces, but high command did not believe them or rather did not considerit a real threat. Anyhow, the sixth army was lacking the resources at that time to adequately prepare and maintain an effective defense against the Soviet armies.  Overconfidence on the part of the OKH certainly didn't improve sixth army's sitution, but it is greatly disputed whether an immediate breakout or a breakout in December when Manstein tried to relieve it would have been successful at all. Some even go so far as to argue that the Stalingrad pocket having been held for so long tied down many Soviet troops which would have otherwise inflicted a devastating defeat on the retreating AG A which might have snowballed into an even bigger defeat. Funnily enough, the regime tried to justify the whole thing in this exact way.	1643054448.0	hu28ko9	t3_sb9qhd	t3_sb9qhd	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sb9qhd/was_nazi_germanys_overconfidence_the_main_reason/hu28ko9/

zrtbk	Further to r/Neptunianbayofpigs's examples, it is notoriously difficult to accurately trace the lives and experiences of former (Scottish) Jacobites in the New World once they left the shores of Britain. Whether that movement across the Atlantic was voluntary or served as punishment via indenture in the wake of the Forty-five, the paper trails of these emigrants is a real challenge for historians to put together. As a result, there has not yet been any study of significant value done on accurately tracing Jacobite sentiment in the decades after the last rising, mostly because it was pretty clear after 1746 that the Stuarts were not going to be able to reclaim the British thrones. Following the lines of genealogy does not necessarily reflect political position in new contexts, so it is important to consider how concepts of loyalty and ideological or sentimental attachment evolved as an individual's fortunes also did – and how much of it was reported or otherwise preserved in writing.  Other than the examples of famous personalities like the ones that Nep offered, you might also like to take a look at [Simon Fraser, Master of Lovat](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Fraser,_Simon_(1726-1782)), a former marginal Jacobite who lost his father to execution in 1747 and later rose to the rank of major-general in the British army and fought in the American Revolution. On the other side was [Hugh Mercer](https://archive.org/details/pottersamericanm03lossuoft/page/482/mode/2up?view=theater), a prominent Jacobite who joined the British army in the Seven Years' War but who went on to fight against it once again during the Revolution.  Beyond these, the following sources might offer some interest:  • Calum Cunningham, ['Rebels Without a Cause': The External Jacobite Diasporas, 1688-1788](https://www.stir.ac.uk/research/hub/publication/1696275)  • Duane Meyer, *The Highland Scots of North Carolina 1732-1776* (UNC Press, 1961)  • A. Roger Ekirch, *Bound For America: The Transportation of British Convicts to the Colonies, 1718-1775* (Clarendon Press, 1987)  • David Parrish, *Jacobitism and Anti-Jacobitism in the British Atlantic World, 1688-1727* (Boydell & Brewer, 2017)  A similar question was [brought up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2orkb5/jacobites_and_influence_on_the_american_revolution/) some years ago, too, and might be worth a look.

ddzw2	I think that it is fairer to say that traders in the East (which I interpret as meaning East Asia) probably didn’t think of England at all.      While obviously impossible to prove this negative, we can get an impression of the kinds of information that was circulating from the writings of a Chinese inspector of foreign trade named Chua Ju-kua \[Zhao Rukuo\] (1170-1228), who worked in Fukien during the Sung Dynasty and collected information about foreign countries and their trade products in a book entitled Chu-fan-chi \[Records of Foreign Nations\].  Chua was a civil servant rather than a traveling merchant, so his book necessarily recorded the information he gleaned from foreign traders in the port city of Fukien.  Compiling these second-hand reports, Chua assembled extensive descriptions of Southeast Asian counties which were regular destinations for Chinese traders.  His description of central Java – then the center of the Majapahit Empire – details Javanese clothing, rituals, and local medicines in addition to an extensive list of available trade products.      While his entries describing the locations closest to him were quite detailed, his knowledge of more distant countries was fragmentary as accounts of these distant lands were gathered from second-hand stories and travelers’ tales.  Drawing on the testimony of Arab traders, he included a brief entry on Ssi-kia-li-ye \[Sicily\] describing Mt. Etna,  as well a lengthy description of southern, Arab-controlled Spain.  As he described it, Spain was a fantastic world:       "The products of this country are extraordinary; the grains of wheat are three inches long, the melons six feet round, enough for a meal for twenty or thirty men.  The pomegranates weigh five catties \[1 catty = approx. 500g\], the peaches two catties, citrons over twenty catties, salads weigh over ten catties and have leaves three or four feet long.  Rice and wheat are kept in silos for tens of years without spoiling.  Among the native products are foreign sheep, which are several feet high and have tails as big as a fan.  In spring-time they slit open their bellies and take out some tens of catties of fat, after which they sew them up again, and the sheep live on; if the fat were not removed, (the animal) would swell up and die."        This entry contains obvious exaggerations about the scale of European produce interspersed with specific facts such as the use of silos to store grains.  Significantly, certain mundane practices were entirely misunderstood and wildly distorted as Chua attempted to make sense of what he was being told.  For example, the description of the springtime extraction of fat from sheep is most easily understood as his misinterpretation of an image of the spring shearing.  One can imagine how the scene of a medieval Spanish shepherd holding shears and removing a white mass of wool from the sheep’s belly could lead to the curious description that he provides.        This was the extent of his descriptions of Europe, however and was limited to the ports that Arab traders went to on the Mediterranean coast.  England was very far removed from traders and trade routes along the Silk Road as a later inscription explains.        Two centuries later, in the 1490s, when the prospect of long distance trade was being revived, Martin Behaim made an illustrated globe that most complete information that he could find as he constructed his globe.  The details of geography were apparently gleaned from secret Portuguese navigational reports, while the descriptions of the flora and fauna include quotes and citations from the Marco Polo’s Travels.  Next to the Indonesian spice islands, Behaim included a long inscription that gives an idea of what the trade route from Asia to England was like.  It reads:       Item, be it known that spices pass through several hands in the islands of Oriental India before they reach our country.    First, the inhabitants of an island called Java Major buy them in the other islands where they are collected by their neighbors, and sell them in their own island.    Secondly, those from the island Seilan \[Ceylon/Sri Lanka\], where St. Thomas is buried, buy the spices in Java and bring them to their own island.    Thirdly, in the island of Ceylon or Seilan they are once more unloaded, charged with customs duty, and sold to the merchants of the island Aurea Chersonesus \[the Golden Peninsula, perhaps Malaysia, first mentioned by Herodotus\], where they are again unladen.    Fourthly, merchants of the island Taprobana buy the spices there, and pay customs duties, and take them to their island.    Fifthly, the Mohammedan heathen of Aden go there, buy the spices, pay customs, and take them to their own country.    Sixthly, those of Cairo buy them, and carry them over the sea, and further overland.    Seventhly, those of Venice and others buy them.    Eighthly, they are again sold in Venice to the Germans, and customs are paid.    Ninthly, at Frankfort, Bruges, and other places.    Tenthly, in England and France.        If East Asians were getting their information second hand from traders and travelers who were involved in the Silk Road, this inscription suggests that there were four layers of intermediaries between Cairo and England alone, making it unlikely that much information filtered back about England.      Does this mean that no one new anything about England in East Asia – no.  In his travels to the Mongol court, William of Rubruck, a european pilgrim who traveled to the Mongol court, described the range of people who attended an Easter dinner in Karakorum.  Curiously, the list included “Basil, an Englishman” so at least some English were living in Asia in the 13th century who could have described their country to the locals.

96gqp	Hi there - unfortunately we have had to remove your question, because [/r/AskHistorians isn't here to do your homework for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_homework). However, our rules DO permit people to ask for help with their homework, so long as they are seeking clarification or resources, rather than the answer itself.     If you have indeed asked a homework question, you should consider resubmitting a question more focused on finding resources and seeking clarification on confusing issues: tell us what you've researched so far, what resources you've consulted, and what you've learned, and we are more likely to approve your question. Please see this [Rules Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hplxyf/rules_roundtable_xx_the_no_homework_rule/) thread for more information on what makes for the kind of homework question we'd approve. Additionally, if you're not sure where to start in terms of finding and understanding sources in general, we have a six-part series, "[Finding and Understanding Sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/theory#wiki_monday_methods.3A_finding_and_understanding_sources)", which has a wealth of information that may be useful for finding and understanding information for your essay. Finally, other subreddits are likely to be more suitable for help with homework - try looking for help at /r/HomeworkHelp.     Alternatively, if you are not a student and are not doing homework, we have removed your question because it resembled a homework question. It may resemble a common essay question from a prominent history syllabus or may be worded in a broad, open-ended way that feels like the kind of essay question that a professor would set. Professors often word essay questions in order to provide the student with a platform to show how much they understand a topic, and these questions are typically broader and more interested in interpretations and delineating between historical theories than the average /r/AskHistorians question. If your non-homework question was incorrectly removed for this reason, we will be happy to approve your question if you **wait for 7 days** and then ask a less open-ended question on the same topic.	1643057355.0	hu2g5mx	t3_sbw35y	t3_sbw35y	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbw35y/reasons_for_the_irish_easter_rising/hu2g5mx/

4le7p4jb	The idea that "Byzantine" identity was a creation of Hieronymous Wolf is a long-standing historiographic tradition, but it's one that has only recently begun to be challenged. The best and most recent article on the subject is this one, by Anthony Kaldellis: ["From “Empire of the Greeks” to “Byzantium”: The Politics of a Modern Paradigm Shift’"](https://www.academia.edu/67605105/_From_Empire_of_the_Greeks_to_Byzantium_The_Politics_of_a_Modern_Paradigm_Shift_in_N_Aschenbrenner_and_J_Ransohoff_eds_The_Invention_of_Byzantium_in_Early_Modern_Europe_Washington_D_C_Dumbarton_Oaks_2021_349_367) \[academia.edu link\].  In the article, Kaldellis raises an important point that speaks to your example of Constantine Lascaris: namely, that we have to distinguish between the word "Byzantine" meaning "relating to the Byzantine Empire" (in other words, a near-synonym of *romaios*) and "Byzantine" meaning "relating to the city of Byzantium" (in other words, a near-synonym of "Constantinopolitan"). The latter was generally more common among Greek writers, and as Lascaris was a Constantinopolitan himself, we cannot assume he was using the term in its wider sense. It is this wider sense, specifically, that Wolf is credited with pioneering: the word *byzantaios* is present in Greek texts much older than Lascaris. A conservative approach to the question must therefore seek examples of usage that could not possibly apply to the narrower concept of Byzantium-as-city.  Beyond a few exceptional late-antique writers who titled their histories of the empire as "Byzantine," Kaldellis argues that the continuous tradition of "Byzantine" identity begins with the mid-fifteenth-century scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles, writing shortly after the fall of Constantinople. Part of Chalkokondyles's intellectual project was the rehabilitation of Hellenism as an aspect of Greek identity.\* He thus recast the Byzantine Empire as a Hellenic, rather than Roman, state: the Byzantines become "Greeks," their emperor the "king of the Greeks," and their empire the "Kingdom of Byzantion." The Byzantine element was, if anything, magnified in Conrad Clauser's influential 1556 Latin translation, where a *rex Byzantinus/Byzantii* ruled over the *regnum Byzantii*; Wolf's *Corpus historiae Byzantinae* was published a year later.  Chalkokondyles's Hellenic Byzantinism played into Western biases, which had long been inclined to discredit any notion of the empire's Roman-ness. Early modern scholars thus tended to use the adjective "Byzantine" purely to denote medieval Hellenism, rather than what was in reality a complex multinational society. (This in turn, perhaps, influenced Paparrigopoulos and other nineteenth-century Greek proponents of Hellenic-Byzantine continuity.) As a noun, however, the "Byzantine Empire" is much less common than you might expect in the centuries following Chalkokondyles and Clauser; most texts referred to the state as the "Empire of the Greeks" or some variation on that phrase.  Kaldellis argues that the expressions "Byzantium" and "Byzantine Empire" really only become common in the nineteenth century, when Greek irredentism and Russian expansionism threatened an Eastern Orthodox conquest of Constantinople. If Hellenic Byzantinism was useful to earlier Western Europeans as a way to preserve Roman-ness for the West, it now became something of a political liability. Political slavophobes like the Bavarian historian J. P. Fallmerayer thus argued for a *dis*continuity between the ancient Greeks and the medieval Byzantines—both racially and socially. For Fallmerayer, modern Greeks were an essentially Slavic people who had absorbed the remnants of actual Hellenic society in the early middle ages; thus, Byzantium could be neither Greek nor Roman, but a construct with its own unique identity. As Western slavophobia intensified around the Crimean War (in which Greece supported the Russians), even more moderate historians began adopting the name "Byzantium" as opposed to the older "Empire of the Greeks." By the early twentieth century, the latter had fallen completely out of favor.  "When the term was introduced," therefore, depends on your frame of reference. In terms of sheer priority, one might point to one of the Late Antique historians I mentioned above; in terms of continuity of use, Chalkokondyles beats out Wolf; and in terms of continuity of *meaning*, both Chalkokondyles *and* Wolf probably wouldn't make the cut (and we should instead credit Fallmerayer or one of his contemporaries with the term). But in any case, Hieronymous Wolf certainly wasn't the man responsible.  \* Though, as I have addressed elsewhere, Byzantine Greeks did not entirely repudiate their Hellenic ancestors \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jb5092/did_greekspeaking_citizens_of_the_byzantine/g8u72j1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fglubf/was_the_byzantine_empire_roman_or_greek/fk8bun1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qos2kq/importance_of_ancient_greek_mythology_and_culture/hjr088f/?context=3)\].	1643057382.0	hu2g89l	t3_sbec1f	t3_sbec1f	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbec1f/when_the_term_byzantine_empire_was_introduced/hu2g89l/

It looks like they're little removable daggers like 6 inches long, and only on the last 2 fingers.

96gqp	I've been talking with some other folks on the mod-team about this, and we're planning a Monday Methods post coming up soon about changes in history education in K12 schools -- it might be a good place for a follow up like this one. The thing that is really slippery about this as a "historiography" question is that it's really not one -- it's not asking how the understanding of the Trail of Tears changed over time, it's more asking about what was a pretty bad writing prompt.	1643058919.0	hu2kbgz	t3_sbuyi6	t1_hu2hvyi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbuyi6/what_was_understood_about_jacksons_enforcement_of/hu2kbgz/
7xgnjo	If you mean Henry VIII as you did when asking in the main sub the answer is "Tudor era" which encompasses his father's Henry VII, his son Edward VI's and his daughters' Mary and Elisabeth reigns too. Usually the reign of Elizabeth I is the most interesting/talked about part and is thus specifically referred to as Elizabethan (since there will be no confusion as to which period you mean).  You couldn't talk about Henrician (or something like that) era because there are 9 kings named Henry (yes I count Henry the Young King) with centuries to separate them so we wouldn't known if you mean early medieaval or the Renaissance ones. And this kinda gets at the problem with naming eras.  The Georgian era e.g. did cover 4 George's (and a short William IV reign), which is why it's so called, but it also interestingly includes the Regency era which is a particular period usually picked out due to it's special circumstances, this occurs in the middle of the Georgian period. More importantly these were 4 George's all following each other in turn and they were the first ones so named and represented a distinct period of the rule of the Hanoverian house (to which Victoria belongs, but she gets her own period).  It is all really a matter of convention to make it easier to roughly place something because periods often have general trends in fashion, architectural style, paintings and often society changes in various ways. It is *not specifically* customary to name the eras solely after every ruler as you seem to imply in your question, for the simple reason that names are often reused. Edwardian refers to the rule of Edward VII in most cases, because Edward VII loomed large in the era. Not in the least because his rule is bookended by his mother  Queen Victoria at one end, the epitome of the old order, and by World War 1 at the other end basically the start of the modern era in many ways.   Basically not all kings and queens get an era named for them, and ultimately it's somewhat arbitrary which naming is picked. It has a lot to do with how people subsequently view the supposed eras. You will find early periods that are less well covered aren't as rigorously subdivided as later ones. Much of it has to do with how distinct a period is from the previous one, artistically, socially, politically and so on, or all of them together.	1643059132.0	hu2kvwa	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htxpvdi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2kvwa/
7ltu0qrk	The reason my wording might be a bit confusing is because I was trying to avoid asking what the oldest piece of writing that references a name is. It seems like this is an important distinction because of the Palermo Stone, which was created in the 25th century B.C.E., but contains the names of rulers from pre-dynastic Egypt. According to the Wikipedia article I linked in my original post, there are a few rulers that seemed to have reigned even before the 3200 B.C.E. The article implies that […]pu is the oldest of these, and also appears to be older than Iry-Hor by a significant margin. Even though we will never know his full name, would he be the most likely candidate for the answer to my question.  Also, since I’m sourcing all of this from Wikipedia and the inscriptions on the Palermo Stone, feel free to correct the validity in any of my claims.	1643059141.0	hu2kwrv	t3_s7qqa4	t1_hu06xiu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2kwrv/
pmgxogo	Sure you can PM me, or you can ask questions here on AH. Others may have more familiarity with clothing in particular.   As for labneh, it's harder to say anything about about styles of yogurt (or many other types of food). There's an Akkadian word for the liquid that separates from yogurt, so it stands to reason that people were interacting with strained yogurt in some way, even if only to mix it back together. Whether they were straining and thickening it to the same degree as some modern yogurt dishes is less clear.  Only a few ancient recipes have survived, and they're all relatively complex. Daily staples probably weren't written down.  See source above.	1643059296.0	hu2lbj2	t3_s7qqa4	t1_htn8smv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2lbj2/

There's a linked post in there that examines the availability and attempts at placing value on meat.

13ch64	I just want to add to this, since the interwar period hasn’t been covered well here. This hatred definitely starts up prior to WW2 and can be seen shortly after the 1918 foundation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. In a nutshell, many ethnic/religious groups were for the creation of a united Slavic country, but when the Serbian Karađorđević family was installed as the ruling power, non-Serbian Slavs feared their interests/power/rights wouldn’t be protected- they were right. Serbs essentially had a monopoly on power in the Yugoslav government, and over the next two decades restricted the financial, political, religious, and social rights of non-Serbs.  Here's where claims of interwar genocide come in and get sketchy, and the only thing that I think Malaquisto missed- The Serbian-led government didn’t publicly enact pogroms or formal military campaigns against non-Serbs. Instead, individual politicians and political parties financed private paramilitary groups to roam Yugoslavia, harass non-Serbs, disrupt elections, and impose Serbian hegemony. In my research I’ve found 22 Serbian funded paramilitary groups that operated between 1918-1941. This was not genocide, but it was organized oppression and violence (primarily, but not exclusively) towards Bosniak and Croat peasants. During this time there were also formal political executions and informal ones as well (Croat politician Stjepan Radić was murdered during a parliamentary session by Serbian politician Puniša Račić, who was punished by being put under house arrest in a lavish villa). This interwar violence is well-documented by historians like Sabrina Ramet & Mark Biondich, and can be seen in Vladko Maček & Dragiša Ristić’s memoirs/papers).  Now it should be acknowledged that Croatian resistance groups did exist and did fight back against the government, but they were relatively minor/ineffective. The most extreme/violent group, Ustaše, operated out of Italy, and were generally unsupported by the Croatian population until the German takeover of Yugoslavia (in 1937 they had less than 500 members). What I think did factor into the growing rift between Serbians and Croatians was the Croatian Peasant Party’s mobilization/modernization of the Croat peasantry. In the late 1930s Croat politician Vladko Maček organized an effort that taught literacy to 200,000+ peasants and encouraged them to participate in politics. Many Serbians saw this as a growing threat to Serbian dominance and preached to their followers that Croatians intended to take over Yugoslavia and oppress the Serbs (this did happen but it was a weird, unpredictable sequence of events that put it in place).  Maček was actually able to negotiate with moderate Serbs in power and establish an autonomous Croatian state within Yugoslavia… then the Nazis showed up. They asked Maček to lead a Nazi-backed government, but he declined (and was imprisoned), so the Naziz went to Pavelic/ Ustaše who massacred a horrifying number of Serbs and Jews. Had Maček agreed, this could have been avoided but Maček acknowledged that Yugoslav politicians knew that Jews were disappearing under the Nazis and he wanted no part of it.  So the interwar period was absolutely a time of strife and violence imposed by Serbian loyalists and agitated by Croatian extremists, which set the stage for Ustaše’s brutal oppression of the Serbs. Side note: a handful of Serbian-backed paramilitary groups associated with war crimes/genocide that operated in the 1990s used the names and even the logos of the Serbian paramilitary groups from the interwar period. The interwar period was often referenced by all parties in the 90s as being a source of their respective victim identities, and quite honestly there was violence by all sides in that period, although the Serbs were the biggest culprits in that era. But to echo Malaquisto again, the interwar era was not a period of genocide.  Again, Biondich and Ramet have done a lot of great work digging into the rampant violence in the interwar era and are worth looking into.	1643061402.0	hu2qx72	t3_rq9iqu	t3_rq9iqu	/r/AskHistorians/comments/rq9iqu/what_is_the_history_of_the_ethnic_hatreds_in_the/hu2qx72/

e49gp06y	He was a very genuine Antisemite. He started getting into contact with that... "idea" first in his time in Vienna which is fairly well documented and even mentioned in Mein Kampf. He didn't show any specifically antisemitic tendencies before that. He even worked with a lot of Jews who sold some copied paintings he made for a living for a while. More then that however he saved the Doctor of his Aunt Eduard Bloch who was also jewish when he wrote to Hitler and asked him for protection from the Gestapo, leaving him an his family able to sell everything they had at normal market value and flee the country. Many of his own views for example are very similar to those of, for example, Guido von List which is evident in the both of them often writing about the "fate" of the Germans and subsequently the Arians as a race. There is a big list of other antisemitic or racist literature that he could've read and used as a base to form his own belief of it because most of the ideas the Nazis stood for had already been around for a good while at this point. Especially considering that the general Eugenicism was highly revered. Even to a point where, in the USA for example, it became taught in many schools. On that I specifically suggest "Hitler's Vienna" by Brigitte Hamann.  His radicalization just simply came from the contacts he made and held As RudolfTheRendeer already said Europe at that time (not just Western Europe) was ripe with the worst kind of antisemitism. Hitler just had the "misfortune" to meet the extremely wrong people. That only continued when he got to Munich and then after the war when he was still in the Army (Reichswehr) where he was actively pushed more towards forming his views through, for example, taking place in Seminars to which the Reichswehr send him about "Bolshevik Propaganda" and, as you can probably guess, most about these were very much so about the Bolsheviks being Jews. It wasn't long after the war that he joined the NSDAP (back the just DAP) and started to hold speeches so to answer your question in summary:   Hitlers Antisemitism was certainly formed in his time in Vienna but was only cemented by his time in the military and in Munich especially with the loss of Germany in the war and his beliefe in the Dolchstoßlegende.	1643062290.0	hu2t8h2	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0qcsj	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2t8h2/
2gu4x0fh	Ottoman Empire definitely did have book shops.  It is pretty hard to find shop records about the early empire. However we do have other evidence. Molla Fenari, a cleric from Sultan Bayezid I’s reign is recorded to extend weekend from 2 to 3 days. This extra day was granted so the students could work and pay the “outrageous bookseller prices”.  The earliest records about specific booksellers in Ottoman Empire are from 1520.  Out of 140 shops in the Grand Bazaar, 4 of the shops  belonged to book merchants (called “sahaf”). There are also records of book merchants in Fatih district and other major marketplaces.  European diplomat’s one of the important missions in Constantinople was to shop for valuable books. In a letter to Venice, Venetian diplomat Piedro dela Valle writes that he has been looking for Arabic grammar books in Bezistan market in Constantinople in 1615.  Likewise a Dutch merchant in Izmir Michiel de Mortier wrote to the Dutch Levant trade director to complain about the diplomats in Constantinople. He complained that the diplomats spent thousands of golden liras in book merchants which could have been used to solve trade matters.   Overall it is clear that Ottomans had book shops in the classical period. We can also presume that there were places selling books and book supplies to students in early 1400s and 1300s, even though there are no surviving reports.   About the author and statement you mentioned, I have not heard of a book ban in Ottoman Empire. It also does not sound plausible for an Empire that needs schools and libraries to ban books. However Bayezid II banned the printing press, as a result of lobbying from scribes who did not want to lose their profitable jobs to a machine. This ban was only lifted in 1700s during the reign of Ahmed III.

cgxrfdt	Let me ask this in response to you and Reendeer.  Where was all the antisemitism in Europe coming from? I had no idea it was already such a ripe mindset in general.   I know the Jewish people through history have always been targeted or however you want to say it, but why was there such a ramp up in Europe and especially Western Europe in that time?  Sadly my history is Terribad but I find this stuff interesting.	1643062688.0	hu2u9j2	t3_sbczey	t1_hu2t8h2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2u9j2/

e49gp06y	Oh, yeah. There was the "Verband nationaldeutscher Juden" or "Association of German National Jews" for example founded by Max Naumann. They strongly supported the DNVP which was in a coalition in the NSDAP and subsequently proclaimed their loyalty to the Nazis after 1933. They were prohibited and dissolved in 1935.   They for example wrote in their own paper "The german national Jew"   "The Association of National German Jews aims to bring together all those Germans of Jewish origin who, while openly professing their descent, feel that they are so inseparably attached to German nature and culture that they cannot feel and think in any other way than German. It combats all expressions and activities of an un-German spirit, whether they come from Jews or non-Jews, which impair the resurgence of German national power, German legality and German self-esteem and thus endanger Germany's rise to a respected position in the world."  And on the election of the NSDAP they wrote:   "We have always held the well-being of the German people and the fatherland, to which we feel inextricably linked, above our own well-being. Thus we greeted the results of January 1933, even though it has brought hardship for us personally."  There is a source in "Die Etablierung der Außenseiter: Der Verband der Nationaldeutschen Juden 1921-1935" by Matthias Hambrock about them specifically but I don't know if there's an english translation of that is available.   It's the weirdest thing.	1643063115.0	hu2vd6k	t3_sbczey	t1_hu0xwmv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2vd6k/
hhelidpe	Was Malcom X murdered by the US government? - it was claimed somewhere in a sub, I'm ignorant on the issue but most regular sources list other members of Nation of Islam and I saw that recently, after old documents were released, it was decided that 2 of the people imprisoned shouldn't have been. But did the US take any more of an active role in his murder?	1643063317.0	hu2vvxq	t3_s7qqa4	t3_s7qqa4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s7qqa4/short_answers_to_simple_questions_january_19_2022/hu2vvxq/

e49gp06y	I'm fairly certain that somebody asked about the origin of Antisemitism in this sub a while ago. The Answers there were very detailed and well written so you should definitely look for that and if you can't find it just ask again yourself because it is something absolutely worth diving into.  The simply answer is what you already said: It was already there. Antijudaism was deeply entrenched in a variety of societies and historical chapters in Europe as early as medieval and feudal societies at their very beginning. Antisemitism was simply the "Evolution" of Antijudaism with the aspect of Racism which heavily developed during the Atlantic Slavetrade.    And in the 19th century the biggest part in forming Antisemitism towards what it is today was played by the huge popularity of Eugenicism. It cannot possibly be stressed enough how influential and important Eugenicism became. Not just in Europe but also in the USA. The theories about "race" which the Nazis held can all be traced back to that thing and, naturally, it didn't take long until the Jews were put into this model of "Race" as well which very much so marks the transition from Antijudaism to Antisemitism as the former was mostly a discrimination based on Religion whereas the latter became a discrimination based on the construct of race.    A very big starting point of this new, European Antisemitism is often considered to be the anti-Jewish Pogroms in Russia. They were already ongoing in the 19th century especially at its end but found a very bloody and tragic peak in the beginning of the 20th century. Now this is where a certain book comes in and you might have already heard of it. But "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" was pretty important to all of these events. It's, very simply put, not sure who wrote it or what the original intend was. There is Spekulation that it was published by the Russian Government itself in oder to combat the rising influence of Socialists in Russia, accusing them all of being Jews and in that trying to get the masses to turn against them using the already ongoing antisemitism and pogroms for that matter. But, again, it's simply never been proven. It does however make sense considering that one of the biggest narratives in antisemitic rhetoric always has been that Socialists were all Jews. And then much later of course that very argument used against the Bolsheviks of being Jews who wanted to conrol the world.    Whoever wrote that "work" didn't really matter though because it became one of the most influential books of it's time and I'd even say in the entire 20th century of how it further coined and fueled Antisemitic rhetoric and prejudices.   If you want to know more about the History of Antisemitism I would always suggest the Frankfurt school and critical Theory. Especially Adorno and, for example, the "Elements of Anti-Semitism" by Adorno and Horkheimer. Adorno is THE institution when trying to understand the roots and works of Antisemitism.	1643064455.0	hu2ysbm	t3_sbczey	t1_hu2u9j2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu2ysbm/

um4xp	So this is a question that is very broad and so I am forced to give a relatively broad answer; what follows is mostly based on evidence from the Classical period, but it’s general enough to apply broadly to the entire ancient Greek period from let’s say the middle of the sixth century BC onwards. As far as our knowledge about festivals are concerned, the surviving evidence ensures that we are much better informed about Athenian festivals than those organized elsewhere, with the exception of the great Panhellenic festivals (i.e. the Panhellenic Games organized in Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia, and Nemea), which I assume you will know at least something about.   All festivals were organized to celebrate one or more deities, and for some deities (like Zeus) they did organize multiple festivals in their honour within the same year. Festivals could be big or small, organized on a Panhellenic level, on the level of a city-state or part of it, or even confined to a small village. Important festivals, like the Panhellenic Games, could attract visitors (pilgrims) from all over the Greek world, others were more regional affairs or limited just to the local populace. Some festivals were very specific to a certain place, like the Panathenaic celebrations in Athens (in honour of Athena, the city’s patron deity), whereas other festivals were celebrated in different places in the Greek world, like the Thesmophoria (in honour of Demeter).   Festivals were celebrated in different ways, but they usually included some form of a procession to a sanctuary (where a cult image of the celebrated deity or deities were kept), as well as various performances (singing hymns, dancing, engaging in athletic competitions, music and drama contests, and so on). It’s always good to remember that ancient Greek plays were created for festivals, and specifically that playwrights engaged in competition. Naturally, an integral part of festivals was the sacrifice of one or more animals on the altar within the sanctuary of the deity or deities in question. Male animals were, as a rule, sacrificed in honour of male deities, female animals for female deities. Parts of the sacrificial animals were burnt for the gods, while most of the edible parts were prepared for consumption by the community: such meals were often the only occasion for many people to consume meat.  Not everyone celebrated the same festivals. Women, for example, were excluded from attending the Olympic Games (though that did not preclude them from sponsoring athletes!). Some festivals practiced the reverse, and excluded men: the aforementioned Thesmophoria, for example, were intended specifically for married women. Some of these festivals lasted only a day, others several days and even more than a week; the Thesmophoria lasted three days. The ancient Greeks, by the way, didn’t have a “week” like ours, and thus no weekend, and festivals may have been a convenient time to take a break, even though a lot of business would have continued as usual.   I think this will do for now. Some suggested reading:  *  J.N. Bremmer, *Greek Religion* (1994).   * M. Dillon, *Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion* (2002).   * J. Ferguson, *Among the Gods.

e49gp06y	"Hitler's Vienna" by Barbara Hamann which I mentioned here a couple of times already as well as "Hitler" by Joachim Fest (who specifically writes about Hitler trying to flee from Military Service). He actively tried to erase that part of his past by having his Austrian military records confiscated after the Anschluss. Which wasn't by far the first time he tried to erase parts of his own past.    Him being arrested in Munich and forced into Service by being dragged to the Austrian Konsulat is also talked about by Ian Kershaw in "Hitler, 1889-1936" as well as in "Hitlers München. Aufstieg und Fall der Hauptstadt der Bewegung" by David Clay Large. Pretty sure there is an english translation for the latter but I only got it in German and I couldn't find the title of it.   That should fulfill all your needs I guess. And just as a general rule of thumb in terms of Hitler? Take ANY stories about great heroic things with him with a very large grain of salt. Always consider that the man had more then enough time to make his life look a lot better then it was to stylize his own cult of personality.	1643065328.0	hu30yu0	t3_sbczey	t1_hu11uoi	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu30yu0/
e49gp06y	There is a point to be made that he didn't want to be in the Austrian Service because he already understood himself as "German". And the fact that he requested to be transferred from a Austrian to a Bavarian regiment during the war every much underlined that. But, no. I'm not implying that. I'm merely stating that he actively dodged Austrian Military Service. Which is factually true.	1643065566.0	hu31k4i	t3_sbczey	t1_hu15i61	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sbczey/who_financed_hitler_before_his_coming_to_power/hu31k4i/
