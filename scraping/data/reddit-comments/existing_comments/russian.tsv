3kktj0kv	How common is it for people to refer to others by just patronymic? I've heard sometimes that people will do this if they're really, really close (for example, I remember reading about instances where Lenin was just called "Iliych" to demonstrate being close with the Soviet people), but I'm not sure how regular that is, or if it was just something that was common during the time period.	1641534828.0	hrlotj8	t3_rx6hf2	t1_hrhou1d	/r/russian/comments/rx6hf2/did_i_do_it_wrong_or_is_it_an_error/hrlotj8/
3kktj0kv	I'm learning Russian with the primary goal to read literature and historical sources, and learning to speak it is just as important, even if you're not going to be speaking with people very often. For one, it reinforces grammar and vocabulary in your brain, and two, becoming accustomed to how people speak and speaking it yourself can give you a better sense of the language, which carries over into reading. Russian poetry and literature is great, but there often is a speech element, even with literature. Take, for instance, Gogol and Zoshchenko's *skaz* writing, which intentionally imitates natural speech. And hearing Pushkin recited is a completely different experience than just reading it in your head. Learning the language in all of its aspects- speaking, listening, reading, and writing- allows you to appreciate and understand each aspect more, so even if you're learning primarily for reading like I am, I would still highly recommend learning to speak anyway.	1641535126.0	hrlpc7e	t3_rxdht3	t3_rxdht3	/r/russian/comments/rxdht3/i_need_some_resources_to_read_and_understand/hrlpc7e/

h3qjoj2	Patronymic only is very informal, about the same as using short first name only. It's more popular in certain demographics like older generations and blue collar workers.  I am not sure how true it is, but I have a feeling that when you start as formal/respectful with name and patronymic, e.g. –ü—ë—Ç—Ä –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á, then switch to more informal, going to just patronymic –ò–≤–∞–Ω—ã—á is easier in your head than to short name, –ü–µ—Ç—è.	1641536887.0	hrlsaw9	t3_rx6hf2	t1_hrlotj8	/r/russian/comments/rx6hf2/did_i_do_it_wrong_or_is_it_an_error/hrlsaw9/

4tzio0vc	Sorry for not replying, I encountered the deadly problem - having the need to sleep.    I argue because from my perspective, I am right. And it's not something I can just think of "phew, fuck it, they may think what they are thinking now", because if you say this construct isn't used in language EVER, it can influence someone's speech and knowledge of Russian.    I treated you without respect, just like you. We both think we are right and the other side is incorrect, and in my opinion, saying that a phrase is never used only because of "—Ç—ã" isn't just being incorrect, but straight up bullshit.	1641539394.0	hrlw9qw	t3_rx6f45	t1_hrjzzpu	/r/russian/comments/rx6f45/can_someone_tell_me_what_my_mistake_is/hrlw9qw/

I don't code for work (yet) actually. I'm just a hobbyist (though if this project is successful, then I'll certainly put it in my portfolio.) There are two reasons I chose Clojure:  1. On a more abstract level, the language "gets out of the way" and lets me focus on the problem and rather than the syntax or low-level minutiae. This is a pretty common sentiment among Clojure developers, and also quite relevant for me as a self-taught developer. (I would never be able to write a program in C, for example.) It's powerful and also very expressive, in that you can perform complex manipulations of data in just a few lines of code that are much more human-readable than most programming languages.   To cite examples from this task, `group-by` and `frequencies` are core library functions in Clojure. In Python, I think the equivalent is `itertools.group()` and for counting occurrences, you have to use `collections.Counter()` and it's not very obvious at all how it works (I only learned about it last month during Advent of Code 2021).  Also, REPL-driven development means that I can interact with data and test small parts of my program live in a terminal without repeatedly compiling it or running entire scripts.   2. More concretely, **ClojureScript.** I'd been doing stuff in Clojure on and off for quite a while, but never deployed a real app or released anything out "into the wild." I once used Python for the backend of a web app several years ago (when I only knew Python), which was fine, but dealing with the constantly-changing and overpopulated JavaScript ecosystem for frontend development was not fun.   I had heard that ClojureScript makes it possible to do full-stack development in (basically) the same single language. That is, CLJS transpiles to JS, so you can make stuff happen in the browser without writing a line of JS (a language that annoys me a lot). The development experience of Clojure/ClojureScript, once you get past the initial hurdle of setting everything up, is really smooth.  More specific to this particular post, the noun case thing is kind of a side task that came up as I was preparing the data. Perhaps it would have been faster for me to a write a script in Python to parse the XML files (and I actually did write one very quickly the other day to parse an OpenCorpora text file for noun gender information), but then the parsed data would still remain external to my program and I'd still have to import it. Using Clojure to parse the XML means that I can keep on parsing the data in different ways and the output is readily usable and already in the data structures that I need.  Hope that answers your question!	1641560946.0	hrmqy7m	t3_rxtjiv	t1_hrmhv77	/r/russian/comments/rxtjiv/oc_frequencies_of_noun_cases_in_opencorpora_data/hrmqy7m/

"The bank account is for dollars, so try to transfer 115,000 GEL to the dollars.   Find out your mistake."   It is probably not entirely correct since I don't know Georgian, I just know their script.

hnkamh90	It's pretty good for the first time, although you do have some mistakes!  &#x200B;  First, sometimes half of a letter disappears when you connect two letters. For example, in "–ö–∞—Ç—é—à–∞" your "—à" merged into "–∞". In the word "–≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞", "–ª" merged into "–∞". Try to write the letter completely and then connect it to another.  &#x200B;  You seem to confuse "–∏" with "–π". These are different letters and you can't put that little mark above every "–∏".  &#x200B;  Sometimes your "–æ" looks like "–∞" when it's at the end of a word. For example, the last two "–ü—Ä–æ" look like "–ü—Ä–∞", whereas the first looks correct.  &#x200B;  You'll get even better pretty soon if you practice regularly!	1641570778.0	hrne6ql	t3_rya82p	t3_rya82p	/r/russian/comments/rya82p/hello_first_try_to_write_cyrillic_i_want_your/hrne6ql/

avgpx	Unreadable for mysterious reasons (you were supposed to had a teacher who would smack you the moment you tried writing like this).  –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥ - –± looks like a capital one.  –ª - you joint the preceding letter to it incorrectly.  Everywhere.  –í—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª–∞ - a slightly wrong —ã, a tilde over –∏ (everywhere), wrong joining in –∏–ª, a too long tail in –∞.  Why tails in all final –æ's?  The tail is for joining with the next letter.  If it's the last letter, there is no tail.  –æ—Ä–ª–∞ - nobody will recognize this.  —Ä needs a stoke to the bottom.  Wrong joining in —Ä–ª.  –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ - what's up with k?  It's simple letter without all these loops.  Speaking of loops.  There is no visible loop in –æ.  There is some thickening of the stroke in the upper left corner because you draw a double line there, but it's not a small circle inside a big circle.	1641571999.0	hrnhjqd	t3_rya82p	t3_rya82p	/r/russian/comments/rya82p/hello_first_try_to_write_cyrillic_i_want_your/hrnhjqd/

gwxm3	The simplest method, obvious but frequently overlooked, is to listen to a native recording of a sentence, then record yourself speaking the sane sentence, then compare your recording with the original. Of course, this method will only work if you can hear Russian properly. For most English natives, Russian is not too difficult to hear properly nor are individual Russian sounds difficult to produce, so this method alone will give an adequate pronunciation to most native English learners. If not, then you will need a native teacher to help fix your inability to hear your own mistakes in pronouncing Russian.	1641579326.0	hro22my	t3_ry740p	t3_ry740p	/r/russian/comments/ry740p/are_there_any_russian_learning_apps_that_give_me/hro22my/

Mostly, they are aligned in a QWERTY setup, so you can input most of the letters correctly without even knowing the Georgian script. However, there are some letters like ch, sh, dzh, ts, etc. that you cannot input that easily, and you have to know the alphabet to be able to distinguish them from other letters.	1641581736.0	hro8s9m	t3_ry7kx0	t1_hro5xim	/r/russian/comments/ry7kx0/please_can_anyone_translate_this_in_english_what/hro8s9m/

17m1w20t	FWIW, I've seen a video of a woman who learned Russian and recommended the "method". It does make sense.  On the other hand, as one above comment said, stresses from Pushkin's time aren't 100% like today's. Though I'd estimate number of the differences is not that significant.  Truth be told, I don't think many people would read that much poetry to learn the correct accentuation spontaneously from it. E.g. I got accustomed to older prescribed accentuation in my native language only by reading a 19th century translation of Homer, so like 30k lines of poetry. God knows how much Pushkin you'd have to read to "develop an ear" for it.  I guess poetry is a great method if you enjoy it. And if you're at the level where you're still not sure how to stress "–ù–∞—à–∞ –¢–∞–Ω—è –≥—Ä–æ–º–∫–æ –ø–ª–∞—á–µ—Ç", your overall knowledge might be limited enough to prevent much enjoyment. But it's up to you to try and find out. Either way, there should be enough simpler prose texts out there with marked accents, so if you can't follow poetry (which almost by definition uses more difficult language than prose, vocabulary- and syntax-wise) you still can practice accents. Besides, audio books and films and songs are also a good way to expose yourself to accents.  If you do want to try poetry, start with Pushkin and Lermontov and maybe some newer poets, and see how it suits you. I recommend leaving "silver age" (—Å–µ—Ä–µ–±—è–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ–∫) poets for later, they're very difficult IMO.  As for your description of the trochees, usually it's not that simple. The metrical feet do not have to correspond to words, or even to the natural stress entirely. An example from Pushkin:  >–ú–Ω–µ –º–∏–ª –∏ –≤–∏–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ –Ω–∞ –ª–æ–∑–∞—Ö  This is iambic tetrameter (—á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä—ë—Ö—Å—Ç–æ–ø–Ω—ã–π —è–º–±, 4x combination of unstressed-stressed; in this case the verse is hypercatalectic, i.e. it has an additional unstressed syllable at the end). The natural stresses go:  >–ú–Ω–µ **–º–∏–ª** –∏ –≤–∏–Ω–æ**–≥—Ä–∞–¥** –Ω–∞ **–ª–æ**–∑–∞—Ö  but the meter goes:  >–ú–Ω–µ **–º–∏–ª** –∏ **–≤–∏**–Ω–æ**–≥—Ä–∞–¥** –Ω–∞ **–ª–æ**–∑–∞—Ö  So, one word carries two metrical stresses, but only one grammatical. There are different explanations for why that works, why it still sounds like a regular verse, I'm not sure which is currently taken as the best, but either way I hope it illustrates how metrical regularity behaves. Consequently, you cannot discern exactly which syllable in "vinograd" is to be stressed if you've only read the verse, it might be either the first or the last one - you still need to know how the word is pronounced by itself. You won't ruin the rhythm of the poem if you stress the first syllable, but you still won't learn the correct one.	1641581990.0	hro9hg4	t3_ry99kr	t3_ry99kr	/r/russian/comments/ry99kr/do_you_think_that_poetry_is_an_easy_hack_for/hro9hg4/

5a7q1i63	OK, my friends, let's talk about –•–£–ô, AKA "3-letter word" in Russian. Yes, it's a rude word for "penis" but it doesn't have a direct translation to English because English has no word for it. Sure, you can bring up DICK (Richard), COCK (Rooster), PRICK (asshole), and so on. But those are synonyms, right? Those words originally meant something else while –•–£–ô is always –•–£–ô. Just like "cunt" (–ü–ò–ó–î–ê) is, first of all, a rude word for "vagina".  So the English language has a word for –ü–ò–ó–î–ê (cunt) but no word for –•–£–ô	1641583959.0	hroeucc	t3_rxwj4y	t3_rxwj4y	/r/russian/comments/rxwj4y/two_american_ladies_at_my_place_of_work_expressed/hroeucc/

For them it's more intuitive to write a complicated loop that does everything than to decompose the problem into common operations like group-by. The "let's program our way out of it" approach can work, but results are hard to maintain. You may have an advantage.  I wouldn't want to work on data in C either... Ipython is a "prettified" for interactivity Python shell (I think this is what REPL means?) but to me it does not feel like the best development environment. Have you tried any "notebook" interfaces (they look a bit like Maple or Mathematica, with both code and results on one page). Jupyter is huge in Python, you can try it easily in Google Colab. There is a project for a clojure kernel for jupyter, but it looks not quite done: [https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter). And finding the problem across languages *when* something breaks does not sound fun.  >core library functions in Clojure. In Python, I think the equivalent is itertools.group() and for counting occurrences, you have to use collections.Counter()  Yeah, sounds like Clojure works quite well for this. In Python I would just use Pandas, which has df.groupby('foo').size(). Pandas does a lot, but it's definitely not a core library. Some operations have to be more syntactically awkward than they probably are in Clojure where it's closer to the heart of the language.	1641587750.0	hrop16r	t3_rxtjiv	t1_hrmqy7m	/r/russian/comments/rxtjiv/oc_frequencies_of_noun_cases_in_opencorpora_data/hrop16r/

However, both in my and your sets –ï always turns into –Å when it is stressed.  I'm not a linguist, so I don't know how to phrase scientifically accurately.

As someone else said, it can also be used ironically. I've noticed that Russians will use –≤—ã to someone they know on purpose if they're pissed at them. It's kind of like using someone's full name in English (Jeffrey instead of Jeff) when you're peeved at them. Spouses will do it to show the other person that they're not super happy at them or to a kid who maybe thinks he's older than he is.	1641601731.0	hrpou8t	t3_rydtp4	t3_rydtp4	/r/russian/comments/rydtp4/should_i_use_—Ç—ã_or_–≤—ã_in_this_situation/hrpou8t/

f6ppkqrj	Listening practice would be the best to learn stress. Reading at the same time as listening practice (like an audiobook and written book at the same time) would help more. I think listening and reading poetry simultaneously, if you can get hold of an audiobook of the poems, would be highly valuable. Especially if you 1. understand poetry (if you aren't versed in it, it's not always easy to understand), and 2. the poetry rhymes (rhyming words and alliteration are easier to remember). Though, as others have pointed out, be careful of poems, like rap, which intentially change the sound slightly, as an artistic technique to fit in the poem.	1641602395.0	hrpqeq8	t3_ry99kr	t3_ry99kr	/r/russian/comments/ry99kr/do_you_think_that_poetry_is_an_easy_hack_for/hrpqeq8/

17m1w20t	I think I get what you mean, but I don't believe it'll work out that way. Assuming that in poetry words can attain a secondary stress for rhythmic purposes, you still won't use it when talking in ordinary prose - –≤–ò–Ω–æ–≥—Ä'–∞–¥ will end up as –≤–ò–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, which IMO doesn't sound very close to correct pronunciation. Better than –≤–∏–Ω–û–≥—Ä–∞–¥, sure, but still too far if you're aiming at correct pronunciation. Funnily enough, just today I heard one very similar mistake - a three-syllable word (in my native Croatian) that I'd stress on the last got stressed on the first, and it definitely rang odd.  So, you still have to use the dictionary diligently, no way around it. :D	1641604095.0	hrpudwy	t3_ry99kr	t1_hronwlx	/r/russian/comments/ry99kr/do_you_think_that_poetry_is_an_easy_hack_for/hrpudwy/

i2v8d	Yes, you can say both phrases without any problem. Russian doesn't have any specific word order, just sense of the sentense have to be correct.  In this exact case, you actually don't care where –æ—á–µ–Ω—å is applied. Both "(Smth) is flowing a lot" and "a lot of water flows" mean the same thing. "–û—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" just emphasises a process in whole.  Yes, some forms can be more "popular" just because. Like in your second case most people would still say "–û–Ω –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥", but your sentense is still perfectly valid. However you can skip "–¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥" at all, and now "–æ–Ω –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" and "–æ–Ω  –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" would divide 50/50. Cause nobody cares, sense is the same.	1641605055.0	hrpwmov	t3_ryn3on	t3_ryn3on	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrpwmov/

jya24	Your constructed phrase is perfectly correct. But I would rather classify *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* as ‚Äúfuzzy cardinal‚Äù, because its corresponding interrogative pronoun is *—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ*, and syntactically it behaves very similar to real cardinals (like, e. g., *–ø—è—Ç—å*). So, in the construction *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥*, it's not *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* which modifies *–¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥*, but vice versa. You can compare it to English *a lot of money*, where *of money* is a complement of the quasi-noun *lot*. But in any case, the two words (with their other dependents) form a cohesive syntactic unit.	1641605715.0	hrpy5rm	t3_ryn3on	t3_ryn3on	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrpy5rm/

7pascwg1	>"–û–Ω –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥."  That is correct, but this sentence allows practically any word order imaginable, especially in speech (some options might carry a slightly different meaning).  The most standard "literary" version would be: "–û–Ω –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥", because it follows Subject-Verb-Object order and the determines are placed before the words they describe. Conversationally, "–û–Ω –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å" or even "–û—á–µ–Ω—å –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –æ–Ω –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" are quite fine.  Regarding your question about what modifies what in "–û—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ—á–µ—Ç –≤–æ–¥—ã", I find it a bit difficult to correctly analyze this sentence, because it has a very rare combination of adverb + noun. But if my analysis is correct "–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ" (semantically a numeral, but morphologically a noun) forms a noun phrase with "–≤–æ–¥—ã" and is modified by an adverb "–æ—á–µ–Ω—å". So the Noun Phrase "–æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–¥—ã" serves as a subject of the verb "—Ç–µ—á—ë—Ç".  (Alternatively, it's a sentence with a Genetive subject *–≤–æ–¥—ã* and *–æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* it's an adverbial phrase modifying the verb).  However, in "–û–Ω –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥" *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* is either a noun in Accusative case that forms a noun phrase (*–æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥*) or a adverb that modifies the verb *–∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç* and *–¥–µ–Ω–µ–≥* is a Genetive object. On the other hand, now that I think of it, the latter is less likely, because *–∑–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞—Ç—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å* takes an Accusative object.  Sorry for such a long reply, I hope someone corrects me, if I'm wrong.	1641606066.0	hrpyz78	t3_ryn3on	t3_ryn3on	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrpyz78/

diarn8kr	To start, I'd recommend investing some serious time into studying the alphabet. Not just the letters, but the sounds they make and how they combine into words. As a native speaker of English, you can *build* on the phonemes you learned as a child, but simply *using* them to try pronouncing Russian words would be a mistake, and could even turn into a habit that is rather difficult to unlearn further down the road. For that, I'd recommend searching for a channel on YouTube (not necessarily mine üòâ) where you can listen to a native speaker and then imitate the way they pronounce simple words.

jya24	Because, after all, it's not a *real* noun (much less so than Engl. *lot*). It has acquired some noun-like traits by virtue of occurring in constructions where it functions as a count word. But it can also occur in contexts where it's a bona fide adverb, modifying verbs (e. g., *–æ–Ω–∞ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç*) and comparatives (*–æ–Ω –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ –º–µ–Ω—è*). Generally, a word which doesn't inflect according to a specific pattern‚Äîthat is, any word which is not a noun, verb, adjective or pronoun‚Äîcan only be classified as this or that part of speech based on syntactic contexts in which it can occur. Words like *–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ* are essentially transcategorial.	1641609470.0	hrq6qch	t3_ryn3on	t1_hrpzp9b	/r/russian/comments/ryn3on/confusion_about_adverbs/hrq6qch/

Also try to become friends with a native or reading/listening to as much as possible. That last part is important because native speakers talking will help you learn HOW to talk like a native.

1m7nxb5	Been studying Russian and a few other languages over the past years. If there's one tip I could bring to the table, it would be to take note of the words (primarily verbs and some nouns) that you use in English a lot, even make a list of the top 20 verbs and 20 nouns, then become familiar with those verbs/nouns in Russian. Although Russian gets tricky with verbs in terms of aspect (imperfect/perfect), I think it's a good start!  Russian is tough because grammar is hugely important. So knowing a few key nouns in their nominative form could help (google translate single words or go to a dictionary for this)then once you dive into the grammar, you'll learn declensions.	1641623755.0	hrqygk7	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrqygk7/

3g18bif8	Well, they've already said about the wrong word "—Ç—ã". Now about the word order in this phrase.  When anybody say "—è —Ç–µ–±—è –ª—é–±–ª—é" it is exactly - and consistently - who loves whom. Not that someone who else, someone whom else, and what kind of relationship they have - namely me, specifically you, and only then the main thing about love. This phrase is about the relationship of these two people, and only then about what this relationship is.  And this is a standard phrase between lovely people.  When someone says "—è –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ç–µ–±—è", he is talking about his feelings, first of all. In this phrase he says that he loves, and whom he loves - in this sequence. Therefore, this phrase is characteristic of expression: for the first declaration of love, for a quarrel, for protection in front of others ("—è –ª—é–±–ª—é –µ—ë" (I love her)), and so on. This phrase is about the feelings of one person, not about the relationship between two.	1641624041.0	hrqywac	t3_rygnab	t3_rygnab	/r/russian/comments/rygnab/difference_between_—è_—Ç–µ–±—è_–ª—é–±–ª—é_and_—è_–ª—é–±–ª—é_—Ç—ã/hrqywac/

dnq43	The letters –ï, –Å, –Æ, –Ø pronounced as YE, YO, YU, YA when they don't follow a consonant character, and as E, O, U, A with palatalization of the previous sound when they follow a consonant characters.  The letter –¨ is taught to be a silent one (it only causes palatalization of the previous consonant), but actually is pronounced before –ò and –û as –ô: "—á—å–∏" ('whose') is pronounced as if spelled "—á–π–∏", "–∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω—å–æ–Ω" as if it's spelled "–∫–∞–º–ø–∞–Ω—å–π–æ–Ω".   Everything else can be pronounced pretty straightforward.  Unstressed –û are pronounced as –ê, but you can't tell which letter is stressed, so it won't help you. Also unstressed –ï and –Ø tend to be pronounced as –ò.  Word-final consonants are pronounced as unvoiced even if they are spelled as voiced (like in German).  Important exceptions are the grammatical endings -–û–ì–û/-–ï–ì–û which are pronounced with /v/ sound while are spelled as if they are pronounced with /g/ sound.  Some –ß are pronounced as 'ch' instead of 'sh'. The most important of these is the word "—á—Ç–æ" ('what').	1641629330.0	hrr6bsu	t3_ryumct	t3_ryumct	/r/russian/comments/ryumct/what_are_some_basic_pronunciation_patterns_i/hrr6bsu/

434wy2qh	Russian has a way of phrasing things quite a bit differently than English. It may help you to translate in two ways: the literal translation and the more natural translation. For example, "She is five years old" translates to –ï–π –ø—è—Ç—å –ª–µ—Ç, but the literal translation is "To her are five of years." Or to say "He is a mechanic," it's just –û–Ω - –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫.  Don't worry, in a little while it will start to seem much more natural. It's a different system and things don't always translate 1:1. I daresay things don't *often* translate 1:1.	1641629745.0	hrr6vju	t3_rynwmk	t1_hrr0dqe	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrr6vju/
pofti	There is Eugene Onegin opera with exact this phrase repeated several times. It was normal to use –í—ã (–í–∞—Å) in high society even for close relates up to wife/husband/children/parents...   Please note that in written form –í is capitalised for single form, but for plural form we use –≤—ã (–≤–∞—Å). Also it is common to use name+fathers name (–∏–º—è+–æ—Ç—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ) if you use –í—ã.   For example: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞ –°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–µ–≤–∏—á, –ø—Ä–æ—à—É [–í–∞—Å –∏–¥—Ç–∏] –∫ —Å—Ç–æ–ª—É! [–ú—ã] –¢–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –í–∞—Å –∂–¥—ë–º.

5h2wo	Oh oops I meant –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏. Yea it's true that a word can become incomprehensible if it is pronounced horribly, but you can talk around the word and add more context if you just know more words. Studying as many words as possible while speaking with natives is the most important thing you can do as a beginner. The more you speak, the more stuff you just pick up. Phrases, grammar, pronunciation, and more just become internalized. For me, perfectly understandable pronunciation is something that is easily acquired by just speaking as much as possible. Spending time specifically on pronunciation is just not efficient. Especially since, in my experience, drilling good pronunciation and correct grammar actually becomes counterproductive for students because they just become more hesitant to speak.	1641632801.0	hrratsb	t3_rv4iwm	t1_hrfv0nx	/r/russian/comments/rv4iwm/is_proper_word_stress_crucial_for_a_total_beginner/hrratsb/

h6j3rrd7	There are some important rules. First of all you need to know where the stress is because of unstressed you pronounce like a and e unstressed you pronounce as –∏. This is about Russian vowel reduction bit there also many rules about consonants too!

89lzwm6d	I started off with Dualingo daily and I did an audio course called Pimsluer at the same time.   Now I've moved onto Glossika which is like Pimsluer on steroids , I'm also doing shared Anki decks alongside Glossika for vocabulary. I have a teacher on Skype once per week where we speak in Russian , I also have two people I speak with in Russian via WhatsApp weekly.	1641634473.0	hrrcy75	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrcy75/
89lzwm6d	I agree with you some people say Dualingo isn't good I disagree ,I found it very helpful like you said.   You can click on the discussion part of each question , and people will discuss the grammar rules it's very helpful indeed. It's how I came to understand the grammar alongside watching YouTube videos. I think it's a lot easier to pick up the grammar concepts as you go , rather than studying complex grammar tables etc.	1641634958.0	hrrdk7a	t3_rynwmk	t1_hrqpbcq	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrdk7a/

47cd9b9k	I'm a work-in-process, but for me what has helped the most is hiring tutors via Skype/Zoom on italki.com -- like $10-15/hr. I started with two hours a week, moved to 4 hours a week, and I'm about to increase to 8 hours a week as my poor little brain develops linguistic endurance.  I should note that I used free language partners for a while, mostly in-person, but I found that our meetings weren't consistent enough to make much progress. Having regular meetings has been key.  I've also switched any TV serials that I watch over to Russian language -- English subtitles for the first watch-thru, Russian subtitles for subsequent viewings. LingQ.com is a good way to read Russian books on a smartphone -- just tap words you don't know for a definition. And I use Quizlet to drill vocabulary, but my brain doesn't retain much from drills. Reading and speaking seem more productive. And once in a while I dork around with Memrise and Duolingo. Can't say I learn much from them, but hey maybe.  Apps are better than nothing, but real-life practice has by far been the most helpful for me. The good news is that you don't need to live in Russia for this "immersion" -- you can do it all remotely with online teachers.	1641635733.0	hrreipa	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrreipa/

fn7k4	Duolingo was really only useful for learning to type for me.  Get the Windows 10 mnemonic Russian keyboard--you can basically type a lot of the same letters and the extra letters (Russian has more, 33 or something like that) are typed with combinations.  Anyways, learn the alphabet, do some of your basic intro lessons to learn how to greet people, thanks, you're welcome, etc.  Then you get on HelloTalk and you go into the search and look for Russian speakers.  You can start 25 new conversations per day.  Do that--people will drop out for long periods of time (I've done it myself).  Once you start seeing the standard greetings and figures of speech often enough you can start copy pasting the beginning stuff.  Find the people that want to talk on audio/video calls (lots seemed to want to use WhatsApp).  There are seriously so many Russian speakers on HelloTalk that want to practice their English.  That ought to get you started.  The most important thing is to find the things you are interested in and do/watch/etc. in the target language.  Don't feel like you have to plug along with lessons or w/e if you find them boring.  Don't get attached to specific apps or w/e because if you stay in that ecosystem you're probably not going to take whatever skills you build outside of it.  Lastly, recognize the fear to make a mistake or to be misunderstood.  It's going to happen no matter hard you try because you just don't know what you're doing yet.  If you can recognize that and put it aside, you'll make a lot more satisfying progress.	1641637384.0	hrrglh5	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrglh5/

fgdyz	I liked Babbel more than duolingo. They both have nonsense phrases to a degree, but I can see the ones in babbel actually being used.  I think they may have updated the lessons some, so not sure if it's still the better one between the two.  A lot of people recommend just building up a vocabulary without worrying about grammar, but I'm the kind of person that likes learning some of the grammar to better understand the language.  1000% learn the alphabet first. Some of the sounds are completely alien to a mouth used to English, especially the types of combinations that exist. Once you know the alphabet well you'll be able to read even if you don't know what it means.  Install/enable a Russian keyboard.  Repeat everything.  Use a vocabulary/flashcard type of program like Clozemaster.  Try to find Russian versions of English media you like.	1641638112.0	hrrhhzs	t3_rynwmk	t3_rynwmk	/r/russian/comments/rynwmk/advice_on_learning_russian_by_a_english_native/hrrhhzs/

Also League's owned by Tencent so you could count it as Chinese if you wanted, there's a massive audience for it in Asia, and there's development and other teams internationally even if the headquarters may be in America.  Idk, what makes a game a 'Russian game' or an 'American game' or whatever is about as vague around the edges as who counts as an American, borders are imaginary.	1641959952.0	hsb0efg	t3_rzlzei	t1_hs90o52	/r/russian/comments/rzlzei/russian_video_games/hsb0efg/

8rn093bg	Thank you for the motivation, I dont think that it is correct to use your language level as progress but I just started out learning passively almost a year ago, exactly 330 days according to Duolingo and I have managed to go up to A2 maybe already B1 because it's been a while since I've made the test, I was suprised to see it since I was waiting to see an A1 so that's something, also, when I first started out I focused myself on the reading and pronounciation part of Russian and believe, comming from knowing both English and Spanish was a VERY big boost since both languages are pretty similar to Russian, Russian has lots of words that come from English and the pronounciation is pretty similar to Spanish, it took me only 3 months to be able to read fluently, obviously a bit more time to pronounce it but the progress I've made is seriously great, if somebody is feeling down or something, try going back to it and doing something different because changing things up from time to time will keep you engaged, try learning some songs too, –ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞ by  –ì–ª—é–∫–æ–∑–∞ & –£—à–ª–∞ –∫ —Ä–µ–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç—É by –ú–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–æ—á–∫–∞ were my starting songs and I'd recomend learning those first!

I went through an agency, so instead of the basic $300~ or so fee if you do it yourself, I paid closer to $400 and got a 3 year visa.   I guess I could have done it myself, but after having lived overseas and being in various different countries, I decided to not have the stress and pay a little extra lol.

434wy2qh	Pefective verbs (–≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª—ã —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞) are used to describe completed or not-yet-started actions. Something that has a definite beginning and end. So they can only be used in past in future tense.  Imperfective verbs (–≥–ª–∞–≥–æ–ª—ã –Ω–µ—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞) are used to describe an ongoing state or process. They are used for things that are happening right now, or for things that were in the process of happening at some point in the past.  Let's use —á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å/–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å for an example. (To read)  –Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. I'm reading a book. (currently in the process of reading)  –Ø —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª/—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–Ω–∏–ª –º–Ω–µ –º–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥. I was reading a book when my friend called. (I was in the process of reading, when...)  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª/–ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∞ –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. I read the book. (and finished reading it)  –Ø –ø—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É. I will read the book.  Verb aspect, or –≤–∏–¥, is one of the hardest things to nail in the Russian language. But it's the reason that Russian doesn't need like 147 tenses like English has, so that's a plus. :)	1641972249.0	hsblilh	t3_s1s2hg	t3_s1s2hg	/r/russian/comments/s1s2hg/what_is_this_column_trying_to_show_me/hsblilh/

at3t8vmv	These are synonyms. But it seems to me that "–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" is a more formal word and means the termination at the moment of a conversation: –ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏ –≥—Ä–æ–º–∫–æ —á–∞–≤–∫–∞—Ç—å! / Stop chewing loudly! (right now). The connotation is very strict.   And "–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å" is more informal and means long-term termination: –ü–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å –ø–∏—Ç—å –ø–∏–≤–æ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å, —ç—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ / Stop drinking beer every day, this is harmful (and it takes time).

There is one grammatical difference: the verb "–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" can be used with a reflexive postfix -—Å—è. You could say "–î–æ–∂–¥—å –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª—Å—è" = "–î–æ–∂–¥—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–ª –∏–¥—Ç–∏".  Another example: "–°–ø–æ—Ä –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª—Å—è / The dispute ended".	1641980232.0	hsbvt09	t3_s1zzvm	t3_s1zzvm	/r/russian/comments/s1zzvm/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å_vs_–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å/hsbvt09/
jya24	They are synonyms, but *–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å* is more formal in style: *–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å* is rather uncommon in legal and technical prose. Grammatically, both verbs can take infinitive complements (*–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å* and *–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å*), but only *–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å* can take direct objects (*–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É*).	1641980480.0	hsbw3tn	t3_s1zzvm	t3_s1zzvm	/r/russian/comments/s1zzvm/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å_vs_–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å/hsbw3tn/
cj2bk	"–ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" is more assertive and abrupt, "–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å" is more relaxed.  The difference is more noticeable when used as imperative. Derivatives of "–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å" sound like a direct order, whereas "–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å" is closer to a request.	1641983599.0	hsbzugp	t3_s1zzvm	t3_s1zzvm	/r/russian/comments/s1zzvm/–ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å_vs_–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å/hsbzugp/

They have two packs, one that says the sentence in your native language (if your native language is one of the available 50 languages and you choose it) and then it says the sentence in your target language with two different speakers, one man, one woman.  The second pack is only sentences in your target language, but still with two speakers. I think two speakers might only be for gendered languages but I'm not really sure. I thought it was cool that it was available in so many languages and non English speakers can use it in their native language. It's definitely not a program that will take you to fluency but it's a good start in listening training. Next Level Russian is a good free intermediate level podcast. UCLA has a free Russian business podcast.  I like listening resources.  Oh also, I use a browser extension called Gloss that translates some words I'm reading on the page into Russian to build vocabulary. It's like Toucan but Toucan isn't available in Russian.	1641986543.0	hsc3msm	t3_s1r955	t3_s1r955	/r/russian/comments/s1r955/free_ways_to_learn_russian/hsc3msm/
bci24ojc	**[Double negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negative)**     >A double negative is a construction occurring when two forms of grammatical negation are used in the same sentence. Multiple negation is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a clause. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have negative concord or emphatic negation.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/russian/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1641986567.0	hsc3nxp	t3_s23t1t	t1_hsc3mf9	/r/russian/comments/s23t1t/–≤–∏—á–µ—Ä–∞_—è_–Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ_–Ω–µ_–∑–Ω–∞–ª/hsc3nxp/

cj2bk	English language is lacking here. It is impossible to say that you have learned what "nothing" truly is in English. Because if you say that you know "nothing", you are just saying that you don't know anything.  In Russian, you are given the precise information. Either you do not know or do know nothing. And if you do, then you really do know what is "nothing". Same with the other verbs, in Russian you can choose if you are creating/painting/seeing the nothing or not doing it.  –Ø –≤–∏–∂—É –Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ. vs –Ø –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ –≤–∏–∂—É. - two different things, that require further elaboration if you want to express them in English.	1641987142.0	hsc4fp6	t3_s23t1t	t3_s23t1t	/r/russian/comments/s23t1t/–≤–∏—á–µ—Ä–∞_—è_–Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ_–Ω–µ_–∑–Ω–∞–ª/hsc4fp6/

4vxhj26	Not from start, it will just overwhelm you. At least get some basic understanding in grammar and have some vocabulary. Then start reading simple texts, something simple modern and generally popular (not kids books). After you become somewhat comfortable start watching movies and tv shows (again something simple). Listening is a different skill which you haven't trained until this point, so expect to not understand anything, use russian subtitles if needed (never subtitles in your language).  I would NOT recommend songs as a source of immersion, just remember how unnatural and sometimes unintelligible songs in your language, same with russian.	1641994364.0	hscgehy	t3_s235st	t3_s235st	/r/russian/comments/s235st/what_is_the_best_way_to_immerse_self_in_language/hscgehy/

4xw1sl5	If you are planning to devote 3-4 years, it means that you are serious. Mass-marketing oriented popular apps like Duolingo won't take you far. On the opposite side, taking it too academically and doing tiresome grammar drills all the time and making cumbersome vocabulary lists.   &#x200B;  For learning methods, I suggest you read refold, I don't follow or agree with everything they say, but there is some solid information there. Other than that every individual is different and learns in different ways. Here is what worked for me for another language:  Step 1. Learn the basics of grammar. *Without* being able to use them actively or remember them all the time. Learn grammar to be able to say what is going on in the sentence, and maybe identify why the words are used in that way/form.  Step 2. Memorize the most common 1,000 words. Anki works great in that step.   Step 3. Watch/listen/read to see how words sound like, phonetics, intonations etc.  Step 4. Review grammar and memorize another 2,000 words.   Step 5. Massive amounts of watching and reading  Step 6. Trying to output. Writing short texts, trying to speak etc. Identify the weak points and concentrate on filling the knowledge gaps.   &#x200B;  This is just a general picture of what worked for me, maybe something completely different works for you, you need to see for yourself what is the most effective way for you. Also keep in mind that it will take a lot, a lot of time to become proficient.	1642001210.0	hscvymq	t3_s1yh7l	t3_s1yh7l	/r/russian/comments/s1yh7l/i_know_this_is_a_question_asked_multiple_times/hscvymq/

4oxt1n3z	Verb pairs are verbs of the same definition because in English we make no distinction in the verb itself if something is a regular occurrence or a singular time. For example: in English we would say something like ‚ÄúHe walked home from work‚Äù and say it the same way whether he did that often or this one time - in Russian they use two different verbs to make a distinction. My personal favorite is you can accidentally imply you are a stalker in Russian by using the wrong version of the verb ‚Äúto see/watch‚Äù if you use the wrong form in the sentence ‚ÄúI watched him walk home from work‚Äù you are saying you watch him walk home from work often, like very often.	1642001985.0	hscxwn4	t3_s1s2hg	t3_s1s2hg	/r/russian/comments/s1s2hg/what_is_this_column_trying_to_show_me/hscxwn4/

I've been working my way through Babbel for the last few years and seem to have hit a wall because I never hear and can't participate in conversations, so I think some immersion learning might help.

77v15ydy	At the moment don‚Äôt count on it - Russian vaccines are the only ones officially recognised here so while some places (like an empty restaurant) might risk letting you in, officially it‚Äôs a no.  I know this as I have colleagues with non-Russian vaccines and they are currently restricted to supermarkets, chemists and other ‚Äúessential‚Äù shops. No museums, no theatres etc.  They are optimistic this will finally cause the authorities to recognise non-Russian vaccines, but I am not so optimistic.  At the moment this is only a super strict requirement in St Petersburg.	1642004383.0	hsd43q3	t3_s289zm	t1_hsd3jta	/r/russian/comments/s289zm/derzhavin_institute_st_petersburg/hsd43q3/

bgzo7k2t	Hello! I'm learning Russian, and something that is helping me is a book called "The New Penguin". Bought it on Amazon, and it is really good for beginners.   You can also watch some videos, since the book isn't that helpful at the listening/speaking parts. The channel that I recommend to you is "Be Fluent in Russian". You can also train on Duolingo or other apps.   Good luck, and have fun!	1642007040.0	hsdb5d3	t3_s2aht0	t3_s2aht0	/r/russian/comments/s2aht0/hi_im_15_years_old_im_a_american_girl_i_love_to/hsdb5d3/

bsoa3gqf	Not really, it definitely is "–∞" You use "–∞" when you are saying things that are opposite to each other or something like that. For example:  "–≠—Ç–æ —à–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞–¥ –∞ –Ω–µ –¥–∂–µ–º"  - This is chocolate and not jam.  "–û–Ω –±—ã–ª –≤ —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–µ, –∞ —è –±—ã–ª –≤ –º—É–∑–µ–µ."  - He was at the university, and I was at the museum."  Did you get what I mean?

d8ox1pq8	I think if you have reasonable expectations, immersion from the beginning is fine. Of course, if you don't understand anything then what you are doing is useless so there is no point in doing a lot of immersion especially native immersion in the very beginning (but I think in small quantities it's good to get used to the sounds of the language). I watched Better Than Us on Netflix very early on in my language learning and I had fun picking out the few words I knew and reading the names of the actors on the screen, and I just enjoyed the story. Immersion means different things to different people as well, some mean it to mean native material/people and others use it to mean learning in context (ie reading). I have personally found mixing up study materials with native material gets me the best results, but I stop doing anything I don't understand and save it for later. This can include study materials too if they are too advanced for my level.	1642011853.0	hsdo5jh	t3_s235st	t3_s235st	/r/russian/comments/s235st/what_is_the_best_way_to_immerse_self_in_language/hsdo5jh/

gwxm3	You'd actually be better off using DLI  methods of 60 years ago than many so-called innovations like Duolingo. Real innovations since 1960:  1) Apps like Anki are much more efficient and less weight to carry than paper vocabulary cards.  2) Ebook reader with integrated dictionary more efficient and less weight to carry than paper book and dictionary.  3) Speaking of dictionaries, unless you put a really low value on your time (under $1/hour), consider buying add-on dictionaries (Universal and Ermolovich en-ru, Explanatory BTS ru-ru for ABBYY app, latter needed to show stress for all forms). So much more efficient than online dictionaries, to speak nothing of paper dictionaries.. Universal en-en also good, if you don't already have a good English dictionary integrated into your browser and ereader.  4) Audiobooks, podcasts and YouTube offer far more native recorded speech than was available in the past, all of which can be accessed at any time, unlike vinyl records, cassettes, CDs.  5) Skype, Zoom, etc allow easy conversations with natives living far away.  Otherwise, secret (already known in 1960) is as follows:  1) Get your pronunciation okay upfront, instead of developing bad habits that have to be unlearned and relearned later.  2) 80% of time, after basics, should be: listen to recording, read transcript and look up unknown words in dictionary, listen again, repeat for next recording.   3) Results = hours * effectiveness/hour. Difference in effectiveness between good and perfect is small, and hours required is enormous even of using perfect method. This argues for focusing primarily on sustainability (after taking points 1 and 2 above into account) rather than perfect effectiveness. Find a method that is reasonably effective and that you enjoy, then grind away.	1642025584.0	hseovli	t3_s2bdw4	t3_s2bdw4	/r/russian/comments/s2bdw4/learning_russian_the_best_possible_way/hseovli/

a0qlz566	Perfect reply.   I would add:   The difference between a reasonably effective method and a terrible one is great (meaning that with a terrible method you'll make close to zero progress even after years). But it doesn't look like this applies to OP.  One technical innovation that has helped me increase my efficiency drastically is using an addon for my web browser that lets me right click on a word to give me a translation (would give you the name but it's in German; but I know there are others like it out there). Makes looking up words pretty much effortless.  Yes, the number of hours you need to put in IS enormous BUT if you spend that time engaging with interesting content you won't really notice it. So I wouldn't let that deter you. I switched from playing video games to learning Russian and the time goes by just as quickly (you could, of course, also learn playing video games but I don't think it's as effective; games usually aren't as language-dense as videos or podcasts)	1642028609.0	hsewkuc	t3_s2bdw4	t1_hseovli	/r/russian/comments/s2bdw4/learning_russian_the_best_possible_way/hsewkuc/

4nyx8zzd	Uh, sorry, I don't have a full answer, but something I can tell you is that "–∞" often does not mean "and", while "–∏" is pretty much always translated into English as "and" (maybe there are some rare exceptions though).  So, "–∏" is the preposition used when listing things (as well as English "and"), for example: "–ù–∞—Å—Ç—è **–∏** –ò–≤–∞–Ω –∏–¥—É—Ç –¥–æ–º–æ–π" - "Nastia **and** Ivan are going home"; "–û–Ω –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç —Ñ—É—Ç–±–æ–ª **–∏** –≤–æ–ª–µ–π–±–æ–ª" - "He plays football **and** volleyball"; so pretty much an analogue of "and" (note that "–∞" cannot be used here)  "–ê" has many uses, many of which I don't know how to describe, but at least one I know how to. It can be used for comparing two things in a way to emphasize their difference (an English analogue here would be "but" or just nothing). "–û–Ω–∞*(she)* –∏–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç*(plays)* –Ω–∞*(on)* –±–∞—Ä–∞–±–∞–Ω–∞—Ö*(drums)*, **–∞** –Ω–µ*(not)* –Ω–∞*(on)* –≥–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–µ*(guitar)*" - "She plays drums, **~~and~~** not guitar" - I have marked "and" with a strikethrough because it's normally omitted (not sure if it's even allowed there); "–û–Ω –ª—é–±–∏—Ç –û–∫—Å–∞–Ω—É, **–∞** –Ω–µ –°–≤–µ—Ç–ª–∞–Ω—É" - "He loves Oksana, **~~and~~** not Svetlana"; "–û–Ω–∏*(they)* —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏*(did)* —ç—Ç–æ*(it)* –Ω–µ*(not)* —Å–æ*(because of)* –∑–ª–æ—Å—Ç–∏*(anger)*, **–∞***(but)* –∏–∑-–∑–∞*(because of)* –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞*(hunger)*" - "They did it not because of anger, **but** because of hunger".  Lastly, I will give you some examples where "–∞" actually translates into English as "and", though I can't really explain them: "**–ê***(and)* –∫—É–¥–∞*(where to)* —Ç—ã*(you)* –¥—É–º–∞–ª*(thought)* –æ–Ω*(he)* –ø–æ—à—ë–ª*(went)*?" - "**And** where did you think he went?"; "**–ê***(and)* –∑–∞—á–µ–º*(for what)* –Ω–∞–º*(to us/for us)* —ç—Ç–æ*(this)*? - "And why do we need it?"; "**–ê***(and)* –µ—Å–ª–∏*(if)* —è*(I)* –∏–º*(to them)* –≤—Å—ë*(everything)* —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∂—É*(will tell)*?" - "**And** what if I tell them everything?"

aiqzuzme	I‚Äôve been to Ukraine twice for vacation, both times in Odesa. I was told by numerous locals this: Do not attempt to speak Russians in west Ukraine, especially in Lviv. I was warned that I would probably be attacked for doing so even as a tourist. How true this is I don‚Äôt know since I haven‚Äôt personally verified it by going there myself. But after hearing it from five or six people there I imagine there is some truth to it.  In Odesa it‚Äôs fine. I did it every day without issue.	1642036643.0	hsfe8su	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsfe8su/

4ra1e0ku	Ukraine is an excellent place to learn Russian immersively.  In Kiev you will hear 90% of people on the street speaking Russian. Strange thing is that despite Russian being the colloquial language, all signs are in Ukrainian, but it is similar enough to Russian that it should not be too confusing for you.  You may hear ‚Äúsurzhyk‚Äù which is Ukrainian mixed with Russian, but in Kiev and large cities people speak pure Russian. You will encounter surzhyk in more rural areas. In Kiev people will pronounce –≥ as a soft ‚Äúh‚Äù, which is dialectically similar to southwestern Russian and Belarusian Russian.   Odessa has a very unique dialect and accent in Russian, so be ware of that, but it is more ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù there than even Kiev.  Also, regarding Lviv: no, you will not be beaten by anybody for speaking Russian. Especially since you are a beginner, your accent will be obvious, so nobody will take offence. Maybe, you can learn basic Ukrainian pleasantries like ‚Äúdyakuyu‚Äù for people to like you more in the west. Note that there exists the remote possibility of encountering an aggressive drunk, but that exists in both the west and the east. Just avoid politics!	1642043269.0	hsftclw	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsftclw/
4ra1e0ku	Lviv is totally safe even if you speak pure Russian with no foreign accent‚Ä¶ this is probably propaganda you heard regurgitated by eastern Ukrainians, who have issues with western Ukrainians.  Ironically, I know somebody who was almost in a fight in Odessa because he only speaks Ukrainian, and they wanted him to speak Russian!!	1642043362.0	hsftjvq	t3_s2m7ri	t1_hsfe8su	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsftjvq/

Perhaps there will be regional particularities (e.g., saying ‚Äú—á–æ–±–æ—Ç–∏‚Äù instead of ‚Äú—Å–∞–ø–æ–≥–∏‚Äù for boots, etc) but the language is RUSSIAN. In Kiev, hearing Ukrainian being spoken is extremely rare.  OP, Ukraine is a RUSSIAN SPEAKING COUNTRY. It is confusing, but please, trust me.

It is not as if they will have to accommodate him by speaking to him in Russian ‚Äî- they will automatically address him in Russian before he talks!!! In Portugal, people speak Portuguese, in Spain, people speak Spanish; in Russia and (almost all of) Ukraine, people speak RUSSIAN.

gwxm3	Ukraine is fine for learning Russian, but try to pick a predominantly Russian speaking city: Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro are the big ones. Kyiv is inside the Ukrainian area, so people in small towns and villages near Kyiv speak mixed Ukrainian-Russian, as do recent immigrants from those towns/villages. But since Kyiv is the capital, it is full of highly educated people who are fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian and often English as well. In particular, if you want a native Russian speaker tutor, university educated residents of Kyiv are indeed native speakers of Russian. At worst, they might occasionally use a Ukrainian word instead of standard Russian (–±—É—Ä–∞–∫ instead of —Å–≤—ë–∫–ª–∞, for example).   Note that 100% of Ukrainians everywhere in Ukraine understand Russian perfectly, and always will, because of the influence of YouTube now and television in the past. However, they may not speak Russian fluently due to lack of practice, especially in the Ukrainian areas of the west and north.   Spoken business/technical language in Kyiv is Russian and they speak it perfectly. However, most street signs, packaging and all official documents are Ukrainian. Ukrainian and Russian get more and more similar when the document is full of legal, business, medical, scientific and other technical jargon, so learning to read  business or technical Ukrainian is not that difficult if you are C1 reading in Russian.   A polite way to deal with the language issue anywhere in Ukraine is ask "–í—ã –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π?" (Russian pronunciation of –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ). If yes, proceed in English. If no or a hesitant yes, proceed in Russian. In other words, if someone in Ukraine really hates Russian, you are giving them the option to speak English. If they can't speak English, then they can't complain about being forced to speak Russian.   I did most of my Russian learning in Kyiv, and have been spending 3 months each year there since 2015, plus 16 months straight during the Great Covid Plague of 2020-2021. I don't speak any Ukrainian myself, but I understand enough that if someone (such as young women secretaries in offices) speaks a simple sentence to me in Ukrainian, I can understand and reply in Russian without asking them to translate to Russian. My experience is that learning to listen to Ukrainian at A2 level, and read business/technical documents at C1 level is not difficult if your Russian is B2 listening/C1 reading, and the Ukrainian does not interfere with Russian of it is input only. I would recommend against learning to speak both Ukrainian and Russian until you have mastered one of these languages (presumably Russian, given which reddit we are in), because they conflict so much. In particular, they use different stress for identical words (–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ, for example).	1642045927.0	hsfz308	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsfz308/

opdzd	It can depend on context, but often –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç—å ‚Äì the perfective of –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å ‚Äì comes close, since realizing can be like the moment when you understand something. Or perhaps –≤—Å–ø–æ–º–Ω–∏—Ç—å for the moment when you remember something. Or –æ—Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞—Ç—å, as Whammytap suggests.  When I have a question like this I often check for examples in the [Russian National Corpus](https://ruscorpora.ru/new/search-main.html).

b64fe	I feel like people's explanations of why this is wrong could be better.  –ê in this sense is contraposition. It means that "this is mom" and *by virtue of being mom*, it can't be Dad.   "But" is used to exclude a possible property or state that could exist by the preceding clause. Dad is not a subset of things Mom could be, so saying "this is mom, but not Dad" is at best tautological, but mostly just confusing: of course it's not Dad, you just said it was Mom and Dad-ness can never be a property of Mom. Why are insinuating that "This is Mom, and also Dad" could ever be a possibility?  Compare these two sentences:  - "I am going to the mall, not the grocery store" - "I am going to the mall, but not to buy anything"  The former clarifies that you are going to the mall, expelling any notion that you might've gone to the grocery store instead: it's not possible to do both at the same time. The latter clarifies that while you are going to the mall, you're not going to do something that is possible to do at the mall: buy things.  If Duolingo offered "and" instead of "but", then there'd be a case to be made that they were wrong. These sentences are equivalent (the latter is not idiomatic in most English dialects though):  - This is mom, not dad. - This is mom, and not dad.  But in this case, "but" is clearly incorrect.	1642055404.0	hsggfwj	t3_s28pef	t3_s28pef	/r/russian/comments/s28pef/error_on_my_behalf_or_duolingos_wouldnt_a_but_fit/hsggfwj/

irfa7	Most of Ukraine thinks in Russian, but they are definitely in a phase of trying to switch most things: TV, street signs and the like into Ukrainian. So I‚Äôd say Ukraine is a poor choice if you want full immersion. In addition to Russian, you‚Äôll have Ukrainian words here and there and both will inevitably slip into your vocabulary. And you‚Äôll have less access to purely Russian media, as some are literally banned there. So, the people will speak Russian, but also speak a lot of Ukrainian‚Ä¶ I think this akin to going to the US to learn English and then living in Chinatown where most people speak Chinese AND English.	1642058426.0	hsgkt5a	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsgkt5a/

xt3cp	The meaning is the same in this case since the word "–æ—Å—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" is used in somewhat different meanings. In "–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –æ—Å—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" it refers to the process of cooling, in "–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ –Ω–µ –æ—Å—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç" to the end result of getting sufficiently cool. So "process takes long" and "process doesn't finish for a long time" mean the same if you only care about the end result. In fact if you cared about the process (e.g. heat exchange from the cooling kettle is used for a practical purpose) the meaning would end up somewhat different.	1642059626.0	hsgmfuq	t3_s2tclq	t3_s2tclq	/r/russian/comments/s2tclq/title/hsgmfuq/

b1y15iy	>Native speakers, please correct me if wrong   Unfortunately, this is one of the thing that we mostly use intuitively. I think you have it right, but hopefully there is a way to clarify the difference between "–Ω–æ" and "–∞" a bit more formally.  The best description I found is [here](https://rus.stackexchange.com/questions/423679/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7-%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85).  The main meaning of "–∞" seems to be comparison, juxtaposition, highlighting contrast features: "–Ø –±—É–¥—É –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –∫–ª—é—á –Ω–∞ –∫—É—Ö–Ω–µ, –∞ —Ç—ã –ø–æ–∏—â–∏, –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞, –≤ —Å–ø–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ" means: "I will look for the key in the kitchen, please look for it in the bedroom \[at the same time to best use our time\]". Our activities are not mutually exclusive or logically contradicting at all, we can indeed look for the lost item together in the kitchen, if we want. But I specifically suggest we split our efforts and search in two places, and use "–∞" for that.   "–Ø –±—É–¥—É –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å –∫–ª—é—á –Ω–∞ –∫—É—Ö–Ω–µ, **–∏ —Ç—ã** –ø–æ–∏—â–∏, –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª—É–π—Å—Ç–∞, –≤ —Å–ø–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ" also sounds good and grammatically correct.  But here I probably focus on the fact that you should look for the key too, not just sit on a couch while I am looking for the lost item. :)   The main meaning of "–Ω–æ" is contradiction, exactly as in English "but": "–Ø —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—é—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É, –Ω–æ –µ—ë —Å—ä–µ–ª–∞ —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞" / "I did my homework, but the dog ate it".

3bmg1sm8	You use "a" when you want to convey the idea of "rather than": "This is my mum rather than my dad".

3bmg1sm8	It says "No one was even thinking of delaying it".  In terms of structure, it almost literally says "But delaying it wasn't even in anyone's thoughts", however:  * The word order is reordered to respect the natural topic & comment structure.  * The pronoun is "–Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ" ("no one") rather than "–∫—Ç–æ-–ª–∏–±–æ" (anyone), because the pronounse need to be in negative agreement with the verb.  * The preposition "—É" + genitive is used to convey the possession ("anyone's" ~ "no one's"), and negative pronouns act funny when they see a preposition: you say "–Ω–∏ —É –∫–æ–≥–æ", and not ~~"—É –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ"~~.  * The particle "–∏" is used for emphasis like "even" in my English interpretation above.	1642065786.0	hsgu6rv	t3_s2uent	t3_s2uent	/r/russian/comments/s2uent/–Ω–æ_–Ω–∏_—É_–∫–æ–≥–æ_–∏_–≤_–º—ã—Å–ª—è—Ö_–Ω–µ_–±—ã–ª–æ_—Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å_–æ—Ç–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç—å/hsgu6rv/

Like there was a recent example when a Kazakhstan expert from Kazakhstan was on Ukrainian TV and him and all of the hosts and guests knew Russian as the Lingua Franca. But the host **had** to ask his questions in Ukrainian, which the Kazakh didn't understand, so the host had to ask one of the other guests to translate that into Russian, cause as the host, he couldn't be caught speaking too much Russian.	1642069749.0	hsgz1un	t3_s2m7ri	t1_hsgoget	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsgz1un/

Russian used to be taught in most schools back in my parents time, however nowadays the only mandatory language which is taught in all schools is English. To answer this threads question, knowing Russian and reading the Cyrillic will definitely help you in Bulgaria with reading signs and understanding simple conversations, but it won‚Äôt get you too far. People will mostly understand you when you speak Russian, but they‚Äôll have trouble engaging in conversation, unless perhaps they‚Äôre a bit older.

aiqzuzme	If you‚Äôre going to live in someone else‚Äôs country then of course you should learn their language, that‚Äôs just basic respect for the land you live in. I mean, I get pissed when someone has lived in the USA for 6 years and doesn‚Äôt speak any English. They‚Äôre lazy and don‚Äôt care.  But expecting a tourist to speak your language before coming on vacation is absurd. When I went to Cyprus no one expected me to learn Greek before arriving, using Russian or English was fine. Same thing in Turkey, Mexico and Austria.

ctgr4	For the past few years, the government of Ukraine has been rolling out a series of measures aimed at derussifying the country. For example, new street signs are written either only in Ukrainian or in Ukrainian and English, not Russian. When I first started learning Russian, a few years ago now, wandering around the city and reading signs was very instructive. Now that is impossible.  Another example: This past summer, I visited the Bulgakov House Museum in Kyiv. When I bought my ticket, the babushka at the front desk assured me that the tour would be in Russian, however, when the tour began, another one of the guests demanded that the guide  speak only in Ukrainian 'for political reasons'. The museum ended up refunding my ticket.	1642082261.0	hshixr7	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hshixr7/

3uywgx6a	Oh, you are right. I was just opposing OP and gone little bit too far.  I love winter. -5 to -10 C and snow - it's wonderful. I prefer skiing or unicycling, or just walking. Here in Moscow there are a lot of parks and "forestparks" (out term). In most parks there are trails to walk or cycle and XC ski trails. Apline ski (is it correct term?) places are rather far, in our part of a city there is only one place. You should go deep to suburban to find other places.   City services take away all the snow and it is ok in most streets. They scatter "a salt" to the roads and there is no ice and safe to drive.  Also we used to have weekend travel to some frozen lakes and snowy forests nearby.  Summer is not hot, only couple of week with 30C. Mostly 20C.  One thing bothers me: you can not stay at beach and swim too long, it's steel rather cold for it. Though this summer I spent 1,5 hours in water while crossing Volga in swim event. It was comfortable.  What about your words about premium places. On guy in far north (Ukhta, Komi) told me that the air in north is worse. I don't recall either less pressure or less oxygen, so they have mandatory vacation in south "to breath" as he said.	1642173085.0	hsmxdru	t3_s37a4z	t1_hsmunb4	/r/russian/comments/s37a4z/interesting_russian_words/hsmxdru/

Very often also, final y has the same sound at the end of nouns in final y in accents pronouncing it differently from i in plural ies : levy, levies. The form of the mouth and especially of the lips stays the same as for a short i as in bit but the tongue is more backwards, to the middle of the mouth, as for i in bird.	1642175273.0	hsn2vnx	t3_s38xmg	t3_s38xmg	/r/russian/comments/s38xmg/whats_the_difference/hsn2vnx/

5li67xhe	Thank you everyone for the reply. I appreciate all the different opinions. My plan is to visit Ukraine for 1.5 month. 1 week in Kyiv and the rest in Odesa.  Speaking with a friend in Odesa, majority speak Russian and most businesses have Russian inside (I.e. menus).  Right now Ukraine is the best option for me to immerse in the language.  I am also looking forward to immerse in the Ukraine culture and language.  Also, I wish all the trouble between Russia and Ukraine will stop. And that Ukrainians who are Russian speakers can have their language and culture recognised at the same level as Ukrainian.  Many countries have accepted the colonial past as a fact and have accepted the many generations of these colonial settlers as part of their country. Both culturally and their language. You can not judge the people today based on what their grand parents or great grandparents did. If we judge everyone today based on what the previous generations have done, then we will all go to hell. We simply need to accept the fact.	1642177890.0	hsn9nen	t3_s2m7ri	t3_s2m7ri	/r/russian/comments/s2m7ri/learning_russian_in_ukraine/hsn9nen/

i6ifs44a	Well, you will still spend lots of time learning how to speak and understand Russian like you do in your motherland. It makes more sense when you have some skills in it, let's say A2-B1 in all the 4 types of skills and then you will still learn Russian with a textbook, but in this case the environment will help you and you will have all chances to improve your speaking and listening. Nevertheless, Russians aren't reluctant when it comes to language exchange online, unlike Germans and Koreans.  Regarding your questions  There are 4 types of skills - reading, writing, listening, speaking. Focus on all of them. Yes, you mustn't disregard Grammar as it's the only way to learn this language even if you are a Slav yourself. And don't rely much on your mother tongue. It will only help you in the very beginning.	1642181550.0	hsnj9jy	t3_s3l0zi	t3_s3l0zi	/r/russian/comments/s3l0zi/tips_for_learning_to_speak_russian_like_native/hsnj9jy/

jdz7n	Probably because it doesn't have any punctuation and there's a mistake - it should be –±—É–¥—å –Ω–∞—á–µ–∫—É instead of –±—É–¥—å –Ω–∞ —á–µ–∫—É. This is a fixed expression that means "be wary", and –±—É–¥—å is –±—ã—Ç—å in the imperative. If we punctuate it properly, it would look like this: –ë—É–¥—å –Ω–∞—á–µ–∫—É: –≤ —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –¥–Ω–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Å–ª—É—à–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç —Å—Ç–µ–Ω—ã. –ù–µ–¥–∞–ª–µ–∫–æ –æ—Ç –±–æ–ª—Ç–æ–≤–Ω–∏ –∏ —Å–ø–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏ –¥–æ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—ã.

jya24	All the perfective verbs in your examples describe actions which happen instantaneously and produce some significant change of state. You go to the kitchen, you take the cutlets/chops, and one they've been taken, the state of affairs has changed‚Äîyou can't take them again. Likewise, buying a dog, once accomplished, results in a significant change: the dog becomes your property. Likewise, selling one friend only happens once and results in your losing your friend.  By contrast, the verb in your last example describes eating, which you do repeatedly or habitually, so that the scene before and the scene after have no substantial differences.	1642185841.0	hsnugya	t3_s3y5pk	t3_s3y5pk	/r/russian/comments/s3y5pk/confusion_wih_the_perfective_aspect/hsnugya/

i6ifs44a	Yes, perfective verbs imply a one-time action while imperfective - continuous. But there are numerous context based exceptions, where an imperfective verb means an action in general, whereas a perfective version - a certain action related to the current activity.  Which is again difficult to explain when we are talking about something like —è —Ö–æ—á—É.	1642187933.0	hsnzqr0	t3_s3y5pk	t3_s3y5pk	/r/russian/comments/s3y5pk/confusion_wih_the_perfective_aspect/hsnzqr0/

673o9	Fun fact ‚Äî none of these (+–±—É—Ä–∞–Ω) need actively falling snow, it's mostly about the wind picking up existing snow.

vxm57	As a native speaker, I don't think I understand the difference between these concepts either. Maybe that's because I'm from the very South-West where snowfall is a rare occasion, but I've lived in St Pete where winters are cold and still didn't have to use these words, let alone differentiate between them. Honestly, they sound a tad bit bookish or archaic. –ú–µ—Ç–µ–ª—å must be the least weird and most common of the three but still.	1642209496.0	hspglnw	t3_s46enw	t3_s46enw	/r/russian/comments/s46enw/just_happened_to_me_and_they_are_talking_about/hspglnw/

There are a lot of ads, sometimes there are screensavers with a logo and music, but without a voice. Interviews with people with fuzzy diction and high-tempo speech. But the decision is yours..

lop34	The problem is, palatalized consonants are often perceived as having a short "y" after them. Even the IPA for them has a superscript /j/. In reality there's three options: a distinct "ye" like in "–µ–¥–∞, a "hard e" like in "–ø–∞—Ä—Ç–µ—Ä", and the "soft e" like in –ª–µ—Ç–æ. The latter is somewhere in between e and ye, that' s why even natives argue here about whether or not it should be explained as "ye".  So how do palatalized consonants sound? English doesn't distinguish them, but consider the m in "meet" vs "mob ". I could write the former as "myeet" and that would be the same thing that you're suggesting for "–ª–µ—Ç–æ". But the sound of m is different! The vowel just incorporates that fleeting /j/, same as the Russian e does.	1642421645.0	ht13bjd	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht0h7qg	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht13bjd/

psc30	Don‚Äôt misunderstand, the explanation they‚Äôre giving you is from the perspective of a native Russian. To them, it doesn‚Äôt constitute a ‚Äúye‚Äù. As english speakers, you and I comprehend it differently. It is indeed a ‚Äúye‚Äù sound, it‚Äôs just that the ‚Äúy‚Äù is super slight, it kinda just shadows on the beginning of the word. Otherwise it would just be –ª—ç—Ç–æ.  You‚Äôll notice that even in words that end in ¬´–∏¬ª, it is not a hard ‚Äúee‚Äù, it‚Äôs still almost like a super super slight ‚Äúya‚Äù. Like ¬´–ø–æ–µ—Ö–∞–ª–∏¬ª is not pronounced ‚Äúpah-yeh-kha-lee‚Äù, it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúpah-yeh-kha-lyeh‚Äù  That‚Äôs one of the harder parts of perfecting the Russian pronunciation - learning how to make that slight ‚Äúy‚Äù sound.

psc30	To you as a Russian speaker, there is no ‚Äúy‚Äù. To an English speaker who is learning Russian, there is a distinct Y sound. ¬´–ü–æ–ª—ë—Ç¬ª to us is not ‚Äúpalot‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äúpalyot‚Äù, however slight the ‚Äúy‚Äù may be. Same with –ª–µ—Ç–æ, ‚Äúlyeto‚Äù.  It‚Äôs just that Russians view ‚Äúe‚Äù as a single letter that makes a single sound - this concept doesnt translate into English, all of our vowels make one single sound.

psc30	The e in –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ is a hard ‚Äúyih‚Äù, like a ‚Äúy‚Äù followed by the i in ‚Äúhit‚Äù.  The e in –ª–µ—Ç–æ is like the e in ‚ÄúEdward‚Äù, but with a soft ‚Äúy‚Äù before it.  Are you familiar with palatization?  What‚Äôs really happening is that the consonant before the E is palatized, meaning the middle portion of your tongue is touching the roof of your mouth when you say it. So technically that ‚Äúy‚Äù sound is just a result of your tongue not having left the roof of your mouth yet before you say the ‚Äúe‚Äù. With that in mind, that ‚Äúy‚Äù sound is technically affiliated with the consonant, not the ‚Äúe‚Äù, which is why a Russian would tell you there is no ‚Äúy‚Äù, to them it‚Äôs just how the consonant is being pronounced.	1642437690.0	ht208vn	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht1wsxl	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht208vn/

jdz7n	It was created by Russians for Russians as a Ru-En-Ru dictionary (eventually other languages were added) so why would it have conjugations or stress marks? It doesn't have explanations because it's not an explanatory dictionary (but you can add quick links to wikitionary), but its collection of usage examples is probably unrivaled since reverso has lots of mistakes and mistranslations. Have you ever looked at the phrases section? In terms of the sheer number of definitions it's probably the biggest dictionary out there.	1642444896.0	ht2j92n	t3_s647g8	t1_ht2dpo8	/r/russian/comments/s647g8/this_is_a_good_russian_dictionary/ht2j92n/

2crcoz1k	–º–æ–π/–º–æ—è/–º–æ—ë = 'my'. They are different because they are used with different genders: –º–æ–π with masculine, –º–æ—è with feminine, and –º–æ—ë with neutral gender.   For example, –¥—Ä—É–≥(a friend) is a masculine noun, so if you want to say 'my friend', you should say '–º–æ–π –¥—Ä—É–≥'.   –ü–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞ (a girlfriend) is feminine, then, my girlfriend = –º–æ—è –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞.  –•–æ–±–±–∏(a hobby) is neutral, then, my hobby = –º–æ—ë —Ö–æ–±–±–∏.  *You can guess gender by the last letter(s) of the noun. Nouns, ended by –∞/—è/—Å—Ç—å are normally feminine. Of course, if they don't mean obviously masculine things, for example, father(–ø–∞–ø–∞), uncle(–¥—è–¥—è). Such nouns are obviously masculine gender.  Words, ended by o/e are neutral.  Words ended by hard consonants(for example, –º/–Ω/–≥/–∫/–¥/—Ç/—Ä...) are normally masculine.  It is great simplificantion, of course. Sometimes it can give you false results, but it will work correct in the most cases.	1642445339.0	ht2kfk1	t3_s5m469	t3_s5m469	/r/russian/comments/s5m469/hi_i_am_currently_learning_russian_on_duolingo/ht2kfk1/

jya24	The case of the cardinal is determined by the external grammatical context, i. e. the slot that it fills in a framing construction. If the cardinal + noun construction is the subject of a clause, or the predicative in an existential clause, the cardinal is in the nominative:  * *–î–≤–µ —Å–æ–±–∞—á—å–∏—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—É—Ä—ã —Å—Ç–æ—è–ª–∏ –≤–æ –¥–≤–æ—Ä–µ.* * *–û–¥–Ω–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—É—Ä–∞ —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∞–ª–∏–ª–∞—Å—å.* * *–í –ª–µ—Å—É –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–µ–º—å –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥.*  If the construction is the direct object, the cardinal is in the accusative:  * *–Ø –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª –≤ –ª–µ—Å—É —Å–µ–º—å –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥ –∏ –æ–¥–Ω—É –ª–∏—Å—å—é –Ω–æ—Ä—É.*  If the construction is the genitive complement of another noun, the cardinal is in the genitive:  * *–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∫–∏ —Å–µ–º–∏ –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥* (‚Äúremains of ‚Ä¶‚Äù)  If it occurs in a prepositional phrase, the case is determined by the preposition:  * *—Å —Å–µ–º—å—é –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏–º–∏ –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥–∞–º–∏* * *–∫ —Å–µ–º–∏ –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏–º –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥–∞–º* * *–∏–∑ —Å–µ–º–∏ –º–µ–¥–≤–µ–∂—å–∏—Ö –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥*  Generally, if you want to know what case the cardinal is in, replace the construction with a bare noun and look what case it is in. The cardinal shall have the same case:  * *–±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥–∏*^(nom) *—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç –ø—É—Å—Ç—ã–µ* ~ {*—Å–µ–º—å*^(nom) *–±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥*} *—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç –ø—É—Å—Ç—ã–µ* * *—è –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª –±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥—É*^(acc) ~ *—è –Ω–∞—à—ë–ª* {*—Å–µ–º—å*^(acc) *–±–µ—Ä–ª–æ–≥*} * ‚Ä¶  In your grammar book, the cardinal + noun constructions presumably stand on their own, outside of any clauses or other framing constructions, so there's no context to speak of. So you can safely assume that it's the default case, i. e. nominative.	1642447081.0	ht2p16x	t3_s5p77i	t1_ht2e3eq	/r/russian/comments/s5p77i/can_someone_check_if_everything_is_ok_with_this/ht2p16x/

opdzd	I'm not sure of the value of insisting on a Russian vs non-Russian way of looking at this. Saying –ª–µ—Ç–æ has a 'y' before the 'e' sounds implies a separate 'y' sound, which it isn't ‚Äì as you point out, it's a feature of the palatalized consonant. Without that awareness I'm not sure how learners can distinguish the sounds in, say,  –ø–æ–ª—å—ë—Ç and –ø–æ–ª—ë—Ç, –ø–æ–¥—ä–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å and –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂, –æ–±—ä–µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å and –æ–±–µ–¥.    It may be helpful for the OP to hear examples of a native speaker pronouncing words that highlight this contrast, in [this video](https://youtu.be/JdoCUN6QSb4); and at 1:29, there are images of waveforms that show the 'y' \[j\] as a separate sound in –ª—å—ë—Ç as opposed to –ª—ë–¥.	1642448345.0	ht2sf6m	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht208vn	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht2sf6m/

60nkf	I just remembered another misadventure from my time studying abroad.  My (American) friend and I wanted some pizza but it was snowing so we decided to order delivery to our dorm. We called the restaurant, struggled our way through ordering, they told us it would be 45 minutes, and we waited.  And waited. And waited. After about an hour and a half, my phone rang and it was the driver saying he was in the building. We told him we'd go down to the lobby but he wasn't there. We tried to give him directions (poorly) He kept calling back and he was getting angrier and angrier but we just could not understand each other.  We went outside looking for him and we finally saw him in front of the wrong building down the street.  We waved him down and he drove up with our pizzas. He was visibly annoyed with us.  Then he saw that my friend was wearing a shirt that said "–Ø –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è" and he busted out laughing hysterically. He was like "Russian but not good at Russian language??" We had a nice laugh with him and gave him a massive tip. Every time we got pizza from them after that he'd be like "My Russian girls!

168j6g	Although there is a very short '–π' produced between palatalized consonants and vowels, the quality of the consonant is more important. For example those 4 syllables are pronounced differently: –ª–∞-–ª—è-–ª—ä—è-–ª—å—è. Russians can hear and recognize this difference. If you focus on the short '–π', it will be hard to distinguish –ª—è-–ª—å—è. If you can hum or hiss the hard consonant for several seconds, you can do it to the palatalized version as well (—Ä-—Ä—å may be the exception). Try it with —Å-—Å—å, –≤-–≤—å, –ª-–ª—å, —Ö-—Ö—å. You can also do it with –º-–º—å-–Ω-–Ω—å, but you'll just be humming in 4 different tones.  If you keep humming '–ª—å' and finish with '–∞' without a pause, you'll end up pronouncing '–ª—è'. Additional short '–π', if any, will be produced naturally.	1642451376.0	ht30a4d	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht208vn	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht30a4d/

1fvilplw	Actually that's an interesting point. Indeed, the default pronunciation of –∏ is like the vowel in "eel", rather than the starting sound in "yield". That said, the original commenter is actually correct on point 3 for –∏:  [–ë—É–∫–≤–∞ –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —å –æ–±–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–µ—Ç –∑](https://phoneticonline.ru/pravila.html)[–≤—É–∫ \[–π'–∏\]. –†—É—á—å–∏ ‚Üí \[—Ä—É—á'–π'–∏\].](https://phoneticonline.ru/pravila.html)  I'm not so sure about point 2 though. To my ears rendering of –º–æ–∏ as \[–º–∞–π–∏\] or \[–º–∞–∏\] both sound correct, so it might be the case \[–π–∏\] and \[–∏\] after vowels are [allophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone).	1642456179.0	ht3cowp	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht2y5hk	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht3cowp/

bybipzc7	I have tried many apps so far and Speakly is frankly the best one in my opinion. I work as a ux designer so I really appreciate the ux and ui. I also really like that the app introduces new concepts very gradually. I think the vocabulary is chosen very carefully so that learners (especially beginners) are first presented with the most essential words and phrases.   In my opinion it‚Äôs way batter than Lingvist for example because there is no risk that the app will start showing you more advanced words when you are not ready to learn them yet.

11jn5n	What you have is the genitive case as declined for feminine nouns.

jdz7n	They should teach that in the Notes section that comes with lessons. It used to be available only for desctop version, but I think somebody said that Notes are now visible in the app too.  Regardless, Duolingo Russian doesn't have a very good reputation.

psc30	They are trying to learn pronunciation. They‚Äôre not looking at it from a linguistic perspective, it‚Äôs simply about what they‚Äôre hearing. The reason why something is pronounced a specific way is a whole other demon. The comment was telling them ‚Äúthere is no ‚Äòy‚Äô sound‚Äù, ‚Äú–ø–æ–ª—ë—Ç is just palot‚Äù, which is gonna be super conflicting for them, because there is a distinct Y, wherever it comes from.   My goal was to at least address the sound they were talking about, and then give them some context as to where it comes from, but outright denying that the Y exists is not, in my opinion, an effective way of communicating what‚Äôs happening in the word.	1642459567.0	ht3l6yy	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht2sf6m	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht3l6yy/

180zhn28	It's absolutely useless for foreign learners, since the exceptions listed here include only those which are not stressed in conjugation so the vowel reduction takes place. There are countless more verbs ending with –µ—Ç—å in second declension like –≥–ª—è–¥–µ—Ç—å which are not listed here because they are stressed in conjugation. But learners of the language don't actually know where to put a stress, they don't have intuition for it like natives.	1642459737.0	ht3lmby	t3_s65br2	t1_ht1jk2o	/r/russian/comments/s65br2/how_to_tell_which_russian_verbs_get_which/ht3lmby/

s1vmz	Hey, so I mean absolutely no hate whatsoever but almost every part of your last sentence is wrong.  - –∏—Å–∫–∞–ª—å is not a word. "–Ø –±—ã –∏—Å–∫–∞–ª" sounds like "I would be searching" but it would be better to say "–Ø –∏—â—É" - "I'm looking for", or maybe "–Ø —Ö–æ—á—É –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏" - "I want to find", or even "–Ø —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª –±—ã –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏" - "I would like to find" if you love the particle –±—ã. - Channel is –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª - The latter clause can get complicated. You could try "–≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º" - "in which", or simply "–≥–¥–µ" - "where". Then, either "—è –º–æ–≥—É" - "I can", or "–º–Ω–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ" - literally "it's allowed for me" but it's just another way of saying "I can".  Don't get discouraged from trying, and you definitely don't deserve hate for it! But it's possible that you could use more lessons before you're ready to speak with natives and they just don't have the patience to correct you.	1642466382.0	ht41avw	t3_s6ece6	t3_s6ece6	/r/russian/comments/s6ece6/a_forum_for_learners/ht41avw/

This reminds me of when Russians try to explain the –®/–© contrast by having an English speaker say *shoe* and *sheet*‚Äîthe English speaker uses the same sound in both words, but the Russian speaker pronounces them differently because of L1 interference, and so assumes that the English speaker will do the same.	1642473118.0	ht4h8cl	t3_s5vtha	t1_ht13bjd	/r/russian/comments/s5vtha/how_do_i_know_when_–µ_makes_an_e_sound_or_an_ye/ht4h8cl/

That said, you can consider some usage examples and try to intuit a difference between the prepositions when they‚Äôre both *for* in English. *–¥–ª—è* tends to precede a recipient or benefactor: *–ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä–æ–∫ –¥–ª—è —Ç–µ–±—è* ‚Äúa gift for you‚Äù, *–í–æ–∫–∑–∞–ª –¥–ª—è –¥–≤–æ–∏—Ö* ‚ÄúTrain Station for Two‚Äù (a film). *–Ω–∞* tends to precede more abstract concepts that can‚Äôt receive anything: *—Å—É–ø –Ω–∞ –æ–±–µ–¥* ‚Äúsoup for lunch‚Äù, *–ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Ç—å —á—Ç–æ-–ª. –Ω–∞ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ* ‚Äúrub sth. for good luck‚Äù.	1642475850.0	ht4nv1m	t3_s5wkkc	t3_s5wkkc	/r/russian/comments/s5wkkc/–Ω–∞_–∏–ª–∏_–¥–ª—è/ht4nv1m/

However if you are required to fill up forms, you are encouraged to use block letters to avoid misunderstandings.

7pascwg1	I've listened to 3 or 4 interviews for about a minute each and couldn't pick anything too different from modern Russian.  The interviewer speaks with some sort of Old Moscow pronunciation, but contemporary Soviet media persons sound the same. Old Moscow accent in interviewees is very weak or absent at all.  (Goldenweiser has soft –¶ in front of –ò: —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é–¶–¨–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π, –Ω–∞–¶–¨–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ, –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞–¶–¨–∏–∏; Naumov has said —Ä–∏—à–∫–Ω—É–ª instead of —Ä–∏—Å–∫–Ω—É–ª, but I suspect it's just a slip of a tongue; someone else has said something like –Ω–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞–º–∏, but I think he uses plural in a mocking manner, which is common in Russian).

bybipzc7	I have tried many apps so far and Speakly is frankly the best one in my opinion. I work as a ux designer so I really appreciate the ux and ui. I also really like that the app introduces new concepts very gradually. I think the vocabulary is chosen very carefully so that learners (especially beginners) are first presented with the most essential words and phrases.   In my opinion it‚Äôs way batter than Lingvist for example because there is no risk that the app will start showing you more advanced words when you are not ready to learn them yet.

7pascwg1	Based on my school memories:  A sentence that has any other words besides subject and predicate is "—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ".  A sentence that has both subject and predicate is "–ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–µ" (not sure how this concept applies to impersonal sentences, I guess they would be "full" as well).  I don't remember anything about "–æ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è/–æ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—è—é—â–∏–µ —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã" from school, but yandexing shows that those are sentences that have forms of address, introductory words and parallel constructions/coordinated member (here's [a table](https://fsd.multiurok.ru/html/2020/04/13/s_5e93933e99d10/1415627_1.jpeg)). I guess the difference between "—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ" and "–æ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ" is that the former only has descriptors of subject and predicate, while the latter can have coordinated members.	1642514117.0	ht6csxb	t3_s6xov4	t3_s6xov4	/r/russian/comments/s6xov4/little_help_with_syntax_problem/ht6csxb/

aef0b6v5	Foreign languages are compulsory in school curriculum, I believe 90% is English, no less, there are some schools focused on other languages like French, Spanish or Chinese but they are rare.  The level though are very low practically in every ordinary school - big classes, low motivation, unrealistic programmes whe  kids are supposed to cover more than they're really able to within these hours.   But there are a lot of language schools as extra curriculum, great amount of kids (at least in big cities) attend either these groups (5-10 people most often), or study individually. Many study with private teachers. These kids get good results.	1642531820.0	ht7mc0f	t3_s73d92	t3_s73d92	/r/russian/comments/s73d92/how_common_is_it_for_russians_to_learnspeak/ht7mc0f/

cywnw	Historic sound changes. /g/ underwent lenition (a process in which a consonant becomes ‚Äúweaker‚Äù) in some East Slavic dialects. The value of –ì in modern Belarusian is […£], and Ukrainian has something like [ ï ~ …¶], depending on the environment and who you ask. In the genitive case endings, these weaker consonants evidently got dropped between vowels entirely before being separated again by the insertion of [v] in Russian.  As is so often the case in languages whose spellings don‚Äôt seem to match their pronunciations, nobody bothered to change the spelling when all this was going on, so these genitive case endings in Russian still have a trace of the historic pronunciation in them. In that regard, the answer to this question is the same as the answer to ‚ÄúWhy does *knife* have a silent K at the beginning and a silent E at the end?‚Äù Once upon a time, we pronounced them!	1642571364.0	hta8jjy	t3_s5jgau	t1_hsz4eax	/r/russian/comments/s5jgau/how_to_pronounce_–Ω–µ–≥–æ/hta8jjy/

xcxic	I'd say it's very do-able to be fluent in 3 years depending on the depth of conversations you'd like to have.   I was able to have super basic conversations 3 months into my learning (–ö–∞–∫ –≤–∞—Å –∑–æ–≤—É—Ç? –ì–¥–µ –≤—ã –∂–∏–≤–µ—Ç–µ? —è –ª—é–±–ª—é –º–æ—Ä–æ–∂–µ–Ω–æ–µ. –£ –º–µ–Ω—è –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞. –∫–∞–∫—É—é –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É —Ç—ã —á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—à—å?). 4-6 months is probably where your vocabulary will expand a lot and you'll be able to hold increasingly more difficult (but still basic) conversations.   I did not study every day because I'm busy and if I get too stressed from learning, I get burnt out. I do put in hours, but it varies from week to week and my mood/interest. I'd say if you do at minimum 2-3 hrs a week (30 mins x 6 days), you'd get pretty far.	1642577208.0	htahjf6	t3_s7cjiy	t3_s7cjiy	/r/russian/comments/s7cjiy/how_long_would_it_take_to_go_from_no_russian_to/htahjf6/

xcxic	As someone who JUST learned it at the start of this year (for this sub's handwriting contest), I recommend to do it early on. My teacher told me I would never have a need or use for Russian cursive being based in the US. But then she started assigning reading assignments that would have italics (that default to Russian cursive) or have instructions entirely in cursive. It was extremely frustrating because I didn't know any of it!   It took me about a week to learn it and it didn't take time away from learning Russian. If anything, it re-ignited my passion to learn!	1642577781.0	htaic8v	t3_s6v99y	t3_s6v99y	/r/russian/comments/s6v99y/would_it_be_better_if_i_learned_russian_cursive/htaic8v/

89lzwm6d	It took me around a year to hold basic conversations , although I think I held myself back by spending too much time studying grammar.   Once I changed my approach and started listening and repeating , doing audio courses my ability to speak went up a lot. Two years in now I can hold conversations to a basic level , day to day stuff. Now my aim is to acquire vocabulary , this is very slow going. I think consistency is key when learning anything especially languages.  I think it's very possible to get to a good level in three years with the right approach.	1642589561.0	htaxi2m	t3_s7cjiy	t3_s7cjiy	/r/russian/comments/s7cjiy/how_long_would_it_take_to_go_from_no_russian_to/htaxi2m/

You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you! You are not proffesional, because proffesionals knew how to lose and congratulate opponents, you are like a girl crying after i beat you! Be brave, be honest to yourself and stop this trush talkings!!! Everybody know that i am very good blitz player, i can win anyone in the world in single game! And "w"esley "s"o is nobody for me, just a player who are crying every single time when loosing, ( remember what you say about Firouzja ) !!! Stop playing with my name, i deserve to have a good name during whole my chess carrier, I am Officially inviting you to OTB blitz match with the Prize fund! Both of us will invest 5000$ and winner takes it all! I suggest all other people who's intrested in this situation, just take a look at my results in 2016 and 2017 Blitz World championships, and that should be enough... No need to listen for every crying babe, Tigran Petrosyan is always play Fair ! And if someone will continue Officially talk about me like that, we will meet in Court! God bless with true! True will never die ! Liers will kicked off...

4m93q407	Not an expert per se, but as far as I know its a bit like prepositions in English. You could create a rule but it will have a ton of exceptions to each case.  The basic rule i was taught for these when I first started learning was –≤ is to be used for enclosed spaces, and –Ω–∞ for wide, open spaces.  –Ø –≤ —à–∫–æ–ª–µ; —è –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–æ—â–∞–¥–∏.  Everything else should probably be picked up by immersion. For example, is —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ (where you work) a wide open space or an enclosed area? Depends where you work, but the correct way is —è –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–µ.	1642592091.0	htb0ztc	t3_s7nzzx	t3_s7nzzx	/r/russian/comments/s7nzzx/i_still_dont_understand_the_difference_of_usage/htb0ztc/

3llpe	It depends on so much factors that it's impossible to answer: your age, your natural proficiency in acquiring languages, which material you have access to, how much time you can afford to spend on it...  The [US Foreign Service Institute](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) considers Russian a Category III language, meaning they estimate it takes 44 weeks to reach full working proficiency, which is of course quite a bit more than just being able to hold a conversation. But this is for studying the language *full-time*, they mention 1100 class hours, i.e. 25 hours a week, which is in itself already very hard for a casual leaner who has other responsibilities like study/work, but students are also expected to work on the language outside of class.  That being said, if you work consistently at least an hour every day, 6 months is very reasonable for having simple conversations.	1642606306.0	htbti1m	t3_s7cjiy	t3_s7cjiy	/r/russian/comments/s7cjiy/how_long_would_it_take_to_go_from_no_russian_to/htbti1m/

After a while you will remember most scenarios just from the sentence and not from the rules. You don't even think about it.

yzmjx	> I think in German or English I don't really do that much with the middle of my tongue  Der Deutsche Ich-Laut ist ein palataler Konsonant (der palatale Frikativ). Die russischen Konsonanten sind palatalisiert, nicht palatal. Palatal bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge ber√ºhrt den harten Gaumen, und palatalisiert bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge n√§hert sich ihm. Aber beide klingen sehr √§hnlich.  Hast du versucht, die palatalisierten Konsonanten mit zur√ºckgerollter Zunge auszusprechen? Das ist etwas v√∂llig anderes. Das w√ºrde man ‚Äûretroflex‚Äù nennen.  >Sure, but the name doesn't tell you which part of your tongue goes to your palate.  Das ist ein phonetischer Begriff.

I‚Äôm learning now to write in cursive and will be writing down new words and sentences in a notebook. I don‚Äôt think writing Russian with Roman alphabet would work for me.

jya24	Btw., there's a funny ambiguous sentence familiar to almost anyone who has studied linguistics in Russia: *–≠—Ç–∏ —Ç–∏–ø—ã —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏ –µ—Å—Ç—å –≤ —Ü–µ—Ö–µ*. It can be parsed either as ‚ÄúThese kinds of steel can be found in the workshop‚Äù or ‚ÄúThese fellows began to eat in the workshop‚Äù. In the first reading, *—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏* is the genitive singular of the noun *—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å* = ‚Äústeel‚Äù, and *–µ—Å—Ç—å* is the present indicative of *–±—ã—Ç—å*. In the second reading, *—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏* is the plural past indicative of the verb *—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å* = ‚Äúbegin / become‚Äù, and *–µ—Å—Ç—å* = ‚Äúeat‚Äù is its dependent infinitival.	1642614745.0	htcfplm	t3_s7uqw0	t1_htcb3il	/r/russian/comments/s7uqw0/–Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ_–Ω–µ_–ª—é–±–∏—Ç_–∏–º–µ—Ç—å_–ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã_or–Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ_–Ω–µ_–ª—é–±–∏—Ç/htcfplm/

5lsu0fou	I had that issue with Serbian. My solution is the same as most people have suggested. HUGE amounts of input. Use the extension "Language Reactor" on Chrome and click on the words you don't know. The extension can translate and save them for you. Review the words (however you want, I prefer to just read them from time to time), then REWATCH the videos, ideally multiple times until you understand 90-95%. You don't have to rewatch the same video multiple times in a row, you can of course watch other videos but make sure you rewatch the same videos from time to time.  Russian Progress and Russian with Max are your best friends from now on. Listen to their podcasts too, the level is usually higher.  Artyom is an accomplished language learner, he explains his method here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrulOnlisWQ  I prefer a high tech solution to using a notebook, which is why I use Language Reactor instead.

It's a lot safer to just assume that women are not into you and not trying to flirt, unless they make it crystal clear that's their intentions.

3mmwfahk	One story told about the origin of this phrase suggests that it came from Odessa: "—Ñ–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω—ã" were drinking fountains that tapped into the underground artesian water wells (the Fountain districts were named after them: see [here](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π_–§–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω_(–û–¥–µ—Å—Å–∞)#–ü—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ_–Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è), for instance), and Odessans could tell the difference between water shipped in from elsewhere and drawn from these drinking fountains. So, if someone would offer them outside water, they would opine: "–ù–µ —Ñ–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω".  As with any folk etymology, this story should be taken with a mountain of salt, but it's simple enough that it's perfectly plausible :)	1642624532.0	htd66rx	t3_s7yrel	t1_htczt40	/r/russian/comments/s7yrel/—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞_–Ω–µ_—Ñ–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω_do_you_actually_use_this_phrase/htd66rx/

ff11u002	No its not because it's a different script it's because you haven't spent enough raw time with the language via immersion. Through reading a ton and listening a ton. Sounds like you have too much grammar study and not enough immersion study which is common in schools.  As someone who has he exact opposite problem after spending well over 1,000 hours just listening alone and who knows how much reading in russian with maybe 50 being grammar study I can't explain most grammar rules but have no problem putting them to use from pure exposure.  Start reading a couple hours a day and do vocab study through a SRS program and I will bet within 3 months your vocab will absolutely skyrocket and it will finally "stick" Reading is key for acquiring vocab and if your not doing some sort of reading everyday it's just never gonna stick.  It takes tons of repetition of words seeing then in the context of sentences for them to become ingrained in you. Exact same advice goes for listening.	1642625847.0	htd9s0x	t3_s7rv3r	t3_s7rv3r	/r/russian/comments/s7rv3r/does_anyone_else_have_good_understanding_of/htd9s0x/
a0qlz566	>Der Deutsche Ich-Laut ist ein palataler Konsonant (der palatale Frikativ). Die russischen Konsonanten sind palatalisiert, nicht palatal. Palatal bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge ber√ºhrt den harten Gaumen, und palatalisiert bedeutet dass die Mitte der Zunge n√§hert sich ihm.  Interessant, das wusste ich nicht. Hab mich aber auch noch nie mit der deutschen Phonetik besch√§ftigt. Nur mit der englischen in der Uni. Da gibts ja soweit ich wei√ü zumindest keine palatalen oder palatalisierten Phoneme (anders als im Russischen).   Wahrscheinlich w√ºrde es sich aber mal lohnen, mir auch die deutsche Phonetik mal anzuschauen. Je besser man die Eigenheiten der eigenen Aussprache kennt, desto besser kann man dann einen starken Akzent in anderen Sprachen vermeiden.

The latter sounds more informal IMO. Also, the former is informal too - applied to people you call "—Ç—ã".

yzmjx	>Danke f√ºr die Artikel, die Bilder sind tats√§chlich recht n√ºtzlich.  Kein Ding :)  >Retroflexe Aussprache von Konsonanten klingt sehr anstrengend :D.  Aa, noch etwas: In manchen Quellen (z.B. englische und spanische Wikipedias) wird der Begriff ‚Äûretroflex‚Äù √∂fter auch f√ºr Laute, die nicht wahr retroflex sind, sondern nur unpalatalisiert. Beispielsweise werden in dieser Art die russichen —à und –∂ im IPA als / Ç/ und / ê/ transkribiert. Aber diese Laute haben keine wahre Retroflexion (die Zunge wird nicht zur√ºckgerollt). Also musst du dir keine Anstrengung damit machen.  Auf der polnischen und deutschen Wikipedia werden sie, richtigerweise, als /‚Å† É‚Å†/ und ‚Äã/‚Å† í‚Å†/ (posalveolare Konsonanten) transkribiert.  Es ist verwirrend und ich bin nicht sicher warum es diesen Unterschied gibt. Die englische Wikipedia sagt, dass die postalveolaren Konsonanten im englischen, deutschen, italienischen usw. eigentlich swach palatalisiert sind, und die im russischen oder polnischen, die √ºberhaupt keine Palatalisation haben, deshalb mit den Symbolen f√ºr die retroflexen Laute transkribiert werden. Ich finde diesen Grund dumm, aber was kann ich tun?  Ich sage dies alles, damit du selbst von der Transkription nicht verwirrt wirdst.  Sprachen mit wahren retroflexen Lauten sind z.B. Schwedisch, Hindi, Tamil und Amerikanisches Englisch (amerikanisches *r*).	1642635262.0	htdy8jm	t3_s737cf	t1_htdbgob	/r/russian/comments/s737cf/i_think_i_finally_understood_what_i_was_doing/htdy8jm/

Additionally, despite there being some patterns/general rules, having to learn two forms of every very and remember which is which is a lot.

8mm42qpr	This word shares the root with the word ¬´–ª–∏—Ç—å¬ª which means to pour. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre singing and pouring the song out in the world. As for the meaning, I‚Äôd say in English it‚Äôs closer to the word ‚Äúflow‚Äù rather than ‚Äúpour‚Äù. So I feel like in this context ¬´–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞¬ª is the flow of the song or one specific chorus, hook of the song that is the most pleasant and memorable.  It‚Äôs totally not a name.

jya24	It's a diminutive, but not a person's nickname. Rather, it's an epithet for a song or tune which can also be called by the adjective *–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–∏—Å—Ç—ã–π*, i. e. sonorous and modulating.  Also, to believe the singer and folklore collector S. N. Starostin (see [this page](https://www.pravda.ru/culture/1623803-naigrishi/)), *–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞* in this song is likely a corruption of *–∑–∞–≤–∏–¥–æ—á–∫–∞*, which means a song from the village of Zavidovo.	1642694507.0	hth0bmy	t3_s8kr6y	t3_s8kr6y	/r/russian/comments/s8kr6y/–∑–∞–ª–∏–≤–æ—á–∫–∞_meaning/hth0bmy/

gwxm3	People complaining about stress, aspect, cases, verbs of motion, etc are learning wrong. The hard part is vocabulary, which is much less cognate to English than that of Romance or Germanic languages. If you spend 80% of effort listening to native recordings (with transcripts so you can look up unknown words), then stress and grammar are learned automatically, like a native learns them. You also get a better pronunciation, better feel for natural expression style in Russian and of course vastly better listening ability. But you'll still have to learn vocabulary one by one, and even ordinary conversation can use a 10K non-cognate vocabulary (–º–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–∫, –≥–≤–æ–∑–¥—å, –≤–∏–Ω—Ç, –æ—Ç–≤—ë—Ä—Ç–∫–∞, –≥–∞–π–∫–∞, –∫–ª–µ—â–∏, –∏ —Ç.–¥.)	1642695128.0	hth1ygj	t3_s8cyn3	t3_s8cyn3	/r/russian/comments/s8cyn3/ask_english_native_speakers_what_are_the_most/hth1ygj/

zv2tv	Like many old short words, "—Ç–∞–∫" has a lot of close shades of meaning. Literally, "—Ç–∞–∫"="thus" is the answer to "–∫–∞–∫?"="how". But in your two examples the underlying meaning of "—Ç–∞–∫" is a little different.  [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA#Russian)  In the first, it's mentioned in the wiktionary: "—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ" = "never". You can parse it literally as "You still didn't say" = "–¢—ã —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª". "–¢–∞–∫ –∏" has a sense of continuing the same way. "–û–Ω —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª –ø–ª—ã—Ç—å –ø–æ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—é". "–¢—ã —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞–ª –Ω–µ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –º–Ω–µ, –∫–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å" - a little clunky but grammatically it works.  In the second example, "I told Tom exactly this", "–∏" usually means that you agree with some previous statement. "–Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: –Ω–µ –µ—à—å –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã!" (I told Tom this: don't eat unfamiliar mushrooms") is one step from a dialogue like this:  >B: –¢–æ–º –≤—á–µ—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—Å—è –≥—Ä–∏–±–∞–º–∏   >   >A: –Ø –±—ã –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã –Ω–∏ –∑–∞ —á—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–∞–ª –µ—Å—Ç—å   >   >B: –Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª: –Ω–µ –µ—à—å –Ω–µ–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∏–±—ã! (what B said to Tom doesn't need to exactly coincide with what A said to B, but B still emphasizes his agreement with A's sentiment.)   >   >B: –Ø –¢–æ–º—É —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª! - (also works, what exactly B said to Tom is implied. In this instance it's not very clear, maybe my example is not the best, or maybe B is not clinically precise in his everyday speech)  If it seems weird that "how/thus" means "what/this", it's not rare but not very common. "–ö–∞–∫ –æ–Ω –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–ª?" = "What did he do?" (in English there is "how did he behave" which has a similar weirdness of how \~ what). It *is* especially common around verbs of speech, I don't logically understand the nuances well enough to explain it. Why is it "–¢–∞–∫ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞", and not "–ß—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞" or "–≠—Ç–æ –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∏–ª –ó–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∞"?	1642698494.0	hthb4qp	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthb4qp/
h3qjoj2	¬´–¢–∞–∫¬ª has a meaning that quite hard to explain. It means something like "so" in the way "how the things are", or "how the things should be", or "like this", or "this way". –Ø —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî I said so. –Ø —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª —ç—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫ ‚Äî I said it this way.  ¬´–ò¬ª, when added to verbs, used for emphasis, kinda like that the action is "really" happened. –Ø –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –µ–º—É —ç—Ç–æ ‚Äî I did say to him/So I said to him.  ¬´–¢–∞–∫ –∏¬ª combines them into emphasis on the action being exact. –Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –µ–º—É –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî I said to him exactly this. Also used a lot in sarcastic tone: –¢–∞–∫ —è –µ–º—É —ç—Ç–æ –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî Like I'd say to him this.  ¬´–¢–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ¬ª is a set expression that means "still didn't/haven't". Like "how the things are, did not change" –¢—ã –º–Ω–µ —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª ‚Äî You still haven't said to me.  P.S. we also have ¬´-—Ç–∞–∫–∏¬ª that means something like "actually", "apparently" or "finally". –û–Ω-—Ç–∞–∫–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –º–Ω–µ ‚Äî He finally said to me.	1642698511.0	hthb6f7	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthb6f7/

jya24	This *–∏* is a kind of emphatic particle, very approximately meaning ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúexactly‚Äù, ‚Äúquite‚Äù. However, your two examples are different. In *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –¢–æ–º—É –∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª*, the adverb *—Ç–∞–∫* simply means ‚Äúthus‚Äù, ‚Äúso‚Äù, ‚Äúin such a way‚Äù. The particle *–∏* can be dropped, removing the emphasis: *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ –¢–æ–º—É —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª* (or, with a more neutral word order: *–Ø —Ç–∞–∫ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –¢–æ–º—É*) means ‚ÄúI said so to Tom‚Äù. With the particle, it means ‚ÄúThat's exactly what I said to Tom.‚Äù  On the other hand, *—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ* has become a set expression: *S —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –Ω–µ V-–ª* = ‚ÄúS never V-ed‚Äù, ‚ÄúX failed to V‚Äù. The *—Ç–∞–∫* in it has more or less lost all independent meaning, like, e. g., *-so-* in English *whatsoever*.	1642698754.0	hthbu2z	t3_s8lt3r	t3_s8lt3r	/r/russian/comments/s8lt3r/what_does_—Ç–∞–∫_–∏_mean/hthbu2z/

In my time, we had like 31 hours of high math alone per week, it's brain raping even for a 17 y.o. recent math-specialized high school graduate. We had a couple of 30 years old students, they dropped after the 1st year.

7bwehon1	From you saying its weird and nothing like Latin I think you're focusing too much on your prior knowledge of the latin script.  Its meant to be different because its not the Latin script. Its Cyrillic, its written in the way Cyrillic is meant to be written. The only reason there are 'common' letters between Latin and Cyrillic is because they both come from the same ancestor. Im sure ancient greeks would argue the way we write the letters from their alphabet is weird and nothing like theirs too tbf  You can adjust and have your own way of writing by all means as long as you can read it yourself. But its worth taking time to study cursive a little, not only does it help writing fast but in some text fonts theres a semi cursive semi print style so knowing the cursive helps with that at least. E.g —Ç will be written as m etc.	1642703866.0	hthpzol	t3_s8n4vl	t1_hthhws4	/r/russian/comments/s8n4vl/should_i_write_in_print_or_cursive_cursive_is/hthpzol/

i6ifs44a	Get a textbook with structured lessons (vocab+grammar with audio) with increasing difficulty. Beware of books that force you to learn whole phrases without understanding what its words mean separately and why they have their exact endings. Linguistics manuals aren't good either. It should have exercises with keys too. You will need a help of a native speaker from the beginning, because books don't talk and Russian pronunciation will seem ridiculously hard unless you can speak Polish.   Forget about unadapted movies and books , you have to dive deep into Grammar and linguistic stuff. Learning apps should be an addition to your learning plan, but not its core.	1642705750.0	hthv5nm	t3_s8e8wi	t3_s8e8wi	/r/russian/comments/s8e8wi/recommendations_for_beginners/hthv5nm/

634opeto	¬´–ß—Ç–æ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ¬ª isn‚Äôt even a mistake, it‚Äôs antiquated. The ¬´—á—Ç–æ¬ª modifies the ¬´—Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ¬ª. It‚Äôs not meant to be temporal, but to emphasize how little significance the action has.   It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI only just‚Äù in English. Excessive, but not grammatically wrong.   I personally find the temporal modifier stuck between two verbs more offensive.	1642720833.0	htiw5of	t3_s8ljtx	t1_hthctrw	/r/russian/comments/s8ljtx/what_do_you_feel_reading_this/htiw5of/
