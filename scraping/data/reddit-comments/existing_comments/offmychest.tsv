io9xevlk	I‚Äôm glad to hear that you could get even the littlest nudge forward out of this. It is very hard. I feel so bad for them. They‚Äôre so sweet and suffered so much from my carelessness. We need to make amends with ourselves by really taking steps to not repeat it again (as someone said in the comments previously). We need to work to be better people. We can ask them to forgive us and show thru our actions we are making efforts. They might never forgive us. We have to make peace with that. I hope you found comfort in the fact that you‚Äôre not alone in this. Hope we both do better. Take care ‚ù§Ô∏è	1642704480.0	hthrpcm	t3_s8l53k	t1_hthpepy	/r/offmychest/comments/s8l53k/i_traumatized_a_beautiful_person/hthrpcm/

dxjycuqp	I never said "I" was offended, now did I?   Even beyond that, your question is quite easy to answer. Someone can feel as if the reject is unjust because it is based off something that they cannot control. For example, what if you rejected someone for their ethnicity? People do it all the time. Some people date exclusively within their race, other people do not. And they have every right to do so, do they not? It's no different.	1642704566.0	hthrxsk	t3_s8p77d	t1_hthqi37	/r/offmychest/comments/s8p77d/i_cant_believe_im_called_shallow_for_having_the/hthrxsk/

3plksabc	Have you tried messaging classmates? I think texting them about class and maybe moving forward with talking in person. It seems that you are lacking confidence in yourself and maybe working out and getting into better shape can help. You can start off by walking to places nearby and joggin, Etc. It can be better than sitting down watching tv and eating bad. Small things like that can maybe help you get out of the slump your in. If you boost your confidence then it could be easier to talk to people in general.

6uw1p9f	I don't doubt that you've likely had some terrible experiences and traumas to have developed this mindset. But you're consciously choosing to give up your own power by letting the actions of a few people (and they are very few; there's almost 8 billion people in the world so you can't have met them all) decide what you are worth to the world.  You also sound like you would rather dedicate your energy to being resentful towards what you percieve to be "attractive" people, than to work on learning to like yourself.  You can't control what other people do. But you can control yourself. And one of the things you can do for yourself is look into some therapy to figure out how to move past what others have done or not done to you, to make you feel like they own your very worth.	1642704902.0	hthsv2c	t3_s8n86p	t1_hthr1kw	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/hthsv2c/

c10nf93y	If you truly believe everyone has a right to reject anyone based on anything, than no reason is "unjust". A romantic relationship is not a college application or a job offer. Everyone has things about themselves they have no control over and can't change.   You can't *make* anyone like you or date you, for whatever reason. You can't sue them and over-ride their decision not to date you just because you think it's "unfair".	1642704936.0	hthsyfa	t3_s8p77d	t1_hthrxsk	/r/offmychest/comments/s8p77d/i_cant_believe_im_called_shallow_for_having_the/hthsyfa/

aw08pc3w	I don't think I will get anywhere if my life remains the same.  It seems it will remain the way it is for some time because I don't have motivation to do anything.  I remember when I was in high school with my friends, hanging out every weekend and doing crazy shit without having to care about anything else. Those were the daysüòÇ.  Growing up sucks if you don't know what you want to do with your life.   It's so crazy how we are 'forced' to choose the thing we will do for the rest of our lives when we are 18.

en0x4n9m	Thank you so much! This is thankfully the healthiest relationship I've ever had and our communication is really good I'd say. Things like these are discussed but I don't feel comfortable to let out all my emotions about his sister to him. The night it happened I called my mom to have a big ol' rant, because she's not involved in his family. That calmed me down a lot, and eventually did tell my boyfriend what it is that's been bothering me. We have not yet talked about boundaries, though I did tell her I do not appreciate her opening the door without knocking when we're in his bedroom. As far as mean comments go, I'll just let them go over my head for now or (kindly) confront her by staying calm and asking her why she's said what she said.	1642705004.0	htht57k	t3_s8mf8r	t1_hthrj3y	/r/offmychest/comments/s8mf8r/im_growing_tired_of_my_boyfriends_sister_and_her/htht57k/

dxjycuqp	You're completely missing the point.   I personally believe that anyone has a right to reject anyone for whatever reason they want. You don't want to be with that person, cool. And why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you anyway? Forcing the issue is never the answer.   But again, I can understand why some people might not see it that way. I can understand how people can be offended by such things. It's called empathy, you should get some.  Again, never said that you should make anyone date anyone else. Never even remotely hinted that. But people are allowed to think that someone rejecting them is unfair and unjust based on something as simple and unchangeable as appearance. And people are well within their rights to deem OP shallow for doing so. You're shallow if you do, and you're dumb if you don't. Either way, people will judge your decisions and you should make the one that benefits you the most.   Are we clear now? Or are you going to keep putting words in my mouth and assuming things that I never actually said?	1642705246.0	hthtt0y	t3_s8p77d	t1_hthsyfa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8p77d/i_cant_believe_im_called_shallow_for_having_the/hthtt0y/

I'm sorry that you've been through horrible things, but you and you alone get to decide if you are going to keep letting those experiences control you.  No amount of you claiming that "the world decide your worth" is going to make that it any less your responsibility to take control back of your own life and get help for yourself.

Risks of catching covid through food and drink are extremely low.  This is because of the way covid works.  It's an upper-respiratory infection that infects primarily through the lungs.  Generally speaking, if someone has Covid and touched your food, it's mostly safe to eat as your stomach contents are such strong acids that it will likely kill any virus the moment it enters. Not to say it isn't possible, but just unlikely.  I will not, however, stand for your KK slander.

You've proven yourself a dedicated mother but if things get out of hand its ok to protect yourself. Relationships in any and all forms needs to be mutual, if they aren't then its only one-sided. You need to remember that there is nothing wrong with protecting yourself from harm's way, physically and mentally.  Its gonna hurt a lot right now, you can cry as much as you need to, to get it out of your system, after some time has past, probably give it more than a few years, can you start the process to reconciliation with your daughter.	1642705550.0	hthumn5	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/hthumn5/

5o9h2	As someone who routinely bakes goods and brings in food for my office on a weekly basis, something to take note of is that only a few handful of people will actually take anything you bring.  Donuts, cupcakes, cookies, etc.  I bring these things in often, and I'll usually bring 2-3 dozen everytime since my office usually has around 10 people in it at any time, and 2 dozen gives an opportunity for seconds.

6nv8q8kg	Well, you seem to have quite exquisitely effed that up so badly that you have boxed yourself in a corner of no return friend. Ugh. As you say, whatever you do now won‚Äôt look good. So it may be that you have to take this one in and let it sink in that lying to fit in will only end badly one way or another.  But luckily for you, you and your friends are both mere mortals. Fallible humans. So if you explain to them with absolute honesty, as you‚Äôve described here, what happened, a reasonable human would probably forgive you but insist you never do it again. Sure, it might have all eroded trust a bit, but even that can be grown back over time.   Lastly, it might be worth taking a closer look at these friendships from your own perspective‚Ä¶ why were you lying? Do you feel pressure and anxiety a lot when you are around them? Is that about you or them? Etc. Eg; Is you‚Äôre discomfort around them just your own anxiety, or is it something more around whether you are actually close friends with them? Friends you are comfortable with?  I‚Äôm suppose I‚Äôm saying, that in any of these scenario‚Äôs; 1) Good friends make you feel comfortable and validated and happy and dont make you feel the need to lie or feel anxious (though of course sometimes we are anxious ourselves, not as a result of the action or inaction of others)  2) Good friends hold shared values 3) Good friends forgive genuine mistakes and fallibility and in the end love your flaws as part of you.   Really, you‚Äôve got nothing to lose by just being honest at this point.

Quit caffeine and weed before that and also alcohol the year prior.  Nicotine was by far the hardest thing I've quit.   To touch a bit on people not being proud could be that some people come from a standpoint of you should have never used it to begin with, which is true but they have no way of knowing what its like quitting something like nicotine and that sometimes just showing a bit of empathy goes a long way.	1642705722.0	hthv31e	t3_s46499	t3_s46499	/r/offmychest/comments/s46499/i_finally_quit_nicotine_and_have_no_one_to_tell/hthv31e/
1yt2w21k	Thank you for your words. I myself was not all that good of a person.   I spoke to my bf about this and he agrees with you. I was afraid he'd get upset but he says he doesn't expect me to get over her for years just because of all the time we've spent together.  He also says that I may have misconstrued the past relationship and only focused on the good things while forgetting all the bad regardless of whether it was her or me doing the bad.   He is literally amazing and although he has a hard time expressing his emotions, he has never faltered on being there for me when I want to share mine....so like every hour lol.   I don't want to ruin my chances at potential happiness just because I was comfortably uncomfortable with a toxic relationship.   There's a lot more of course happening. Me being comfortable with my more feminine traits after taking all the masks off, rediscovering myself and healing. I'm just glad I have redditors, my bf, and a few close friends to vent to when I need advice or an ear.	1642705761.0	hthv6qu	t3_s8cl1o	t1_htfp6x4	/r/offmychest/comments/s8cl1o/i_miss_my_abusive_relationship_after_finding_a/hthv6qu/
99uvykx9	I haven‚Äôt been in your exact situation but I can relate. My sister grew up this way too, with a mostly absent father that affected her mentally and having aggression issues, being a runaway, and hurting herself physically, sexually, and with drugs. It was hell for my mother and I for many years. The toll it takes to care emotionally for a person who is fully dependent on you but has no empathy and no remorse and is completely unpredictable is so so horrible. However, our story is more of a success‚Ä¶ we just started giving her what she wants. Almost all the time. People tell my mom she‚Äôs a horrible parent for this too‚Ä¶ just to let you know, you can‚Äôt win. People will judge you as a parent no matter what you do with a child like this, I‚Äôm sorry to say.  But once we enrolled her in a private art school and shifted to less control and supervision, her behavior and attitude genuinely improved. She still uses drugs (less dangerous ones), makes unwise decisions, and has low empathy, but all of this is a gift in comparison to the child we used to care for. I am at the point where I can hang out with her and have a good time, although my heart still drops everytime I see her on my caller ID; I fear the worst.  I know every child is different, but maybe some of these strategies can help y‚Äôall as parents. Also, giving her space is not a bad strategy at all. It‚Äôs a very respectful thing to do to give another human their personal space from you if they want it. People might see it as a bad parenting move but those are just dated ideals that don‚Äôt mean much.  Some other things we did that helped were see a counselor together to help with our family relationship. Even if you feel you shouldn‚Äôt have to change, you might have to just to make your life and your kid‚Äôs life easier. Something my mother learned from the counselor was that her and her daughter could both take a break from a hard conversation at any time and pick it back up later when they felt better. That was extremely useful.  I feel for you very hard and I hope you and your daughter find some peace and healing. Don‚Äôt forget to take care of yourself now; I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve been mainly focused on her for a long time. Talk to a therapist about your own problems too. Sending you love.	1642705767.0	hthv7b7	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/hthv7b7/

Better to be true to yourself and let people disagree with you for the right reasons (because they will!) lol.   But if it's brought up again it's a very easy fix, stay fairly silent and once they've made their pointsmexplained their position be like "Those are all excellent points, and you know what... You're right". You can even bring it up yourself "I had a knee-jerk reaction before, but thinking back on it I actually agree that we should be treating everyone humanely."

In the case of a man being *offended* that a woman rejected him, that he believes her decision was unjust or unfair, he judges that the woman made the WRONG decision. If a man feels entitled to judge that a woman made a WRONG decision, then, logically, he feels that that woman has really no RIGHT to make that decision.

Obviously that doesn‚Äôt mean you should do nothing about pain. Acute pain can lead to worse outcomes and chronic pain	1642706322.0	hthwo6p	t3_s8qjgj	t3_s8qjgj	/r/offmychest/comments/s8qjgj/i_am_so_tired_of_doctors_disregarding_me/hthwo6p/

iu0qcw2j	I hope you are okay?   In relationships we tend to forget about ourselves because we are so focused on pleasing our partner. Remember the time when you first met... how things used to be. When you were both focused on your own lives. I think it's very important to give yourself time alone either it be doing something you enjoy alone or spending time with friends. When you spend so much time together you tend to get used to things we stop appreciating things because now it's become an expectation.   You mentioned your wife suffers with panic attacks and anxiety. You also mentioned that your behaviour towards her used to consist in yelling and screaming... maybe these two are linked. When someone suffers with anxiety it's important to make them feel reassured. A small text message, a quick call to check on how she's doing. Women are very sensitive. Try that and see how you get on.   This does not give her any reason to treat you in such a way. You are allowed to do what you want to do. You are allowed to have off days... You are human. Nobody especially not your wife should make you feel that way. You are in control of your life, don't allow anyone to make you feel like you're in the wrong for just living your life. I hope you manage to find peace and you go to that game and enjoy yourself!	1642706435.0	hthwz06	t3_s8otsz	t3_s8otsz	/r/offmychest/comments/s8otsz/i_feel_like_dealing_with_my_wife_is_like_dealing/hthwz06/

I‚Äôd like it to service councillors and therapists that work with vulnerable people to have a comfortable house in a nice part of town, also to make sure they are most ready to shoulder the load, in the same way you want your surgeon to have had a good nights sleep and healthy breakfast on operation day.

c6gpgv60	If you can't express emotions to even your best friends, I suggest you sometimes yake the time to do what you just did: write about it. Write about your feelings in a journal. And no you don't have to make it lighter not to be a burden or whatever. And remember: there is no 1 "right" way to grieve. There are many ways, every one has their own way.   Aside from that, this horrible experience might be a little advantage in med school because you now know upclose how it is to be on the patients side. If it's not too confrontational for you, you might even consider working on oncology. It gives this horrible experience a sliver of meaning. There's a little book I can recommend called Man's search for meaning by Victor E. Frankl which might be helpful as well.	1642706764.0	hthxuvk	t3_s8eyhe	t3_s8eyhe	/r/offmychest/comments/s8eyhe/husbands_dead_im_starting_med_school_i_want_to/hthxuvk/

cz67kues	I don‚Äôt have any surprise siblings and wasn‚Äôt adopted, but I fully agree with you based on the experiences of three of my best friends throughout my life (two in middle/high school, one currently who is really like family to me and talks about this stuff very openly with me) who were adopted and have half or full siblings and parents they didn‚Äôt grow up with.  u/porcelina-g, I would reach out to your brother. I‚Äôd also highly recommend family therapy with your dad if he takes it hard and it is financially viable for either/both of you. I‚Äôve done family therapy with my mom and sister (my dad is deceased or else I‚Äôm sure I would have requested he be there, too, considering I was the one who asked them to go to therapy with me), and while it hasn‚Äôt helped my relationship with my sister yet, it has definitely helped my relationship with my mom (we still have a lot more to fix, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but a lot has improved). We stopped therapy prematurely in the spring of last year after only a few months because we were dealing with multiple imminent cancer deaths in our immediate family (both my grandfathers), my mom was the primary caregiver for both of them at the same time, I was spending several weeks at a time there (for a total of about three months leading up to and after they died) when I live halfway across the country and have been dealing with severe health problems myself, and this was all coming to a head at finals time for my sister‚Äôs college. Things in my life have continued to be at a level where adding back family therapy is untenable as of yet (my wife and I have just been dealing with emergency after emergency, both health and otherwise, as well as some ongoing legal issues with my health insurance company and a terrible but thankfully now ex-roommate/friend who directly caused both my severe ongoing health problems that almost killed me and tens of thousands of dollars of damage to our house), but I am hopeful we will be able to resolve things further once things calm down enough that we can resume family therapy.  Granted, I grew up with both my mom and sister, and every family‚Äôs dynamic and willingness to adapt and change their behavior and communication for each other is different, but it is unlikely (not guaranteed, but unlikely) to make it worse if you‚Äôre starting from a point of him already cutting off communication with you (though starting before it gets to that point is obviously preferable). And if you‚Äôre not ready yet, that‚Äôs okay, too, but make the decision for your own mental health needs, not in anticipation of others‚Äô mental health needs that you don‚Äôt know for sure even exist the way you‚Äôre fearing they do. Do you have access to a (personal, not family) therapist to talk this over with? They could be a key asset in helping you through this.  Sending you love and good luck for connecting with your brother. üíú	1642706811.0	hthxzbt	t3_rs68uj	t1_hsucmq1	/r/offmychest/comments/rs68uj/i_keep_meeting_my_birth_mom_but_she_doesnt_know/hthxzbt/

awdf7dl	That is such a rotten feeling and a hard place to be in. I‚Äôm so sorry that they‚Äôre not listening to you.   Have you considered working with someone on biofeedback and mindfulness techniques to help you better manage not only the pain but your response to it? Anticipating being in pain makes us tense and more likely to hurt. Have you been to PT/OT? Tried massage? Have they mentioned prescribing something like gabapentin or doxypin (that‚Äôs spelled wrong, I know), or Amitriptyline to help dull some of those nerve signals?   I want to be very clear that I am not dismissing you; I have been in your shoes before, and it‚Äôs really frustrating when you‚Äôre in pain and miserable all the time and you feel like no one is listening. However, thanks to a nationwide push to reduce the amount of opiates available in the population, people who legitimately need pain medication are being screwed over. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm suggesting alternatives that, while not the same, might help you.	1642706932.0	hthyawv	t3_s8qjgj	t3_s8qjgj	/r/offmychest/comments/s8qjgj/i_am_so_tired_of_doctors_disregarding_me/hthyawv/

bruze3bk	I have experienced similar issues.  My in-laws are from Mexico, my wife grew up in a poor immigrant home.  My family is upper middle class and there is always tension between my wife and my mother and sister. She says very similar things as to what you are saying on here.    Even *if* your in-laws hate you (which I doubt), the important thing is your husband loves you and that he probably does not care what others think of you because he knows the women that you are.   Men and women think very differently, men say things overtly, women tend to have a kind of covert intention about the things they say, especially in a case where one women does not like another.  Maybe your in-laws are narcissistic and snobby like my family is.  Thankfully, we live across the country from my family so we only see them once a year.    I hope that you can find a way to communicate your feelings to your husband in a way that he will understand. He may feel like he needs to "fix" the problem as we men often do.  Maybe just assure him that your feelings towards his family are separate from your feelings for him and hopefully yall can build from there.  It took a while for my eyes to open to how my family *really* is.  Although I love them, my wife was very right about how they act, the off hand things they say, and how they can be overbearing.

I don't kmow of it's us, but I do know I am tired of being told I'm sensitive when people do whatever the hell they want without caring about any one else and yet expect everyone to care about them. It's not fair to have to live in your own home in fear.  I wish I could offer more advice, but I'm afraid I'm stuck in the middle like you. What I can say is that it is so important to take some time for yourself. Build up your friend base. My friends have really stepped up for me in this time my family has been such a disappointment. Learn to trust your friends. They will surprise you. Find something fun to do just for yourself. I exercise, you may enjoy soemthing like that. Watch TV, focus on your hobbies. Focus on you.

Plus American Sign Language is an amazing way to communicate while you can't hear.     I mean, you can still use your voice, but using ASL to help babies communicate is a great tool to have in any situation. Milk, more and all done are great first 3 signs.	1642708369.0	hti27ow	t3_s7quis	t3_s7quis	/r/offmychest/comments/s7quis/my_babys_crying_triggers_my_ptsd_from_my_time_in/hti27ow/

On my last day of work at a company I worked for five years, I bought four dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts and emailed a bunch of colleagues to come get one and say goodbye.

ay6cy9mg	 Maybe I‚Äôm one of the rarities, but I was on dating apps for several years and it always felt like this. As a woman, I constantly felt objectified. Mostly it was people interested in hookups, or because an online profile can only show you so much about a person I would meet them in person and realize we weren‚Äôt compatible. It was a lot of first dates only, a few casual short term relationships and mostly disappointing.   But, I did actually meet my husband on bumble. We‚Äôve been married now for 3 years. So, I know it might not be common but it does happen.

cq0qo31r	Stop drinking.  I know it's not that simple but relying on a substance to function is never going to work and always will lead to more problems down the road.  It may sound corny, but a support group might be the best thing for you.  I understand not wanting to burden your family with this information and that being the case I would definitely recommend finding a support group to help handle your addiction.  You can try to quit alone. I do that on and off, but it's extremely difficult and tends to be very prone to relapses and failure.  Even then it is something that's quite difficult and it's a constant process of improvement.  I have felt that kind of "brain fog" you seem to be describing. I used to drink a lot and basically smoke weed all day, every day. It gets to the point where you feel like you're in a stupor or some sort of waking dream.  I would definitely recommend taking a step back and trying to get a handle on things before it gets worse.  I'm in somewhat of a relapse now as I've gone through a divorce last year and my mom just died, so I don't know what to do currently, but I'm going through the process of starting therapy again and I would recommend the same to anyone who is dealing with overwhelming amounts of stress, sadness, depression, anger, or really any difficulty with your life.	1642709187.0	hti4d8p	t3_s8rk16	t3_s8rk16	/r/offmychest/comments/s8rk16/i_feel_mentally_crippled/hti4d8p/

5at6tnzc	WHY ARE WE ACTING LIKE THIS IS OKAY AND COMPLETELY IGNORING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HERE?  Has the entire human race lost its mind? Or am I taking crazy pills?  You lived with someone who had COVID severe enough to kill him and still thought it was okay to go to work? And then you blame the vaccine?  I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. Truly, I am. But the fact that you went through something terrible doesn‚Äôt give you the right to go around infecting people and potentially forcing other people to go through the exact same thing you did.   It just makes me sad at this point. The complete collective disregard for human life. How can you go through something this tragic but still fail to realize that other people‚Äôs lives are worth protecting by staying home for a few days? Do you just not care as long as it‚Äôs not somebody you personally know? I don‚Äôt understand, I just don‚Äôt.   I‚Äôm really not trying to be insensitive to your grief here but it baffles me that all the top comments don‚Äôt make a single mention of the fact that you were going to work while living with somebody who was sick with COVID.  THIS is the sort of thing that keeps the pandemic going. People will express their condolences and say how awful it is to lose someone to this virus, WHILE FAILING TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT EVEN MORE LIVES BEING LOST.   Is it a fear of stepping on toes? Is it because y‚Äôall think it‚Äôs ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù to call a grieving person out on their bullshit? In most scenarios I‚Äôd agree, but considering the REAL LIVES at stake here, I‚Äôm okay with violating some social norms.   I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm just tired. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm the only one who cares about other people anymore. Or if I‚Äôm the only one who ever did. The self-centeredness and complete lack of care for others‚Äô well-being is just running more and more rampant with every day that passes. I. Am. Tired.	1642709373.0	hti4msw	t3_s874u2	t3_s874u2	/r/offmychest/comments/s874u2/my_friend_died_in_my_house_yesterday/hti4msw/
q7onv	With NFTs, there is no copyright trading structure in existence that complies with international law.  Because of this, unless an external agreement is made between the artist and the buyer, the copyright still belongs to the artist.  The buyer of an NFT owns nothing except a unique transactional hash on the blockchain and a hyperlink to the file.  All you're buying is a receipt.    I'm with you. Crypto is an interesting prospect if you want to make quick money in a high-risk, unregulated asset sector. Beyond that, crypto is only a byproduct of the high cost of hashing.	1642709417.0	hti4olo	t3_s8lwar	t1_hthysk1	/r/offmychest/comments/s8lwar/im_so_sick_of_the_metaverse_and_nfts_and_crypto/hti4olo/

It‚Äôs a beyond sad reality and great you didn‚Äôt throw the things you did for her in her face. This must be so hard for you but it‚Äôs best for your health. Although she may not know what an amazing mom you are now, I pray there will come a point where she learns and reflects on happy memories that you just mentioned and recognizes her faults and your sacrifice. Although you‚Äôve given up custody, you have not given up on your child. You will have time to visit and know how she is doing, you are able to seek that out. I pray for your continued strength and hope you are reassured that this is the best decision. Your life is meaningful and valuable. You deserve happiness and peace.

dqhq6lwg	You cannot pour from an empty cup.  And right now, you've been emptied of every last drop.  You haven't abandoned her to no home. You've entrusted her care to her other parent, and as he's let you carry all the abuse and trauma for years, it's his responsibility to step up now when you cannot take another day.  Perhaps this is the best option for everyone and your daughter will be happy and dad copes, while you heal and build your life again. Or perhaps in a while your daughter will discover that the grass is not greener elsewhere, realise that you were her true support and come to give you the respect you deserve. Perhaps dad will struggle too, but it is his responsibility to do his best just as you did.

2cre2bs3	Definitely go to a dermatologist asap. They know best. There's also things you can do that I believe can atleast hinder it.   Check your hormone/testosterone level. Get your bloodwork done. Too much testosterone can create dihydrotestosterone. That's why men usually bald a lot more than women.   Increase bloodflow to the scalp. Cut back on wearing tight hats, massage your scalp, and pour cold water on your head. It keeps your hair moisturized, relaxes you and increases bloodflow to the follicles.   Massage your forehead, temples, scalp to increase your bloodflow. I like to use a wide tooth brush to brush my head with. It detangles your hair and the nibs at the end massage you.   Also check for stress shedding. Too much stress can knock out your hair. And being stressed out about your hair can accelerate more. Look into anti-stress techniques.   Like I said, get your bloodwork done. See if you are not eating enough of a specific nutrient. Not having enough of your proper nutrients of course not only makes your body bad, it knocks out your hair, since cells need a good amount of nutrients.   So basically, dermatologist, activate blood flow around your scalp with cold water and scalp massages, get enough nutrients, lower your stress level.   You said it happened suddenly and you're only 25. Please go to a dermatologist as soon as possible.   And of course, exercise and build a great body. Healthy body, healthy mind, healthy hair.   Take care.	1642710327.0	hti6am2	t3_s876zd	t3_s876zd	/r/offmychest/comments/s876zd/im_going_bald_at_25_and_my_hair_was_the_only/hti6am2/

5iqrcesa	He's referring more to the people who are like 'i hate cats i enjoy when harm comes to them' rather than ppl like you, who are just allergic.  There's a difference in approach to disliking cats that can raise red flags. Simply dislking them isn't the issue. Actively wishing harm is, and a lot of people do. Those people should be avoided.	1642710818.0	hti7l8y	t3_s822ks	t1_htf7qdt	/r/offmychest/comments/s822ks/cats_are_100x_better_than_dogs_and_its_not_even/hti7l8y/
atto2qwl	My MIL cooks all the time and always have leftovers. She always ask me if I want to take some for work so I would. So when I started taking lunch to work everyone told me to write my name on my lunch because someone kept stealing lunches. Fast forward and it was six time the lunch bandit stoled from me. After I made a scene about my lunch (was tamales) I notice one of my coworkers made a remark about ‚ÄúI know those tamales looked so good I would have stolen them too‚Äù then laughs. I was at my wits end and decided to make a strawberry laced with laxative chocolate shavings and pepto bisol. The I set the trap. After the cake went missing I paid close attention to everyone and that on coworker from early was losing it he basically destroy the toliet and went home. I stopped the lunch bandit.

crk1wptv	Cats are responsible for many bird species being endangered.   Cats can bite and scratch people all they like, but a dog barks too much or nips once, and they‚Äôre liable to be taken away and maybe killed.   I don‚Äôt have to pick up dog shit off my property because cats have more rights over the land than most humans.   90% of cat owners don‚Äôt know where their cat is most of the time, because a cat isn‚Äôt a pet that takes responsibility. It‚Äôs for people who want a cute animal without having to do much.  Yall literally get your cats high like wtf is up with that?  Dogs are able to work and save lives. Cats get dubbed ‚ÄúESAs‚Äù for teens with minor anxiety issues.   Cats aren‚Äôt even properly domesticated.

2mrn79ah	Bruuh not less manly at all. That‚Äôs some real man shit doing your absolute best to work on and find healthier means of expressing yourself. Just because historically men express themselves through violence does not in the slightest make being violent more manly. Personally speaking I think gay sex is the manliest activity if we draw lines exclusively along gender. Violent expression of ones emotions is toxic masculinity.   Does any of your cPTSD therapy go over situations like what you‚Äôve been going through? Does the military or therapist provide you with any resources on how to cope with sound sensitivities? I don‚Äôt want to sound insensitive to your child but would noise canceling headphones help at all? Being able to be home and have sound calming music in ear? I‚Äôm not suggesting that be a 24/7 thing obviously you‚Äôll have to tend to your child‚Äôs needs and need to be able to hear them. But maybe as a way to fight an attack or prevent a potential oncoming one?  Sounds like you‚Äôve been working hard to be a good dad and that‚Äôs the most important thing.

c6gpgv60	A lot of little individual choices can make a (big) impact combined. If you decide to give up I can understand and respect that but you must know it wasn't all for nothing. We sometimes forget that those industries are there because of the demand we as individuals create. I've seen this influence in the supermarket, a lot more choices of meat replacements and meat from organic local farmers.   I eat vegetarian most of the time (I do it because of animal welfare) but once in a while I have a little purge. You don't have to either eat strictly veggie or burry your head in the meat every day. You can go flexitarian (eat meat once a week or something) or eat meat from organic farmers. Whatever you chose, thanks for being aware of what you ate the past ten years.	1642711119.0	hti8ezg	t3_s8j10m	t3_s8j10m	/r/offmychest/comments/s8j10m/ten_years_a_vegetarian_not_anymore/hti8ezg/

cj1d1i6p	My hunnie and I definitely do not have a perfect relationship. We fight, we argue, we disagree. But we also laugh until we cry (or I pee), we have so much fun going out and doing things together, or staying in bed and watching a movie. He pushes me to be better and me him. At the end of the day, I can‚Äôt wait to walk in the door and feel his arms around me. No matter what, if it‚Äôs been the most horrible day that I‚Äôve had in a long time, as soon as he puts his arms around me, the stress is gone. I have never loved somebody the way I love this man. It‚Äôs coming up this year on five years together, but I knew three months after meeting him, he was the one I meant to spend the rest of my life with.  I think everybody has their idea of what a so-called perfect relationship is. I don‚Äôt know if there is a perfect relationship in general, or perfect for us. Because I know any buddy else, I would‚Äôve sent them running for the hills by now lol. Our relationship may be unconventional and how we met and how we started, and may have other people shaking their head sometimes, but he and I are happy. And we couldn‚Äôt imagine it any other way.   Reading your post, made my heart so happy. I love hearing about other people finding that kind of happiness because it seems like it‚Äôs so rare today. You guys are gonna grow old together.

2nv3fujv	I'm not a mom, but I know about children's mental health. And I tell this to parents I work with.   You're human. You're human before you're a mom. You're allowed to do what's best for *you*   You did your best, and that's enough. She's happier there, and you're allowed to know your love was more than enough. And sometimes love means letting go, and taking care of yourself.   Nurture yourself, heal yourself, allow yourself a safe world. So you can love her, and be her mom. Just in a different way than you have been before. You're still her mama, but you've allowed her to go to a place where she's happier. And maybe one day, she'll thank you. And maybe one day she'll get better. And maybe one day, this will all be a past.   You're a human.  You're allowed to adjust and do things differently. You're allowed to feel safe and be healthy, before throwing yourself into something someone else can handle.	1642712272.0	htibkif	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htibkif/

2hzz5ooi	I‚Äôm not the troubled child but a lot of my friends were. Just because she has ADHD along with a host of other disorders, doesn‚Äôt mean she can‚Äôt be accountable for her actions. She‚Äôs old enough to know right from wrong and she knows how she‚Äôs treating you is wrong. She genuinely doesn‚Äôt care because people who care actually use coping mechanisms provided for them in therapy to try to do better. They recognize their triggers and learn how to navigate. You‚Äôre not giving up on her, you‚Äôre holding her accountable for her actions and showing her there are consequences. That is the most valuable lesson a parent can teach their child.	1642712358.0	htibt3o	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htibt3o/

2rmfin9d	I used to oversee a group of challenged/disabled adults who helped out with small projects at our machine shop. It helped give them a sense of community and feel needed in the work force as well as supply them with some money. They were paid minimally to paint parts for 6 hours and then bussed back to their care homes. These guys never got to eat out or get a treat from a fast food shop, they ate what was offered to them in their care homes. One day before they were to leave our facility to go back to working at the bus plant I went and got two 30ct trays of Chick-fil-a chicken biscuit bites. Those things are like heaven to me on an early cold morning. That group was so thankful and appreciative, I got so many hugs and I love yous from them. Over some chicken biscuits. They had never had anything like that before or in the home, they made me feel like the best person ever. The way they made me feel has stuck with me, even years later. I may have been their supervisor and mentor but they were not just my workers but my friends. I miss them dearly and hope they are doing alright.	1642712753.0	hticwjl	t3_s8ndv8	t3_s8ndv8	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ndv8/i_bought_donuts_for_everybody_at_work_and_im_the/hticwjl/

7zon3itr	I‚Äôd imagine it also has to do with the severity of the call.  If they are positive that he‚Äôs already deceased and receive a call about a child getting hit by a car, the most urgent call will probably be taken first. That + an understaffed team + higher rates of crime/injury, any of these combinations could heavily delay response times unfortunately.  Where I‚Äôm from if you call 911, you‚Äôre most likely going to end up being put on hold (yep, on hold, by the dispatchers) or hung up on if it‚Äôs a busy night.

Also embrace what about being black from my point of view there is nothing to embrace nothing to be proud of only shame.

e1umx68f	I don't mind people keeping their options open in the talking stages as that's part of finding the most compatible / desirable partner to you. I also understand that people can outgrow one another which is what I consider not being as compatible anymore.  What makes me uninterested in relationships more so than talking/dating is the idea that everything can be great but they would still pick someone else if the option became available. You can be the best version of yourself but like I mentioned, there will always be someone hotter, funnier, smarter etc and the idea that your partner would end up desiring others who they can't get, thus settling for you is...depressing.

14rl5g97	You have to think for your own safety. At this point, she is a danger to you. Maybe if her father has a go, he can give her the discipline that you aren't able to give. It's not that you're a bad mom. You tried so hard to help her. I think we can all see that with the help you got her. Instead of saying "you're giving up your child" I would frame it as "you are trying a new approach".  Little girls need their fathers, even if he was terrible to you. At best, her being with her father will fill what ever she feels she's missing and will give her peace; worst case, he can give her a taste of her own medicine and maybe she'll develop some empathy.  For now, you need to focus on yourself. You gotta get to a better place with yourself for her.	1642713906.0	htig42a	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htig42a/

Sure, looks are important, but why did you reject all of the ‚Äúaverage-looking‚Äù guys? You might be surprised by who you ultimately end up with as a partner. When I was young I was primarily into one type of guy, and my amazing husband is completely different than most of the guys I used to be interested in, both physically and mentally. what is truly most important to you in a partner?

i805sh86	So firstly, This guy is not your friend. He's probably thinking he's manipulated you into following him like a cult (which you clearly aren't), and honestly, he sounds like a really big Elitist Meathead. I don't care what culture somebody's from, that doesn't give them the excuse to be "oh, your cultures so dogshit". Do I like Sauerkraut? No. But I don't go to Germany and scream "your food and culture is Dogshit". It's rude, disrespectful, snobby and not a cool thing to do.  You have absolutely got to call him out on this. He's living in a bubble that needs to be popped by reality desperately. You need to confront him in order to have a genuine friendship.  I've seen many a narcissistic, but this guy is quite literally tripping on his own ego. He thinks the world Revolves around him for no reason other than he is rich.

I woke up the next morning horrified at the person I had become and realised that I could spend the rest of my life being the kind of person who would steal from the person who love them or I could be someone who made them proud. Admitted myself to hospital, stopped doing drugs and got a job to pay for therapy. I was very lucky to be able to look after my grandad in his last days when he passed last year and I hope I made him proud of me.	1642715371.0	htik7bw	t3_s8re1l	t1_htii45f	/r/offmychest/comments/s8re1l/five_years_ago_yesterday_i_was_rped/htik7bw/

3gqw9sbh	You're a good person. Try not to take what happened personally. Similar things have happened to me before.   I've noticed that when you bring food into a workplace it seems like only one of two extremes happen: no one touches it or pretty much everyone eats it. I think if you're new somewhere and bring food, it's easier for the first one to happen. Most people don't want to be one of the first ones to take free food for fear of looking greedy or coming off as rude. Even though it is free and you brought it to be enjoyed, I think a lot of people feel guilty about taking it. This seems to be a partly a cultural thing surrounding reluctance to take free things in general and also partly having some guilt about indulging in sweets.   But once a few people have started eating what you brought, then others are more willing to ignore their guilt/hesitations and join in. This is where having a few good friends can be really helpful. Since you already have an established relationship with your friends, they feel more comfortable taking things more readily. There's much less guilt associated with taking food or a gift from a friend because there's likely going to be an opportunity some time in the friendship for them to make it up to you in some way. Once a few friends have accepted your free food, other coworkers are likely to take some as well. It's basically a snowball effect.  I think there can also be a lot of trust issues surrounding free food nowadays with the pandemic going on. I'm hesitant to even borrow a pen from someone, so I imagine many people feel similarly with free food right now.  Edit: Sorry to go into a psychological and sociological debate about this, but I've done enough people watching to see this behavior happen a lot, and it's always seemed strange and interesting to me.  Edit2: I've found that if you go individually ask each person if they want a donut (while holding the box of donuts), then they're more likely to accept. Since it feels more like a personal invitation/offering, they feel less guilty than they would if they just walked over to a table and took a donut. Although this works more in a one-on-one setting than in a group setting. If everyone is all in the same room and you walk around the room asking each person if they want a donut, people are likely going to copy whatever the most common answer is that they've heard so far. You'll also look really strange if you approach every single person in a room to offer free donuts. That sort of tactic makes much more sense if you can walk into individual offices to approach people. Also works better if you're actually holding the box of donuts.	1642715786.0	htilbwd	t3_s8ndv8	t3_s8ndv8	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ndv8/i_bought_donuts_for_everybody_at_work_and_im_the/htilbwd/

3702wdko	Aww, thank you so very much for that, gorgeous heart. Genuinely bought tears to my eyes. I parented the way I did because I had very similar to you, my parents were all sharp edges, restriction and violence. It destroyed me as a person and I swore I would do the exact opposite that my parents did to me. But they didn't have instructions, either. And then I found out about all the trauma they lived through as kids and young adults, before getting together. Trauma has a way of echoing through generations. I'm just glad that going to see a psychologist is a more acceptable thing, my parents gen, definitely wouldn't have done that. I do see that, I screwed up, but if I were going to choose a way to screw up, putting too much love into a kid probably isn't the worst way. I'm still there for her. She messages me in her lowest moments to talk through the things that are upsetting her and tells me she misses her mum. I try and be there for her as much as I can. Please tell me you found people, if you didn't get that from your parents? Do you have people in your life that you can lean on and rely on?

There are lots of assistance programs they are likely eligible for if it is that tight. I know this is easier said than done but it is critical for you -  you are penalizing your future to pay for their past.

That way at least you don‚Äôt get fucked. Also don‚Äôt know the relationship you have with your parents or if you care. Just don‚Äôt want you to be taken advantage of.   Would probably be cheaper to buy a place for yourself with an in law suite or separate unit‚Ä¶that‚Äôs just not fair.	1642716978.0	htioi6i	t3_s8u8u8	t3_s8u8u8	/r/offmychest/comments/s8u8u8/im_25_making_120k_a_year_and_i_still_feel_like_im/htioi6i/

6b8sjos1	I don't think I have any rights to talk about this subject because I am still a teen who recently turned 18 so I know nothing about marriage. But I am in a similar situation with my best friend (the girl I love from the bottom of my heart). I have been fighting with depression and anxiety since forever mostly because of my toxic family and she is still the only light in my life. But because of my condition, I always felt like every argument or problem we had was because of me and me alone. I still have moments when I feel like I am dragging her down alongside me and she can do way more than this. But that's not true at all. If she choses to stay despite every ,,problem" that comes, she is convinced this is the best for her. And if you staying with her is what she really wants, why would you assume she is better of without you. Your wife chooses to stay because she believes in your marriage and most importantly she believes in you. The weak answer is obviously to just leave, because it feels like it's all you can do right now. But take a moment to think about how your wife truly feels. She wants you to be strong enough to want to stay. It is very difficult and she knows it too. But I am sure she has faith you can overcome it. No one teaches you those things, that's true. But you have to teach yourself not to run from them. That's the first and most important thing. Face them. Even if they make you feel worthless or remind you how broken you are, even if it hurts like hell, if you love the woman who puts up with everything just to be with you and is strong enough for both of you, please choose to be strong too. If not for you, do it for her. Believe me, if she would think she would be better off without you, she would leave the next second without second thoughts. Your assumption is just you imposing your thoughts on her and that's really not healthy trust me. I know it seems impossible. It did for me too. But trust me on this, if you want to leave for her sake, it's your worst decision ever. And if you want to leave for your sake, leaving her will just make you feel worsen than how you feel right now and the wothless feeling won't every go away if you don't choose to fight it yourself. You just gotta find the motivation. For me, it's my best friend. Sorry if I spoke nonsense, I am half asleep and decided to randomly answer this question because it reminded me of my recent past self and because no one responded it yet. And if you got so far, I wish you the best in the world. I sincerely hope you won't leave your wife and, if you don't, I pray for your happiness.	1642717876.0	htipnih	t3_s8t621	t3_s8t621	/r/offmychest/comments/s8t621/i_dont_want_to_be_married_anymore/htipnih/

You should definitely read up on it. It can be transmitted via a scratch, bite, saliva on an open wound, etc.   I've been part of a University of Chicago study on it since birth and am quite well educated on it. I'm a lucky one that was born mostly blind in my left eye.

I was personally shy before and texting before confrontation is 100 times easier. It makes the convo in person smooth.

No doubt about it, its a strange sensation sorta feeling the catheters going on up there. And when they take control of your heart... Well, its not pleasant, but for me this was more due to feeling out of control than any pain. For me actual ablation just felt like a pleasant warmness, not nasty at all.

inyb4663	Ex-smoker here. Most people who quit smoking don't quit for good on the first or even the fifth try. That's okay. Reframe your attempts as learning experiences instead of failures. That's what finally worked for me.   Make a mental note of when the cravings become overwhelming and then have a plan of how to deal with them beforehand. One thing that I found important was to remember that I could inhale deeply without pulling smoke into my lungs. Deep, calming breaths and waiting 90 seconds for the strongest part of that addictive pull to pass got me through.  Physical addiction is only the first 72 hours. After that, you have pure heme pumping through your veins sans nicotine. Be aware that caffeine and nicotine co-metabolize, so any caffeine you intake will effect you stronger than you're used to. Take it easy during those first three days and feed yourself nutritious food. After that, it's all psychological and fades with time.  Mostly, don't beat yourself up if this time isn't THE time. You can try again and you'll be armed with better tools from your last attempt.   Good luck and don't give up!	1642719434.0	htisqsq	t3_s8t870	t3_s8t870	/r/offmychest/comments/s8t870/i_dont_think_i_can_give_up_smoking/htisqsq/
79ztv42d	Big virtual hugs, OP.  As someone who has chronic fatigue syndrome, and has mostly just been sick of life for the last several years, the one thing that made things bearable was a fuck it attitude.  It took a while to get there - I also was a people pleaser and a super stresser/worrier.  But my turn in health was brought on by stress and made worse by it, so it was almost a matter of survival for me to stop stressing.  It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I really did just repeat it to myself, and eventually got to a place where I was caring about the things that mattered to me, and dismissing anything that really wasn‚Äôt (or giving it less priority).  This actually made a huge change in not just what problems I had in front of me, but how I viewed life.  Putting yourself first is sometimes hard, but once you start doing it here and there, it becomes so much easier.  And maybe how you need to think about things is that something will surely give if you keep going at this pace - and that something will likely be your health (whether physical or mental).  So think of it as a survival tactic.  Repeat it to yourself until you believe it.  I, too, work in a job where as much as people may try to care about work life balance, the job doesn‚Äôt let us do it as well as we want to.  Of late, I have started putting me-time on my calendar to make sure I get a lunch break or a tea break or whatever.  I‚Äôve started carving out 20 minutes here and there to do yoga or Pilates - sometimes I get to it, sometimes I don‚Äôt.  But that structural reminder is helpful. I‚Äôve also stopped being on camera for internal calls that do not require  critical thinking - if I am off camera, I can relax and not have to be ‚Äúon‚Äù; if a bunch of people are blabbing in the background, I make a cup of coffee and tune them out for a bit, or sometimes use the time to take a walk - I score points for being on, but it doesn‚Äôt drag me down either.  All of this is to say that if your job allows it, there can be even small things to lessen the stress even just a little, and that may make a difference.   As for your friend - to borrow a line from SATC - sometimes there really is not enough room in a relationship for both people‚Äôs problems.  And in your situation, I don‚Äôt even think it has as much to do with her not being there as the fact that right now, you do not have the bandwidth to deal with her problems.	1642719470.0	htistws	t3_s8ufa9	t3_s8ufa9	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ufa9/feeling_the_weight_of_the_world/htistws/

gzjur2t3	Everyone else is right. Sex is normal. Masturbation is normal. Sadly these days, pornography is pretty much ALL hardcore and that is not so normal. Be careful with it is all I‚Äôm saying because it can be addictive and can lead people into less mainstream kinks that can inhibit mate finding(I read one last night on here that was insanely foul and involved poop). Maybe research the difference between what is portrayed in porn and what sex is in real life, when no one is putting on a ‚Äúshow‚Äù.

While I'm sorry that this is what happened to you, your mom should've kept her face out of cat shit. Or learned to wash her hands. Or if she got scratched or bitten and felt ill after (which, ya know, is generally how it presents in the beginning), why not see a dr?  Or maybe she just ate some undercooked lamb.   You know why I know? Bc this is common info for women who may be pregnant or want to get pregnant. Again, I'm sorry for your situation but to hate an entire species of animal for it is ridiculous.

I will say that it‚Äôs a feeling similar to what I‚Äôve experienced in abusive relationships and during sexual assaults, a sort of freezing/hiding of the mind, quite obviously not a response I would‚Äôve preferred to have. I‚Äôve been doing some research on google on ‚Äúwhy victims stay silent‚Äù. Maybe you should use those thumbs to do some research of your own. I understand your lack of comprehension, because I don‚Äôt fully understand myself, but there‚Äôs a cure for your ignorance and it‚Äôs not going to come from making thinly veiled implications against someone (me) who has been through something traumatic and wants advice on how to prevent the person who traumatized them from doing anymore damage in this world.   Best of luck on your quest for knowledge, unless you just felt like beating someone who was already down. If that‚Äôs the case then you already know where to shove it. Surprise!

It all just depends. How old are you? You said your mother isn't giving you information?  Maybe you could try phoning the mental health hospital your brother is in and trying to get as much information as possible, that is of course, whether or not the hospital have consent to share information.

You were young, and he knew that.	1642721347.0	htixejt	t3_rpa64l	t3_rpa64l	/r/offmychest/comments/rpa64l/i_knew_i_was_getting_groomed_tw/htixejt/

9b5kwq1v	Of course you'll be ok!! Someone that relies so heavily on his family is a bullet you dodged. Do you think it wouldn't have come out anyway later? Sometimes we have to lose what we have and it's ok. You'll be ok. In Italy we say "closed a door, a bigger one opens up". Let it goooooo LET IT GOOOOOOO  yeah he has a bit of a problem. Tell him that the next time you see it. You can tell him whatever you think of him now :p you have a pupper to think of!! If you really need to worry about him take like 10 min a day, be sad and then GO ON you'll think about him the next day!! No time for that bullet!! I had to leave my bf and he was my personal trainer, my cook, he'd be the one that went and buy groceries, organize holidays and everything. I bet yours didn't, (because no man does everything my poor boy did for me), so yeah if I survived you'll survived too. And you'll even do way better that this poor man who gave his dignity and balls to the family!  (To be fair, I left my guy because I saw he was being happier with a friend of ours, in fact they're together now. Just to be clear about why I left such a golden guy TT___TT. Yeah I needed to vent too. Thanks ) Good luck babe	1642721404.0	htixjdu	t3_s8vm37	t3_s8vm37	/r/offmychest/comments/s8vm37/i_miss_my_boyfriendex_im_not_even_sure_what_is/htixjdu/

6xroyy8w	Good evening everyone.   I was not expecting this post to be noticed. I never thought there'd be a reply.    I am, after realizing how many people have taken their time to reach out to me, overwhelmed. I do not know how to thank you for lifting these feelings off my heart, even if briefly.   I wish I could reply to every comment. I want to thank and acknowledge each one of you individually, let you know I am seeing you too and receiving all of your words. That I appreciate so much your kindness for a stranger who just couldn't keep it all to themselves anymore.   I know maybe I do not owe anyone explanations... But if I had the guts to post here, receive and acknowledge all the things being said, I feel it's my responsibility to also acknowledge and see those with different views. I was not expecting anything at all, not from anyone. But if I can provide background or information, not for sympathy or empathy, just to attempt and clarify things if I can, I'll try to. I am sorry if this is coming off in a negative way, I'm very tired and have had a long day. My mind is not computing the languages properly anymore. Please bare with me.  I will try to reply to some comments here, again, my apologies if it seems I am looking to change anyone's opinion. I am not,  just want to provide information if I can. In truth. It's selfish as this is coming from my perspective, and not what she's gone through. I could say I've tried, that I did all I could, but maybe in her eyes I have not. Probably, retelling this herself would be very different. I hope someday, that will happen. And hopefully then, I will know what I could have done for things to be different.        Someone commented on instilling physical activity in her. I tried, maybe not hard enough, but it was tried as well. She was at the Boys & Girls Club, it was a positive experience because she got to spend time with other kids, younger and older, and it gave her a feeling of belonging she could not have with me. Being an only child, with no relatives her age and growing between adults, it is hard on her. It's alienating, it's exhausting and anyone would feel completely alone. Even though I'll never fully understand how she feels, I can relate to that pain. A hurricane hit in 2017, the club was closed indefinitely. There was no electricity for months, and it was winter. The physical activity ceased, there was no chance to run outside, go to the park or just walk around the neighborhood in the evening.        She loves to bike, and I encouraged her to do so very very much. Since she is now older and we're living at a place I can watch over her better, she used her bike almost everyday. If she had a lot of energy I'd suggest it too. When she got bored of running around the neighborhood, I'd try taking her to the park or a nearby beach, just to change the pace. I should clarify, her ADHD is mostly the inattentive type, not hyperactive. Whenever she is angry, yes she explodes, but otherwise she is calm and will rather engage in passive activities like drawing, playing videogames or literally just lying next to me and talk or listen to music.        I am not very active due to my own conditions and well, I have lost most of my energy through the years. I could have tried harder, be more consistent, but I just could not do it all on my own.    \--        Someone mentioned I am abusing her by sending her to live with her father. I am clear that he is not the best choice. But between him and I, is there another option? Would it be advisable we stay together, and I continue to not be of any help to her? Would it be more acceptable the neighbors call the cops and she's taken away anyway? What would you suggest? Please tell me. If she just kicked and screamed, if she had tantrums and people were not scared for my safety, if I did not have to beg her to stop whenever she hurts me, this would not have come to be. But please, please tell me what option is there that ensures she'll be well, healthy and safe with me, and I will keep trying.        \--    The custody arrangement is supposed to be every weekend and a month from summer. She either stays with me, or her father/grandfather pick her up and drop her at her grandparent's house during weekends. At this very moment, I think is the best for me to back out as close to completely from her life, once the custody is changed, I mean. I don't think it would be much of a difference if we saw each other every weekend right away. I wish she is able to rest and get her mind off all these terrible events, and if after that she wants to contact me, I'll be here always.        \--    I have most definitely talked to her. I promise. Saying there's therapy or doctors involved would be meaningless if I hadn't tried. She is my baby. And through it all, talking is what I've tried most. But talking is not always what's needed or wanted, most times we want to feel, without words, without having to focus on listening or being receptive. Also, she does not talk, she does not release her feelings in any way. No matter how much we've tried to remind her that if she needs to vent, to say what she feels, she just doesn't talk. There is no communication, and eventually it feels like we're just lecturing her. And that's not what we're trying. That is not what she should feel. If you don't have words or don't want to speak, you can leave a note, I promise I'll read it. I promise I won't say anything unless you want that. If you don't have words of your own, share a song, I will listen. Send a picture. I will try to understand. But please don't keep it to yourself.        The only times she'll say something is during an episode. They're not good things, things I could reply with 'I will help you, I am here and I will help you', they're not things I could give support for. And truthfully, it hurts. I do not know if you know what it feels like to be put down by the person you love the most, and still console them when they're hurting. And still hold them and want to give everything for them, even when they just told you you're the person they hate the most.   Sometimes she'll say she doesn't mean those things, but she'll say them again. I know it's also her age and conditions. It's just complicated when you can feel when someone means something or not. Her eyes do not pierce mine or her voice sounds as decided as when she says negative things.    \---        If he decides he can't do it either. I do not know what will happen, I hope it does not come to that. That things get better before anything like that could happen. But I assume it would be that, or returning to me. I just hope by the time she comes back, if things have not changed I have the strength to keep going.    \--        Someone said I do not accept any responsibility and only blame her father. Please inquire anything you deem needed for me to be accountable. As I've expressed previously, I posted unorganized thoughts from a grieving heart. I did not share everything, or even a fraction of it. I am sorry if I've not expressed all things necessary to put both parts in an objective enough perspective for your judgement. I am not perfect, I have made many mistakes as well, otherwise things would not be like this. If I had done everything perfectly maybe I would not have gotten a divorce, or things would not have worsened after. I am not trying to blame him. I am only focused on her. Unfortunately his choice affected her whole life, at least up to this very day. And there is nothing that can change that one truth. She is my daughter, and as her mother and caretaker I will always be responsible for the time we've spent together. If there is anyway I can be accountable for this, please tell me.            Thank you once again everyone. I am extremely grateful you've given me your time. Your words, thoughts and wishes. I truly did not expect this.	1642721454.0	htixnp9	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htixnp9/

9b5kwq1v	I think there's not much you can do about it. Like, you might need to process it with a therapist, but even if you did something at the time, it would have been a long journey of stress, anger, worry, and with no proofs you couldn't have properly punished anyway. :/ Like, we can't actually know what would have happened, but this is the probable outcome.   You did nothing wrong other than saving yourself time and worry. He's a bastard and the law can't reach him this time. I do believe in karma and I know he'll have a miserable life, like you said you wouldn't have touched him with a stick, so I guess his life is probably pretty miserable.   Now, since you can't do much about it, please process it if you need but then free yourself. This kind of people doesn't deserve to be remembered, to occupy any part of someone's brain. Let it go. Flush him as the piece of shit he is.   But only after you processed it of course.  You're doing your best.

7sh6y79b	You don't "fall ill" from Toxoplasmosis as an adult, in fact, it generally won't do anything to an adult unless they have a compromised immune system other than possibly cause an eye infection, which is also quite rare. "Keep your face out of cat shit"? Litter box dust from changing litter is all it takes, that's what got my mom. Unless you're wearing a face mask while changing litter, you've likely contracted it yourself.   While this is common information for anybody that is or plans to become pregnant, it isn't an in depth conversation or presentation as it should be. There is a great deal of information left out of birthing and pregnancy classes.   You're still just further proving that you don't know anything about Toxoplasmosis.   It's also not a matter of "grow up". It's a matter of fact that pregnant women shouldn't be around cats at all. It's also a fact that as a person with Toxoplasmosis, I am extremely susceptible to further eye lesions and further loss of vision due to exposure to animals with Toxoplasmosis.	1642722259.0	htizlnp	t3_s822ks	t1_htivdzy	/r/offmychest/comments/s822ks/cats_are_100x_better_than_dogs_and_its_not_even/htizlnp/

There is nothing wrong with that, but we have to put our own sanity and our own feelings first. Look in the mirror and tell yourself...

1uuioo2a	Bare minimum is to not get in the way of what they're fighting for.   Beyond that, read up on anything. It could be the history, it could be the current events, or it could be people's personal stories.  But to be active in supporting them, spread the word and advocate for change. Attend the marches and protests. Fight back against bigots online, and potentially even teach them.   Note that Pride parades are more of a celebration of how far they've come, I'm not sure if it's also technically a march.	1642723250.0	htj2002	t3_s8whon	t3_s8whon	/r/offmychest/comments/s8whon/im_a_straight_female/htj2002/

5uiyl241	Absolutely this, though while it may be worth checking the attitude of each specific pride, generally everyone is welcome! Pride at it's core is a protest; the parades will often include groups with signs and chants etc protesting injustice against the community as well as more celebration orientated stuff. Showing up, having a good time and showing your support is always going to be appreciated. Turnout to pride events does make a difference. Besides that, if you have the means, donating to organisations that provide support to the community is a good way to go. I usually recommend the Trevor project and mermaids, but there are a lot of others I'm sure I'm not aware of.	1642723562.0	htj2qwj	t3_s8whon	t1_htj1dsm	/r/offmychest/comments/s8whon/im_a_straight_female/htj2qwj/

iud91j27	If you have to hide something you like from your marginalized friends for fear they think you are transphobic, you are not as liberal as you think.  The reason is, you would be making you fears more about you, than about whatever injustices your marginalized friends experience that you will never be able to 100% understand.   If you can face your fear and not make it about you, and asks genuine questions of inqury to your marginalized friends, then you are providing yourself an opportunity of growth. However, if you do so and your friends choose to have a reaction to it, there is nothing you can do about that, and that is a consequence you would need to be willing to take in order to be more authentic in your own values.   Once I started speaking my truth in my own morals and values, I attracted people who had the same.	1642724156.0	htj460d	t3_s8wts1	t3_s8wts1	/r/offmychest/comments/s8wts1/i_am_liberal_and_progressive_but_i_am_a_jordan/htj460d/

xs75i	Part of what's going on here is major depression, those severe symptoms make it clear (and for me, are familiar).   Have you tried therapy & antidepressants?   I'm diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and mine too was at its worst after losing a relationship I couldn't handle losing. It ended something like 5 years ago. I know much of this feeling, and my life now is somewhat similar, but it's hard to imagine having gotten through that for as long as I had/still am without the help that diagnosis, meds and therapy have given me.   Let yourself do at least that much to help yourself; Think of it as palliative care, if you must. Wherever discomfort exists, and therapy & medications could help, they are worth trying, right? If you don't like the effects of one, you can (talk to your prescriber and ask to) stop and change to another, as many times as necessary to find the best one for you, without any permanent effects from trying them.   Hang in there. I know 'it gets better!' is just not universally true, but on the other hand, if you leave no room to try things that *could* make it better, then 'never getting better' risks becoming a matter of unavoidable manifest destiny.   What I mean is, always keep looking for those opening doors and windows in life that could lead to actually feeling somewhat better. Allow yourself every chance to improve upon this miserable state of being. You might end up surprised at how much trying such doors can help with, and improve, your state of mind & your life in general.  And take care of yourself!	1642724243.0	htj4dfw	t3_s8vvrw	t3_s8vvrw	/r/offmychest/comments/s8vvrw/if_you_stare_too_long_into_the_abyss_then_it/htj4dfw/

hxkvf0j3	it's not that it's a heated topic, it's that a lot of people don't consider children as human beings. they feel that children are property or pets. when confronted about this they get angry and push back. thats what abusers do. physical punishment is absolutely and without any doubt child abuse.  no matter what you did, you didn't deserve to go through that. the fact that they punish their child because they THOUGHT there MIGHT be a lie is just horrible.  being autistic only makes matters worse because you're more sensitive but even if you weren't autistic it still could have traumatized you.

a8yy85cu	Hey, don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. This is simply a setback, not the end of your future as a Dental Hygienist. I know that it sucks and you are disappointed in the situation. But don‚Äôt be disappointed in yourself. Life hit you with some curve balls. You didn‚Äôt plan to be ill, get in a car accident or be in bed with pain killers. But life happened and you pushed through it like a champ - give yourself some credit.   You shouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed. First of all, your grade does not reflect your ability to perform this job. People who know you well, know that. This test is simply a requirement for certification, which is important, but it doesn‚Äôt define the type of Dental Hygienist that you will be.   Go over to the Dental office that you were working at, explain to them what happened and just be honest. There is NOTHING to be ashamed of. You got in a car accident and had to be in bed for a week just three weeks into the program. Let them know that this was a setback and you were just shy of .9 points in passing the test.

b8hf2sj9	This harms my heart to no end! I genuinely wish I could go to my mom in my lower moments. I have tried, but I rarely even get a response from her at all. So I‚Äôve stopped trying. Maybe our relationship is just that broken, I really dont know. I absolutely agree with you, in all the ways to screw up as a parent, ‚Äútoo much love‚Äù is absolutely the best way. Now I‚Äôm wondering if this is the reason I tend to ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù style parent my own daughter. My past, peer/friend that was able to have her mother as a friend, still goes to her for help when she needs, and I‚Äôm actually jealous of that. That is so important to me, for my own daughter, I never want her to think that she cannot come to me for help, or even just to vent at least. I got extremely lucky in that I was able to have an adult in my life at that time, that I could trust and call my friend. This woman was a godsend in a way. She was mentally not healthy, and had MANY of her own issues, but even as a kid I was able to see through that. The love and acceptance from a mother type figure at least, as a preteen, was what I truly needed. The girls I grew up with, in rehabs, hospitals, and juvenile halls, were all so much better off than I was, when their parent was a friend for them, even if they were a crappy and enabling friend. This trend even continued into my first career when I hoped to become successful in helping other young women with similar issues to mine. It genuinely hurts to this day, to not have that type of relationship with my own mother, although I really do recognize the efforts that she made, and also consider the relationship she had with her parents as well. Our relationship now isn‚Äôt bad by any means, but was always best when she did treat me as a friend and even as an equal (our kids are still humans/people). I just never want someone to be down on themselves for being a loving parent and trying their best, when being as loving as possible is often the best thing to do. Your daughter is so lucky to have you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è	1642726453.0	htj9kpi	t3_s87llp	t1_htin8pz	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htj9kpi/

You're doing the right thing by solving that problem before it happens. You're  protecting her from jail. I praise you for making such a hard decision. You are very brave.  Sometimes though, we do have to also put ourselves first. You can't live your life in fear. No one should live like that. You have not failed as mother. You have done everything possible for her.

1giqt01b	At first I wanted to yell from the mountain tops that you don‚Äôt get to tell people how to grieve‚Ä¶until I read the ENTIRE post.   As someone who can‚Äôt get pregnant (or at least every attempt thus far seems to have failed) and/ or has probably had at least two miscarriages thus far (with the same man), I can say I‚Äôd have to agree. It‚Äôs a taboo subject, and with good reason. For a lot of women, it‚Äôs difficult to talk about. Even with their spouses.   There are many nights I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep in my partner‚Äôs arms because of my fear of never being able to have children. Nightmares that woke me up in tears because I lost my cold, it was taken, etc‚Ä¶. And then some where my partner leaves me because of it.   But you know what I don‚Äôt do? I don‚Äôt flood my Instagram and use it as a fucking soap box to stand on. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not over it. Idk. I do grieve, but I don‚Äôt pull the victim card over it.	1642728093.0	htjdd02	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htjdd02/

6xroyy8w	I do not have BPD. Bipolar Disorder Type 2.  I did begin saying mental conditions run in my mother's side of the family, and that my psychiatrist had already told me she would inherit them too. I said he was the trigger for it to happen earlier, not that he is the only cause or contribution. Sorry if it wasn't clear.  It wouldn't be fair for me to describe how I act and treat her, unfortunately I don't think I'd be objective.  I am a strict mother, but a very loving and patient person. I set rules, and like most parents if not all, I expect them to be followed. I can say treatment wise, I am not a terrible person. I will scold when needed, I will get upset if instructions aren't followed, I will rant on and on if school work is not done. I assign house chores and responsibilities. I will remove privileges if needed, and will give them back if earned. I will unfortunately, explain myself much more than I should, because I grew up with "because I said so" and I absolutely hate it. I will sit her down and talk about uncomfortable subjects. I will express when I am sad, when I'm exhausted.  I will get depressed and cry on my own, sometimes she'll see me. When she's younger I would wipe the tears and bring another subject, when she's older I explain what I am feeling, that it's a symptom of my condition, and that is okay to not be okay. I will feel lonely, and shun myself as well. I'll do what I can to get up and spend time with her, but she wants to play, and a lot of times, I don't have the imagination to do it anymore. Sometimes I get sick, so she sees me in pain or taking too many pills. I know she doesn't like it.  I get angry when I'm ignored or disrespected, and I will give long talks about respect, being grateful and putting effort. I will bother her by asking her to do things when she's in her room. She will most likely ignore me, so I'll insist every few hours until she does them, or I end up doing them myself.  I did not allow electronic devices, I would remind her why whenever the conversation came up. I probably was cruel. I told her more than once that she was driving her friends away. I tell her when she grows up, she'll have to follow rules and won't be able to explode when she doesn't agree with someone. I give this lecture over and over.  I am a lonely person. I spend most of my time alone with her. She probably does not see a confident mother (I'm not), or someone who should be trying to set an example for her, as I don't really practice all the self love and "empowering" talks I give her.  She says I always say no when she tries to call her father. Not to excuse myself, but this applies to the violent scenarios. So I denied the calls until she calmed down. She mostly never did. She does not complain about that anymore, as she had a phone.  I had parental controls enabled on her phone, she is not allowed to use social media, and apps are monitored. I respect her privacy and do not check or remove the phone. Phone was taken away last week on Tuesday after last incident. I could not handle being so blatantly disrespected, and her just talking happily on the phone. Petty, some would consider. But from my perspective, it was just one more way she and I both disrespected me. I am her provider but that was a privilege, and I should not let her have it just to "prove" I'm not a mean mother.  I am quiet, barely have energy and focus too much on work. That is an issue, I am sure I'm using work as a coping mechanism, and I have neglected her from overworking. Lately I'm too tired too cook and usually order something for her. She likes Panda Express. I don't eat well. She worries about it and will prompt me to eat and take breaks from work.  We don't go out much. Most weekends or days off are spent in the house. There aren't many things to do where we live. I know she is bored, sometimes we find something to do. Other times she will insist on going out no matter what, and I will remind her people stay in their houses too, that hanging out is not an obligation. I don't feel good saying it, but it's necessary.  I have told her I'm her mother no matter how much she hates it when things go bad. I know it angers her, that I'm supposed to be the bigger person, but I break down too. I have said 'I am your mother, not your friend', when she disrespects me. I absolutely hate it, I want to be her friend, what sense does that make?  I have called her selfish, I've said she doesn't care about anyone other than herself. I've said if she keeps this up she will run people off from her life.  About how I treat her per se. Again, I cannot say. She is well dressed, well fed, told she's loved every day. She is not ignored or deprived of affection. When things are okay, they're basically perfect. When they're not okay, we do not talk to each other and spend the day separately.  Overall, I guess I'm a regular mother. A stressed one. But a regular one. I clarified on my illness because BPD manifests more in aggressiveness, I suffer depression and am not aggressive. I will have manic episodes where I'll be absolutely amazing, and then depressive ones where I am at my worst.  Much like in these comments. I like to make things as clear as possible in hopes there are no misunderstandings between us. I ask if she understands what I've said until then, and to please recap what she understood (ADHD). I want to make sure at least some of my words got through properly and explain what I meant if not.  You can feel free to ask any questions, as I truly don't know what type of answer you're expecting as to how about I act and treat her.  Being suspicious is understandable. I am saying what I've lived. Not what she has, there is more than three sides to this. But mine is what I can provide.

5ko7otm5	I feel this. I‚Äôm 32, and I have had 3 teeth crack and cause excruciating pain. I had to either get root canals or have them taken out. They were all further back teeth so I opted to have them removed because it was way cheaper than the root canal/crown procedure. I am currently dealing with horrible tooth pain in the front/whole left side because I had another one break, but this time it‚Äôs a very close to the front and I really cannot afford to get a root canal and crown right now. I also have another tooth in the back that had half of it break off that needs fixing but it doesn‚Äôt bother me (yet) so once I do go to the dentist I am sure I‚Äôll be facing tens of thousands of dollars in repairs too.   I admit I have not had the best dental hygiene, but not the worst. I also have terrible genes when it comes to teeth, both of my parents have had teeth problems but my dad far worse and I definitely got this from him. My addictions to coffee and cigarettes definitely don‚Äôt help.   I have a friend that had terrible teeth and he went and got all of his teeth removed and got basically dentures that are perfectly straight and white and look amazing. He was only 30 when he did it and he told me he only paid like $5,000. I‚Äôm thinking of doing it.	1642728510.0	htjebj3	t3_s89793	t1_htj0qm4	/r/offmychest/comments/s89793/please_dont_take_your_teeth_for_granted/htjebj3/
z73pex5	Marriage is work. It‚Äôs every day work with no vacations. It‚Äôs at times hard work. It takes work on your part and it takes work on your spouses part. It takes patience. It sometimes takes reminding yourself as many times a day as it takes‚Ä¶ that you love each other.   Marriage isn‚Äôt a car you test drive or a pair of jeans you‚Äôre trying on‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the realization that you can‚Äôt, nor want to imagine a life without that other person. It‚Äôs leaning on one another when times are hard and celebrating one another‚Äôs successes.   When my wife graduated college, she was 34. It had been a long, long road. When she wanted to quit, I reminded her why she was doing it and how she‚Äôd hate herself for quitting. I encouraged her, lifted her up, let her cry on me‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve rarely been as proud as I was as I watched her cross the stage, graduating summa cum laude from Life Pacific University. Only two things prior made me as proud: When my daughter was born and when my son was born, although I was approaching it when my daughter graduated high school. She‚Äôs in college now.   When my wife married me, I was a broken man. I was broken for a long time after‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôve been married 21 years now and life is great. Those old hurts have mostly healed now. You just gotta hold on, realize that she‚Äôs with you because she loves you and her ‚Äúdeserving better‚Äù isn‚Äôt your call. It‚Äôs hers. She chose you. YOU! She didn‚Äôt marry you because she was forced to, depending on what your culture is anyway.   All you gotta do is get up every day and decide to do the best that you can do. If you do that, then you‚Äôre doing all any of us can do.   Just from one broken man to another.	1642728527.0	htjecxh	t3_s8t621	t3_s8t621	/r/offmychest/comments/s8t621/i_dont_want_to_be_married_anymore/htjecxh/

34uyrrki	As I have found out the hard way, some people have good luck, some people have bad luck.  No matter what you do, no matter how nice you are, things just go wrong.  It takes losers to have winners.  I don‚Äôt mean that like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a loser!‚Äù, but some people just seem to get all the luck while others have nothing but a bad run.  It‚Äôs sometimes a matter of learning to live with that bad luck and just roll with it, no matter how shitty it keeps getting.  We are stronger people than most would realize being able to keep trying to be a better person in the face of everything blowing up around us.  We might be over looked by many, but we are so much more and stronger than 80% of the population.  I hope things get better or at least you keep fighting every day.

That damn thing cost $25. It was approx 17 degrees that night. I left the coffee on the tailgate of a pickup truck for anyone to take. About 15 minutes later it was ice cold and useless.

If you love and cherish this friendship let her know that either she needs to listen more or that you can‚Äôt be her therapist. When starts going a ramble about her life/problems you are going to have to stop her, tell her that you are not a trained professional, and that you can‚Äôt help her with her problems.

I got kicked out at 19 because I have a mental illness and other health issues. I'm just now getting my head above water (15 years later) and she's making stupid mistakes like moving out of her old apartment without finding a new one and then complaining that she has to move back in with my parents. I said I wish I had been that lucky.. She justified it by saying she deserves it because she works full time. I reminded her that so was I the last time I asked and dad still said no.  I feel you. I wish I had a better answer than it sucks how unfair life can be, but you know how to survive. She will likely mooch off her parents forever. You got this. Focus on you, you're what matters.

5lgbim1x	More often than not, I feel like we are our own biggest critics and judges. It can be really challenging to extend the compassion we have for others towards ourselves, on my case because I was not raised in an emotionally healthy environment. It is unfortunate, yet I cannot change the past. My responsibility lies on doing what I can now to work with what I have towards my chosen future of productivity, accountability, and peace.  It's quite interesting that I found your post and that you are struggling with it. As I said, I have been struggling for quite sometime too. Just two days ago, a close friend of mine told me that I have been treating people lovingly and positively. Yet, I haven't been able to do the same for myself, for reasons I start to understand. It is not an easy thing to work at, yet the work is necessary nevertheless.  Good luck with talking to your friends. :) And you are very welcome.	1642731462.0	htjl428	t3_s8gi3z	t1_htgsvq0	/r/offmychest/comments/s8gi3z/i_just_want_them_to_know_im_not_alright/htjl428/
14k6cs	I read your post and it just made me think of things I wish I could tell my younger self.   It's sometimes cliche when other people come in and say yea I've been through that it gets better buck up... That kinda sentiment, I've gotten that before baby times in my life. You know they mean well, but the only one who can decide is you.   The thing is though, in my own personal experience, I remember how sad I was, I remember how much it just all felt so monotanus and endless... And I mean I saw one commenter who's life changed for the better in a year... It took five years for me before my life changed, before I changed jobs, found my now husband, got out of the pit I had found myself in.   And I mean it wasn't five years of straight misery, there were absolutely wonderful moments, the birth of my niece was probably the brightest moment of that time, honestly I never knew how much capacity for love I had until I first saw her, I can't imagine had I missed that moment, not seeing her, and my next niece and nephew, watching them grow.   Star wars was my totem... But there were moments that you can only see in hindsight that the sorrow I feel at that thought of missing them can't be articulated.   And this is different for everyone, every single one of us has different experiences, different pain, different moments.   The only solid truth is that the only way to know is to stay, is to be here.   No one can promise you it will get better.. to be honest sometimes it can get worse.. but that too is never a guarantee... It's an endless rolling tide. Life is moments in good and bad times, there will always be moments that even when brief can make it worth it.   There's no way to tell you it'll get better, no way to tell you it'll get worse, you could find yourself in ten years wishing to tell yourself how much it changed..   I read my timehops on Facebook from years ago and it breaks my heart sometimes... But it also makes me appreciate how far I've come. Even when I have sad moments now... My life has come so far, I've had so many moments I wouldn't give up for anything. And the only reason I have those is because I found a way, my own way, to keep myself going.   I hope you find your way, I hope in ten years you see this post and you can smile and reflect on all that has changed from then. I truly hope you stay.	1642731519.0	htjl8tv	t3_s8eoan	t1_htij60n	/r/offmychest/comments/s8eoan/i_feel_like_i_have_to_kill_myself/htjl8tv/

Forgive yourself for what you did not know, that is the only way we can learn and grow. You did what you knew best.   We must admit that life is just a cycle of acquiring many skills, relationship being one of them. I am still consciously incompetent at it at times, yet it is what it is.   As long as you can hold yourself with accountability, respect, and compassion in a productive way, you will grow into a good human being just fine.

79hapuda	Being attractive is a pretty subjective thing. I think you‚Äôre not recognizing just how true that is. Are there people who are genetically ‚Äúgifted‚Äù because they are well proportioned and symmetrical? Yeah, of course. That makes it easier for them to be attractive. Having said that, there are many things that add to a person‚Äôs attractiveness. Some of the things I‚Äôve observed that make people universally attractive are good hygiene, straight clean teeth, being funny, being confident, being kind to others, being physically active and/or fit, taking care in how you dress and just present yourself to others. No one of these things will make you ‚Äúhot‚Äù but they all add to your attractiveness and you should really not underestimate it.  I want to speak specifically about confidence because I think that‚Äôs very under appreciated and/or misunderstood. Being confident does not mean having a chip on your shoulder and telling people off when they insult you. Being confident means you are comfortable enough in your own skin to both care about other people without seeking approval but also don‚Äôt get offended if someone insults you because clearly they‚Äôre not worth your time. Just be a genuine person and people are ALWAYS attracted to that.  The last point I would make is ask you who are you trying to be attractive to? If you expect or want to be ‚Äúhot‚Äù to everyone, good luck because even conventionally ‚Äúhot‚Äù people are not attractive to everyone. There are so many people in the world, don‚Äôt stress about the people who don‚Äôt find you attractive and find yourself a good one who does and be happy with that. Physical beauty is so fleeting but human connection can be so fulfilling and last a lifetime. Prioritize the things that make you happy. Chasing an unattainable goal of purely physical beauty sounds like a pretty lonely road to me.	1642732135.0	htjmnqj	t3_s8n86p	t3_s8n86p	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htjmnqj/

ecnyntdk	You need to understand that you and your step mother are the 'bad guys' in this story. Not the victim. That's your father.  Presumably he married your step mother because he cares for her. The two of you just destroyed him.   There is no excuse for your behaviour.  Doing it because you are attracted to one another or because you're not that close to him does not excuse what you did nor somehow make it ok. You have to come to terms with that and accept you two did something very cruel and find a way forward.  Maybe you two are very attracted to one another and should become a couple. But she should have ended it with your father first.	1642732961.0	htjokua	t3_s8yhz8	t1_htjhb26	/r/offmychest/comments/s8yhz8/my_dad_found_out_i_slept_with_his_wife/htjokua/
6xc9wycm	I think that's part of it. I think it's been a problem for me for at least 11 years.  I think that I'm willing to try in the future an anti-depressant medication treatment and some surface/superficial level therapy if it's required.. maybe   At one point, I somehow managed to replace the doom I was living in with limbo, that's how I've got through it for so long without snapping one way or another.  You're right, palliative care is really well put, that's how I'd see it. Keeping semi-functional and appearances has gotten incredibly hard in the last few years, I don't really have another choice than to try something, anything.  I know. I feel bad for the people that care about me. Some opportunities I can't get back and there's more to come. At first I wanted to get to that numbness, I thought that's part of "it gets better", but once I got there, the numbness is just.. death. Having the ups and downs, the spikes and the falls, punching walls alone after laughing with friends and having a good time, that's more living, I was more human then, in a way. I'll have to work before getting to those situations again, because I don't have the control I used to, and I prefer my yearly 2 panic attacks to happen in a random night rather than while socializing.  I'm very lucky because some of those doors and windows are still open/unlocked after all this time so I can start with that. Many others don't even have that. I know it can help a lot, still, making the first step in something is incredibly harder for me, compared to the rest of the process. There are things I look forward to, at the moment, not exactly happiness-wise, but progress-wise. Progress to what? Some peace, I guess. That's the only thing I dare to hope at the moment.  What helped me the most was showing compassion (not pity) towards myself, forgiving myself, accepting the regrets as they are and at least try to make it so the current version of myself won't pile up on the same kind of regrets as the past versions. Learning from mistakes is hard when you feel like you're hard-wired a certain way and you have to over-ride your tendencies over and over again.   Stopping for as long as I did is criminal. Keep looking and trying for those doors; that's living! And I'm gonna try to do the same.  Thank You !	1642732970.0	htjolko	t3_s8vvrw	t1_htj4dfw	/r/offmychest/comments/s8vvrw/if_you_stare_too_long_into_the_abyss_then_it/htjolko/

Your family's attitude to abortion and 2. You're unsure about the "what next?"   Keep yourself busy mentally. It could be as simple as watching some videos on You Tube, or doing some gardening. Whatever you enjoy that keeps you busy. Lately I've been doing experiments with growing fruit trees from a seed. Stone fruit (plants whose fruit has a "hard" seed in the core like apricots, peaches, nectarines and so on) can be grown from seed so long as you crack the outer shell of the stone, like you would with an almond. Planted May last year, I now have an apricot tree in a pot that's 1.8 metres tall. It will take a couple of years before I'll get any fruit out of it, but it has been interesting to watch it get to this stage.  "Keeping busy" has always been my way of healing from emotional trauma. I'd describe the process as "I looked up from what I was doing one day and realised it didn't hurt anymore."	1642733083.0	htjov5j	t3_s78ne2	t3_s78ne2	/r/offmychest/comments/s78ne2/im_having_an_abortion_tomorrow_and_i_need_someone/htjov5j/

2gjende7	My mom had, in order:  - abortion - stillbirth  -me - younger brother -miscarriage  ... likely that's not all, but she passed and I can't ask her any more. They all impacted her differently. The stillbirth, for example, we always knew as my older brother. We visited his grave on his birthday. My dad is buried there now.   The miscarriage was with my stepdad, and I was at least seven (my brother was five or so). She was sad, but also relieved. *She didn't have to stay with her abuser.* also, she wasn't more than 3 months along, vs with my older brother who was delivered on his due date.   Life is a rich tapestry.	1642733266.0	htjpagg	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htjpagg/

3gqngk0t	You can bully him into changing his mind, as if he loves you he will do that, won‚Äôt he? You can make him resent you as it will mean he has to give up everything to allow you to be a mother. That resentment will eventually drive you apart.   Or  You can talk to him and understand why what he wants is as important as what you want.   Source: my ex wife bullied me into having a third child. She then demanded a fourth. She didn‚Äôt care about parenting, she just wanted babies. She refused sex unless it was to have more children as a way to force me to agree with her. She let me do all the household chores, work full time and raise the children we had as I tried to keep the relationship going. She then left me for someone else, took custody of the children and let their lives go to hell in order to satisfy her own whims.	1642733538.0	htjpx9j	t3_s8znjj	t3_s8znjj	/r/offmychest/comments/s8znjj/i_do_and_he_doesnt/htjpx9j/

3nadvh2v	I agree with you on so many points that entertainment often uses the worst examples of what a relationship, argument or interaction can be. When it‚Äôs also done in a way that seems accepted or to be perceived as intense love it can really mess with viewers concepts of what is acceptable behavior. I found this especially alarming while being in a relationship that didn‚Äôt involve that behavior. I had seen it so often in entertainment I was almost expecting to see that behavior.  I hope more shows and movies will show more positive relationship examples. I was struck watching Ted Lasso that they have very deliberately involved some good conflict resolution into the show. In particular, when one of the cast had betrayed another. Once that person came clean and expressed their regret they had a conversation about moving forward. Right away I had the thought that on any other show that would have turned into a huge plot on how they could get revenge. While it wasn‚Äôt a romantic relationship it felt good to see the conversation on screen changing. I understand that some people can separate entertainment from reality. At the same time, when you are constantly bombarded with that behavior being presented as acceptable it starts to sink in whether you want it to or not.	1642734298.0	htjro7j	t3_s8wkrp	t3_s8wkrp	/r/offmychest/comments/s8wkrp/unpopular_opinion_tvmoviesmusic_should_take_more/htjro7j/

698447bo	I‚Äôve had a miscarriage and I totally agree with you. I don‚Äôt mean to sound insensitive about it but it was sad and then I moved on. Maybe part of what shaped my view on this was that right around the same time I miscarried (at 8 weeks) my best friend gave birth to a baby girl who died. She held her baby. She named her baby. She had a burial for her baby.  What I went through does not compare to what she went through.	1642734649.0	htjsgv2	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htjsgv2/

Then her surprise number two came.  Her number two was born 2 months after I lost my girl sleeping.  She still now shrugs off all baby loss as "things happen".

hq4byhb6	I 1000% agree with you making the best decision for you. Kids are not for everyone. I have a (defective) uterus and I cannot explain to people in words how this has saved my life.  I love kids. Everyone in my family calls me the baby whisperer (not as creepy as it sounds because I do have a uterus) because they *flock* to me like I'm Mary fucking Poppins. My partner has kids.I  love them like mad, but I  also like that if things changed and it didn't work out. I can leave and go anywhere. He's tethered to their mother.. maybe forever (one of his kids has special needs and will likely never be able to live on their own) and she is psychotic. I don't think I'd ever leave him without things drastically changing between us, but having the option takes *so much* pressure off of me and our relationship.	1642734864.0	htjsy9c	t3_s9044x	t3_s9044x	/r/offmychest/comments/s9044x/deciding_not_to_have_kids_was_the_most_freeing/htjsy9c/

c2mrxy37	I am so sorry that people said dismissive things to you during your time of need. Sometimes people who can‚Äôt handle grief try to make themselves feel better by telling you that your problems are small. That is wrong and small of them. You deserved better.   My concern isn‚Äôt that people don‚Äôt get to grieve based on the duration of the pregnancy. My concern is that parents need to stop telling their children graphic stories about dead siblings before it is developmentally appropriate to clue them in on your reproductive life.   My cousin deserved, and continues to deserve, all the love and respect and tender care in the world for her miscarriage. She went through something awful and real.   It seems that I did a poor job of expressing how much I believe people experiencing pregnancy loss deserve to grieve, no matter the circumstances, and I‚Äôm sorry for that.

Don't get me wrong, it was devastating at the time, but it wasn't yet a baby. I grieved not being pregnant,  I grieved not getting to make a huge family announcement like I wanted, but I didn't grieve a child because it wasn't yet a child.  When we conceived a second time, I was very open with what had happened but also somewhat non chalant about it. It was so uncomfortable for people to call my baby my "rainbow baby."

3dr7sz3r	You're not weak, you're struggling.. I'm not just talking out of my ass either, I have dealt with mental health issues for all of my life, suicidal thoughts for years, dissociation, mood swings, psychosis and several anxiety disorders.. If you're weak then so am I and so are the billions of ppl who have struggled with mental health issues at some point in their life. You're not alone in this, so many ppl have been where you have been.  your mom fucked you over by not taking you to therapy sooner and it sounds like you're mom is toxic af.. Recovery is 100x harder with negative ppl in your life so putting space between you and her until you start feeling better might help. If that's possible ofc. It's very important that you get back on your meds, withdrawals are very real and going cold turkey will makes things worse .. If you feel like your meds aren't working then you should talk to your psychiatrist about adjusting them or trying something new. Even if you decided to stop taking them, you need to talk with your psych first..  Also with therapy, it takes some time before you'll start feeling better, 4yrs is a very long time to struggle and it'll takes time to get better. I've been in therapy for 4yrs and on meds for 6yrs, I know from experience that it takes some time but no matter how severe your mental health issues are, it can always get better. I know it sounds like bullshit, I felt the same way when I was suicidal but it will get better. I'm saying this as someone who's been where you are and made it to the other side. You almost have to live it to believe it, which is why you need to keep up therapy, meds, mindfulness, ect. Cause it's not gonna happen overnight but trust me, it will happen. Fuck the whole it's selfish bullshit, it's not about other ppl .. it's your life and the reason to keep going is so you can experience what it's like to get better and be content with life. The work is worth it and it will pay off. If you die now, you die suffering. You won't get to know the feeling you get from recovery, from putting in the work and for most importantly, surviving it and living in spite of it. You started therapy and are seeing someone for meds, that's not something everyone has the courage to do.. You should be proud of yourself for surviving this long and for actually going to therapy. I know how hard this is but please keep going, one day you'll be glad you did. Keep up the work, it might not feel like it rn but you can do this.

The reason I went in was cause I did have broken teeth and the pain finally forced me. Best decision, long awaited though. Now my teeth are good and with minimal out of pocket expenses. I totally regret not going in earlier. Take care of your teeth.	1642735779.0	htjuzkb	t3_s89793	t3_s89793	/r/offmychest/comments/s89793/please_dont_take_your_teeth_for_granted/htjuzkb/

4rixtvn3	Just wanted to say that I appreciate your post and this should be part of the conversation more, in my opinion. My mom experienced 3 miscarriages, had me, and then had a stillborn daughter full-term when when I was 6. I can‚Äôt imagine how traumatic that was and no one should have to go through that. However, I ended up being the receptacle for her grief for years and it was very damaging not only to our relationship but is trauma I‚Äôm still processing through in my 30s. I‚Äôm super lucky to have access to therapy and am working through it, but I hope conversations like the one you‚Äôre raising here can become part of the larger dialogue around this issues. I imagine if my mom had more support, or mental health treatment for her grief, it would have been better for our whole family because I know she was certainly not intentionally inflicting pain.	1642736998.0	htjxnwq	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjuflt	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htjxnwq/

fap94ru4	My old friend had a sister who was absolutely insane. She was obsessed with having kids and had like 4 miscarriages which is awful and of course I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. But she ended up giving birth to a harlequin baby that died a few minutes after birth, and had all of her children come in the room and take turns holding the dead baby for pictures. She had these pictures put on shirts and blankets and gave them out to the family and everyone was really disturbed.  Every holiday they take a family photo with the dead baby picture and put Santa hats on it and shit. It's so morbid and sad.	1642738312.0	htk0h59	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htk0h59/

Also down to the part about not having children. For those who responded saying they hope this is possible, I‚Äôll say that I was married once and engaged three other times, all to men who cheated on me and not healthy for a relationship, at least at that time. I met my partner finally at 41. I feel so fortunate every day. And we met in the grocery store!!! Crazy how life is. Anyway, don‚Äôt settle ladies. We bring too much to the table to accept less than we deserve.

2ml35xoe	As someone whose had a miscarriage I totally agree with you. Trauma porn is really disturbing. Personally, my trauma isn‚Äôt around losing a baby (I was 10 weeks along. It was hardly a baby at that point) it‚Äôs around how physically painful the process of miscarriage was. It took three weeks and I got an infection because the fetal tissue wouldn‚Äôt flush out. I hemorrhaged and spent the night in the ER getting pumped full of morphine and needed to have my uterus flushed out with a vacuum thing. I‚Äôm saying this because most miscarriage influencers only talk about emotional pain and not the physical because they want sympathy (emotional pain lasts longer than physical pain). They love the attention.	1642739271.0	htk2h5a	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htk2h5a/
52h44lpq	Hello,   I don't know everything about religion or the universe and life but all I can think to say or ask is why?  Why do you do this? Why do you put yourself in a dark place with possibly negative emotions that scare you or make you think badly?  What does this bring to your life?  Does it make you feel good?  We try to live our lives in the best most positive ways possible, we want to be happy, comfortable and secure.  You are a special unique human being that has been gifted life to live to the fullest.  Regardless of what you believe in or how you are raised it's up to you to look to the bright side and make something out of it.  If what you are doing is scaring you... Well then don't do it. I understand the curiosity of wanting to try this but I believe that if you are bringing your mental sanity into question then if it was me I would stop.   The most important thing in this world and life is yourself and your emotions. DO NOT Sacrifice them because of curiosity or boredom. Feel free to reply. I'm not here to hate on religion. I would just like to see all people be happy and emotionally stable.	1642739317.0	htk2kh6	t3_s91vou	t3_s91vou	/r/offmychest/comments/s91vou/i_need_some_help_or_something/htk2kh6/

2zz1euy4	I am married to an INTJ, and let me tell you, emotional stuff isn't his strong point. He has been making more of an effort, though, especially after I shared with him some statements that would be comforting and validating for me whenever I'm going through stuff. It's been a big help for my husband because he's more aware now that for me, being comforted means having my emotions acknowledged instead of being given advice. My husband is very solution-oriented, so his instinct really is to try to fix things even when I don't really need to do so right away.   Maybe you can tell your friend about specific statements that she can tell you whenever you're going through something. Or you can share with her the type of comfort you need (e.g., acknowledgement of emotions instead of advice/logical assumptions).	1642739576.0	htk33ut	t3_s8gvy2	t3_s8gvy2	/r/offmychest/comments/s8gvy2/does_anyone_have_a_bestfriend_or_someone_close/htk33ut/

gta7yi79	   Well, I am not sure the question you ask you wanted me to answer so I did anyways. The reason I  do it is because when I cast spells and do different rituals it makes me feel powerful as if nothing can hurt me. It really doesn't put me in a dark place I been doing it for a few months and nothing has ever happened like if did tonight, it doesn't scary me well, to night if shook me up because it was the first time it has happened. In some why it dose make me feel good because I use to be bullied and now when I do spells I feel in power.	1642740134.0	htk48bt	t3_s91vou	t1_htk2kh6	/r/offmychest/comments/s91vou/i_need_some_help_or_something/htk48bt/

2xxge9h6	Yes! Exactly! I have had six miscarriages all in the first trimester. We‚Äôre they emotionally painful? Yes. But I never had to feel those fetuses kick or see their bodies growing on sonograms. Losing a baby after it is viable (26 weeks+) is a whole different thing. While they still consider them miscarriages, I think if they die that late into development they should just be considered still born. It‚Äôs much more of an attachment lost and the effects on the woman‚Äôs body are much greater too.

I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks and I would never dream of comparing that to my friend. She knew nearly her entire pregnancy that the little one she could feel moving inside of her would either be stillborn or die shortly after birth. She got to hold her daughter alive for a few seconds before she passed.	1642741168.0	htk68uk	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjsgv2	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htk68uk/

2oevbpud	Over the course of your life your brain will pick out very many terrifying shapes in the dark. Humans survived so long because of our ability to recognize patterns. Unfortunately this also renders in Jesus-Cheetos and Demon Dark Faces.   If the hallucination was vivid, and out of the ordinary things like that happen frequently, Id recommend talking to your parents about seeing a doctor.   I promise you, it is not the devil giving you signs, not really.   Not sure of your sect of Satanism, as the Satanic Temple doesnt worship him but the Church of Satan does. Id recommend delving deeper into your readings. Neither is particularily 'good', as they are both run by imperfect humans, but I tend to gravitate towards the Temple, and the 11 Satanic Rules of the Earth. But i do not believe in him as an entity and very much do not think he gave you a sign.	1642741689.0	htk78tu	t3_s91vou	t1_htk4da3	/r/offmychest/comments/s91vou/i_need_some_help_or_something/htk78tu/

iuwe6hmq	I just always feel like they will find someone better and leave. I just really want to be enough for someone. Sick of being cheated on and used. Maybe I give too much. I always give everything I have to my relationships, I just want to be the best for them and be enough. I'm drained. I've run dry. I'm not a perfect boyfriend, but I really try to be the best partner I can. I don't really know if I see the point in trying to be a good partner anymore though. It seems like it always leads to the same place regardless. Seems like relationships are nothing but a series of transactions for most people. Maybe I give too much of myself away so when I inevitably run out, they walk away. Idk. My self worth is so wrapped up in romantic and sexual approval and validation.

cl94kfsp	I've been there.  Ex was extremely emotionally, verbally, and financially abusive. Guess what? Nobody knew. My parents had a small idea as they witnessed some of our arguments. But even they were blown away by just how bad it was.  I was so depressed because of him that I thought the only way out was by me not being alive. Luckily, I reached out to my dad one night when those thoughts got more intense. I told him everything and he helped me start making a game plan to get out.  My ex still has a lot of people fooled. Sometimes the mask breaks and people see him for who he really is. Narcissists are scary. They can destroy someone's whole life without even touching them, just by their actions and their words.	1642742558.0	htk8vlw	t3_s92438	t3_s92438	/r/offmychest/comments/s92438/i_have_a_charmed_life_but_i_think_my_husband/htk8vlw/

rhwmz49	Part of removing the stigma from miscarriage is normalising it. They happen a lot and to a lot of women. It‚Äôs okay to grieve and its also perfectly okay to not feel the need to.   Moving on is an important part of grieving. How and when you get there is very much an individual thing. That said, its frustrating to watch people define their entire personality and future around a traumatic event. It seems like an unhealthy coping mechanism that‚Äôs constantly retraumatising them and the people around them.   We‚Äôre also much better at determining pregnancy at earlier stages. So some of these very early miscarriages would previously have been assumed to be a regular period and wouldn‚Äôt usually have the same degree of grief attached.	1642742730.0	htk971n	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htk971n/

You also want to push people close to you away. You will never fully understand her pain and that‚Äôs lonely for her. There is nothing you can do to make it better, unless there is something specific asked of you. Give her space. Let her know you‚Äôre there for her and stop contacting.

cjd7n06m	I think social media makes people emotionally inept. Instead of processing the tragedy of miscarriage privately they rely on the attention and sympathy social media will generate to feel better. I say this humbly as someone who posted about a different albeit equally tragic personal matter. I wish I could take that back, because really not everyone you know is worthy of or equipped to process your personal trauma. As much as I believe we should be having more conversations about miscarriage, I don‚Äôt think that can happen authentically or in a healthy way over social media. It‚Äôs about as absurd as walking up to someone you see weekly in your yoga class and telling them you miscarried. I chalked it up to having poor emotional boundaries. I look back and cringe at that behavior. I have several friends on Facebook who have miscarried before 2 weeks, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish that pain on my worst energy but I don‚Äôt feel convinced that when they post about the 5th anniversary of losing their unborn child or they post that commemorative tattoo that it‚Äôs done with honest genuine intentions. I think we all just want people to see that we‚Äôre hurting and to feel sad for us but I think we also fail to realize that everyone has their own pain and hurt and we can get stuck believing we have a monopoly on pain and suffering. So I say all this as carefully as I possibly can because I agree we can‚Äôt police the way other people are hurting but I think social media has fucked up so many things, this being one of them. I truly believe the superpower of vulnerability lies in comforting and empathizing organically with those who have to walk through something unimaginably painful that you have experienced yourself - NOT mashing the cry emoji button on Facebook every time -insert name here- reminds the world she lost baby 2 days after conception.	1642743001.0	htk9own	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htk9own/

It was disappointing, but I didn‚Äôt gender the ZEF that was basically nonexistent, or try to compare the event to a major pregnancy loss. I didn‚Äôt call it a miscarriage, even.

I guess it‚Äôs possible he could change, but that‚Äôs going to take a lot of work on his part.  If he is not willing to do that, get out.  No one deserves to be treated the way he is treating you.  Do it for yourself and for your kids.  You don‚Äôt want your kids to grow up thinking his behavior is an appropriate way to treat a spouse.

518fr9bt	I honestly didn't know this was a thing to begin with, and it seems quite weird to me...  Some acquaintances have lost their babies, and I suffered a miscarriage when I was 21, at about 6-7 weeks. Didn't even realise I was pregnant (I'm incredibly irregular) until the bleeding and the pain began. It was a shock, for sure, and I grieved for some time...  But I could've never imagined myself doing any of the things that OP describes, and while my acquaintances had a really hard time with their losses, they moved on in what I'd say was a fairly healthy way.  I might be wrong, but what I read in this post isn't healthy at all, neither for the mothers nor the people they're getting involved, especially other children. And to raise sympathy, money, or even *likes* by over-sharing through social media? That... That *can't* be good!  I try to be respectful of people's beliefs and decisions, I swear, but there's -or ***should be*** \- an obvious line between following those beliefs (religious, spiritual, whatever) and pulling out the "victim card" in such a selfish, unhealthy and/or obnoxious way.  I'm sorry, but what on Earth are people like this thinking?	1642743310.0	htka9cu	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htka9cu/
cl94kfsp	Reach out to whoever you can. Friends (if he let's you have them, mine didn't), other relatives, other siblings. Anyone. Hell, I even reached out to my landlord, at the time, for some help. You could still reach out to your parents. I'm sure if they knew how you felt, they would still want to help in any sort of way you can. You can get out by yourself. It's harder that way but it's not impossible.   Just know that you don't have to stay. That you can get out. And also just be safe. Narcissists are scary. Even if he's never been physical with you before doesn't mean he won't ever put his hands on you. If things start to escalate towards that, reach out to authorities if you need to.	1642743370.0	htkadaj	t3_s92438	t1_htk9ie9	/r/offmychest/comments/s92438/i_have_a_charmed_life_but_i_think_my_husband/htkadaj/

3fgnnpxb	Oh man I‚Äôm so sorry you are feeling like this. THERE IS HOPE. I promise. I‚Äôd suggest first finding a counselor or psychologist to talk to about all of this. Your anxiety needs to be managed quickly so you can  think clearly again. Once the panic and anxiety are better managed, you‚Äôll be able to brainstorm and work with someone on how to leverage your skills to another profession.   This happens a lot (the intense study, years of school, crazy hard effort, and then realizing that oh shit, you *hate* what you do.) And then there is huge shame because you‚Äôve invested so much damn time, sweat, blood and tears into the career, how dare you not love it??  Shit, we are human. We make mistakes. The idea that we are all supposed to just pop out and have a magic clue what we‚Äôd love to do for a living is ludicrous. You are very well educated and obviously capable of working under intense pressure. You‚Äôre able to study long hours and memorize huge amounts of data. You obviously have a strong work ethic and are a stubborn persevering person (meant in a good way.) Those are all traits that will make you a success no matter where you go.  Get out of that job by going to someone who can help with the anxiety, talk to them and open up about all this. Then you can begin planning your escape.  You didn‚Äôt make a mistake, you‚Äôre human! But now, you can take care of yourself and get out. Good luck friend.	1642743393.0	htkaeu3	t3_s907dz	t3_s907dz	/r/offmychest/comments/s907dz/i_am_a_lawyer_and_i_hate_it_so_much_that_i_feel/htkaeu3/

6hoa2t0j	Since she was doing this behind your back, does this mean you had no idea your wife is abusive?  This is a lot for you to take in and you're probably in shock, so it's understandable how you can still love her. With time you'll realise she is not your 'soulmate', and that you are better off without her, and more so, your children are far better off without her.   Also, you should get your children into therapy and yourself, because this kind of treatment can be highly damaging. When you go to therapy, get advice on how you can help your children deal with the abuse too.	1642744350.0	htkc52o	t3_s93jwf	t3_s93jwf	/r/offmychest/comments/s93jwf/my_life_is_a_living_nightmare/htkc52o/

zblo1	You're an amazing mother, with unconditional love. Even if its not appreciated, its not unnoticed.  Im 28, and its only been recently how I've come to terms with what I was diagnosed with so many years ago. My grandparents adopted me when I was a baby, and my grandfather (now dad) is the best person I've ever known. And I treated him like absolute shit over the years. It wasn't until he was at his worse that i had those flashes of what I had done. Kicking the window out the van as he took me to the hospital as a kid, screaming that I hated him. Pushing him on the ground as I was in a drunk, manic, stupor lost in a crowd losing my sanity as a young adult. Every mean word, and action that I hurt him with, I felt a thousand times over as if it was a red hot poker searing itself into my heart.  BPD never goes away, and it truely is a struggle every day. We don't mean to hurt the ones we love, and most regret it almost instantly, even if we don't show it.  I'm sorry you were hurt by the one you love the most, and I hope one day things can change for the better.	1642744429.0	htkca6g	t3_s87llp	t1_htg5yuv	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htkca6g/

98jju1qq	Taking care of yourself, which includes skin, nail, and hair care and dressing in a way that suits your color profile and your proportions can dramatically change the way you look and are perceived. It‚Äôs also true that there is a type of beauty that radiates out from inside. Of course physical features are what they are. But all any of us can do is work with what we‚Äôve got, love ourselves enough to let our best self shine through, and make relationships with people who see the beauty in us wherever it comes from. I work in entertainment and I see a lot of ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù people all the time. And many of them are the most unhappy and also truly the ugliest people ever. A lot of this, I think, is choosing how to see and not projecting your judgements about yourself into how other people see you.	1642744515.0	htkcfi2	t3_s8n86p	t3_s8n86p	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htkcfi2/

pg60o	I also never know if the influencers have actually undergone real trauma or they‚Äôre faking.  All throughout modern times, peoples public profile and personas haven‚Äôt matched their private lives.  But with influencers, it‚Äôs kind of wild how far they‚Äôre willing to go - and how brazenly they‚Äôre comfortable doing it. Because most don‚Äôt have much to lose :(  So I really would not be surprised if some of these especially vocal ‚Äúmiscarriage influencers‚Äù hadn‚Äôt gone through a miscarriage themselves. if ever confronted they would either rage at someone doubting them or they would suggest that they‚Äôre speaking on behalf of someone/people who can‚Äôt.  Influencer culture has meant that everyone can and apparently wants to live like a Hollywood d lister lol. Little bits of negative attention, but just enough to make you money.	1642744696.0	htkcqsj	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htju42i	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkcqsj/

cfh05j61	I had a miscarriage and it absolutely broke me. It was a planned surprise if that makes sense lol. We wanted to start a family but didn‚Äôt think it would happen on our first try. I was so happy when I found out. No one knows about that miscarriage other than my immediate family and of course my husband and his family. Once I got better emotionally I was always tempted to make a post about it. I think we just feel the need to let it out. But every time I would start a post. I always stopped myself from posting it cause just writing it was therapeutic for me. I guess some people like the attention and the pity party they get for a couple of hours... idk.

ikgqtjk7	Just because a person puts themselves and their needs first doesn't mean they're not capable of loving you. Everyone should put their needs first and then someone else's. This is how it should be. I don't think I'm a selfish person. I do myself and my career/needs first but if my friends or anyone else needs me, I'd be there for them. However, I hate to say it but if accomodating someone means I'd have to sacrifice my career/needs I wouldn't do it.   People who disregard their needs and only put other people's needs first are called people pleasers.	1642745154.0	htkdj9q	t3_s92055	t3_s92055	/r/offmychest/comments/s92055/sick_of_dating_people_who_always_put_themselves/htkdj9q/
88pjmd3m	There is never a right time. Something will always come up and seem important and you can keep pushing children back but as you get older it does get harder  However on the other side of that is working out the logistics of what would happen if you did keep the baby. Who will stay home for the first 6mo? Will money be an issue? Do you have childcare arranged after?  It‚Äôs a lot but at the end of the day it is your choice. Don‚Äôt let anyone convince you one way or another.

3x3so	‚ÄúDisabled‚Äù is a verb. Society disables people by refusing to accommodate. For instance, people get annoyed at the prospect of having to fund ramp access due to regulations - but completely forget that the steps they build are also subject to regulations and construction standards that make sure the steps are accessible to those who possess a certain level of walking ability.  They also forget that accessibility regulations also help people who don‚Äôt have physical issues - like people with pushchairs, prams, etc.  It‚Äôs frustrating.	1642745506.0	htke4oc	t3_s8yxcz	t3_s8yxcz	/r/offmychest/comments/s8yxcz/people_with_disabilities_are_not_a_burden_on/htke4oc/

6hoa2t0j	It's so fresh - you need time to heal from this trauma. You'll feel all sorts of things and you need to allow that to happen to process and overcome it. Don't expect your daughter and yourself to heal straight away.   Hopefully your mum (and other female influences) will step in and show your daughter how she should be treated by women. Also, if your son saw this, you might want to pay extra attention to how he treats people.   Trauma can be an ongoing thing (often is), so it's very important that your daughter talks to someone to try and avoid future issues.

cl94kfsp	It was so hard for me to get out. I was the one supporting him. Me leaving meant that he would be homeless. And I was terrified of being the villain. Emotional abuse is strange. I look back every once in awhile at some of the text messages that I had from him and I'm appalled that I let someone talk to me the way he did. But he always made it seem like i deserved it. I wasn't the perfect girlfriend for whatever reason and I wasn't giving him what he wanted so I deserved it. Now that I'm out, and starting a much healthier relationship, I've realized how broken I was back then.   I tried leaving three times before I was actually able to. It's hard. Especially if you don't have outside support. The only thing that kept me from falling into his manipulation for a fourth time was realizing that things were escalating and were spiraling very quickly towards a potentially dangerous (or worse, deadly) situation for me.	1642746035.0	htkf075	t3_s92438	t1_htkavh6	/r/offmychest/comments/s92438/i_have_a_charmed_life_but_i_think_my_husband/htkf075/

88keprq8	Personally, I don‚Äôt believe in unconditional love‚Ä¶ there should always be conditions and boundaries in any relationship. They‚Äôre what make relationships *healthy*. I won‚Äôt love you if you are a terrible person for me and vice versa... If I were your partner, I‚Äôd be a bit overwhelmed by the statement ‚ÄúI will literally sacrifice everything for the sake of my partner and my relationship‚Äù. It shows you don‚Äôt care about yourself at all and that this relationship is the only thing you have going for you. You‚Äôre supposed to grow with the other person, not use them like a crutch.   Giving and giving without anything in return isn‚Äôt healthy. Healthy relationships are all about equilibrium.. as much as you take, you give.   What‚Äôs wrong with caring about yourself? Selfishness in moderation is *healthy*. I feel like you may be confusing selfishness for self-respect. Everyone has a different capacity for bullshit, some people are just less likely to put up with you than others.  You opening up about your mental health isn‚Äôt the problem‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the fact you are so concerned about being enough for *them*, that you never think about if they‚Äôre enough for *you*. You have to learn to be more selfish and stop trying to love yourself through other people.  That being said, I really hope you learn to love yourself on your own OP, as cheesy as that sounds.. because if you view yourself as trash, you‚Äôll attract and settle for trash. You‚Äôll end up hurt and then the cycle will continue.. Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop dating and do a little self reflection‚Ä¶	1642746814.0	htkg93k	t3_s92055	t3_s92055	/r/offmychest/comments/s92055/sick_of_dating_people_who_always_put_themselves/htkg93k/

6hoa2t0j	Sure, even though I'd only seen my (far) younger cousin briefly, she copied something I was doing, so they are very impressionable.  In one positive aspect, psychology is moving forward at such a quick pace, you should be able to find resources that can help.   Today, I listened to the HubermanLab podcast episode 49 - Erasing fears and trauma based on the modern neuroscience of fear. This could be helpful to you. One thing it mentioned was talking about the experience over and over, so it becomes 'boring', still bad, but it doesn't hold power over your emotions, then you replace it with a positive, while linking that to memory.  He obviously explains it better, but it could be worth your time to help your situation.	1642746914.0	htkgepb	t3_s93jwf	t1_htkf1r6	/r/offmychest/comments/s93jwf/my_life_is_a_living_nightmare/htkgepb/

Of course your feelings and worries are valid, but it‚Äôs not your fault, everyone makes mistakes and you were in a very vulnerable state of mind and position with this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. I use quotations because if he was a true friend he wouldn‚Äôt have pressured you like he did and he was not right whatsoever for doing that at all. You should never ever feel uncomfortable or pressured into doing things, sexual or otherwise. I‚Äôve been in this situation many times unfortunately and I know the anxiety and guilt, the shame and beating up on myself over it. I just want you to know that I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs your fault nor that you have any reason to be so hard on yourself about it. I‚Äôm also sorry that you were pressured into it and that you don‚Äôt have anyone you can confide in with this information.

7cf0d91k	I knew somone who did something similar. They would be having a 'miscarriage' then 2 weeks later be like 10 weeks pregnant again. If you questioned her she'd have some half baked explanation.  The maths and excuses never added up and a baby never came. Her poor boyfriend just went along with it every time. She even decided to have a miscarriage at a mutual freinds birthday party. Basicly came out of the bathroom crying and getting on like she'd just started bleeding and was in severe pain on the floor but wouldn't let us call an ambulance. I still can't decide if she genuinely thought she was pregnant and each period was just a miscarriage or if she was fully aware of her own deception.	1642748557.0	htkivz2	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htkelz4	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkivz2/

gbjvc	I have some mixed feelings here.  My wife and I have gone through two miscarriages. It's horrific. Heartbreaking at any stage‚Äîeven three days in‚Äîso on that point, shame on you for invalidating their grief.  I agree going all in on the "my brother's an angel" bit is a bit much.  But I also think it's perfectly reasonable for the older sibling to react the way she did. When we got pregnant again after two consecutive miscarriages, we had *so much* anxiety that it could happen again. It's natural to worry and have anxiety after tragedy  On the other hand, "influences" who monetize peoples tragedies can fuck all the way off.	1642749137.0	htkjqar	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkjqar/

h8hw483s	Congratulations on all of your accomplishments!! As someone who was raped twice and sexually assaulted I‚Äôm so proud of you! I too went down a similar road. I turned to alcohol. Drank everyday but I never thought I had a problem. I then was introduced to cocaine and pills (molly). At one point every morning I would be doing shrooms, smoking weed, hitting a line, taking a shot just to get out of bed. Sometimes multiple at once. I had a lot of pressure on me from my family to be successful so I had to pretend to function. But I was dead inside. I didn‚Äôt care if I lived or died.   I quit drugs 2 years ago, alcohol 9 months ago, and caffeine (I was addicted to energy drinks to cope with quitting blow) I‚Äôm so proud of myself! I‚Äôve never felt so good in my life!

2jb3sl6k	Having a child is hard. When you start to think of rubbing a little back until they fall asleep, imagine that child crying and feverish and doesn‚Äôt fall asleep until 20 minutes before you have to go work for 4 days in a row. Imagine having a child with special needs who never finds comfort in your touch. Imagine that child cursing you as an adult when you are a good mother and making you feel guilty for every time you thought about yourself. Take into consideration colic, ear infections, tantrums, the guilt, ER visits, parenting a teenager who knows everything, bathing them, dressing them, regular life trauma, social pressures, and someone with no reason for doing what they do the first 25 years you know them. Let alone the other judgey parents and carting them to sports and activities week after week after week.  I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs not joy in it, but there is not a whole lot of fun. The drudgery is so much. They are only little for so long, the every-minute-neediness fades eventually (with most children anyway), but then way more complex problems come about.   I have children and I don‚Äôt regret it, but I have a spouse, a home, support, and live in a relatively good school district - and it is STILL VERY HARD.	1642749642.0	htkkg9m	t3_s94dlp	t3_s94dlp	/r/offmychest/comments/s94dlp/god_help_me_i_want_a_baby/htkkg9m/

92zewmla	I totally agree from the points you‚Äôve given. I agree with another poster saying it‚Äôs massively to do with SM influencer. I‚Äôm definitely a person who wants people not feel like a miscarriage is shameful, if they want to talk about it then they really should because there are many women who‚Äôve been through it and are suffering in silence. But this what you‚Äôve mentioned is the wrong kind of influence. You want people to open up and deal with the trauma, not exploit it. If you want to keep it yourself that‚Äôs absolutely okay, if you want to open up and spread genuine awareness about miscarriages for support that‚Äôs excellent. But doing things like this for social media grosses me out. There‚Äôs a difference between what you‚Äôve mentioned and say someone going on to make a personal video sharing their experience in a meaningful way to offer support to other people going through the same thing.   I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve seen Firefly Lane? Katherine Heigls character hijacks her own show to discuss something taboo, miscarriages. And it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt like I could relate to someone over this. I gave me support and closure all in one. It was beautiful so there‚Äôs definitely ways to go about talking about this. Exploiting it and causing further trauma to people who were not even affected by it (the children) is just selfish. But like your last paragraph says, it‚Äôs hard to comment on such a thing without feeling like you‚Äôre policing people, especially with grief.	1642750639.0	htkluqw	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkluqw/

hq4byhb6	He's probably had a narcissistic ex who love bombed him before. He might be wondering if you fall into the same category. I've been with my partner for almost 4 years. We've never said I'll. We say "I like you" because you can love someone and not like them at all. I know it was hard for me not to say it in the beginning too. It feels like pressure to people who have had narcissistic partners in the past. Do you feel comfortable asking him how he's feeling about it? Or explaining that you're okay with him not saying it back?	1642751400.0	htkmwpv	t3_s952l6	t3_s952l6	/r/offmychest/comments/s952l6/embarrassed_and_ashamed_after_telling_bf_i_love/htkmwpv/

o2lzto	Wow... I wasn't sure what to expect when I clicked this post but it sure wasn't the miscarriage themed nursery for starters.   I also suffered a miscarriage and luckily had my rainbow baby after.. and while it's been a little easier to cope, it's not something that I'll ever forget.  But because I don't have too much of my first.. I made a memory box with a few little bits and dabs in it so there is SOMETHING to show that this child DID exist and that even for their very short life, they meant something to me and that they were loved.    But that's for us, to remember and to heal. If my child or anyone else wants to find out what's in the box later, sure we can look into it. I don't think miscarriage belongs in the shadows or out of civilised conversations but you also have to respect how personal and emotionally charged it can be..  It's not something to decorate a nursery in or shove in people's faces because you never really know what others are dealing with.	1642751678.0	htknakb	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htknakb/

I know mental health is hard(I struggle with it myself), but putting the weight of ones own problems on another person is not going to do anything to help. At this rate your friend needs to be talking to a therapist about the things that are bothering or they will get worse. I would honestly tell her it‚Äôs in her best interest to get professional help.

Randy Rhodes is one of the best guitarists I‚Äôve ever seen‚Ä¶ but back when he first started playing, do you think he was a ‚Äúguitar god‚Äù? No, he sucked just like the rest of us lol. But he was passionate about it, studied, practiced, took risks, and became the guy who made Crazy Train what it is, though I‚Äôm not knocking Ozzy in any way but Randy Rhodes playing is what really pushed that song over the top.

350luwr1	I‚Äôm a mother to a 3-month old, and her big brother was stillborn a year before she arrived. I‚Äôm not very active on social media, but have found the babylost community online really valuable in many ways‚Ä¶and infuriating in others. On the one hand, the kind of grief marketing that you describe can be so weird and unhealthy and desperate. On the other, I understand why mothers want to talk about what they‚Äôve lost, because they‚Äôre invisible otherwise. It‚Äôs tricky.   I lost my son at the beginning of the third trimester. I gave birth to him. It was, quite simply, the worst. And although pain and suffering and trauma aren‚Äôt a competition, I do believe that going through a stillbirth is very different and far more traumatic than a miscarriage. So, it can be even more alienating for loss mothers trying to learn how to survive  their reality when they‚Äôre hit with all of the grief porn around chemical pregnancies and early miscarriages.   Grief is complicated, and so is healing, and thank goodness for therapy. My daughter will know that she had a big brother, and although we will always mourn him, we celebrate her. Her life is hers; she is not a replacement.	1642753504.0	htkprd6	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkprd6/

2bb0h7w7	There is no scale for grief. Grief is grief and people experience it and cope with it in different ways. To be clear, the things OP described are upsetting and not healthy. A close friend lost a full term baby a few days before his due date. She never emotionally recovered from that and has PTSD. And she did know him, she carried him for 9 months and emotionally bonded with him.  I‚Äôd just hate for someone to read your comment and feel like their pain isn‚Äôt valid.

4ekglbdu	I really don't think it's a good idea that you should marry someone because you feel obligated to. It's a recipe for disaster and often ends in divorce, or murder (usually in abusive relationships because divorce is way more costly than breaking up. ) It may seem shitty now to break up, but you'll feel way more free months after, than you do now, being with someone who is putting you down. It's a mechanism of control. He's putting you down now, he'll be isolating you later. He'll have you wrapped around your finger and when he's done with you, he'll dump you. You'll be devastated, he won't.	1642755101.0	htkrutf	t3_s960xn	t3_s960xn	/r/offmychest/comments/s960xn/there_is_nothing_i_want_more_desperately_than_to/htkrutf/

67oxlzai	I said "shovel my face with meat" for the comedic effect, I still don't eat a lot of meat (except in comparison to my previous diet). But I'm disillusioned about individual choices. It was far from a new idea when I started, and it's even less ten years later, yet so many people around me have a hard time cooking even a single meal without meat. I'm waiting for some tax raise on meat, or some other governmental measure (hopefully something smarter than just not letting the poor have meat), it's the only way we can achieve anything.  Most people know and agree it's fucked up to eat meat at every meal, but most of the time they just go "But I'm addicted to bacon" like a brain dead idiot, sleep walking into the apocalypse.	1642755332.0	htks5qd	t3_s8j10m	t1_hti8ezg	/r/offmychest/comments/s8j10m/ten_years_a_vegetarian_not_anymore/htks5qd/

glpwg	Unrelated to miscarriages, but a few years ago my dad died. Being hours from family, having rocky relationships with most of them, all my friends having finally left town, I didn't have anyone to really talk to. So I went to social media and posted it to Facebook. Hours later felt disturbed by it like I was somehow harvesting his death for likes and comments and hid the post. I have dumped most social media since then because once I recognized it (and it wasn't even deliberate, but I needed that social feedback to bounce my emotions off of and social media was a very unhealthy way to do it) I saw it everywhere.	1642755822.0	htkssmu	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjv6b1	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkssmu/

Why do people seek approval or feel the need to show the rest of the world (strangers) such things...because there is no contentment from within. You don't hate this world... the world didn't do anything to you. It's society that is wrong. You are feeling this way because you are grounded, you see through this mirage of modern day society.   I remember a lovely quote   What do you like best in life... the pursuit of happiness or expressing happiness. We are always seeking for happiness/validation from others however we miss the important thing which is to actually enjoy our own happiness, live in the moment. Happiness from within is the only true happiness. Take a look outside your window, look at the trees, the birds all the beautiful creations enjoy real life. Be true to yourself, try not to live your life to make others happy. You are the most important... remember that	1642756755.0	htktznt	t3_s8w7pl	t1_htjfjw8	/r/offmychest/comments/s8w7pl/after_trying_my_god_damn_hardest_to_be_the_best/htktznt/

Honestly though, I feel the same way about French. Here, having French as a second language gives you so many extra opportunities, but I lost interest in learning French after my reading skill in it dwindled to nothing.

Regarding your family, I don‚Äôt know if you hate them or not, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. You are at an age where you will define the rest of your life. My advice: focus on school. Get into college. Get a job. If you don‚Äôt focus now, you‚Äôll be perpetually hating yourself. Another thing: make a diary. Anytime you wanna get something off your chest, just write whatever comes to your mind. If privacy is an issue, then just burn the page. It‚Äôs really helped me. Sorry if this went on a tangent.

3vyjj4f8	Well, crying and complaining won't get you laid in 100 years. Not because you are a lost cause (how would I know? I don't have a clue who you are) but simply because crying and complaining are not very attractive.   Watching porn won't get you any closer to a woman either.   I get that you are not eager to handle more rejection but ultimately it will be the only way to get your desire.   I know looking conventinally good helps in this world but tastes are different. I like my man on the chubby side. Others are into skinny dudes. Some want a man to be tall, others don't give a fuck.  Still, finding the few out there that have a taste that you cater to will only happen out there. So rejection is inevitable. But you shouldn't take it to heart. As I said. Tastes are different.  But that aside, maybe you should rather try to develop healthy personal relationships. Find some friends that just happend to be women. Not to complain about it as if friendship was the worst thing one could find in this world, but to just get comfortable around women.   Also it can be quite beneficial. Woman friends tend to critique your looks constructively if asked for it. They can help you to look a little bit more inviting. If you can make them care enough they will try to set you up with friends. Also many men that I ended up being together with were my friends first.	1642757059.0	htkudol	t3_s96gke	t3_s96gke	/r/offmychest/comments/s96gke/i_want_to_die_because_i_cant_get_laid/htkudol/

ipk2e437	I can see both sides. Of course being physically attractive can give you a leg up when it comes to first impressions and with people who only value physical beauty. But the more time you spend with most people the less they tend to judge based on your physicality and the more they judge based on the kind of person you are.   My personal experience was that as an overweight person I had some great friends, good friends, and a large variety of people who didn‚Äôt notice my existence or weren‚Äôt interested in being around me. Once I lost a significant amount of weight many of the people who previously hadn‚Äôt noticed me at all wanted to be in my life and some of my good friends treated me differently but those closest to me treated me exactly the same.    My takeaway was yes, that people in general definitely reacted to me differently when I became more conventionally attractive, but only on a very shallow level, and only those I wasn‚Äôt really interested in having in my life anyway. Save your attention and love for those who love who you are and not what you look like and don‚Äôt waste time on the rest.	1642757501.0	htkuxic	t3_s8n86p	t3_s8n86p	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htkuxic/

6166xvxt	Yeah this sounds to me like you have serious depression. And when I say sounds, I mean you definitely do. So first thing‚Äôs first, seek professional help. Now, I am a current high school senior so trust me, I understand the junior year struggle. If you want to get out of this slump, there‚Äôs no way other than working crazy hard for it. If that puts you off, why? For me, I always have trouble starting things i.e. I procrastinate and hate myself which then makes me procrastinate more and you get the idea. You need to be honest with yourself about why you‚Äôre not caring about school. As far as college is concerned, don‚Äôt think you blew your shot. Even if you failed classes, you have ways to get in. You could take a gap year (tho I don‚Äôt recommend) or you could just retake those years of schooling. Yes, it‚Äôll suck. Yes, you will graduate two years late. But you will be back on track. And trust me, you‚Äôre gonna need to be prepared for writing college apps (they‚Äôre HORRENDOUS) so focus on getting yourself back together. Lastly, tell your mom you love her and that she‚Äôs not a failure. Idk what your relationship with her is like, but hearing you say it will really make her happy. If you want to talk anymore (life, college, or anything else in general), please message me or something. Remember, people care for you, strangers and otherwise	1642758243.0	htkvuj1	t3_s96fd4	t3_s96fd4	/r/offmychest/comments/s96fd4/useless/htkvuj1/

v0w5zi7	Does not seems curious to you, the way we use the word shallow to criticize people and their own standards?  How can you measure another person's desires with a standard? Rich people sometimes want simple-minded, mundane people. Humble ones maybe want beauty and riches.  It's like mortals calling the gods of Olympus shallow, just because they're godly.  I always express my own standards and that makes people call me shallow. It's okay, people can't understand why I want the things I want or why I likes the things I want. I always reply something in the lines of:  "What you like is of no interest to me, why should I bother with what you think of my interests? Do you think that calling me shallow puts you in a culturally higher level than me or something? You are spiritually worthless and hollow, and by criticizing my standards you're proving my point. After all, what are you going to do? Pick a partner for me with your superior tastes? pftt."  Or something like that.  It is as simple as that. Either you agree with me or learn to tolerate my opinion. Regardless of what you think, you don't even know which person are you gonna end up with. Having high standards and realistic ones are two different things. It doesn't hurt to dream, but don't mess with them.  What hollow heart do they carry... truly a shame.	1642758556.0	htkw8ka	t3_s96zxx	t3_s96zxx	/r/offmychest/comments/s96zxx/when_attractive_people_have_high_standards_they/htkw8ka/

One day she casually mentioned she and her husband couldn‚Äôt have children because they tried for half a year and had not conceived yet. But then, surprise surprise (not) she could and got pregnant and was happy and tbf I was happy for her. But had a miscarriage which was really sad. Then she posted a story about how sad she was and that she‚Äôd never meet this kid etc, I really felt for her till the last line: ‚Äúyeah well now I guess I can forget being a mother soon‚Äù Dude wth. So it‚Äôs not about this kid it‚Äôs about you. Don‚Äôt know why I was surprised tbh.  I‚Äôve been told that most of the times when people have a miscarriage they‚Äôll get pregnant very soon after because it means that you can conceive and everything is fine only this particular kid wasn‚Äôt healthy (don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true ofcourse and exceptions make the rule) And indeed in no time she got pregnant and kid was born healthy.

4lbxapbb	On AITA their was a mother that lost her eldest daughter when she was about six or so, two decades ago. For every one of her living children's events (graduations, birthday parties etc.) she'd set up a tribute table and make them remember. Make note that the daughter was about six when she died, her siblings were toddlers; they don't remember her. Finally, her daughter was having a wedding, and like usual, the mom started planning for a tribute table, a notecard on an empty seat to 'imitate' her and a tribute speech. Daughter goes off that for once she wants her event to be not be about her dead sister she can't even remember. In the comments the mother said that if her living children don't want to honor her dead daughter's memory she doesn't want them in her life.	1642758750.0	htkwhbb	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htk6khn	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkwhbb/

50x52o3m	Sexuality and loneliness can bring on very strong feelings. The desire to reproduce is what keeps species surviving. I haven‚Äôt been in the same situation myself and I don‚Äôt want to minimize your feelings. It seems difficult for you.  I think you have to gain some perspective to go through these feelings. It is your monkey-brain screaming at you. But to end ones life because of this would be a total waste. Try to tend to your hobbies and stop masturbating for a while. Have you ever considered psychedelics? They will grant you perspective on your life and remind you of the beauty of the universe. It could be a difficult experience also though so be careful.   Professional help is also something you deserve but I know it can be difficult to get.   Why are you so sure you can‚Äôt get laid? Believe it or not but there are others out there who feel similar. It‚Äôs just a matter of meeting the right person at the right time. Covid doesn‚Äôt really help with dating and to be honest I don‚Äôt think you are in a good place emotionally to be dating.   You need not give up however. I think the best place to start is meeting people who have similar interests or philosophical ideas. Work on yourself and your interests. Become a person you would want to have sex with.   You could also go to a prostitute depending on the legality situation where you live, I guess. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it morally. It could be a positive emotional investment for some, as long as both are treated with respect. I believe the lack of respect for prostitutes and their vulnerable position is what makes it questionable. Make sure to use a condom.   I know I gave you two illegal advices here. Take what you will. Tending to hobbies, professions help and laying off masturbation is also good. Throw in some meditation as well.	1642759398.0	htkx9sc	t3_s96gke	t3_s96gke	/r/offmychest/comments/s96gke/i_want_to_die_because_i_cant_get_laid/htkx9sc/

Deep down at the core of your being you truly believe your taste buds have more value than another being. That mentality is disgusting. But your right the government does ignore the problem so we all have the choice to eat dead flesh or not. "This brought me to the conclusion that the only logical path of action is to shovel down my face as much beef brisket and pulled pork and other delicacies as I can until the end of me" couldnt help but giggle a little. If you want to try and pass as logical call it what it is.

6166xvxt	Write in a diary. Anytime you have to get something off your chest, whip it out and write. If privacy is an issue, burn the pages. I‚Äôve been doing this for a while and it‚Äôs helped me a lot. I actually understand specifically how you feel, and the best way I got over it was just understanding myself. Whenever I was in a group of my friends, I felt more lonely than when I was alone and I realized it was because I thought I didn‚Äôt matter to them. Fast forward to when I get Covid and lo and behold, they start asking me how I am and check in on me. I‚Äôm not saying wait for a blatant sign. I‚Äôm saying have faith in yourself and your loved ones. But most importantly, focus on yourself. Exercise (5 push-ups a day is fine. Baby steps üòä). Go on a walk and get some fresh air. Draw. Write. Anything. Figure yourself out by exploring and thinking. Ik this advice lowkey-actually it highkey sucks (sorry), but I believe in you.

eqpqtrmb	This post is kind of proof for me that while we all know the platitudes, it's very difficult to really understand the concept that people grieve in their own way, about different things, for different reasons.   There is so many comparisons going on in the comments, as if the idea that this isn't a hierarchical experience is completely lost on people.   Pain is relative to the interior and exterior experiences of the individual and history, a early-term miscarriage to one might be more impactful to one than a still born to someone else.    Are the things OP described bizarre? Yes. But they're also creating the idea that there is a type of human who doesn't deserve our empathy, who we can judge with impunity, instead of engaging compassionately, even if we don't understand.   The interrelationships between these women's activities on social media and how they chose to cope with their loss might be greed or attention, but it might also not be. We really don't know.   We can't expect mental anguish to always act and look tasteful. Sometimes it's uncomfortable, bizarre, incomprehensible.   I do feel absolutely devastated for the kids described in some of the scenarios, but I still balk at the idea of making these mothers the spectacle of a judgemental circlejerk.    Do I think these women need to be taken aside and cared for? Totally.	1642759625.0	htkxjvb	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkxjvb/

6hoa2t0j	I've been through severe sleep apnoea. Get a sleep study done and then CPAP, BiPAP or an ASV machine if needed.  I'd try other things first, as I couldn't help but sleep at my worst, so insomnia wasn't a thing.   Try getting unadulterated sunlight in your eyes (don't hurt them) at dawn and dusk for a few minutes everyday. If you combine this with exercise it'll be better. Be outside as much as possible during daylight and dim lights at night. Try not to check the time if you wake and if you need to get up, point the light on your phone toward the floor to avoid direct light.   Don't stimulate yourself with things if you can't sleep, rather picture yourself walking in a nice environment.  If it's OSA - losing weight or getting surgery will help,  if it's CSA - seeking therapy and doing meditation will help.	1642759734.0	htkxon3	t3_s971bm	t3_s971bm	/r/offmychest/comments/s971bm/my_chronic_sleep_issues_are_making_it_so_hard_to/htkxon3/

c64qwx5m	I know you mean well but saying that to someone struggling with infertility is really hurtful for a myriad of reasons. There are a ton of articles and stuff about how to speak about infertility, and this is almost always the number one no-no. It feels to you (I assume) that you're making a reasonable suggestion but it's   a)super duper hard to adopt depending on location, it can take thousands and thousands of dollars and years of waiting  b)infuriating because people who are experiencing infertility have already gone through all options so it's pretty condescending to suggest that like it just hadn't occured to them  also;  c)wanting to have a biological child is very natural and shaming someone for choosing that route over adopting is just cruel. When a friend announces a pregnancy, do you ask them why they didn't choose to adopt instead, or are you just happy for them?  d)adoption isn't a replacement for having a baby. Adoption has a long list of emotional and mental challenges that most people probably couldn't handle- hence the lengthy and expensive process. While it does make you a parent and I absolutely believe you can love an adopted child as much as a biological child, they are you completely different processes  I'm sorry for the lengthy reply but this kind of hurtful comment is a big issue in the infertility community and seeing it in this forum when I came for support and essentially got condescended to is just to frustrating. Thank you if you took the time to read all that and bonus points if you actually now take the time to educate yourself on why it was an inappropriate thing to say.	1642760374.0	htkygkh	t3_s920b7	t1_htkkmdg	/r/offmychest/comments/s920b7/secondary_infertility_sucks/htkygkh/

v0w5zi7	Born of hate is a foul child.  Its fits of rage engulfed the sun again.  As time passes it erodes the mind.  Yet I keep calling its name in vain.  To quell one's wrath one must first understand its source. As long as its cause is found one can take measures to control it.  "I hate everything, and I love everything." It may be contradictory, but even the most uncontrollable rage must stop someday.   Human wrath can be quite tiring, don't you think? Even a mental fit of anger can tire a normal person withing minutes. Every form of pain and revenge is displayed like a bizarre movie. Without noticing you're already moving your body towards your selected target, be it tangible or not.   I could foolishly try to quench your thirst for anger, but that's a mouth I cannot feed.  The Void may echo your screams and share your curses, but everything will come back eventually. Rage's bane is reason. As humans, we can fight wrath with reason, at least within ourselves... as long as it has a reasonable origin.  If your rage doesn't have a reason, then I fear you are now far from human. Still, seeing you wanting to start a family makes me a little uneasy.  As one with a soul filled with unreasonable rage and unreasonable love I can assure you... You can do it.  Pierce your own heart while the demon is asleep, and find the peace you want amidst the chaos in your mind.  You can direct your anger at me, at these words, I'll devour them and fill you with love instead. Until you're void, I'll offer these words as a sacrifice. Take them. They aren't mine anymore.	1642760728.0	htkywex	t3_s971gz	t3_s971gz	/r/offmychest/comments/s971gz/i_hate_everything/htkywex/

8bieifnf	We learned in embryology (I don‚Äôt remember what animal this went for but I believe it‚Äôs for most mammals) that the rate of miscarriage in the first few weeks is about 60%. That‚Äôs a lot. It‚Äôs literally more common to have a miscarriage then to have, let‚Äôs say, two kids right after eachother. Its because a lot of times there‚Äôs something wrong with the clump of cells, or it doesn‚Äôt implant in the womb correctly, etc. Imo it should be normalized to talk about this without automatically expecting the person who miscarriages to be in intense grief and letting them choose for themselves how they handle it.	1642761361.0	htkzozi	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjtafn	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htkzozi/

9gp8e	I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any right or wrong way to grieve. I had two miscarriages before my children were born. They were early on, so my husband wasn‚Äôt attached, but I was heartbroken. My husband had a child stillborn before he was with me, so he only grieves the loss of that child. He goes to church on the day they lost him, and grieves for the entire month every year (his son would have been 25 this year). But he never acknowledged the losses we had, which I understand. I have moved on from the miscarriages I have, but sometimes I think about them. I think it was worse for me because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to grieve. My mother was happy I had miscarried, she said it was ‚Äòa blessing‚Äô. So sometimes I still grieve a bit, but I think it‚Äôs a little more anger for me now at this point.	1642761625.0	htl00uq	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htkdewo	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htl00uq/

You all got it, they all got mild symptoms, but the one person who did everything "right" feels the absolute worst. Feel wronged. Feel VERY wronged for being led to believe that you were helping yourself by insulating yourself.

Assuming your boyfriend is around the same age as you, then a large portion of the reason he's with you is definitely sexual gratification. That's not because you're lacking, that's because dudes are like that, no matter how nice they are.  3. See your gyno. Some research is never going to tell you the truth when it comes to health, only years and years of medical school and practice.  You're extremely harsh on yourself and I feel like you are zooming in on the negatives in your life and occluding anything positive, but that's the opinion of an internet stranger.

67oxlzai	That sentence was tongue in cheek, it's obviously not a logical conclusion. I get what you're saying but that kind of guilt tripping is not helping.  Vegetarian and vegan are hated for acting like they're morally superior (which they probably are, but no one likes condescension). Most people are already sorta agreeing with what you said, they just don't see the alternative as viable. If you point to the positive side of being a vegetarian instead of the negatives of eating meat, you'll get a much more positive feedback. My go to move was cooking something like veggie burritos for friends or colleagues while not talking about the fact they're veggie burritos, and then inevitably someone realises and asks "You're vegetarian, right? There's zero meat in this?", which makes everyone realise that being vegetarian does not mean eating kale for every meal. I've actually seen people change their diets because of that.  I agree with you that the way we consume meat really removes the reality of the way meat is produced, it certainly doesn't help, but acting like a high and mighty religious zealot is not gonna help people realise that.  I personally don't believe eating meat is morally reprehensible in itself, nothing is sacred, but aligning thousands of pigs in a warehouse then slaughter them so some fat slobs can have a food coma at the local all you-can-eat ribs restaurant certainly is.

a5c3adu1	I'm sorry this happened to you. I was fully vaccinated, about to have my booster when I got covid the second time. With a friend and her family, whose son was too young to be vaccinated, although I didn't know he would be there. Everyone had negative lateral flows beforehand. I had been nothing be careful, but I took my mask off for few minutes because I was having difficulty breathing with it on, having breathed in some dry ice and being asthmatic. His lateral flow the next day was positive. Mine, three days later, after having thankfully isolated despite being pressured to go to work.   That was four months ago. I still can't walk more than a few metres without being out of breath or having to stop and rest. And it sucks. It would be easy to be angry at myself, or my friend, or the government for not having vaccinated the teens early enough. But if I let my mental health suffer as well as my physical health, I will have to spend a long time pulling myself out of that too. I hope that in time you can let go of this anger for your own sake. We cannot escape the uneducated, the antivax crowd, the conspiracy theorists, anymore than you can escape this crappy virus. All we can do is put one foot in front of the other and live the best life we are able to at the time. I hope your recovery is speedy.

17ajs5	Tbh I tldr but I believe it is nonetheles worth noting that the reason this is so tiring is that somebody saying yo I had a miscarriage or I was raped wears on your empathy, and that is exactly because these things are so tragic. People who make it their personality traits are actually preying on your empathy, as harsh as it sounds. It is of course not to say that they do not deserve compassion, because they do, but I myself, being naturally a very empathetic human being, become very tired almost instantaneously when I meet people like that. Remember that you are NOT obligated to force ANY feeling upon yourself regarding anyone you meet. If the first thing you feel when encountered by such a person is "man get lost" - don't deny that feeling.

But profiting of them gives other people conflicting feelings about the matter like me and you.   Profiting off of your trauma? What a weird little question yet you see influencers do that daily. We can't really do something about that as they aren't hurting anyone (or as long as they don't hurt anyone). It doesn't feel right though but then again we aren't that person either, there's nothing inherently wrong with the case except morality and ethics.	1642765608.0	htl5efe	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htl5efe/

s6w96qu	THIS.  My first born (finally after a 2nd successful IVF) was diagnosed with a rare fatal tumour at my 20 week scan. It was unfortunate luck and we had no choice but be induced and deliver. To be in labour and delivery for 3 days, listening to babies being born left right and center, while I was waiting to deliver a dead baby, was fucking traumatic and horrible.  When you leave a hospital after that kind of experience and your empty handed, it‚Äôs the worst kind of lonely. Then your milk comes in and you get a call from the crematorium to pick up your dead baby‚Äôs ashes. I‚Äôm not trying to be dramatic either, that‚Äôs literally what happens. After that, you‚Äôre on your own to pick up the pieces.	1642765966.0	htl5xsr	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjsgv2	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htl5xsr/
3oot1wyd	You‚Äôre young and (minus mass) healthy. Those are in your favor. It‚Äôs difficult to navigate and you need to take some deep calming breaths and bask in the love of that baby. As you said, the doctor that saw you doesn‚Äôt know because it‚Äôs not his specialty. As you said, it could be an abscess or benign or cancer. You don‚Äôt know and won‚Äôt for a while. It‚Äôs very easy to focus on the negative thoughts, but when you do, you‚Äôre feeding the stress and it affects you, the baby & your husband. Choose the fact that no one knows what it is, so don‚Äôt start worrying about something that may not warrant such stress. You are still the same person you were before that X-ray and you need to live your life like that until you know different. So bask in the love of that sweet baby and just know you‚Äôre going to get through all this one day at a time. My husband had an ultrasound on his thyroid and they discovered lumps. The doctor, a general MD told him it was cancer.  This sent him into a deep dive of panic and stress. When we got the appointment from the surgeon he told us it is not cancer and that they have to biopsy it, but generally just remove half or the whole thing once they get in there. Until the thyroid hits the pathology lab, no one knows what the result is. Turns out just some non-cancerous nodules. They removed one half of the thyroid and in an instant, relief. My point in saying that is the MD doctor who had no experience with thyroids/cancer told him something that he should not have done because he didn‚Äôt know. Not saying your case is like this, but you have inexperienced doctors who are used to looking at spines, not possible cancer, so please, some deep calming breaths and surround yourself with love. You‚Äôll get through this no matter the result because until you actually know anything different, it‚Äôs the truth.	1642766078.0	htl63pj	t3_s98phx	t3_s98phx	/r/offmychest/comments/s98phx/theres_a_lump_in_my_throat_because_of_the_lump/htl63pj/

Japan is a great place but its not some idyllic Shangri-La.     If you get a chance travel, I think you will be shocked to find things are not what you expect.

cudmrk4o	You are very brave and I want you to know that. Today's society may be better then years ago, but people will always be dumb fucks and until people get their heads straight, the community suffers, you suffer.  I don't think going back in the closet will help at this point. You are probably happier now that people know and it seems like friends and family support you, which is awesome! A few bad apples are always going to come along and try to fuck with you. All you would be doing is making yourself unhappy by again lying to everyone. Plus, everyone already know you are Trans, and just because you take it back doesn't mean the harassment will stop. If anything you'll be labeled as the boy who cried wolf.  The school system needs to change and tbh, maybe try to reach out to the news about what happened, or take it to the top. Never stop fighting, you deserve to live a normal life.

cxvrt4s0	There was literally a woman on TikTok doing dances with her dead baby. And the number of people defending her in the comments sickened me. It seems almost sociopathic to me, and there‚Äôs something so disrespectful about being more concerned with one‚Äôs social media presence than grieving.   People try to defend this stuff by saying ‚Äòwell everyone grieves differently‚Äô but dancing around with a dead baby isn‚Äôt grieving, it‚Äôs clout chasing and it‚Äôs nauseating. People will do anything for views including exploiting their dead child.   I found the whole thing to be so disturbing and disconnected. And this wasn‚Äôt a psychotic break, it was just narcissistic and attention seeking behavior being done in the presence of other children.  People like to hide beneath the veneer and guise of ‚Äòdoing what I can to grieve and cope, don‚Äôt judge me for my healing process‚Äô but this isn‚Äôt really an effort at healing, is it? It‚Äôs not saying ‚Äòrest in peace, baby‚Äô it‚Äôs saying ‚Äòeveryone look at ME‚Äô  The fact people were actually willing to defend her made me utterly sick. Stay off social media, mourn privately with your family, and show some damn respect to the body of your deceased baby by giving her a proper burial instead of taking her out of a freezer every few days to film a tiktok.   Feels illegal to me, but I guess that‚Äôs what ‚Äògrieving‚Äô looks like in the day of social media where no one can keep anything to themselves and exploitation gets you famous.	1642767511.0	htl8bct	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htl8bct/

I will say though a dance school near me has been selling shirts in the RUN|DMC style but they say DNC|MOM. While I know it‚Äôs Dance mom now the first time I saw it on someone she was a True Trumper and I knew it wasn‚Äôt a Democratic National Convention shirt and took me far too long to figure it out, my husband had to ask me what it meant because he just kept thinking Dilation and Curettage too and when I told him they were Dance Mom shirts he was not impressed. I hate that fucking shirt but I will never say a word because it‚Äôs my problem not hers.	1642767822.0	htl8tjn	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htl8tjn/

33n17qqt	False equivalency. That's not a scale for grief, that's a job honoring benefits which they're legally required to do. There are many places that offer bereavement leave as well for miscarriage and other loss. That's beside the point. Grief and trauma are still not a competition. How one person feels or experiences something is personal and can't be quantified. The fact that anyone thinks they should be able to scale someone else's pain is really weird, and again, inappropriate.	1642767983.0	htl92vc	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htl8fyy	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htl92vc/

12l1nj	I had a miscarriage after my youngest was born and I honestly couldn't tell you what the date was.  It was in the fall, September I think, but that's about it.  I was only 6 weeks pregnant and only knew I was pregnant for about 10 days.  So while it was sad and depressing right when it happened, it didn't alter my life in anyway.  So no, I don't think it's horrible at all.  I work with a woman who had 2 kids, had a miscarriage about 4 days after finding out she was pregnant and then had 2 more kids.  She's got a tattoo of baby feet with the miscarriage date and every single year she posts on that date about the death of her baby.  It seems really over the top to me.  She's a massive attention seeker though so that probably has a lot to do with it.	1642769871.0	htlccrg	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjseg3	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlccrg/

u5rcx6m	Soo English is the lingua franca at the moment, like a standardized currency of language worldwide. It happened sort of by chance (not exactly) but England happened to be really powerful for a moment and decided to colonize way too many places, and I guess other parts of the world followed suit with English being a common language currency.   BUT.... this can and probably will change at some point in history. It really depends on which country becomes most powerful and "important". Like say China becomes the most economically powerful country in the world at some point, we might all be scrambling to learn Chinese in order to better our opportunities in the world and that could become a new status symbol rather than the English-speaking.  Sorry for the super unsolicited info, you probably know all of that. But I said it to express to you that speaking better or worse English isn't truly a mark of education, high class, intelligence, or anything of the kind. If those people you mentioned speak English at a native level its due to opportunities they were given, and had you been given the same, you likely would speak English at the same level.   The way I see it, people, especially wealthy ones will always look for a way to feel superior to others or to have some type of status above others. In this case it's the English-speaking. Imagine how superficial and snobbish of an idea that is, especially considering that they had privileges in their lives not afforded to others.  Anybody can learn English, you can give it an hour a day of your time for a while and become as skilled or close to as proficient in the language as those people.  I have an Ex who's native tongue is Italian who taught himself English on his own completely from scratch when he was like 22 and he is very much fluent. He taught himself Spanish as well at 24 and is completely fluent now, and is currently teaching himself German. He was the worst in his class during his school years and didn't do any university degree but he was dedicated to learning languages and is overall a very talkative shameless person. He learned English informally, by watching movies and media in english, and he learned spanish by moving and living in spain for 3 yrs, and he recently moved to gemrany just to better his German. He speaks a better English than most high-achieving students that he went to high school with now btw.  So I mentioned the example of my ex just to express that most people can learn and that it has very little to do with academic proficiency, intelligence, ect.. maybe passion for languages helps, but if you have a will, you can do it!!  I'm sorry, this is long and disorganized, but remember that when England colonized other places they had a sense of superiority to the locals/natives and imposed the idea that English people/speakers or whatever were smarter, more advanced, less primitive, and that kind of thing. I get that you would just wanna learn English to better your job opportunities, but remember to honor and value your native language as a f\*\*\* you to the colonizer mindset of euro/english superiority even if you live in a country that was never colonized by england hehe.   The English-speaking status symbol isn't real, anyone can learn although it has to be self-motivated and involves some consistent practice and training, and the people who feel superior for speaking english are kinda brainwashed, although I know there are real implications associated with english-speaking in your country like having better job prospects. If it could help you in your life to learn, I believe in you, do it!!   But remember you are absolutely no less than anyone who can speak English.   I grew up in Switzerland from age 0-10 and went to an international school that was bilingual and both my parents speak a diffferent native language and so in our household we spoke english, and I lived in a french-speaking part of switzerland.  Now (in my mid twenties) I speak English as my native language and french where I sound like native person but with many mistakes from lack of practice,  and all of this by no real effort of my own. Just because of the school I went to and where I lived, and my family situation.  I lived in the USA for 12 yrs and most people born and raised there never learn to speak another language because their opportunities are good enough with one language and because language programs in US schools aren't great tbh. But mostly because of a lack of necessity.   We are also kinda dedicated to ruining English in america for whatever reason. I literally mispronounce words when speaking with friends intentionally, for fun, and misspell things ect..   All of this to say, once again, English is not the mark of an educated or intelligent person  and most people in English-speaking countries who aren't descendants of recent immigrants don't speak or speak a few words of another language at best.   And so you and others can't put that kind of weight onto yourselves marking people who haven't learned a second language as any less-than.	1642770283.0	htld3zo	t3_s96o6l	t3_s96o6l	/r/offmychest/comments/s96o6l/i_feel_stupid_because_im_not_good_in_english/htld3zo/

And I‚Äôm sorry if I offend anyone with this but when people take all the needles from their fertility treatments and make a heart out of them either for the miscarried or actual baby?  That‚Äôs weird.  I have endo and found out in my 20s I can‚Äôt naturally have kids (my tubes are blocked) and I went through all the shots to have my eggs retrieved and frozen so they are ready when I‚Äôm ready to have a baby.  I had a complication after the egg retrieval where your body absorbs a bunch of fluid and you essentially need to be on bed rest and I told my boss I was going to be out and she literally responded with the word sorry.

Reading through your message, it sounds like you have a few things going on‚Äî like you‚Äôve had some bad relationships in your life and your self-confidence isn‚Äôt great‚Äîand you‚Äôre associating the rise of feminism with the bad experiences you‚Äôve had. I just wanna say, like not all men are serial killers, not all women are batshit insane or think men should be treated poorly. That‚Äôs just their own individual shitty personality. I‚Äôm a woman and I‚Äôd never tell my guy friends to man up or disparage them in any way. I also compliment my guy friends, try to listen to their feelings, and I‚Äôve brought them flowers before. Most of my female friends are exactly the same and would never act like you‚Äôre describing. If I‚Äôm honest it sounds like your past relationships were not great and you haven‚Äôt fully recovered from the damage they did, and that‚Äôs tinting your worldview right now. If the women around you are talking about how shitty men are in general, and being shitty themselves, those aren‚Äôt great people‚Äîregardless if they‚Äôre feminists or not.	1642771672.0	htlfssv	t3_s98lnd	t3_s98lnd	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htlfssv/

5tatll8	I've had some bad experiences for sure but I understand that grouping all women under that assumption can add to the issue and I'd never do that.  Some of the women in my life are the strongest, most caring and understanding people I know and they really are role models with how to treat others. What I was referring to here is the general acceptance that women can act poorly towards men just because they're women and we're men.  Like I said in the post, I understand the fear a lot of women face and it's such a shame, it'd be so nice if people just treated others better.	1642772085.0	htlgmsq	t3_s98lnd	t1_htlfssv	/r/offmychest/comments/s98lnd/with_the_current_state_of_feminism_i_feel/htlgmsq/

I have a "friend" that posted a photo of her stillborn baby on Facebook and will remember him every year and now that she has a living child she will still bring him up as the older brother.

88zd1	Heartbroken, yes. I was a I was desperately wanting to get pregnant, and losing that hope hurt a lot. But most reasonable people don‚Äôt bond with line, and assign it personhood (and arbitrarily a gender with pronouns) and name it with a relationship to your older child. That is the weird part - bringing your older child into something that all of us know is tenuous at best.   Most of us who have been through it before spend those early days hoping this one is going to stick.

by3cpwo	If Americans want better healthcare, they have to start voting for *local* and *federal* politicians that support healthcare.  Everyone focuses on the president, but if your federal Senator and House Representative do not vote for the funding and the legislation, you will not have good healthcare.  But don't forget to vote for state Senators, House of Representatives, and governor, because they control how the money is spent on the local level.   For example, the federal government passed the Affordable Care Act (Obamcare), but state legislatures and governors refused to accept money from the federal government that would have expanded healthcare and reduced costs.   The state politicians fucked their constituents up!   You have to vote for your local politicians because they get in the way of implementing policies you want. Kentucky, California, New York, etc. got all the benefits of the ACA, but South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, etc. residents got screwed.	1642773158.0	htlixau	t3_s7ty3b	t3_s7ty3b	/r/offmychest/comments/s7ty3b/so_irritated_right_now_about_a_covid_test/htlixau/

33n17qqt	I choose not to engage with unstable people. You want to keep throwing ridiculous scenarios that have nothing to do with the matter at hand. My answer has stayed the same and will stay the same. Grief and trauma are simply that. There is no scale, there is no worse than. It's all pain, especially to the person experiencing it. It is no one's responsibility to look at people in pain and decide which is worse. There is no point to it because it is not a competition and it is frankly bizarre that anyone would even feel compelled to do that.	1642773272.0	htlj6d0	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htlgmyd	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlj6d0/

3929p7jf	I had an old boss like this, anytime she struck up a conversation with a customer she wired it back to how she has a child in the sky and will go on and on about how she survives without him and will never let his name die. The only thing is she has 3 other kids and pregnant with a fourth, and the miscarriage being her first pregnancy 6 years ago. She‚Äôll even show pictures of the miscarried baby and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my Johnny!‚Äù but never show her other children.   The baby was born like 3-4 months prematurely, and I‚Äôm not sure what the cause was but the pictures she shows looks like the baby has no skin, it‚Äôs honestly pretty graphic to just show random people coming in for a sandwich.  Since we worked in a chain sandwich shop, none of us made a ton of money, her being especially stretched because she has three living kids, expecting a fourth, and her fianc√© doesn‚Äôt work so she provides for them all. Always saying how she needs to ask her mom for money and all this stuff, if she could get extra hours etc........ except that she was using her checks to save up to have a reborn doll made of her miscarried child.   She was quoted over $3,000 to have this made, and not trying to sound insensitive at all but the doll would definitely not look like typical reborns given how it looked when it was born. Plus I feel like it would make her other kids feel uncomfortable, but she was dead set on this and seemed to put all her energy into work so she would be able to get one.	1642773325.0	htljakv	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htljakv/

If you drown, it doesn‚Äôt matter how deep the water is, you still drown.  If you lose a child, it doesn‚Äôt matter how old they are, you still lost a child.  And since you ever so kindly ignored my last comment, do you ever consider that it is more than just the miscarriage?  Women, regardless of term, can die from miscarriages.

1o5luxq2	I have no idea what to even think reading this. I can definitely feel the frustration and anger, and anxiety, I don't know how I would deal with that on a daily basis, especially since you're close to her.  I mean if she were a bad mother that would be one thing, but it sounds like she was actually a decent Mom.  I had a friend who lost both his parents by the time he was like 10. First his father, then his mother later. I think they were both drug addicts or something.  He lived with his grandfather, and I used to go there to hang out with him. We played video games all the time and he never liked going outside, he said he didn't like the sun.  He was a really good kid but he was sheltered beyond belief and didn't like interacting with society, at all. Even less than me, and that's saying something.  I guess what I'm getting at is that even though your Mom has wanted to exit the stage for so long it seems that in some way she had enough love in her heart to stick around for you. What I've learned over time is that you can't get more from a person than they want to (or can) give and that's that. And people do things based on their life experiences and you can't change their pasts, so you may as well take what positive memories you can from your time together and take the rest with a grain of salt.  I live on the other side of the country from my immediate family, purposefully, and I appreciate what little contact I have with them and that's all I need. I stopped hoping that one day they would become what I thought they should be, and just accepted them for who they were while setting up boundaries that keep me and my mental health in good shape.  My mother recently asked me to come out for her wedding to her new partner who she's really in love with and I just said No and explained that I thought it wouldn't be good for my mental stability. I just told her the truth, plain and simple.  Not to make this about me, I just mean that people do what they want and your mother is no exception, but she also did her best. Her death, whenever it comes, has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her life experiences and choices. Appreciate the positive things you share and forget about the rest, it's beyond your control.  She still sounds like a loving mother, after all. I'm sorry you have to experience this.	1642773891.0	htlkjg3	t3_s9988i	t3_s9988i	/r/offmychest/comments/s9988i/my_mum_told_me_shes_going_to_die_in_the_next_year/htlkjg3/

God lord have I tried, most I've managed to get out was a single tear.  Not sure what's going on to be honest but I just dont really care, and shit just isn't making me sad anymore.	1642773894.0	htlkjng	t3_s96ivp	t3_s96ivp	/r/offmychest/comments/s96ivp/do_you_ever_cry_about_all_the_sad_things_that/htlkjng/
37ay6hmn	Yea I have a former coworker who lost her child around 8 years old.  Unfortunately her child was born very disabled and went in for a surgery and didn‚Äôt make it.  We work in a school so everyone really gathered around her to support her as best they could.  This was 11 years ago and her bf has never stopped being a memorial to her daughter.  Pictures, updates of what would have been happening (this would have been her first day of hs, this would have been her prom) and at some point you have to process the grief and keep living your life.  I asked my therapist about it once and she said clinically, about 2 years is the standard grieving time for a traumatic loss.  Obviously everyone is different but she said if a loss is still significantly impacting your life after that period of time it goes into diagnosis territory.	1642773945.0	htlknnn	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htjdd02	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlknnn/

tqbas	If he's existence and life still bothers you then you should probably remove all those related as friends of social media so you don't have to see it.   You might also want to look into yourself a bit more and figure out why it still bothers you, you could still hold resentment against him, be jealous subconsciously, hold resentment against yourself. Whatever feelings you haven't dealt with are still there causing you negative emotions and anger towards this person. It hurts literally no one but yourself as he is clearly moving on with his life, dont involve yourself, who cares if she knows or not, who cares if he's still cheating or has changed.  It does not concern you anymore and involving yourself in his life will only bring negative thoughts to yourself, spend that energy on something positive for yourself instead :)	1642774380.0	htllmpm	t3_s97ng6	t3_s97ng6	/r/offmychest/comments/s97ng6/my_cheating_ex_just_got_married/htllmpm/

irndn	Hm, I went through film school and continue to work on sets and run a videography company.  In school, we were given VERY rigid guidelines. Rules to the effect of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt film falling asleep or waking up,‚Äù ‚Äúdo not shoot without a foreground,‚Äù ‚Äúfind images that ask questions,‚Äù ‚Äútrim forever. Less is more. Without it, no chance of titillating.‚Äù  Try upping the standards of the class significantly next term. Usually only 10% of what students bring in is useable‚Äîthe rest they have to reshoot or rethink. Students (usually) rise to the level expected of them. Start with text editing‚Äîfind a poem and ask the students to rearrange the words to create new meaning, for example. If they can‚Äôt hack it, you have every right to fail them, or refuse credit or however the school works.  Have them read ‚ÄúMythologies‚Äù by Barthes. Have them watch the films of Godard, Renoir, Soderbergh. Make this a requirement. Ask the professors to seriously restructure the class around form and substance.

8kclv	My sister had one still birth, 3 late term miscarriages and I believe 5 in the first trimester. If anyone deserves to make miscarriage a part of her personality it's her, but she doesn't. She commemorates what would have been her children's birthdays privately (I always send her a text or call) but apart from her still born daughter, she doesn't make a huge social fuss about it.   Her daughters know about their sister, the baby she carried to term but was born sleeping, but all the others are not an active part of their lives. Maybe later but her second daughter is 4 and her other is 6 months so not quite ready for that miscarriage discussions.   I obviously write and celebrate with her but I'm her sister and we have been best friends our whole lives. Her partner usually buys flowers or something but publicly it's not a big topic.   Obviously it's horrible. Obviously I wouldn't wish any of it on any woman. Obviously one person's pain does not negate another's and obviously everyone handles things differently but using something like a miscarriage to emotionally manipulate people is a pretty weird response to something so personal and traumatic.	1642774730.0	htlmf01	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlmf01/
65sirx6x	I mean I can see your point, but at the same time, there's a LOT more to a game that just what the difficulty is. And yes, in a lot of cases the developers do build around different difficulties. Skyrim is a good example of that, as you won't progress higher in level on the lower difficulties as quickly because of how the EP works. For example, hitting something with a sword earns EX based on how many times you hit, but the amount of EX gained from striking enemies is reduced because the enemies are dying faster.   There's also game mechanics, how the combat system works, if followers AI are set properly, if hit boxes are accurate, smoothness of level transitions, lighting and visual effects, animation, weapons and sometimes magic systems, crafting, everything still experienced on any difficulty that are major components of a game and development. In the end, difficulty only changes the challenge behind what's already presented by scaling down obstacles, mainly in combat. Otherwise, it really doesn't change much	1642774738.0	htlmfps	t3_s9b8sq	t3_s9b8sq	/r/offmychest/comments/s9b8sq/i_dont_trust_opinions_from_people_who_didnt/htlmfps/

8rrwzd07	I have had two losses and they were devastating, but I 100% agree with what you wrote here.   When I was a camp director like 10ish years ago, I had a little girl who constantly talking about her deceased little sister. She wore tee shirts with the sister‚Äôs name‚Ä¶the whole shebang. Turns out the ‚Äúlittle sister‚Äù was a pregnancy her Mom lost at 6 weeks gestation FOUR YEARS PRIOR. I called DCF and the little girl was removed from the home and the Mom was committed to the psych ward for severe depression. They told me the house was a shrine to ‚ÄúIsabella‚Äù when they didn‚Äôt even know if the pregnancy was a girl!  My MIL goes on and on and on about her miscarriage as if she is the only one who has ever had one. She was going on about it at Christmas when finally my SIL said ‚ÄúI mean, they aren‚Äôt THAT big of a deal. I‚Äôve had one and pineapple has had two‚Äù. She looked SHOCKED and acted like we took away what made her special. She then called both of our husbands and told them they are ‚Äústrong‚Äù for enduring such ‚Äúmajor losses‚Äù üôÑ.   Not every bad things needs to be an absolute life ruining tragedy.	1642775930.0	htlp7pi	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlp7pi/

Mothers who act like this do so imo because it's easier to put a nonliving child on a pedestal than a living one and its a perfect source of narcissistic supply.

The majority of us are closed books to the rest of the world.  We are told not to judge a book by its cover but you actually have to.  What you see is what you get is incorrect.

c2mrxy37	I agree that it‚Äôs normal to tell a child that you are pregnant. However, if you only knew that you were pregnant for 72 hours, and your child was so informed and immersed in that process that she is now traumatized by your miscarriage, you failed as a parent.   The duration of the pregnancy has no bearing on your right to a grieving period. The duration of your pregnancy DOES have a bearing on what appropriate emotional boundaries you should draw with your children.   My cousin‚Äôs six year old was so emotionally involved in her mother‚Äôs 72-hour pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage, told so many details about her ‚Äúdead brother,‚Äù that she was filled with fear and anxiety over dead babies during her mother‚Äôs second pregnancy.   There are developmentally appropriate ways to bring your living children in on the experience of adding a new member to the family, and developmentally appropriate ways to explain that mom and dad are grieving changed plans. The examples I give in this post are NOT it. This is failed parenting. There is no justification for it.	1642776825.0	htlrf3n	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htlon9g	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlrf3n/

And every holiday they take family pictures with her toddler holding a picture of his dead sister. His birthday, he takes pictures holding her picture. At weddings, they bring the dead baby‚Äôs picture to take pics with. Her maternity shoot for her now-toddler, the dead baby‚Äôs picture was front and center in a lot of them. She posts every day about losing that baby. It‚Äôs definitely gone into influencer-y territory. But my primary concern is that her toddler will never have his own self identity. Everything about him, every milestone, is overshadowed by his dead baby sister. Nothing is ever just about him.

13w2gn	I definitely think some people just haven't experienced real grief or loss so when something so small and less.... real.... happens to them then they just latch onto it for attention.   I feel this same way about anyone who takes one thing and makes it their personality. Even regular mom's who think they're saints just for being a mom. Like... being a mom doesn't mean you're a GOOD mom or a good person.	1642777847.0	htltz63	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htltz63/

gaxwy	Yes. This and adoptive parents who can't have children and instead of dealing with their infertility trauma they make everything about adoption and how great they are for buying a baby. It especially sucks cause the average birth parent would be able to keep their baby if they had an extra 5,000 and the average private adoption in America costs the birth parents 50,000. Not to mention its proven that adoption causes permanent trauma to the children even if they never knew their birth parents. So essentially most adoptive parents are buying a baby at the expense of the baby's and birth parents mental health.	1642778285.0	htlv3qe	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlv3qe/

3eapkbf1	After reading most ever post I can say this, people are limited, clearly some more than others. I had a best friend for 31 years. She couldn‚Äôt be there for me like I was for her. What I‚Äôve learned is this, You can‚Äôt get blood from a stone. Meaning, you are wanting something from someone who clearly isn‚Äôt capable of giving you what you need and want. Love her for who she is, with her limitations. If she‚Äôs great in all areas except comforting you then turn to someone else for comfort.   One individual cannot be all things to all people. You already know that she lets you down in this area of need so, stop needing it from her. My mother was not a loving person period. People would ask me about my my mom, I would say with a sharp tongue, ‚ÄúIf my mother was in the animal kingdom she‚Äôd be the type of animal who eats her young! I know, startling. But when I stopped trying to get the love from her that I so desperately needed growing up and looked for the kind, loving, caring qualities in others, my needs were met. I no longer tried to get them from my mother who wasn‚Äôt capable of giving them in the first place.   As an adult my baby daughter cried about everything, I mean everything. I had to determine (around age 2 years) weather or not what she was crying about was ‚Äúcry worthy‚Äù. I would get down to her level and ask what was wrong, if it was cry worthy I would pick her up, give her a hug, and give her the comfort she needed. If she came to me crying and it wasn‚Äôt cry worthy, I would say to her, ok sweet heart, I love you, if you need to cry about that, go over on the couch with your blanket and cry. I realized that every little thing was not the end of the world in reality. She needed to know how to self soothe. I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to be there for her to fix everything in her life. One day she was going to go to school, what then? Helping her learn to care for herself was a necessity for her success.   Sometimes we need to look inward for what we need or go to those who we know can give us what we need. Love your your friend for who she is, stop disappointing yourself, go to someone else that you know can give you the comfort you need, you‚Äôll be happier for it!	1642778482.0	htlvlv1	t3_s8gvy2	t3_s8gvy2	/r/offmychest/comments/s8gvy2/does_anyone_have_a_bestfriend_or_someone_close/htlvlv1/

It's difficult because I was used to him we were living together for a short while now it's all of a sudden just stopped. I will be okay.

Constantly remind yourself of this until it sticks - I find reminding myself of my own bias can help me think more clearly. Remember we all practice lying to ourselves everyday - often times without realizing it.  You could see a therapist as well, they can give you strategies and new insights which may help your case.	1642779027.0	htlx1a5	t3_s9brgu	t3_s9brgu	/r/offmychest/comments/s9brgu/i_hate_the_way_i_am/htlx1a5/

You should not see this as an issue with you (I know, easier said...).  The divorce is the right move, but your thinking of the reasoning wrong.  You should be divorcing him because he's a piece of crap that has repeatedly cheated on you, not because he deserves better.

9rr6jc9j	Yes, surprisingly they ARE ugly or not as attractive to the majority of the world's population. That being said, the image of "model" is one based on the interpretation of the chosen few that control the budget and the means to print the magazines. They are pushing an unrealistic unsustainable standard, and most people fall in the trap of thinking that should be their standard too (point in case: you). Countless of articles, both sociological and medical, have been written on the dangers of using models as a measure of beauty. You're right that being attractive is a Plus, but the definition of "attractive" varies from person to person, culture, beliefs, etc.  I've seen what I considered to be hot women with ugly men, and I've seen good looking men with ugly women. Same as seeing some gorgeous women truly believe themselves to be ugly.  It's all very subjective, and as such, the media, movies, models, etc are creating their own subjective version of what beauty is. None of them would walk around looking, wearing, and behaving the same way they do when they are modeling, any more than an actor would behave and dress the same as the character they play.  I do hope you -and everyone else of the same mentality- find some clarity on the subject.	1642779436.0	htly3wm	t3_s8n86p	t1_htio098	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htly3wm/

3zj0do2h	I don't think that's fair to say. Sure maybe you believe that's what everyone thinks- but that doesn't mean it's reality. I personally had a crush on a guy with a cleft palate. He was really funny and seemed to be friends with just about everyone. Sure his face wasnt like the average guy, but you'd hardly notice it after you saw his eyes light up after a funny joke.   He unfortunately died just before graduation (workplace accident), but he was mourned by many. He wasn't the guy with a cleft palate he was Drew. Funny, smart, motivated Drew.   I can also say I worked with a kid who had BAD eczema. I'm taking dried skin ALL over his face and body. And while obviously I didn't find him attractive romantically (he was 3 when he was under my care lmao) he was adorable and his skin didn't hold him back too much from playing with the other kids. He was full of life and had an amazing smile. He was one of the cutest kids I've met. While obviously his skin is a problem objectively, I don't think it'll hold him back too much in life as far as partners go when he's grown. Truly beyond the actual CARE of his skin; I hardly noticed it. He kept up with the other kids, happily played and made friends. There will always be assholes out there but if he continues the way he was when I worked with him he will surely have a good fruitful life.	1642779492.0	htly96h	t3_s8n86p	t1_hthzd0l	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htly96h/

I was saved by emergency brain surgery but have to deal with a Traumatic Brain Injury for the rest of my life. The sheriff's department charged ME with assault. At my trial they outlined that they had planned on killing me but for some reason never got charged. Meanwhile I ended up homeless and CPS gave her full custody of my son who I haven't seen in over 4 years now. It might help for people to understand that my stepson is marrying or has married the sister of a sheriff's deputy.	1642779749.0	htlyx9b	t3_s9d6l5	t3_s9d6l5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9d6l5/the_fucking_american_justice_system_seems_so/htlyx9b/

This has helped train my body to eat less and less and now I‚Äôve lost about 20 pounds in the 2 months and I don‚Äôt eat near as much as I used too and don‚Äôt feel hungry when I don‚Äôt either. Eating 3 meals a day is super important but another thing you can try is drinking a lot of water so your stomach is more full of water and you won‚Äôt be as hungry. Don‚Äôt starve yourself just find something that works for you. If you have time then make a daily exercise routine and stick to it.

I think the climate is also very different in bigger cities vs small towns.  But things will get better as you age. It won't be smooth, it won't be easy, but it will be so gratifying and rewarding for you once you've actually built YOUR life. What I mean by that is that you're going to encounter obstacles in life, but ones that very few people have gone through before you (compared to a "common" issue of having your period for the first time). The less people share in your pain and troubles, the less basic understanding of the situation they have. And what morons don't understand, they fear and belittle.  But I promise, after all this, you will find your friends, your circle, your love and a newfound family of people that you have chosen to surround yourself with and who appreciate you for you.

d70g9	>Especially those who had a miscarriage only after less then a week of knowing their pregnant.  There's a strong theme of "loss is loss" and saying that they're all equal.  But they're *not*, and the idea that they are pisses me off.  I've had 3 miscarriages--one very early on that was probably a chemical pregnancy, one at 8 weeks, & one at 13 weeks.  I also had a daughter who had fatal birth defects (something else we're not supposed to say anymore) that were discovered at her anatomy scan, so I knew for half the pregnancy that she would live only hours.  Seven years later, I am *still* pissed at the friend of my husband's who said "I know what you're going through.  I had two miscarriages."  As though somehow the probably early, unanticipated loss of a baby is equivalent to spending 18 weeks anticipating the death of the baby you desperately want.  And my loss wasn't equivalent to an unanticipated stillbirth where the parents have to go home to lives prepared for someone who suddenly isn't there, or to a parent who lost a baby to SIDS.    I mean, I'm glad we're past the time when parents were expected to forget and move on and not mourn at all, but there needs to be some nuance.	1642779856.0	htlz7ej	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htk9ggd	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htlz7ej/

Repeat that to yourself as many time as you can everyday. If this is the root of your misery I highly suggest talking to them about it. Weight loss is about calories in vs calories out. Measure your daily calorie output, and make a meal plan which puts you in a 500 calorie deficit. Eat low-calorie dense foods, and completely remove calories from condiments and liquids. (Don‚Äôt use cooking oil, buy 0 calorie sodas etc) Feel proud for trying to improve, that is a win.	1642780261.0	htm09av	t3_s9dco5	t3_s9dco5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dco5/i_want_to_starve_myself/htm09av/

361fwcgm	Of course. But after the hot girl with confidence finds someone or is found by someone, then is the turn of the ugly girl with confidence (before the ugly girl without confidence). There are many ugly men too, but they fare usually better because women tend to pick men based on their success/wealth (thanks, evolution). However, there are several men who are also more interested into success/wealth in women than their looks. In addition, many men like to feel better about themselves, so women who appreciate them are valuable too. Regardless of gender, if you are ugly, bitter, unsuccessful (in both life and work), then you are not going to find anyone worthy. You might be unable to change how you look, but you can work harder to improve yourself/your skills and can have a more positive attitude towards life which would make others around you feel better and see your worth (in making life more bearable and liveable).

6k4e9sk6	I'm sorry you're going through this, the death of a friend isn't an easy thing to deal with, but it seems to me that it just added to an already stressful life. I suggest you seek counseling, and let your partner know why you're doing it. If your partner doesn't understand or gets upset, then it's time to move on. A relationship is a two way street, a balance of obligations to carry the weight, both tangible and emotional. Even if you're a stay at home parent, that's an actual job, so no one can take that away from you. Stay strong, meditate, write your feelings on a piece of paper, write the pros and cons and make a decision, but do seek counseling. Good luck.	1642780714.0	htm1gl8	t3_s9dqc5	t3_s9dqc5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dqc5/i_hate_myself_so_much_right_now/htm1gl8/

idwbr	I agree with the previous comments but I wanted to add that when dating, the bad English only applies to other native English speakers‚Ä¶ when they had the opportunity to learn the language correctly but choose to be purposely ignorant. It‚Äôs the choice that is a turn off, not actually someone who is trying to speak a second language and not quite getting it right. I‚Äôd love to help my partner learn something new that builds his confidence. I‚Äôve been learning Spanish for fun and it‚Äôs easy to read but it‚Äôs always harder to speak, practice is everything and will build your confidence. Watch some favorite American movies and try to mimic the lines, that will help your pronunciation. Also songs. Don‚Äôt be scared to try.

c2rgswny	A few things to cover here!   Trust me when I say it is NEVER too late to change your mind. I went to 3 different schools and changed my major 4 times before figuring it out.   Are you living at home? Can you afford to take a semester or year off? If your circumstances allow it, I would highly recommend taking a break to give yourself some time to figure out what direction you want to head in. Look at job postings in fields you think you may be interested in, join groups for new grads in those fields and ask people about their experiences. If you‚Äôre comfortable with it, you can even message people on LinkedIn in those fields in your area to ask if you can pick their brain or even shadow them for a day to see if it would be up your alley.   Also keep in mind that it is 100% okay to change your mind as many times as you want. You‚Äôre young and still learning about yourself, what you like, and what you want. And it‚Äôs very likely that those things will change over time.   It also sounds like you might be dealing with some fairly strong anxiety. If you‚Äôre able, try to see a therapist. Your school may also have resources available for this.   Lastly, here‚Äôs something my therapist told me once that really helped me. Think of your life as a jungle. When you‚Äôre in the jungle, there are so many things going on around you it can be really hard to see which direction to go, what to focus on, what‚Äôs coming towards you next, etc. When you share your struggles with the people you trust, it‚Äôs more like they‚Äôre floating above the jungle. They can help you see everything that‚Äôs going on a little bit more clearly because they‚Äôre not in the middle of it. Don‚Äôt be afraid to lean on those people for support when you need to. They‚Äôll help you navigate your way through the jungle.	1642781299.0	htm2zu7	t3_s9dm5z	t3_s9dm5z	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dm5z/i_mightve_chose_the_wrong_major_and_i_think_my/htm2zu7/

d70g9	You're right.  You're getting a lot of shit for policing grief or whatever, but there is a difference and claiming otherwise is insulting to people who have suffered a worse loss.  I mentioned in another comment how hurtful it was to have someone equate her miscarriages to me carrying a baby I knew would die.  I absolutely bonded with that baby and loved that baby and have a photo of her on display in my home.  But what I didn't do was prepare for her life.  I didn't go into the hospital to have her expecting I would bring her home.  I did not spend my whole pregnancy wondering what her first word would be, how she would get along with her siblings, etc.  I did not get to get used to her baby voice, to the smell of her head, to her born personality.  I never nursed her, or bathed her, or sang her to sleep, or saw her interacting with her siblings, or experienced a single one of her firsts, so the idea that her loss could possibly be equivalent to a stillbirth or a baby lost to SIDS is absolutely crazy.	1642781629.0	htm3v2e	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htk9ba4	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htm3v2e/

I have waited for so long to be come a developer - job for men as people say - the job that I thought I would never be able to be one, due to my gender and ridiculous traditional mindset of what a woman would do. Granparents, dad, brothers, aunts, uncles, everyone from my big family underestimates females. Our world sucks, but not us, we are amazing.   Don't give up. It took me years from the age 11 to have today. Make yourself a plan and don't lose hope. You can go abroad at age 25 30 35 40 after saving your money. It doesn't matter, age is just a number.

Many men are aware of themselves and do not try the ‚Äúhot girls‚Äù at all as they know the ‚Äúhot girls‚Äù are not their caliber. Also, I have beautiful and single friends (nearing 40) and ugly yet married friends.

rhwmz49	I‚Äôm glad your family has been able to be open about their pregnancy loss.   In my experience, there is stigma around miscarriage. It isn‚Äôt talked about openly so a lot of people have misconceptions about how often they happen. When I was in my obstetric and gynaecology rotation, the sheer number of patients who had experienced at least one miscarriage prior to their current pregnancy took me by surprise, despite the fact I‚Äôm a doctor.   There is stigma around talking about fertility and gynaecological issues in general in my opinion.

That's that painting of a farmer and a woman (I had assumed it was his wife, but I've heard the models were brother and sister) standing. He's holding a pitchfork.

But maybe that‚Äôs a sign that you should look for different crowds to hang with. Also, you don‚Äôt need to be in tune humoristically with your surroundings to be able to hang with them. Though it does make it easier.  All I know is, that thinking and analysing this issue of yours will only make it harder. Humor happens in an instant and if you try too hard, it will be out of sync easily. On the other hand, effortless humor and comedic timing are difficult things to master. Some are quite definitely born with a better set of tools in this regard. But surely you can work on it too. My recommendation would be to look at some late night host who you like, for me Conan O‚ÄôBrien was the shit when I was growing up, and that man really has a way with people in general and a great comedic timing and makes material out of anything. . .

Perhaps you are too young and idolize the mean girls in high school who get to sleep with everyone around them. That‚Äôs not life is about, even it might look like at your age. Whatever it is, you would be better off if you start treating others kindly, so that you get a better treatment too. Also, try to find a therapist please. Someone who you can trust, and can help you.

4fs3bl71	What annoys me is the demonizing of people who don‚Äôt get vaccines. Why do we care if someone gets vaccinated or not? Well allegedly it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre told it helps slow the spread.  But when you look at the large number of Covid cases lately and the fact that even vaccinated people contract it (albeit probably with less severe symptoms) it doesn‚Äôt seem preventing the spread is what the vaccine does. So why tf do we care what someone does with their body if being vaccinated doesn‚Äôt prevent the spread of the disease? It seems all the vaccine really does is reduce symptoms. Well in that case the vaccine is entirely personal, not to help others. Therefor it shouldn‚Äôt matter if someone opts out.	1642783668.0	htm9cv9	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htm9cv9/

And then spamming families that lost people from the virus with ' dont care, they only died bc they got the vaccine, etc.'  Like one side literally has people that have gone into a store that told them to wear a mask shoot and kill the worker for saying it. Workers have been assaulted, threatened, recorded, spit on, a billion other things all because a tiny piece of cloth is required for them to wear for no more than an hour or two of their day if they're shopping.   I literally had a man stop me in a restaurant this summer who tried to forcibly take the mask from my face without me ever once saying anything to him. Completely unprompted.

65t63	I had a miscarriage over the summer and I agree with the spirit of this post and most of the comments, but holy fuck some of the comments in here are so judgmental and triggering as fuck. You don't know people's stories. My miscarriage was an unplanned pregnancy (I was on birth control at the time) and we decided to keep the baby. It was disappointing and upsetting but like many others commenting here, I didn't feel it was really a baby yet and I was able to process it. Does it still affect me now, as I am currently pregnant again after trying? Yes, it absolutely does. It has contributed to increasing my first trimester anxiety tenfold. Is it something I feel the need to publicly grieve about on social media? No, but that's also not my style to begin with. But a good friend of mine suffered a miscarriage around the same time after years of IVF treatment. She thought that was her miracle baby, and you bet your ass she was in extreme pain when she miscarried despite it being early in the process/her knowing the likelihoods of a miscarriage at that point. The comments calling out toxic social media behavior I am fine with. The comment casting judgment on how long/how intensely expectant mothers should be allowed to grieve are really not acceptable in my view. This sanctimonious "hierarchy of grief" posturing is gross. You don't know people's stories. You have no idea what an expectant mother may have had to go through to get even 5 weeks along. You have no idea how much that week or three weeks may have meant to someone trying to have a baby, and you really get nothing out of insulting and criticizing someone who is literally grieving. Society has created a taboo around miscarriages, which is fortunately for all of us something that seems to be dissipating - but perhaps part of why people have such varied reactions to miscarrying is because this is nothing something we are taught how to process or talk about. Many women go through this alone or with their partner only. These judgmental attitudes are a part of the problem. I'm not a better person because I was able to process and dismiss my miscarriage using the logic so many of the commenters on this post are smugly spewing. Frankly, despite my healthy reaction to what happened to me, I've been surprised by how the trauma and sadness of the experience has still cropped up in unexpected ways.	1642783836.0	htm9tc3	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htm9tc3/

7as398wo	I'm sorry, I can only grasp the sadness you must still feel.  Cancer is a monster. It steals the people dearest to us in the worst ways.    Lost one of my and my brother's good friend to it. She went from phoning me in May to tell me that she has cancer and can I let my brother know because she was scared that she would not see him when he flew back in December to visit. He put his wedding plans on hold and changed his leave days to take the entire month of July to spend with her and drive her around where she needed to go. We all got tested to see who was a match. Then in late November she got a match. She passed away on the 3 of December, 1 day before her transplant was scheduled. 22 days before she turned 24.   She is in our wedding photos, a picture that does not come off my wall. We still talk about her, after 11 years she is still our Facebook friend and every year we still post to her wall and send love to her family.  Her other friend named his daughter after her, it's my niece's second name.   I miss her still.

If you can't afford to  1: take them to the vet all the time over every little thing 2: spoil them rotten (buy lots of toys and top shelf food)  3: take them out every 2-3 hours (that's how often babies need to be fed for the first 2 months, EVEN AT NIGHT)  4: figure out who would be able to watch them while you work, someone trustworthy Oh and also start cooking all your own meals, shower every day, and be able to work. Because it doesn't sound like you'd have family to help you with childcare or money.  Otherwise you're NOT ready for a child and you'd probably do them a lot more harm than good. Experience?

d70g9	Rainbow baby is a fairly new term, only about 15 or 20 years old.  The norm used to be that women were expected to STFU about any sort of pregnancy/infant loss, even stillbirth.  And the old way of doing things caused its own trauma.  Used to be you had a stillbirth--any loss after 20 weeks is a stillbirth--and even if it was right at 40 weeks, you weren't allowed to see or hold your baby, much less take pictures, you spent your hospital stay on the maternity ward, & then you were pretty much supposed to go home and never mention it again.  When I carried to term seven years ago, I didn't talk about it to the general public, but I still heard a *lot* of stories from women who still had pain from how they were treated 15 or 20 years before.  And that is where it gets messy, because without women who lost their babies and fought for others, nothing would have gotten better.  A few years before I lost that daughter, I had a miscarriage at 13 weeks that landed me in the hospital.  While I don't remember that baby's due date (and am vague on the month) & even have to think a little while to remember the exact week I had the loss, I vividly recall how awful it was to spend the night in the maternity ward listening to other babies being born and then being sent home the next day without so much as a "how are you feeling?", and wanting to punch a hospital official I happened to know at church because he was legitimately baffled as to why I found the whole thing traumatizing.  But because of women who didn't get over it, that same hospital system treated me much, much, much better with my daughter's death.  There's a difference between working to make sure no one has to go through what you did and just performing grief to be important.	1642784130.0	htmamg8	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htk9tv1	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmamg8/

3f27rlkb	You are saying this to a woman who is not the typical definition of hot, and who has been in a very loving and happy relationship for over 3 years. Personality is in fact more so the priority for many people. And additionally, sometimes when someone is attracted to other aspects of you, then the physical attraction grows.   I‚Äôm not overly attractive in the sense that you‚Äôre thinking- and yet there‚Äôs someone who fell in love with my personality, humour, values, beliefs, dreams- which grew to them also loving my 5ft 1, chubby, jiggly tummy, cellulite everywhere, acne, not perfectly white toothed self.   I‚Äôve been through hell and back my whole life. I‚Äôve been bullied, overlooked, ignored, put down, last choice, and the moment someone doesn‚Äôt like me the immediate strike is ‚Äúya well you‚Äôre ugly‚Äù. I‚Äôve also been the brunt of people‚Äôs kinks, which when it‚Äôs unwanted it‚Äôs equally as horrible. It sucks thinking you made a genuine friend when really all they wanted was to get hard over you and take advantage of you.   So I don‚Äôt want to invalidate your feelings and experiences. I know how it feels. I know what it‚Äôs like to hate literally EVERYTHING about my existence. Not just hate my looks, but hate everything and anything about me. I know what it‚Äôs like to be the outcast and the ugly one in the room. But, I‚Äôve come to learn that it all comes down to eye of the beholder. Some people do find me attractive. And not just my partner, others find me attractive as well. And that level of other‚Äôs attraction for me shot up when I stopped being so bitter and self loathing. So yes, it is very possible to be the not hot but funny girl, and still be adored by people for who you simply are.	1642784367.0	htmb9w5	t3_s8n86p	t1_htm9e7a	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htmb9w5/

7safccyl	This is so sad. You shouldn‚Äôt profit off your babies death. You shouldn‚Äôt exploit it or exploit your young child‚Äôs sadness.  I also have another story to add to it. My older sister who‚Äôs an extreme narcissist has two children. She tried for a third but miscarried. Her best friend from childhood(not really friends now) always wanted a child, all she ever wanted was to be pregnant but she physically cannot, and when she was told (they‚Äôre in their late 30s and this was maybe 3 years ago) my sister, my sister said ‚ÄúI totally understand. I had a miscarriage.‚Äù And although I‚Äôm missing a lot of detail to who my sister is as a person, and I understand that was her attempt, I think, of trying to make the friend feel better. It was in such bad taste. And my sister doesn‚Äôt even treat the children she has very well at all.  It just felt selfish (because she normally turns things into stuff about herself) and the stories you posted also come off as very selfish.   Now, I don‚Äôt have pregnancy/miscarriage experience to empathize with these women but it just feels wrong to think about doing any of that.	1642784732.0	htmc9g4	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmc9g4/

cz041ohd	I agree and disagree with what you said, yes physically attractive is 90% out of your control but being yourself is a houndred percent you.   I am 100% average, not good looking, no insane abs or muscles and not the best weight, no wierd or distinguishing features. Despite all of this I grow on people because I am myself, i dress to show who i am, I am me and I own it.  I dated a model, and not to get into the specifics she was very beautiful. Past her beauty I was more attracted to what made her unique, her quirks, her wierd hobbies, odd laugh, ext. These were the things that made me fall in love with her, but because she was a model and had the 90% physical genes she did not express who she was. She had an ego and slight narcissism, from being bullied for when she was herself. Throught her schooling and even now, She had to pick between being herself and being beautiful, and you cant change the 90%.   We who do not have that 90% have the advantage in finding love and caring relationships, we do not fear showing who we are by dress or by expression because it is all we have. People who say it's all about looks, are only right till they are wrong so show them they are wrong. I promise, it will give you self confidence and you or anyone who follows themselves regardless of that 90% will find happiness.

If a person's social media is personal to them, though, it's a different matter.  Fifty thousand Instagram followers are different than even 100 Facebook friends you've been in contact with for years.  I'm more than willing to extend sympathy to anyone on here who has had a loss, but I can't say how much the sympathy of a stranger helps.	1642785009.0	htmd0np	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htk9own	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmd0np/

7tdir	The term rainbow baby is meant to represent a happy and healthy child following a failed and traumatic pregnancy. It's meant to represent the light after the storm, and can help women process the difficult emotions of  having a child while still dealing with the loss of another. My point is that using the term "rainbow baby" indiscriminately is the same as treating every miscarriage, even early term ones, as though they are major losses and require morning. In your mother's case it doesn't seem like she would consider her miscarriage traumatic and therefore would have no reason to consider you a "rainbow baby".  I understand the definition you're using, I just think it's reductive.	1642785211.0	htmdka5	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htm46ti	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmdka5/

70sgjtdz	There should be no stigma in talking about miscarriage, but it becomes part of your life story and not its sole focus. It is also a very personal pain. Children who never knew their sibling can be traumatised by the parent's depression. The parent needs help and support. Not a social media career exploiting pain.   Let the mother have a mural in her bedroom, but let her child live a carefree childhood.   I have heard from children given their dead sibling's name and encouraged to live the life a never-born baby 'would have had'.

dn0ihp	there is a wild world of difference between losing a pregnancy at, presumably, 5 or 6 weeks and losing a child. 6 weeks is basically a late period. i get that people are over the moon to learn they are pregnant, but it's important to have some perspective. my sister lost a baby at 21 weeks. that's a fully-formed being, not a tiny non-specialized embryo  that shares the same molecular instructions that are crucial to normal embryo development in most vertebrates.	1642785637.0	htmepum	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmepum/

You talk throughout this story like knowing basic right from wrong makes you an empath and kid, that's not how it works.  You said you don't think people would understand why you feel bad for what you did to K? Anyone with any morals would, because it was a monstrously shitty thing to do. That doesn't make you an empath.  Clearly everyone who read this feels only for K, so they must all be far more empathetic than you.	1642785666.0	htmesrs	t3_s9ep2q	t1_htmc63v	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ep2q/i_helped_someone_abuse_their_daughter_for_sexual/htmesrs/

gyh94k60	Hey I think I should clarify that this is past behaviour (dosent make it ok lol) but I realised this post may have unintentionally scared you and stuff and I dont wanna do that  Yes I know this is very fucked up. But I think for a while and I did think she was a pedo. But then I came across the term 'emotional incest" and its 10000 percent closer to what I dealt with. I literally ticked every box or whatever.   I think the thing is I just need evidence my mum would do any of this. Because of the fact everyone hates me in my family no one would belive me. I dont think my mum really knew what she was doing as shes had similar things done to her from what shes vaguely 3xplained and I think unfortunately shes just repeating it.   I just think if I tell anyone about it without 0 concrete evidence my life will be so much worse than it is. The only good thing about my mums shit concept of boundaries is she let's me go out hang out whenever I want with whoever's and this allows me to get away from her weher she realises it. I can tell that will be taken away if I even say anything. Probably not even by my mum but probably my sad who will probably be so   "shocked" I would accuse her of something so awful n stuff   Anyway basiclly I really dont think shes a pedo. I dont know for sure but if I ever see her do something to my siblings I will probably report it	1642786561.0	htmh92g	t3_s9flgp	t1_htmenv7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9flgp/is_my_mum_actually_toxic_or_am_i_just_being_a_dick/htmh92g/

I think they are one cultures manifestation of some real entities.    Just a question for You, why would you choose to meditate on a architype of evil, hatred, murder, deceitfulness, and hedonism?

4fs3bl71	I‚Äôm paying close attention actually. I‚Äôm honestly open for discussion with this because it‚Äôs an important discussion and these are important questions. If you have some specific information you would like to share that supports your claim that everyone getting vaccinated will stop the virus from evolving and spreading please share it. If I‚Äôm wrong I want to know. I‚Äôm open minded.  Right now what I see today is there are far more people who are vaccinated with booster shots than in 2020/21, yet somehow there are far more Covid-19 cases in 2022 than in 2020/21 when there was no vaccine. So how do those numbers support this notion that the vaccine is helping prevent the spread?  Please don‚Äôt demonize me. I‚Äôm just trying to analyze this situation logically.	1642786758.0	htmhse5	t3_s9by4g	t1_htmgli3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htmhse5/

There are a few billion people in America.

But as another commenter said you shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice your well being for the well being of others‚Ä¶   But again it‚Äôs not easy and each situation like this one is unique making it harder to find a solution. But there‚Äôs always one i would recommend OP to slowly distance himself/herself from him. Otherwise this will only get worse with time.   The other person sounds like he may have some problems and should get professional help OP I understand you want to help but you‚Äôre going to hurt yourself more in the long term and you‚Äôll feel like it‚Äôs your fault for not being able to help when it‚Äôs not your fault.

3z0p09xs	No, I wouldn‚Äôt be cool with being a shitty person. I don‚Äôt feel like a shitty person which in itself probably suggests otherwise. I am a good person, always have been. Even too self-sacrificing in the past. I‚Äôm being selfish, yes, but that‚Äôs something I had to learn. You could say I‚Äôve grown by not wanting to be responsible for other people‚Äôs feelings or happiness. I save that energy for family and those that are close and care about my well-being just as much. In this case, I think deep down I didn‚Äôt feel that he‚Äôs a good person and the only reason he‚Äôs good to me is because he knows that I‚Äôll walk away if he treats me in any other way. He tried. What does that say about him I wonder? Does he actually care about me and wants the best for me or is he selfishly and carefully controlling himself to keep me around because I make him ‚Äúfeel good, motivated, happy‚Äù. Will he treat me bad if I do get more involved and walking away will be more difficult?	1642786913.0	htmi7mk	t3_s9ff9t	t1_htmeq36	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ff9t/ive_been_dating_a_guy_for_4_months_and_im_about/htmi7mk/
cz041ohd	I gave one example of the few amazing people I have dated, if you choose to generalize me off of my one example that is on you. I gave you advice I had to give myself when I realized everyone has their struggles. I can talk about my other girlfriend who were not 'beautiful' by your standards or however anyone chooses to make those standards but that doesnt carry my point across. Everyone I have dated was beautiful in my eyes, whether they were a model, or were over weight,  or had a genetic disease eating at the tissue that holds their joints together. Love yourself and people will love you back.   No one gives me a chance, I expect no one to. Sympathy is only skin deep; empathy understanding others, their pains, finding how you might not be so different is a far better emotion to express.	1642786933.0	htmi9kr	t3_s8n86p	t1_htmgw5r	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htmi9kr/
3lqaqf73	If you go on a date with this other guy while you are still technically in a relationship, your curren "bf" will 100% throw it back in your face. So would you rather stay with an abusive person just to be in a relationship? (if you are afraid of him or that he might hurt you - get a friend and help them get away from your bf. It takes a great toll on your mental health too if you stay with him too long.) You should not put his jealousy over your self worth.  If you already feel guilty, you know, that this is cheating. No other way to say that. But it will be much less stressful to break up and only then go on the date. That guy deserves honesty too, to not be the one, who gets sucked into a cheating story, whatever the outcome of the dinner will be.	1642786943.0	htmiaj0	t3_s9ff9t	t3_s9ff9t	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ff9t/ive_been_dating_a_guy_for_4_months_and_im_about/htmiaj0/

He wants what's best for his daughter in his mind, he sees you as something to be protected, something more frail than a guy, but that's just it. Comparing you to your cousin he thinks that you aren't as capable as him because you aren't a man. That doesn't mean that you are less of a person, or that being a girl is the only thing stopping you from achieving your dreams, it just means that your dad is letting his emotions get in the way of his daughters aspirations, which in this Instance is just really bad parenting.	1642787203.0	htmj0ji	t3_s8y8k5	t3_s8y8k5	/r/offmychest/comments/s8y8k5/i_hate_being_a_girl/htmj0ji/

There's two possible rational outcomes to that realization: either I start being actively engaged in environmental militancy to try and change enough people's mindset so that my effort is not pointless, either I quit making that effort. Keeping the status quo after that realization would be madness, I ain't no christian brought in this life to suffer so I can thrive when I'm dead.

The children should never be around an abusive parent.	1642787639.0	htmk8bv	t3_s9gewe	t3_s9gewe	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gewe/hot_take_on_pregnancy_and_motherhood/htmk8bv/

At any rate though the prostitute is selling her body, just like a pornstar, it's not rape because the "transaction" starts with the prostitute, not the other way around. But also even though sometimes the situation is better, prostitutes still do get raped, at an alarming rate. Rape is about taking power from an individual to impose your sexual desires on them, often with force. In op's situation she is unable to afford rent to house her two kids, and the landlord, who is in a position if power, saw that and decided he was going to manipulate the situation to get what he wanted. He attempted to remove this women's autonomy by bribing her for sex and using the threat of homelessness and of having her kids struggle, to get her to have sex with him. It's disgusting. And it is rape. He could have done the right thing and told her that if she couldn't afford rent that she could have an extension and pay it back at a later date, or he could of even just kicked her out and that would of been a better moral choice. He's taking advantage of a mother and her children to illicit sexual acts with the woman, and get what he wants.	1642787685.0	htmkcyh	t3_s62tle	t1_ht98v30	/r/offmychest/comments/s62tle/i_am_having_sex_with_my_landlord_for_reduced_rent/htmkcyh/

What could you possibly be gaining with this line of thinking?

10odjz	I typed out a lot but deleted it. It was too long and rambling and I don't have the spoons to edit it so I'll just try again. Yes. Obviously one loss is "worse" than the other. However. That isn't something we say to people grieving. If miscarriage wasn't taboo, there wouldn't be as many people going the trauma porn route. Why? Because they'd have received support from the beginning, no matter how early the loss. Miscarriage is fucking painful. Even early losses can be brutal emotionally. And everyone handles that differently. If we had more compassion around the topic: if jobs offered leave or mental health services for miscarriage, we'd be in a better place. The majority of people who've had a miscarriage KNOW that a stillbirth would be worse. But that doesn't mean that they don't get to ever talk about it or post about it. Yeah don't be a freak and do a miscarriage mural for your 8 year olds bedroom. But you're allowed to share about it on Facebook. You should be able to get leave and mental health help for it. Its still a loss that happened to you. It's all this gatekeeping that's bullshit. "Someone has it worse, so you be quiet about your trauma." And for the losses I mentioned, I defined them that way because those are the losses that compassionate leave covers. I'm not defining the word itself but we were talking specifically about compassionate leave.  Edit: I'm so tired and I don't think this came out any clearer than the first draft. I'm happy to come back later when I have the spoons and energy and clarify anything I said. Thanks.	1642788374.0	htmm98o	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htmikew	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmm98o/
bruze3bk	Russia will not invade Ukraine.  Putin is just playing hardball as a last ditch effort.  There is no way a country like Russia could sustain a war against peer and near peer forces in Europe.  It does not have the resources or the logistics. After the initial massacre during the opening phases of the war, it would slowly turn into COIN mission against a determined foe with the backing of NATO.  Look at what happened in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.  Russia can not sustain that kind of ever war.  China will not invade Taiwan, It does not have the resources or the logistics to invade Taiwan.  China has way too much to lose on the world stage if it used overt military invasion as a means of re-acquiring Taiwan.   North Korea wont due shit.  They are Chinas little buffer and wild card.  They also do not have even the most basic resources to do anything other than a Hail marry play of launching ordnance before they are blown off the map forever.  A big suicide.  North Korea is just Chinas little puppet.    WW3.  WW3 has already started.  Its being fought through liminal warfare and has been going on since at least 2010.  It could get worse and turn more deadly.  The posturing from Russia and China in my opinion is more about geopolitics, and money more than anything.  Nobody is looking to have some sort of Romanticized Imperial expansion like back in the old days.  Its about having your tentacles behind the curtains everywhere in the world through covert action and socio-economic partnerships.  The old days of gaining ground for the motherland through overt military action is long gone. You cant do more than annex some bullshit territory in the Caucasus, or some island in the Pacific because everyone on the world stage of significant has friends. Those who have friends in the West usually have the upper hand.  I don't say this to be insensitive to the people who live in these areas, it is just the way it is. Nobody cares about Georgia or Crimea other than the people who live there.    I would be more concerned with an alignment of Russia, China, and Iran. The Middle East has always been a powder keg, but if and when we see a strong alliance between these three nations, it could be a real big problem for the world.  It would cause WW3 to become a lot worse than it already is. We already see the groundworks being laid in Syria.   I sure hope I am right about Russia and China and that I am wrong about Russia, China, and Iran.  Time will tell.

4fs3bl71	First I just want to thank you for your respectful response. That‚Äôs a valid argument and I agree with it. I should clarify that I‚Äôm not anti-vaccine. I don‚Äôt take any issue with vaccines or saying you should get vaccinated because it will reduce your side effects which prevents hospitals from being overwhelmed because that‚Äôs accurate.  I mainly have concerns with talk of mandating it or putting people under heavy financial coercion to get the vaccine especially because it doesn‚Äôt seem all of the information coming out of the government is accurate or nuanced for that matter. They told us over and over getting vaccinated prevents the spread and that‚Äôs the reason to get vaccinated but it wasn‚Äôt really based on the numbers. It was an ideological push. And plenty of people have valid reasons to not get vaccinated but they‚Äôre going to be under the same mandates and financial coercion. Plus it‚Äôs unhealthy the way we‚Äôre dividing and demonizing people as vaccinated or anti-vaxx. I think it‚Äôs a dangerous road to walk down without stopping to ask questions. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm suggesting.   Broadly I think people would better served having these conversations and trying to think critically about it. Anytime we‚Äôre talking about increased government powers and threatening people financially, it‚Äôs time to have these important discussions in a rational and respectful way.	1642788574.0	htmmt98	t3_s9by4g	t1_htmkb5l	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htmmt98/

4j7u7fy8	There's a concept in economics called utils. Utils are a unit (used only for the sake of hypothetical discussion) measuring how happy you are with something.      One of the first things they teach you about utils is that they are absolutely dependent on the person assigning them. My value of 5 utils might be equivalent to your value of 2000. I can't tell you "This is worth 5 utils!" because that value is entirely dependent on me.      The point of this is, the scales by which we measure our lives and the things in them are not equal from person to person. The things that make you happiest, the things that make you saddest, the things that absolutely break you down to your core - you determine all of those for yourself. And, I determine those for myself.      If a miscarriage is devastating to someone, it is devastating to them. If it isn't, it isn't. If they feel nothing about a stillborn baby, that's also fine because it is their experience and they decide the value of it.      Trying to gatekeep what other people are allowed to feel based on their experiences is wrong. THEY get to experience their life and assign whatever value they want to their experiences, good or bad, and your opinion of the value of that experience is ultimately meaningless.	1642788758.0	htmnbha	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htk9ba4	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmnbha/

3xjtz3sw	Yeah, I was thinking of that one, too. I think it boils down to the fact that grief is a unique individual experience: some who miscarry are barely troubled by it, others are devastated, and that we should be understanding of another person‚Äôs need to grieve. But when that *individual* need to grieve becomes a *public mandate* for everyone to join them in their remembrance/grief display, that‚Äôs where it goes too far. I totally get a mom wanting to keep the memory of a lost child alive (eg. By remembering them during special occasions) but she cannot dictate the grief process of that child‚Äôs siblings or other family members. Mom‚Äôs coping mechanism might be harming her other kids, who feel each shrine and remembrance as another fresh wave of grief and regret.  (Sigh. We are going through this right now with family after a cousin‚Äôs untimely death. Every special occasion where mom wants to remember/acknowledge her kid feels like another funeral service, and all the kid cousins are sad and depressed and want to avoid the family. There‚Äôs no easy answer)	1642788888.0	htmnoje	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htkwhbb	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmnoje/

gbjvc	You do, after you spend an entire paragraph with periods between words for emphasis stressing how short a time it was, and then you follow it up with:  > But.....  she knew she was pregnant for three days.  So you emphasize it was a short amount of time, briefly mention that she has the right to grieve, and then return to the duration. Whether it's your intention or not, there is strong emphasis on the three days thing. It's belittling whether or not you intend it to be so. That's not me projecting. That's what you've conveyed.   I do see where you go into talking about how she interacted with her daughter afterwards, and yeah, that's beyond the pale. The responsible thing to do would have been to explain to the daughter as calmly as possible that sometimes these things happen and that it's nobody's fault but there won't be a baby coming, not force her daughter to make it her entire identity.	1642789001.0	htmnzsh	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htm7j69	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmnzsh/

51glxyeu	Hmm, am a man. And from my 23 years of experience of life. Its chemical, the balance in the brain and the interaction this individual might go through will affect how they feel. Honestly there are too many variable to think about from where they were born, to what they eat. Everything in life either supports or destroys. If you getting supported in your way of thought then it will become all the more clear to you. But when you find resistance and questions; that's when you need to work on yourself AWAY from people. I might be crucified for this; ignorance is bliss. Had any of these people thought the way they do if someone first didn't show them that way of thought? If we as a society indoctrinate the next generation to be stone cold killers with a logical mindset who only work for the good of others then those individuals will most likely not have any of these side thoughts. Because they were taught what to do with the spare time they have. Instead of looking up porn, they'd be reading or writing or paint or some shit.

If it was financial reasons holding you down then you can make a plan match to see if the financial side can be covered (loans, extra job etc) Life experience enriching your life is not something your father can provide, truth be told.

Look out for yourself and further your opportunities. In the end he will will be proud once the sees the results.

There's always going to be an asshole who says "women aren't funny" or make obscene comments about conventionally hot people, but typically those are the most insecure people.  There are tons of funny ass women. I know what you mean, though, and know you're speaking to the stereotype. Apparently, we can't drive either.

Nevermind that every one of her complaints about me were direct results of a severe hormone imbalanced i had lived with all my life. But by the time we find out about it, she had one foot out the door and didn't even give me a chance to get treated.   It fucking hurts, specially when i was good to her. Always treated her right.   We have two kids together, so i can't get away from looking at her fucking face.   She made me want to do existing.

8xd96y	You wrote, "The thought of K hearing us from the other room and being heartbroken about it, while meanwhile I was with her mom having mind blowing sex was the most thrilling thing I'd ever experienced. C was so hot, and hearing the faint sound of Ks cries while I pounded her furiously made me feel a way that I couldn't describe in a thousand years. It was amazing. I'm shaking just thinking about it rn."  That is one of the cruelest things I have ever read. I started crying for this K girl. That is some pain she will never get over. And you call yourself an empath?  That's not how that works. You talk about auras and stuff but you were extremely cruel to K and enjoyed being cruel. Talking a good game does not make you a good person. It's how you treat others. An empath could never do that to another person because it would hurt them as much as it hurts the other person. For an empath to hurt someone else hurts them. I believe you need to see a therapist. Something has happened to you that has made you the way you are. It might be past abuse or it could be a mental illness but you need to find out or your life is going to be one horrible experience after another and you will have no idea how you are the reason why.	1642789463.0	htmp9fb	t3_s9ep2q	t3_s9ep2q	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ep2q/i_helped_someone_abuse_their_daughter_for_sexual/htmp9fb/

10odjz	I feel like if we had more compassionate methods in place for all miscarriages, this shit wouldn't be as prevalent because it wouldn't be this taboo subject. Because we as a society don't properly acknowledge it, all this trauma porn is born. But if we were all open about our losses, then the trauma porn wouldn't have an effect. "Look at my miscarriage mural and feel bad for me" would be met with "yeah. Almost everyone I know has had a miscarriage. Sorry for your loss but we are all in the same boat, and painting a mural of this is traumatic for your 8 year old". But because miscarriage is painted as this rare thing that never happens, people can exploit that for shock value. If we were set up to offer free mental health services with every miscarriage, and more people opened up about loss and how very normal it is, we wouldn't be in this situation to begin with. Because we would all know that 1/5 or MORE pregnancies end in a loss. It would be common knowledge.   But what this ALSO means, is that the gatekeeping has to stop. Let your friend who just had a miscarriage at 9 weeks post a poem about it without saying "well, our other friend had a stillborn. So you posting this is ridiculous and selfish". Let us grieve the losses we have with compassion, and they won't be able to be glorified. Trauma is trauma. We know that a stillborn is worse than an early miscarriage, right? Of course it is. But when we tear people down because they "only" had a miscarriage, then are we also saying it's okay to tell people who have had stillbirths to be quiet about it because they didn't lose a 5 year old to cancer or an accident? I mean really we all know stillbirth is worse than miscarriage, and the loss of a living child is worse than a stillbirth. But I have a feeling we'd all be up in arms if someone posted on here about their stillbirth and a bunch of people commented "well at least they were never really living. You didn't watch them grow up and THEN die." It would be heartless. And completely invalidating. The pain Olympics has to stop, and we need to have compassion for all losses.   All this being said, yes of course I think painting your 8 year olds room into a miscarriage mural is BATSHIT. but I don't think we'd be seeing that stuff if losses were more commonly discussed and met with compassion. There will always be nutjubs out there but there wouldn't be as many of these cringey examples.	1642789478.0	htmpaxf	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmpaxf/

I would like to say I feel that my generation "gen z" will contribute to saving the planet in big ways. There's so many projects ongoing, so many researches being done to solve this. We just need the laws to prevent any further damage. We need to fight for the new green deal. We have to encourage divestment from fossil fuels.   (So far some investors have dropped fossil fuels from their portfolio.)   Secondly, believe it or not the government has in fact invested 1.1 billions of dollars in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Although ecosystem may have been destroyed there's animals who are adapting.  Change is going to take time, but the least we can do is fight till the bitter end.

Character,  morals, values, how you treat other people, those are things that make you beautiful! I think society has ingrained in us that if we don't have European features and fair skin, we are ugly and that is so untrue! As a biracial woman myself, I have felt the effects of growing up with pre-dominately white friends and family members and I used to hate things about myself that I couldn't control. Now when I look in the mirror, I feel like the finest woman on this GD planet, because I AM. Confidence girl.	1642790053.0	htmqw0h	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htmqw0h/
3drbxh1h	I'm really sorry for how you feel. I can 100% confirm that it does get better! Please do not give up! I think the first thing to note here how you are not a priority to yourself! you need to be! That is the first step to find support and help you need! Also LDR are extremely difficult honestly I can tell you that much, they sucked the soul out of me, but you can also talk to your partner about how you've been feeling and also talk to your support group about how they can help you better.   Exams really test the patience of everyone, but please do not doubt how competent you are! You do your best and that is more than enough and you should be proud of yourself regardless. Do not let exams control your self-worth and competency because honestly, people react to exams differently and it does not make you any less or more competent at whatever it is that you study.  As for the family thing, you must find a space for yourself to escape to when things get difficult, a space a hobby anything at all.   &#x200B;  I'm sorry you are having a rough time, I pray it gets better for you soon <3 If you need someone to talk to or anything I'm here!	1642790054.0	htmqw5j	t3_s9dgdg	t3_s9dgdg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dgdg/does_it_ever_get_better/htmqw5j/

eragn3v	This post is sad. I‚Äôm dark skinned and married to a very good looking white guy. For what it‚Äôs worth, no one has ever acted surprised that I snagged such a man. In fact, my husbands former boss (who hits on my snidely) once asked what I saw in my husband.   So don‚Äôt chalk this up to you being dark skinned or anything.

awcos	When we leave an abusive person it can be really confusing. Obviously that person was not abusive 24/7, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt have fallen in love with them in the first place, we wouldn‚Äôt have stayed for so long. Then it gets more confusing because everyone else around you only knows the awful sides of them and the horrible things they did, and it leaves you alone with the good parts of your relationship and it makes it so much harder to move on.  It‚Äôs important to grieve for the person that you left, and not to feel foolish for doing it. You can mourn the good aspects of your relationship and the good times you shared, because humans are not just either ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúevil‚Äù, you could have been with an abusive person but maybe he made you laugh more than anyone else ever did. And it‚Äôs absolutely okay to grieve for that loss of laughter.

I lost my hair, was defficient and faint all the time, and it gave me mood swings and depression, and I lost my taste and love for food, and it's something we need to survive and be strong.    You deserve to eat, NO ONE has to earn their food! Do not do anything radical, but instead work on eating insightfully. Eating till your not hungry anymore and drinking lots of water. They might make comments, but all should matter to you is how your working on making yourself healthier and stronger so you can live your life better, and in due time they will see it too! Also this is a good time to practice not letting anyone's opinion matter to you and just focus on caring for your body. You are not a pig for eating, eating is the fuel for life.

So sad that so many people have died and suffered, so many families have empty chairs at the dinner table.

Crime is up. Way up. People are calling the police and they don‚Äôt show. They‚Äôre understaffed and exhausted. Inflation is way up at a time when people are struggling with money issues, job issues, isolation and loneliness and‚Ä¶  So many people are looking for arguments and fighting with each other when we all need to help each other. We all need to help one another right now, seriously. So grateful for those that do help, but there needs to be more. This should be an effort where most people look out for one another. But everyone‚Äôs gotten so mean. Even people that I have known my whole life, people I love and care about, it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know them anymore, they are online name calling and being nasty. I don‚Äôt see them the same way anymore.   I had a blood clots all over my lungs late last year. Not a good time for a medical emergency. Everyone made it about the vaccines.

54vo1bl1	You shouldn't feel uncomfortable in your own home. People need time to themselves. Please try to still see a counselor or therapist when you can. You need to be able to process this in a safe and non-judgemental way. When your mom is sober, ask her if there is a way to have specific times you can either be alone or spend time with her. An example would be after school to dinner time you can be alone and be able to do your own thing. There is nothing wrong with that. I'm so sorry you are going through this. Just know that no matter what she says, if she moves beyond hugging and kissing you, you need to tell someone that is not a family member.

Well, let me counter that representation with another: I went and got my first dose, had an allergic reaction, paid for the damn treatment out of my own pocket, was denied an exemption because doctors in Canada say that my condition wasn‚Äôt fatal and so I‚Äôm considered unvaccinated.  Thanks to the rhetoric people like you are picking up from the media and antagonising people who don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated, we are being dismissed, doctors refuse to listen to anyone claiming they are suffering an allergic reaction, severe reactions to the vaccines are being under represented and not recorded.  Don‚Äôt generalise. As someone who was denied a medical exemption and is being asked to put my health at risk by being exposed to the same allergen again just to be ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù to please a society filled with people like you, is disgusting.

a1c377ly	Heh, I love shopping at our Asian market. Bought a couple sets of chopsticks from them. I carry them when going out to eat Chinese food, and I‚Äôve been chased after as I leave for forgetting them. They aren‚Äôt expensive and I wouldn‚Äôt be upset at losing a pair, but the concern is touching.   Never thought of using chopsticks as racist in any way. Our local Chinese place offers flatware, and they have the cheap disposable chopsticks available on request. Those are actually okay because they‚Äôre grippy, more so than the ones I‚Äôve bought in fact - those just look cool.   Of course, if you do use chopsticks, be aware of a couple cultural taboos - the one that comes to mind is standing your chopsticks up in rice. This is a funeral related thing and would be offensive to see at the table. Better to lay them flat on your napkin or the edge of your plate, side by side.	1642791143.0	htmtnkm	t3_s9cr6g	t3_s9cr6g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9cr6g/i_just_got_called_racist_for_buying_chopsticks_at/htmtnkm/

bruze3bk	Hey dude, don't be so hard on yourself.  Not sure how old you are and what your life experience is but....take this for what it is worth.  I am 33 M, happily married with children, I work 50-60 hours a week.  When I was a young man 18-22 I was able to save about $44,000 in just under 4 years.  I was in the Military and advanced quickly and was stationed overseas, combined with all of that I had a lot of extras (Bachelor assisted housing, utilities allowances, hazard pays because of my job. exc.) I still went out with my buddies but I always saved when I got paid.  Got out, didn't feel like working and wanted to just focus on MMA fulltime so I lived off my savings.  It did not last long.  I blew through that money real quick.  My point is simple, don't be an all or nothing kind of guy.  Find a balance.  You work hard, your saving money, don't be afraid to treat yourself.   Just keep in reasonable, don't obsess over saving and don't obsess over the fact that you bought yourself a nice meal and a new phone or whatever....  The money really adds up over the years.  Sometimes it is hard to see the big picture and see the forest for the trees. Look for a consistent balance.  You don't always have to putt x amount of dollars in your savings if there is something you need or want, just putt something.  It adds up over the years. Don't just say fuck it and start spending every penny you earn.    Best of luck to you, I hope that you find a happy balance and continue to treat yourself with out having nothing to show for it.	1642791253.0	htmtxhi	t3_s9crjr	t3_s9crjr	/r/offmychest/comments/s9crjr/spent_500/htmtxhi/

We built a life together. It may not be perfect but it‚Äôs ours. But have you ever just met someone who accepted you? Who was so strikingly familiar with you even though you‚Äôve never met, Someone you didn‚Äôt have a history with, but who loved to know about and share their own. Someone who genuinely cares for you and you feel that? I‚Äôm not selfish enough to act on these impulses, love changes with time, and I wouldn‚Äôt be ready to be anywhere near a relationship if my life implodes. I just want to support this person and keep our relationship as just friends.

fqadk	That makes sense. I can‚Äôt relate to wanting to give up more of my time for work, and for free, and on a thing that actually costs me money. But if you enjoy baking, I guess it‚Äôs like an excuse to do your hobby without flagrant food waste?  Hmm. I‚Äôll try to think about it that way. Currently, when people bake and bring things in to my work, I get annoyed with them for undervaluing their own time and not having enough separation between work and life. I have a friend who bakes a lot to take to work, too, and I know she does it so people at work will like her better, or be impressed with her baking skills and thus think better of her work skills, so I see it as a lack of self-worth and boundaries. She gets upset if a baking project doesn‚Äôt go right, or annoyed if she volunteered to bake for a work party and nobody says thank you, but that‚Äôs different.  Anyway, thank you for explaining. I could never figure out why people would bother.	1642791282.0	htmu060	t3_s8ndv8	t1_htmo14q	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ndv8/i_bought_donuts_for_everybody_at_work_and_im_the/htmu060/

8dsop92g	I don‚Äôt think there are only two sides to this argument. At minimum, there are people like myself who wear a mask and sanitize as much as possible to prevent the spread of infection but who are unwilling to take a shot that could make them sick and still contagious. This vaccine is not like the ones we give our kids to prevent measles and such, it‚Äôs like the ones made for the flu every year. It‚Äôs purpose is not to make you immune, just to make it easier to deal with it should you get it. And if you‚Äôve already had Covid, there shouldn‚Äôt be any reason to take a shot. Those who refuse to wear a mask are belligerent fools. Those who refuse to get vaccinated are not necessarily the same. And there are people who get vaccinated and then feel they now have the right to not wear a mask or take any precaution to prevent spreading disease, what side are they on?	1642791397.0	htmub66	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htmub66/

caz57e	I've been asking myself this question for the past few years. I clearly don't consider being with someone a priority, because I've never really been with anyone. But there's always a moment when I encounter a woman who looks roughly my age of hope for a possibility. That hope is quickly dashed when I consider circumstances, likelihood of mutual attraction, etc. It's become a back-and-forth between considering whether I am asexual, and simply being too fearful to even try.  I do know that being asexual is NOT a bad thing. It happens, and there's nothing to be ashamed of.

bqwbna24	As a person with larger than average breasts, I absolutely hate the attention from having large ones. Every male that shows interest in me I've asked "what is it you like about me?" And they always say "big boobs". For once I'd rather be liked for something different like my eyes or personality but unfortunately my breasts are the only thing people notice about me and it's horrible. I've even been told "if you didn't have the big boobs i wouldn't be that interested in you". Even strangers in the street will directly look at my cleavage and it makes me feel uncomfortable.  I want to be able to wear what i like without people feeling like it's an open invitation to have a good look.

4yo38ozq	I'll preface this with I do have one instagram post about it from miscarriage awareness day, a friend was having a tough time and really didn't feel seen or supported so it was in some ways for both of us. It is very painful and it is a hard thing to process as the parents of the lost child and hard/awkward for those who knew about the pregnancy or have no idea to offer support. For us, it's a private ongoing grief (we have a candle that represents the smells little babe liked and didn't make me discreetly retch in the bushes).  What gets my goat is my brother's a dad, the mother of his child feels it is completely acceptable to speak about *my* miscarriage, because she is open about how she had an abortion. I miscarried when this child was 3, halfway across the country, had no idea she knew, it was twilight zone odd to have my eight year old niece out of the blue asking me if my dead baby was still inside me, or if it was like her mommy's abortion where they make sure it goes away. Though as another poster stated, people that are flaming desperate for attention all of the time and make shit up, if it wasn't that, her mom would just do something else to be noticed.	1642792043.0	htmw2bf	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmw2bf/

Whenever there's one in the yard he calls me over 'so I can see it' but it's really code for 'so I can relocate it to somewhere away from him'. We were in Mexico once and the car in front of us ran over a whip snake on a dirt road but didn't kill it. I got him to pull over so I could move it out of the road. He was fine watching through the open window until I got a hold of it and it started whipping it's body around like crazy (I had it behind the neck so it was safe) at which point he rolled up the window like it was going to steal the car. I thought he was going to drive away before I had a chance to put in in the grass and get back in he was so freaked.	1642792147.0	htmwcfp	t3_s9f844	t3_s9f844	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f844/i_love_my_husbands_phobia/htmwcfp/

60fwji85	so your point is that people should wait until farther into a pregnancy to inform other children of the pregnancy? i think it's reasonable for someone to make that decision, but i wouldn't take a soapbox and judge someone else who wants to share the news of a pregnancy with a child early on, even if there is still a risk of miscarriage. it's a really personal decision and depends on your views about what conception means and the degree to which it's appropriate to shelter children from uncomfortable fact of life.	1642792216.0	htmwjbs	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htm81b5	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htmwjbs/

I drive semi trucks as a job and this line of work seems to be chock-full of the gung-ho, anti-mask/anti-vaccine types that are horrifically seeing "getting sick" as a twisted badge of honor. There's times where I feel like I'm the only one really doing anything anymore and I'm seeing fewer people in these rural areas I live in and go through just "carry on with life".     I don't see any joy in getting sick or dealing with hospitals. But sadly, that sort of thing has become a twisted rite-of-passage for some. Trial by infection: I live, I'm protected by the Heavenly father. I die, I get to live beside the heavenly father. I'm getting tired of everyone acting nonchalantly about this and telling me to "lighten up". If I do end up hospitalized at any point in time during all this, it's probably going to be a psych ward. Won't be the first time either.     Life is already difficult.

bruze3bk	What is a associate degree going to do? Having a degree does not make you employable.   I know plenty of people with masters degrees working shit jobs, they are single, have no family of their own and in their thirties, one is a caterer making $11 an hour.  He has a Masters from a good university.  It is nobodies responsibility but your own to  accomplish a goal.  Make better decisions like not spreading your legs for some knucklehead while your a junior in high school.  I have known many successful single mothers who got knocked up early in life.  Mom and Dad didn't pay for their degrees.    What is a better benefit to society, raising people to have a sense of personnel responsibility, good work ethic and determination; or teaching them that someone else is going to fix all of their problems for them and that there is no consequences for their actions, do what ever makes you happy now?  How about this.  How about a loving parent helps watch the child, or helps foot some of the bill for school while the son or daughter works a job, saves money, and continues pursuing a degree or whatever.  They will be taught the value of hard work, sacrifice and learn personal responsibility and how to be self reliant.    Its no wonder society is the way it is.  Teenagers making Tiktok videos complaining about their jobs because they are lazy pieces of shit who expect everything to be handed to them.    Its a parents responsibility to love and protect their children, to invest in them, to teach them right and wrong, to pick them up when they fall, to instill in them a sense of self worth and value with unconditional love and demonstrate through action how to be a constructive member of society.  It all start in the home.

4xr3g	This is wildly incorrect. The Founding Fathers had quarantines and vaccine mandates. George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and the rest of the group cultivated different visions about America. But they agreed on one principle: They were unrelenting on the notion that circumstances often emerge that require public officials to pass acts that abridge individual freedoms.

It is not a good way to compare yourself to others, trust me I am guilty of that too.  I am a 25 year old virgin and so, who cares, I certainly  don't.   I try to work on myself instead, and meet people and so. I joined a hiking course for example and I chatted with a lovely girl and she added me on Facebook as well.  What I would suggest is the same, what I suggested myself too, if something disgusts you about yourself, then work on it, if you can't then accept it.

bruze3bk	Well, technically your not a virgin dude. With that being said, I get the gist of your sentiment.  You want a "real" relationship with a sex life.  Let me give you some advice.  I am a happily married 33 M father of children.  You should not worry so much about what you can not control.  You cant change the face God gave you.  You can go to the gym, eat a decent diet, and stop jerking off with a fleshlight so much.  Look into nofap.  Masturbation is killing your sex life before it has really even began. Its really bad for yourself esteem and mental healthy also.   I have a cousin, he is 33, educated, not bad looking, and has a huge penis.  He is a virgin, never had a girlfriend, works a shit job and lives at home with his parents.  He has no confidence in himself.  Dont be like him.  You don't need to be  the best looking, extroverted guy to find a good women who will love you for who you are.   I would maybe try online dating.  Maybe look into eHarmony and don't ever tell women what you think they *want* to hear.  Be truthful.  Have you ever seen 90 day fianc√© by chance? Have you seen how ugly some of the dudes are on that show?  I am sure you could find an old cougar who likes black men really easy but, you probably don't want that right?   Lots of different women love black men for all kinds of different reasons.  Use that to your advantage, its like white dudes with Asians or Latinas.  There is someone out there for you.  Bottom line, your not pathetic, your not a loser, you just need to make some small changes.  And as a side not, if women are thinking wrong of you because your Black, they are probably stereotyping or racist. Show people they are wrong.    Best of luck to you man, keep your head up.  Focus on what you have control over.	1642793554.0	htn0743	t3_s9ibxg	t3_s9ibxg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9ibxg/im_practically_a_thirtythreeyears_old_virgin/htn0743/

And yet the governments spend all their efforts yelling at and shaming the like 10-25% of people in rich countries who aren't vaccinated, saying they'll be the ones to blame for variants.  Except the Omicron variant came from South Africa, where less than a third of people are vaccinated, because of all the hoarding.

But you really can't keep bringing it up with your SO because you can only punish someone for so long about it. And you cant really talk about it with friends or family because they will never forgive them. I would just give her time to feel what she's feeling and MOST importantly be open to talk about it with her when she needs to talk about it.

c2mrxy37	My problem is not that she told her child.   My problem is that, during the 72 hours this ADULT knew she was pregnant, she hyped the pregnancy up to her CHILD so much that when mom got her period, child was devastated.   Then, during and after the miscarriage, the ADULT spent so much time and energy explaining to the CHILD that a baby died that the child‚Äôs reaction to a subsequent pregnancy was not excitement but actual terror.   You didn‚Äôt see the video, you don‚Äôt know the kid in question, I do. If your child is reacting to happy family news with a look of terror on her face ‚Äì as if someone had threatened violence against her ‚Äì you did a poor job of maintaining boundaries.   She brought her kid in on her own grief. In no way did any decision along the way benefit the child. In no way did hyping the small child up to be a big sister benefit the child. It was a developmentally inappropriate approach, both in the child‚Äôs age (6 year old does not need to know ins and outs of mom‚Äôs menstrual cycle), and in terms of the pregnancy (3 days of pregnancy is not an appropriate length of time to be pregnant before immersing child in mom‚Äôs pregnancy; discussion of the pregnancy should be for the child‚Äôs benefit, not an outlet for the mom‚Äôs excitement).	1642793671.0	htn0irm	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htmwjbs	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htn0irm/

This vaccine was well documented, there‚Äôs plenty of info on the cdc website but they‚Äôd rather listen to sketchy sources and rumors than go out and find the actual ingredients list.     Aka, they are acting in bad faith, they know exactly what vaccines are, and are only doing acting ignorant now to be oppositional.

9h0iay4a	Dude, I can empathize!   My parents fell into the right wingnut conspiracy hole too. We had to stop talking sometime within Trumps first year in office, and I hadn't spoken to them since until I found out my dad was in the hospital with sepsis from a surgical infection that almost took him down, from someone on FB of all places. I have since learned that my mom also got Covid not long after and was hospitalized and ended up having a stroke. She survived, but the stroke meant they had to leave the farm and move to town...which they also didn't tell me... My STILL Antivaxxer mom asked two days ago if My family & I could come out and help with final clean up of the property... I said yes, but given that my siblings and entire families currently have Covid, we would all need to wear masks and practice proper distancing..  They choose "Their Freedoms" instead and I had to call it off. They said I Am "still shrouded in bitterness and mind control"...   I just fucking give up.	1642794730.0	htn3gzn	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htmz28m	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htn3gzn/

7as398wo	I grew up in old Airforce flats as a young child - those horrible things would get everywhere. Had an open packet of raisins that I left next to the microwave and when I came back to it and poured it into my hand - one carried on running. Took me years to eat them again and I still pour them on a plate, stare at them with suspicion before eating them one by one.

106wg9	First: please don't ever put yourself down for being dark.  There's no world in which that makes sense. You're just talking in racism from others, which is not healthy, not is it based in reality. Being dark doesn't equal ugly.  If your husband thought you weren't attractive enough, he shouldn't have married you. Or at least, he should have made it clear that he wants an open marriage.  I am a white man who can at times be pickier about appearance than I'd like to admit. But the truth is, I sometimes find people incredibly attractive and others are like "if you say so...". My point is that beauty is incredibly subjective. You deserve someone who appreciates you for you. Also keep in mind that Jay z cheated on Beyonce. It wasn't because Beyonce isn't good enough. It's because Jay z is an ass. Him cheating on you says absolutely nothing about your appearance.	1642794766.0	htn3koy	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htn3koy/

7z6j8	I agree with you, women with large breasts get more attention than those that don't have them.   But, who cares? That doesn't necessarily mean small breasted women get no attention? I'm sure you can find ways to get attention by showing your body off in elaborate and creative ways - if you don't feel like you can, I have experienced that 9 months of lifting in the gym can change the shape of one's body, enough to make them more attractive than previously, even if it's not centralized on "big boobs." Well toned bodies are attractive too.   Sometimes a person's mind and personality are more attractive than their "voluptuous" body so to speak.   If it bothers you that much, my recommendation is save up for a boob job.   I hardly doubt though that will make you satisfied. You should look for someone who looks past "large boobs" and find someone that loves you for you, your body, and most importantly your mind.	1642794802.0	htn3o65	t3_s9hh1c	t3_s9hh1c	/r/offmychest/comments/s9hh1c/women_with_small_breasts_are_invisible/htn3o65/

86qhu	I think the confusion here comes from the term "compassionate leave." The employer may personally be compassionate, but that's not what the leave is about.  Mom died, and my employer (I'm in the USA, employment here is barbaric and that's probably an insult to barbarians) gave me some time off.   My employer is a large organization. Compassion is a thing a human being has, not a large organization.  My employer gave me that time off because of contract terms, and because an employee who has just suffered a significant loss tends to be rather useless anyway. Also, I'm the only close relative capable of arranging her funeral and putting her affairs in order, so I would have needed a few days off for that, but they could have made me use vacation or sick days.  Compassion, other than possibly an awareness that a certain amount of consideration will get me back to my normal effectiveness and reduce the likelihood that I'll quit and make them hire a replacement, had nothing to do with it.  Compassion on the part of my coworkers might factor into it, but not the whole organization.	1642795081.0	htn4g2e	t3_s8xqpa	t1_htl9qcd	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htn4g2e/

4t9xuupf	I get it, I feel like I speak a different language sometimes, or that I'm just bad at communicating what I mean. Ultimately its just because most people can't relate to things I've been through/are going through. Our experiences shape us, just don't let crappy experiences with people stop you from being a good person, I'm not bitter about stuff, I'm still kind. I just avoid most people unless I can't. Try to stay open, and you never know you could well meet others who you're more on a level with. Just do the things you love to do, and take good care of yourself. It's better to be alone than in bad company, and if this is one of those times then so be it.	1642795328.0	htn54my	t3_s8hk95	t1_htmkmjh	/r/offmychest/comments/s8hk95/i_strongly_dislike_everyone/htn54my/
cl94kfsp	That's the thing, I can't tell if he likes me, or of he's just using me as a placeholder girlfriend.   But also, i think my mistake is assuming things without asking. Because maybe he went in thinking this was just a casual thing but I'm over here thinking he wants to get serious soon. It's also on him, I assume. He's never brought up anything as far as what he wants. I've mentioned that I want to take things at a normal pace because I'm used to being lovebombed. But I never told him what I was looking for either. But there's been like small conversations in the beginning that made me feel like he did want something serious eventually which is why I'm confused.	1642795331.0	htn54wo	t3_s9i05n	t1_htn2qav	/r/offmychest/comments/s9i05n/i_dont_think_the_guy_im_seeing_likes_me_that_much/htn54wo/

Sometimes it may seem there's no effects but the more awareness we bring to people. The more politicians are going to hear us out and take into account. The environmentalists have to stick together and we have to keep pushing.   In the bigger picture, there's people out there denying the science and the fact the global warming actually exist. (Heck I've met people in their 50s and they really do not believe it exists) That's another thing have face but we should really go ahead and educate the uneducated. (It's not about coming off rude, it's about solving a major issue) They really do think that the earth is so big and that there isn't enough humans to impact the earth. We have to keep educating and bring more awareness because it plays a major role why this is an issue in the first place.	1642795475.0	htn5izo	t3_s8j10m	t1_htmyr39	/r/offmychest/comments/s8j10m/ten_years_a_vegetarian_not_anymore/htn5izo/

I thought the labor would be the hardest but it wasn‚Äôt. It was handing him over to the midwife and leaving the hospital without him. Longest walk I ever took.

9r6se9u7	I mean, it's hard to meet someone if you don't really go out much. Maybe you could talk to your friends about it? If one of them likes partying more that you do, they could help you get out of the house.   On the other hand, you can talk with your friend about it. You just have to tell her that you don't feel comfortable talking about him, and that it may be a good idea to set some boundaries when doing so (not talking about their sex life, or asking first, or omitting certain details, idk, whatever feels comfortable for you). It might not be the best solution, but if it makes you sad rn, it might be for the best.  And well, it's not too late for anything! You're 20! You just got out of highschool two years ago. I'm 17, and I wouldn't even think about marriage until I'm at least 25, maybe older. (let alone children, I want to wait until I'm at least 28-29, wouldn't mind waiting until my 30's honestly) And I want both of those things too.  Please remember, your life choices are yours. If you want to wait, find a guy who wants that too. It's ok to have high standards, as long as you work on yourself too, and they apply to you as well. It's not for me, but you do you.  It's ok to not have a partner. You should come first. Try to better yourself, make friends, start socializing little by little. A good partner might come along in the way, or they might not, but you will for sure be happier.  I believe in you, and I hope you find a way to get out of that toxic environment you are in, with the criticism from your parents.	1642796403.0	htn81u8	t3_s9jhgt	t3_s9jhgt	/r/offmychest/comments/s9jhgt/i_dont_want_to_hear_about_my_friends_boyfriend/htn81u8/

h2w9bty7	But I don‚Äôt understand why, in Canada at least, anyone who got an allergic reaction to the first dose is being forced to still get the second dose?   One doctor told me: ‚Äúgreat news! Those who suffered a severe allergic reaction can now go take their second dose. We will just wait 30 instead of 15min with you‚Äù  Another doctor stopped me and said: ‚Äúif you think I‚Äôm going to give you an exemption, I won‚Äôt.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even ask for an exemption or mention it, she said it out of the blue and talked to me with immense hostility that I had to report her to the clinic she works at.   Another doctor didn‚Äôt want to refer me to the allergist she spoke to the allergist on my behalf and then called back and said: ‚Äúshe says you can go ahead and take the second dose‚Äù   One specialist told me: ‚Äúalthough you had an allergic reaction from the first dose, this doesn‚Äôt stop you from getting your second shot.‚Äù   Any professional unbiased medical professional will tell you that if you are allergic to something you should NOT get exposed to it again! So I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm being asked to either risk getting another allergic reaction or be treated like an unvaccinated.  And now that I‚Äôve been treated like an unvaccinated person I can see how unfair and unethical the shame and segregation and fear and discrimination against them is.	1642796616.0	htn8n4n	t3_s9by4g	t1_htn68sm	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htn8n4n/

e3a91nzq	I was on a ship once, where a fellow officer ingratiated himself with the captain. Let's call him 'J.'  Now, I've heard a lot of people in the upper ranks say that they hate brown-nosers, but my own experience is that they really love being brown-nosed. Can't get enough of it.  Now, J would really love to fuck with people. And he knew he could get away with it, because the captain wouldn't do anything.  One day he did something to ME. Well, he did a lot of somethings to me. We were both Junior officers, the same rank. So there was some rivalry there. I guess because of his malicious personality, it appealed to him to do things to me, to say things to me. To do things to me, and then deny that he had done them. But on this occasion, it was something major. Too bad it was about 26 years ago, and I can't remember what that one thing was, amidst all of the other things he had done.  I was frustrated, and I took my complaints to the captain. I was pretty sure nothing would happen, but there's always hope, right?  I got called back to the captain's office, and she said to me: "Well, Bud, I talked to J, and he said that he didn't do it. So, you can go back to work. This is finished." Or words to that effect.  Life on a ship is different from civilian life. Not only do you have to work there all day, but you have to live there after work, too. You have to live with the same people for all of your waking hours, day in, and day out. It's a very closed environment, and life on the ship becomes your whole world. And if someone is allowed to continuously hammer away at you, for his own malicious and vicious pleasure, with no subsequent consequences, it can really decrease the emotional and mental quality of your life.  I'm not the only person he did things like this to. It got to be that he would not leave the ship unless he was in the company of someone else. Mostly, people from other departments. That's because the chance was real that someone would beat him up, and try to get away with it. You know, "It's my word against his."  I was so frustrated, and felt so miserable, that on one very dark day I told someone else, on the bridge of the ship, that if I ever found out I had only a week left to live, I would make sure that I took J out with me. In order to do the world a favor. Word got around that I had said that, and so then I was the one who was the bad guy. At least, in the eyes of the command aboard the ship.  That was one point in my life that I was totally at the end of my rope. I like to think of myself as being a decent guy, who would always do the right thing. And from this viewpoint I was totally frustrated that the captain was not impartial. That she would play favorites to such an extent. This greatly frustrated me on a moral level.  I'm retired now, but every once in awhile I think about those days aboard the ship. And it has tempered my view about people being basically good. From that point onwards, I no longer believed that.	1642796940.0	htn9jo4	t3_rx7clt	t3_rx7clt	/r/offmychest/comments/rx7clt/im_happy_my_bully_died_in_a_horrible_way/htn9jo4/

I think that's definitely honourable, and like you said - it isn't the end all and be all. New opportunies will come knocking, and you'll be ready when they do. Maybe disable that pesky doorbell the next time if you can? Hehe.  Listen, you'll do well. If you've got a friend or family member to practice with, this could be a great way to get more confident in interviews. Write down some of the more common questions you could be asked, and have them ask you the questions while you answer them. You can also try writing a document on your computer with answers to them, then when you're asked by an interviewer you will probably remember what you wrote, and this could ease things up a bit.

h2w9bty7	I have had all my vaccinations growing up and my own parents are physicians and I understand quite well how vaccines work.  But let me ask you, since we‚Äôre talking about the bigger picture, wouldn‚Äôt it be better for the prevention of the emergence of deadlier mutations and viruses for countries, like Canada who are enforcing vaccine mandates despite having 80% of its population vaccinated, to send the rest of their vaccines to countries that cn vaccinate at least their elderly population? Instead of forcing the 20% who are unvaccinated to ‚Äúroll up their sleeves‚Äù and boosting the already vaccinated, maybe there‚Äôs a better way to protect us all?   As for my own case,  when it is confirmed that I have an allergy to an ingredient in the vaccine and had to be put on max antihistamine dose for two months and take cortisteroids and other immune suppressants and still to this day (five months in) with marks on my face from the delayed skin reaction, I should never be forced to take the vaccine.	1642797202.0	htnaa6v	t3_s9by4g	t1_htn6zh5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htnaa6v/

bruze3bk	This is exactly why the majority of women would make terrible generals, engineers, CEOs and Operators. They are driven by feelings and and emotion instead of logic and reason.  Nobody cares how you feel.  Nobody cares about your struggles. Results are what matters.  The men you see are in the position because *they* made it happen. If you where not so worried about the ratio of dicks to "saggy titty"  in the room, you could vest yourself in becoming what you want.    Nobody really gives a shit about your gender if you are qualified and can do your job in the real world, even though the media would want you to believe differently.  I have worked with female engineers, IT techs, and bosses and the majority of them where substantially shittier at their jobs then their male counterparts.  Some where excellent. This is my experience.  I know your just getting your "feelings" off your chest but come on.  The world would be less fucked up and more productive if we focused on getting things done as a team and not the ratio of male to female workers and how that makes us "feel" because "feelings" don't get shit done in the real world.   Women will never take over the world because it is not in the feminine nature to be domineering and aggressive, and have a desire to compete and win at all costs. This a a general blanket statement, its true for the majority so I don't want to hear about the exception of the rule.  Men have this thing called Testosterone in exceptionally larger quantities that women.  Its part of what drives our nature.  To fight, win, and succeed. Literally, figuratively, and morally.   I am not annoyed by what you say at all.  I respect your opinion.  I believe that women have great value in this world, from being homemakers and mothers, to being a CEO and everything in between.

Leave him because he's a bloody cheat, not because you are out of your league. Know your self worth. The amount of guys I know who would love to get with a mixed race woman, so believe me it's not you. It's him, and it's the narrow minded people who think their opinion is needed to be said out loud. Ridiculous, them, not you. Love yourself. When you love yourself, you won't let these ridiculous comments sink in and hurt you, because thats what they are.

These expectations you speak of need to be questioned if they‚Äôre not grounded in logic. Am I more likely to be contagious with Covid if I‚Äôm not vaccinated? No? Then it‚Äôs none of anyone else‚Äôs business because it doesn‚Äôt impact them. All the vaccine does is reduce symptoms not transmissibility. If there was evidence that the vaccine reduced transmission then there would be a logical reason to require it for work place safety but there‚Äôs no evidence of that. The vaccine has been around for over a year and there are more cases of Covid than ever in spite of the millions of vaccinated people in the country.  Having employers coerce people by saying if you fail to do this thing we will fire you and endanger you and your family‚Äôs livelihood is literally not freedom.

Aunt, who is widow of said uncle and daughter of said grandpa, is a nurse, going through breast cancer a 2nd time, and just lost her job bc she wouldn't get the vaccine. Hell, she wasn't allowed to see her husband in ICU, until he hit the point of no return, bc she chose to not be vaccinated.

I‚Äôve never told anyone to put on a mask, and I‚Äôve never argued with anyone over the efficacy of the vaccine. Do I think people should wear a mask and be vaccinated? Yeah. Am I willing to fight a stranger in public over it? No.  On one side, you have facts, peer-reviewed studies, and data. On a more morbid note, you have many thousands of dead bodies.  On the other side, you have stupid people - or, people who are easily-led. You also have contrarians who just want the attention of being seen to go against the grain.

830etzxr	Freedoms doesn‚Äôt mean freedoms from consequences. Jobs have required vaccines and/or medical tests and clearances for decades. Being vaccinated reduces the severity of the disease which lowers the number of days off you will need to take from work making it extremely relevant to your employer. Additionally, people who are fully vaccinated ( which includes the booster) are much less likely to get it at all. Hey doesn‚Äôt mean no one who is boostered gets it but that you are much less likely to. Keep in mind that statistics and your anecdotal evidence from your friends and family have literally nothing to do with each other.   Whether you like it or not it does impact your employer and employers absolutely have the right to make it a mandate. Public health should be everyone‚Äôs priority.	1642798136.0	htncw39	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnbkf3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htncw39/
brhtfm3z	I‚Äôm 51 years old and my first, and last, sexual encounter with a woman was 23 years ago at 28.  I‚Äôve accepted that I‚Äôll never meet anyone and that I‚Äôll ultimately die alone.  My family line will likely end when that happens as well.  So I know what you‚Äôre going through OP but ending it is, as the cliche goes, a long term solution to a short term problem.  You‚Äôre luckier than me really because you‚Äôre actually dating someone.  That‚Äôs never happened for me.  But, much like me, it sounds like you have this perfect ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù in your head about what your first proper partner should be and you need to get out of that headspace.  I always used to think it would be a single woman with no kids and we‚Äôd be like those ‚Äúcool‚Äù couples in the movies who never act our age and go to all the cool gigs and stuff like that, even though it was never going to happen because the vast majority of women in the age bracket I was would have kids or would have had multiple relationships as well.  I‚Äôd essentially have to be taught how to be in a relationship and be the stereotypical ‚Äúproject‚Äù for the person I might meet and that in itself would probably also be a red flag.  So I do know how you feel because I‚Äôve been there.  But, as I said, dying isn‚Äôt the answer.    It‚Äôs a cliche, again, but there‚Äôs a world of opportunity out there to exploit.  You can disappear from your current life, move somewhere else and completely reinvent yourself.  Start a business and get rich.  Start a YouTube channel and get famous.   You can have a full life without a partner.  And the older you (hopefully) get, the more you might appreciate the reality of the dating scene and the women you might meet and you might be far more prepared to be with someone regardless of if she‚Äôs been with 10 guys or just 1.  I was never taught about dating or relationships growing up so you already have an advantage.  I don‚Äôt know you but I can only hope you do make it past your next birthday and move on with your life and find some happiness.	1642798139.0	htncwfk	t3_s9k29d	t3_s9k29d	/r/offmychest/comments/s9k29d/i_m23_plan_on_ending_my_life_on_my_24th_birthday/htncwfk/

bruze3bk	Dude, apps like tinder are fucking lame.  If you really want to do the whole online dating thing, look into eHarmony.  When I had it (2010-2011) I had plenty of matches.  They where all women who where looking for something more serious than just a fling or sex.  It was geared more towards long term relationships based off of compatibility.   I am 33 now, married and have children.  I honestly feel bad for young single men these days, what a shit show it seems like for yall.  Don't get down on yourself though.   Maybe you can start cold approaching women in a non creepy way.  The Library, grocery store and clothing stores are great for that.  You have a reason to be there and it is not so creepy.

4fs3bl71	We went from HIPPA your medical life is private to show this vaccine passport or fuck your right to earn a living. That is not the way.   There are alternatives. You can say ok well if you need sick leave for Covid then it‚Äôs unpaid for example. Your deductible in insurance is higher for Covid illness if you‚Äôre not vaccinated. Plenty of ways to handle this.  This ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mean freedom from consequences‚Äù argument is such a cliche. And it just keeps getting repeated as freedom gets reduced.  Maybe some day you‚Äôll understand but the way this country has set about demonizing people for their choices and having zero empathy for people making that choice, reducing their humanity, is absolutely scary. This shit has happened before and it doesn‚Äôt go to good places. You shouldn‚Äôt look at people so simplistically. There is nuance to the argument. I‚Äôm not using anecdotes. I‚Äôm referencing real data. Look at Covid cases over time. Do they go down after the vaccine entered the ballgame? No. People are just accepting too much at face value and now it‚Äôs all ideology. You‚Äôre either vaccinated or a fucking idiot. This is how people look at each other now. It‚Äôs disgusting and it‚Äôs dangerous.	1642798549.0	htne1l9	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htncw39	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htne1l9/

In my first marriage we had 2 miscarriages, and 1 still birth at 6 months.  We had two kids that survived, and when I went to grieve counseling for the miscarriage, I was a little judgy about the miscarriages, until someone talked about their SID, their baby died a couple of days old.  I was shamed for discounting the grief of the other parents, until I realized that loss is loss, it's up to the person to grieve, and I try not to judge.	1642798630.0	htne9oe	t3_s8xqpa	t3_s8xqpa	/r/offmychest/comments/s8xqpa/im_tired_of_miscarriage_moms/htne9oe/

The idea that Dump and his COVID denying cronies are not in prison, when they are DIRECTLY responsible for the misinformation that brought us to today astounds me. 100s of 1000s of people are dead for NO reason because some shit for brains was allowed a platform for their lies.

But the fact that they refused something to make their son‚Äôs life safer-it was at that moment I lost all respect for them.

58c9gafc	I think there‚Äôs a bit of a lost message here. A vaccine reduces the symptoms hence reducing the contagion e.g coughing less. There have been more variations of covid which has kept the transmission high.   Unfortunately the way we live as a society it is our business to keep you healthy or you can‚Äôt part take. While I do agree you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to take what you don‚Äôt want to. I think that if everyone didn‚Äôt take the vaccine it would be a different place and probably would have killed off most of the world by now. Instead of shouting about how you don‚Äôt want to take it. Celebrate someone who has as they‚Äôve probably saved quite a few people you know even you.   Keep save. Take the vaccine.	1642799493.0	htngotb	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnbkf3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htngotb/

Pregnancies are dangerous and permanently alter many women's bodies in ways they deal with for the rest of their lives, not to mention the extraordinary financial burdens of the medical costs and raising a fucking child, all for the sake of one embryo or fetus.  A vaccine is of nominal risk, as compared to the significant risk of the well-being of the unvaccinated person and EVERYONE AROUND THEM.  Acting like the risks for granting absolute physical autonomy in both contexts are at all on the same level is incredibly absurd.	1642799515.0	htngr2k	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnce43	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htngr2k/

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the world we should be going for.  It's not a "personal decision."

You're right to make personal choices ends where your personal choices endanger immunocompromised people, cancer victims, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations. We are where we are now because your team endlessly screeches about personal choice and personal freedoms.    Things you are also not free to do even though you technically can:    Drive on the wrong side of the road. Scream "fire" in a crowded building. Drive without a seatbelt. Perform surgery when you aren't a surgeon.    *None of those things is a personal freedom.*    This is not about your belief in your immune system, your belief in your good health or your annoyance about wearing masks. It's about keeping *other* people safe who need these protections. It's not about your interpretation of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.

z73pex5	Sounds pretty close to my childhood. We DO make our realities to an extent. My grandpa, long time ago before he died, said ‚ÄúYou are what you think‚Äù and ‚ÄúThis world is what you make it.‚Äù   It‚Äôs hard to consider either of these when you‚Äôre high. You have no way to apply them when you‚Äôre high, not positively anyway‚Ä¶ but you do negatively. When we are high/drunk because of a shitty past, we don‚Äôt really numb anything like maybe we think we are. Those thoughts come anyway. You relive abuses you‚Äôre trying to forget, you reinforce negative feelings about yourself, and it all becomes a loop; you feel like shit so you get drunk/high. While drunk/high you relive those things that bother you, maybe tell yourself you deserved it so you get more drunk/more high and at some point you sober up. You think about the fact that you got lit and you feel like shit about that‚Ä¶ and start the cycle all over again.   In this way, you‚Äôve created your negative reality. But once you break that addiction cycle, you can see clearly and, with a therapist, learn more positive ways to cope with your past and even find peace with it. With a clear head, you can climb out of that dark pit you‚Äôre in.   Good luck and please don‚Äôt kill yourself.	1642799759.0	htnhfh4	t3_s9hj05	t3_s9hj05	/r/offmychest/comments/s9hj05/needs_love/htnhfh4/

Again we are seeing higher cases than ever and more people are vaccinated than ever. Why is that? It isn‚Äôt logical to suggest more people vaccinated means the virus transmission is reduced just based on that evidence.   People seem to have forgotten all about early 20th century history and seem of the impression we can‚Äôt get there again. Freedom should be valued and protected. It‚Äôs much harder to get freedom back than it is to retain it. But this whole cycle has manipulated people into thinking these freedom restrictions are acceptable.

8v89j	> It's amazing to see the same people saying women should not have the right to their own body are the same people saying they should have rights to their own body against the masks and vaccine mandates.    It's the same logic by which restaurants are banned from permitting smoking, but can freely serve junk food. Somebody else's smoke goes into my body whether I want it to or not. But if they order a huge steak meal and top it off with a gigantic dessert, it's not like the calories and cholesterol goes into me.   If a woman gets pregnant, that does not make you pregnant. If a woman takes birth control, or has an abortion, this has no effect on your uterus.   If someone refuses a vaccine, this continues the spread of a disease which is affecting everybody. Even other vaccinated people can still get the Omicron variant and be knocked on their ass for a week or so. Immune compromised people and children under the age of 5 should not be exposed at all.   To be fair, getting vaccinated is not the only thing people should be doing to avoid spreading COVID; people also need to avoid risky behavior such as being unmasked in medium to large groups indoors, and should remain quarantined if exposed until they can get tested.	1642799776.0	htnhh37	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnce43	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnhh37/

34e19	> The pandemic did not cause the hatred and division. The pandemic could have alleviated the tensions and division in America as it could have brought people together to help others stay healthy. But no. A group of politicians made it out to be all a hoax and used it as fuel to further create division between people and the opposing political party. Even though some in that group have gone back on what they have said, the damage is done and the people are still divided.  This is crucial.  We were at a point of heavy division between parties *already*; the GOP thrives off disharmony, it's just become their bread and butter over the last couple of decades in particular. The reason we're in this mess is largely because some people decided to use a pandemic to try and gain more power, and, well, not to go all Star Wars on everyone but once you start down that path it really does dominate your destiny.

He even got a fake vaccine card and still chooses to be an ass about masks and social distancing when someone asks him. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this, and for our sake I hope whatever is possessing our parents will leave before the virus takes shop inside them.   As it stands, my parents keep on Real America‚Äôs Voice 24/7 - I‚Äôm watching news reporters tacitly encourage taking things like ivermectin while simultaneously creating fear about the vaccine. I think it‚Äôs on the hook - alongside Fox and OAN - for the vast majority of misinformation that takes our parents hold. Joe Rogan, too, has started to turn the heads of my parents, subscribing to the idea that, since he looks good, he knows about health.   I went and got my booster secretly to avoid toxic conversations about my health - concerns that the vaccine is vastly more dangerous than the virus to my age group, and such.

I understand they reduce symptoms.   But the question I am asking anyone to answer is pretty straightforward - why is it that we have more cases of Covid than ever when there are more people vaccinated than ever? If the vaccine is about reducing transmission, logically would the results be opposite? More people vaccinated resulting in lower cases than ever?   You see this is a simple logical question. You‚Äôre ignoring it in favor of this ideology, and treating me like I‚Äôm some anti vaccine q anon trump supporting hick.  If you‚Äôre interested in facts then how do you explain the fact that more cases of Covid are now reported than ever when the vaccine allegedly reduces transmission?

I was incredibly lucky to be in a position where I could take or leave ventilation, I chose to fight on my own, and was still bedridden for 3 months after surviving and was very lucky to be able to do so.  I needed 100% oxygen, plus nebs every 15 minutes as well as water vapour in my air.  They put an arterial tap in (that hurts like f\*\*k btw) and took blood gas every 10 minutes. I had to be bed-bathed by a nurse (she was amazing) and urination was handled via a bed-pan.  I couldn't eat at all due to my airways.  I had five different drips and injections of god-only-knows into my stomach.  There is no such thing as dignity in ICU.  You had better believe I'll take every Vaxx coming my way!

3ncm8t9v	To me it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdebate.‚Äù You can‚Äôt ‚Äúdebate‚Äù facts really. You can debate opinions. For me the issue has nothing to do with politics actually, it has to do with disillusionment with my fellow man.   You can find images of people in 1918 wearing masks in public. We have the internet and so much more information and knowledge and research.   Has humanity learned nothing in the last 100 years? EVEN now that information is so much more available?  It seems not. So what does that mean? Are we just super slow to collectively evolve? Or maybe it has something to do with human nature?   Or is this more about power, i.e politicians/corporate entities using our ignorance to control us? Or what?   Maybe it‚Äôs all of it. So, I‚Äôm trying to think bigger than individuals. But it‚Äôs so goddamn hard when people‚Äôs ignorance impedes your own freedom.   Now that I think about it, maybe we all sort of agree in terms of what‚Äôs at stake. Should we impede someone else‚Äôs choice if it means less people will die? OR is willfully endangering someone by not wearing a mask impeding someone else from living a long, health life?   Seriously, fuck the anti-maskers tho. No one has the right to endanger the life of another person.	1642800679.0	htnjzlb	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htnjzlb/

dn0ihp	Absolutely no one is entitled to know your medical history. Vaccinations are records that are shared for all sorts of reasons. Employment and education are the two big ones. If you can‚Äôt demonstrate that you‚Äôve been properly vaccinated against potentially deadly or debilitating, highly contagious illnesses, you‚Äôre not entitled to a job. That‚Äôs not the same as an employer being privy to your personal medical history.	1642800751.0	htnk6q1	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnhigg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnk6q1/
6yprpudu	Just because you believe that gay relationships cannot have the same type of love that straight relationships do doesn‚Äôt mean that love doesn‚Äôt exist.  It just means you are blinded by your hatred and bigotry, and you are keeping yourself from seeing love that has been experienced for decades, often in secret.  You are incredibly wrong on so many levels and your opinions about biology are wrong too.  Same sex relationships can be found in every part of the Animal Kingdom and the only ones that have a problem with it are humans.  Also, there are species other than human that have the ability to change their sex.    I think you need to really open up your mind and take an honest look at the LGBTQIA+ community.  Especially if you have kids one day and one of them decides to come out to you.  Additionally, marriage is no longer sacred, especially when straight people constantly get divorced for money and women treat their wedding day like it‚Äôs a huge celebration of themselves with destination weddings, fake tans, 10 bridesmaids, 20 clothing changes, and then less than 5 years later, they have a divorce party.   Marriage has lost any meaning of devotion because heterosexuals have cheapened it over the years.  The people I find that truly do not take it for granted are the ones who worked hard to make it legal for them in the first place so that they could legally have benefits after their long term partners died.	1642800763.0	htnk7x6	t3_s8yact	t3_s8yact	/r/offmychest/comments/s8yact/i_f28_will_always_believe_that_marriage_is/htnk7x6/

They think vaccines are a scam to make money for the vaccine manufacturers, and they refuse to admit that all the anti-vax gurus have a financial stake in the anti-vax movement.

8v89j	Do you live in the U.S.?   If not, let me explain. Not all jobs provide health insurance. Part time jobs almost never provide health insurance, and neither is it affordable given the typical pay for the kinds of jobs available to someone with only a HS diploma.   Holding down a full time job, which is the kind of job most likely to provide health insurance, would put OP's scholarship at risk as they probably need to maintain a certain GPA, despite now having 40+ fewer hours per week to study. OP may easily find it difficult to impossible to take the classes they need due to the working hours of this full time job.   So, TL;DR: Thanks to his stupid, pig headed father's decision, in order to get health insurance, OP would have to quit school and finding a full time job with benefits, which due to their lack of a college education, would be low paying. OP would have a challenge paying the rent and living expenses on the likely pay of this job, much less the extra cost of the health insurance, because jobs that offer health insurance just subsidize it, if you're lucky; only rarely it is completely paid for, especially in the kinds of shitty entry level jobs that OP would qualify for with only a HS diploma.    Or, OP can complete their education, which gives them a better chance (not an assurance, just a better chance) at getting the kind of job that does offer health insurance and a living wage, but then they would have to do this with the distraction of crippling depression and constant suicidal ideation.   Does that clarify anything?	1642801108.0	htnl6s0	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htn05wy	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnl6s0/

1novx2a2	Not that I know of, that's something I'd definitely ask a doctor about. Even if the doctor says no, I guess it's still possible. But children and babies tend to get a lot of different vaccines around the same time, right? I'd think if it were really dangerous for your immune system, less people would live past their childhood years.  I'm actually a person with multiple sensitivities so I completely understand how angry the vaccine must have made you. I feel that way towards antidepressants for the same reason. I had to learn after a while that, while doctors want what's best for your health and they truly are the best source of health info, they can only know so much about YOUR body in particular. So while they mean well, a lot of them seem to not realize that YOU are more aware of how your body reacts to things than they are in some cases. They usually think of it as you just "being anxious" and "since it doesn't make sense to them for this to be harmful, it probably isn't".   The funny thing about medicine is that it's considered a science, when it should actually be considered more of a mix of science and art. Because there are standards for everything, but our bodied individually are different. Your reaction to the vaccine was unique. It's probably hard to accept because it was so severe, but most other people truly are not being harmed by the vaccine nearly to the same extent that you were. So even though you feel like you're doing the right thing by warning people about things they may not have considered about the vaccine, you could still be doing more harm than good. The same way doctors think they're doing the right thing by trying to convince you to still take the vaccine.	1642801649.0	htnmoav	t3_s9by4g	t1_htne3gr	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htnmoav/

7rwd1kxp	1. If you want to be scientific here‚Äôs some science: the vaccine has side effects. Yes, rare. But they exist.  2. People have the right to measure the risks of the vaccine vs. the risks of the virus and act according what they see fit. If what they see fit is ‚Äúunscientific‚Äù, does that make them less human? People believe all unscientific things - astrology, for ex. - and we don‚Äôt get a free pass for dehumanizing them because of it. ‚ÄúOh but they are putting publich health in danger‚Äù, how so? The vaccine does not stop transmission. In fact I know a couple of cases of vaccinated people being the source of infection for unvaccinated people. If unvaccinated people are the ones with more severe symptoms, then maybe we should prohibit vaccinated people from entering places, no? They are the ones putting unvaccinated at risk.

Additionally mask mandates have ended in most places and schools are almost all back in person and social distancing is much less observed then during the original lockdown.

I am a white woman who is entirely unqualified to speak to the experiences black women have while seeking healthcare, but anyone denying that anti-blackness and misogyny combined make a deadly combination has never stepped out of their privileged bubble even to listen to someone else.   The bias runs so deep, I think people without firsthand experience find it easy to brush off. Medical papers and studies rarely include women at all, and certainly rarely include black women. It‚Äôs a serious problem that needs to be addressed and I am so sorry that you‚Äôve had to experience multiple instances of medical racism and misogyny.	1642802616.0	htnpbv6	t3_s97a33	t3_s97a33	/r/offmychest/comments/s97a33/angry_and_tired_of_how_the_healthcare_system/htnpbv6/

I'm sorry for you and your family but weekly tests should have been an opportunity for your father. If they're going to go by the CDC's recommendations then that's what it should have been. If you want to get the vaccine, fine. But it should work both ways. Despite the rarity in severe side effects, maybe I don't want to roll the dice - and I have every right now to.

2jj3au38	This is my view on ugliness. You may think you are ugly. And maybe by some standards you are ugly. But to some people, the ones that see you and actually know you for who you really are, they don‚Äôt see ugliness, they see smiles, and quirks, and the good in you, they see when you get excited about something, they see when you are passionate about your hobbies, when your favorite song comes up, when it‚Äôs time to watch your favorite shows and movies. They don‚Äôt get fixated on your skin color or your ‚Äúflaws‚Äù they see the best in you and vice verse. You need to change your mentality about how you see things. If some handsome guy loves you for who you really are, let them love you. That just goes to show what an amazing human being you must be.  Lift up your chin and focus on other issues instead of looks.  Life is short.

She lives with her son (on military deployment) and DIL, young granddaughter and her disabled late 20s daughter.  None of them got vaccinated except the son on military deployment.    They all got Covid and long-term complications because of it.  She also went to work while sick and is around adolescents in her workplace.  She will never be allowed over my house if she visits from her State and I will do my best to avoid her at anyone else's house.  I shun people like this.

He isn't the partner you deserve because he is a selfish prick. YOU are the one moving up, not him. I am so sorry people have put you down for your looks and your skin. Those people have nothing to offer you but hate and are not worth your time. Their words aren't worth the value you have given them.  I've never seen you but I will bet you aren't ugly, not at all. Hateful people will put down mixed and dark-skinned women as ugly and dehumanize them as much as possible because hate is all they have. They can't make themselves prettier, so they insist other people are uglier. Hateful delusions are all these people have.  Leave this dumbass. Leave this nasty, selfish, cheater. Give to yourself the love and praise you so easily give to him. You deserve it.

And why are you with someone who tells other people you are lucky to catch him? Im sure he had red flags in the first instance. What a loser, and I feel because you don‚Äôt love yourself for who you are you accepted bad behaviour. Im single for the last 4 years out of choose and it‚Äôs the best decision I‚Äôve made. I would not sit here listening to a guy telling me that im lucky mate‚Ä¶. You are the lucky one and you should be feeling you are the lucky one and vice versa. You said you have money? Divorce that man and you would meet someone who worships the ground you walk on‚Ä¶ but before that you need to love yourself and accept yourself.. if you can‚Äôt love yourself who else would truly love you and how can you love?

z73pex5	Yeah. But two kids deciding to check each other out isn‚Äôt illegal. It‚Äôs like this: if you were 8 and your sister and you were caught doing this, they‚Äôd likely not take you to jail because you don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on at that age. They‚Äôd probably make your parents explain how we don‚Äôt do that to each other.   When you were older, it‚Äôs a similar situation. The difference was there was potential for things to go much further and you still, probably wouldn‚Äôt go to jail for it. You‚Äôre 20 now. The only way this could come back to haunt you is socially, and only that because people are assholes.

5v9wd9zk	If it was a typical job, then yes it makes sense to not have it as required. However it is a government job. Government jobs require you to be up to date with basically all of the vaccinations. If they included COVID then they included COVID for a reason.  It is the governments business when you work directly for them. Depending on what level you are in working with them then you no longer have the freedom of a regular citizen.  My brother in law can‚Äôt travel to most countries now that he works for the government.    You make the decision for working directly for the government.

rte85s2	You‚Äôve obviously fallen down the conspiracy mineshaft, your information and ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô is completely wrong. Yes, vaccinated people can get Covid. However the vaccination means people are less likely to be symptomatic and therefore less likely to pass it onto others, and they are far less likely to die from it. You really need to get some stats from proper sources which clearly show that vaccinations work. Our hospitals are filled with unvaccinated people, those vaccinated are able to recover from Covid at home aside from those who have other health issues, so the vast majority in hospital are the unvaccinated. There is no reason for governments across the world to invest in something that is pointless, and those who aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated are selfish, privileged and benefitting from those who have gotten vaccinated.	1642803969.0	htnsz2z	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htngvua	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnsz2z/

bwikojkt	I've been there, and around the same time in our relationship. It takes a lot of looking inward and deciding who you really are, what your want, and what you see in your future.  There was a time I wasn't sure if I really loved my husband Bernie we got married. I didn't know if I was still with him because we had been together so long (7 years) and he was easy, or if I was with him because I really wanted to be. I never told him about this because I didn't rant to hurt his feelings. I thought long and hard, literally months, about what it was I really wanted, and if I really wanted him to be a part of it. Ultimately I decided yes. I couldn't ever imagine a scenario where he wasn't part of my life in the future. The thought of losing him was so painful. I really couldn't imagine life without him. That's when I realized that I really loved him deeply.    Now you may not come to that same decision. You may realize that they're not the one you want in your future. That you're too different now and you haven't grown into be people together. I think that has a lot to do with couples staying together so long. They grew up, and old, together. Sometimes as we grow we end up growing apart. It's just a fact if life that can occur. I'm not sure if any of this is really helpful to you, but I hope whatever the outcome is for you it's whatever you want.	1642804683.0	htnuv8k	t3_s9mn92	t3_s9mn92	/r/offmychest/comments/s9mn92/i_think_im_falling_out_of_love_and_im_scared/htnuv8k/

It feels nice to wake up and not want to die and to be able to get out of bed and do something. Even if it‚Äôs only 1 thing. They‚Äôre definitely not a cure but a big tool that made me functional. Not everyone responds well to certain antidepressants so if your current ones don‚Äôt seem to be helping in a few months, try a different kind.

8xd96y	I've read a lot of the comments on here and there is one main theme. You are not ugly and you deserve better. But I understand that you are thinking to yourself, "They don't understand. They haven't seen me. They don't know me or my husband."  The problem with this way of thinking is people that have been emotionally beaten down think like this. Your thought process is one of a person who has had their self esteem slowly ripped away one small insult, one emotional cruelty, one heartbreak at a time.     .  You think others don't understand when in fact (hopefully one day with counseling you will realize this) you are the one who doesn't understand. You have been made to not understand. I read one comment that suggested that your husband speaks poorly of you to others causing them to react the way they do. And that may or may not be the case. But it does seem that your husband has made you feel so worthless that it has impacted your personality. You are probably not the lovely happy person you once were before he started cheating and hurting you on a regular basis.      I believe that if people you meet are making comments like that and you know that your husband has not been making remarks to them behind your back (and it takes very little to make people think they know what someone is like when a friend or coworker (you husband) of theirs tells them how much of a burden or downer you are beforehand) the fact that he has stolen your light is probably what they are reacting to. You are not as bright as you once were. You are not as vibrant as you once were. That is his fault. I'm so sorry. I hope that you find yourself again. I hope you learn to love yourself. He has taken that from you and imo that makes him a pretty horrible person.	1642805028.0	htnvs8b	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htnvs8b/

16e01cc	That's the effect of years of misinformation being allowed to fester, though. Networks like Fox and the farther right ones have been allowed to sow distrust in the government, in experts, in the medical industry as a whole, and we're seeing the effects of that now. If y'reprimed to distrust anyone smarter than a fifth grader, you're going to ignore any professional out of hand. Then, when people act on the human nature to want to be in on secrets and insist that the people they already don't trust are hiding things, it spirals.  If people weren't already told to distrust liberals, that liberals are trying to harm them, that higher education is liberal reeducation pits, and that the government is looking to personally punish them, they wouldn't believe this latest brand of misinformation.  On top of that, it's primarily the kind of people who won't admit when they're wrong. Boomers, cishet dudes, the right, undereducated folks, people who believe in alternative medicine, etc.	1642805529.0	htnx48b	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnaosm	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htnx48b/

Lots of anticipatory grief and lots of guilt with not ever doing enough. I‚Äôm glad to hear that you are in Zoloft, that helps some. Although it took a good 6-8 weeks for me. Don‚Äôt hesitate to tell your therapist / doctor that it‚Äôs not quite enough to help. After I gave birth, I also took ativan in combination of Zoloft and it was helpful. Home is more comfortable place to be rather the the hospital. We also waited too long to ask for hospice care (mainly because of the finality of it I think) but it‚Äôs really wonderful and takes much of the burden off the family to keep your dad comfortable.

pdpyh	I see your point when it relates to the present.  The lines of code today can't compare to the living complexity of a brain or metabolism, And you've seen this through your experience as a programmer.  But have you ever programmed on a quantum computer? Have you ever looked inside a black hole?  Have you ever interacted with a machine powered by exotic materials not found in this earth?        I think these kinds of futuristic technologies will have a place in our universe.  And this tiny obscure religion will grow.  And no doubt people will find that the reality is they can create to be far superior to the one present.  And even though underneath it all its line of code, they wont don't see a difference.         It doesn't have to be a dark future.  Perhaps an ocean of humans losing sight of the wonders of the real world and choosing to integrate with technology instead, might seem scary to us the fossils of the 21st Century,   but I think they will have a different approach in their age.  Humans losing touch with their Humanity sounds like a Big Loss.  But maybe but they'll find  something else instead in their Virtual Worlds,  that will eclipse the wonders of our souls, or our heartbeat powered meat machine.  Thinking like that things do seem so dystopian after all :P	1642807120.0	hto18b1	t3_s9nf5g	t3_s9nf5g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9nf5g/the_amount_of_people_who_believe_we_live_in_a/hto18b1/

zdr5t	This is actually a good point. You should learn what someone's argument is before attacking them. You need to know what point you're going to be countering. Even if you got the inkling that this is why a person wasn't getting the vaccine, you need to nail them down to that point and get them to say  it before you can tear down that argument. Otherwise if you make a good argument against that point, they'll just feel cornered and they'll evade you by accusing you of making a straw man argument. Then you look bad because it seems like you're jumping the gun, making assumptions, and not taking the time to understand their argument.	1642807282.0	hto1nf3	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnu7tq	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/hto1nf3/

69a73thb	I sense you've been through some emotional abuse in this relationship.  The gaslighting kind where you don't even realize he's doing it.  Please do go ahead and divorce him.  But go to therapy-  you should be divorcing him because he's a scumbag and YOU deserve better.    He shouldn't be cheating on you, don't let ANYONE convince you that's just normal male behavior.    Furthermore... I understand that as a black person, you've been through a lot of of social conditioning to make you believe you're less than white women.  I'm sorry for that.   Telling you that it's not true is not going to undo society's damage, I know.  But it's not true, and you need to fight it.    Therapy would help with all these issues.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it, no shame in it-  I wish we could normalize therapy for everyone, including "healthy"  people.    But it's time you talked to someone about learning your worth :)  If you address this head on, in a few years you'll realize he wasn't fit to kiss the ground you walk on. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.	1642807837.0	hto32a6	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/hto32a6/

Being black I can empathize with the mean comments, gaslighting or hypocrisy you may have endured while with him, however the first issue to tackle is your self esteem.

And he continued to do it because he knew he could get away with it. Once you realize YOU deserve better you will have a man who loves you and most importantly RESPECTS you.

Just don't get angry. It's not going to help. Especially if it's a mental health issue.

I think it shook you so much because you thought of your happiness is something that moves slowly and gradually up.  You were sad at the moment The Break-Up. you had a down time, but you got over it and thought those down times wont return. At least not for this girl I already got over       Maybe you should look at your happiness and emotions as more of a cycle. Accept this as a time like the time you broke up - a time where you're not happy and not content.  Then you'll be able to do things.  Keep doing the work, and like being in a storm - bear throw. Once the wave Settles, once your emotions subsides - you'll feel a lot better.	1642808523.0	hto4sny	t3_s9nnrv	t1_hto3soh	/r/offmychest/comments/s9nnrv/getting_over_an_old_ex/hto4sny/

And sense the virus can give no symptoms in it‚Äôs early stages it makes it impossible to tell if one is sick til it‚Äôs to late.  I had family who died from the virus I seen both sides and I came To the realization that this is a endemic a year before it was officially declared one.  I seen cases which proves the anti maskers/anti vac right and I seen cases which prove the maskers/pro vac right.  What we need to understand is no one‚Äôs actively trying to kill anyone.

4fs3bl71	I guess the point I‚Äôm getting at and what confuses me is this ‚Äî I‚Äôm vaccinated. I‚Äôm sure you are too. Even being vaccinated we still have the potential to catch and transmit the virus.  So if you‚Äôre vaccinated you can transmit the virus. If you‚Äôre not vaccinated you can transmit the virus.  So with that in mind, why should a person have their livelihood threatened for not being vaccinated?  I‚Äôve received some good responses such as public sector jobs are subject to different rules and I suppose that is true. But I wonder why people are so eager to support this idea that unvaccinated people deserve to lose their jobs when you have potential to spread the virus regardless.	1642808855.0	hto5mn3	t3_s9gzx4	t1_hto2cfo	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/hto5mn3/

Unfortunately, resentments will eat you alive. Like drinking poison in the hopes that you‚Äôll harm the one you‚Äôre angry at. So my suggestion would be to work on moving past those feelings as they will ultimately only prove to hurt you. As far as these feelings of jealousy, it sounds to me like both of you are doing really well. Even if he‚Äôs found more success than you at this point, that doesn‚Äôt take away from everything you have going on for yourself. I‚Äôve found that focusing on how much worse things could be has really taught me to have gratitude for what I do have. I remind myself daily that even though I‚Äôve faced some horrible challenges‚Ä¶..I‚Äôm alive, I have a roof over my head & food in my kitchen, and people I love. It could always be worse.

72j6tgvr	OP, you are awsome and you are the voice of moderates who want to tell both sides to shove it. I was in the service and recieved the anthrax vaccine which has been on the market for years and really mess me up for months. My mom was retention in the military and she re-enlisted a soldier who completely lost his immune system because of the anthrax vaccine and was being medically discharged but needed the extention so the paperwork could go through. I got my vid vaccine then still got the vid but I have no respect for anyone pushing personnel choices. Why the fuck does it matter if I don't get vaccinated if your already covered. If your system is compromised then personnel safety is just that. Self preservation is a fundamental of being a human and if you are venerable hide your kids, hide your wife because rona raping everyone out here. The amount of dogma and shitting on personnel choice makes me wonder why do people serve people that want their corner of the world mandated instead of liberated which is the whole point of what I thought was the best brand going called democracy.	1642810129.0	hto8s3e	t3_s9by4g	t3_s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/hto8s3e/

4yxti6qx	I am, and boosted too because I have asthma and am at risk for being immunocompromised. Like you covered, government jobs are very strict about who‚Äôs allowed to work for them. And then we also have many states where at-will employment is a thing (something proposed by republicans and now is hated by republicans because they‚Äôre getting fired for not listening to their bosses). But you asked about the risk, not necessarily the reason for being fired.  When someone‚Äôs vaccinated, their immune system is hard at work attacking any potential invaders it‚Äôs aware of. Vaccinated individuals, because of the level of ‚Äúeducation‚Äù their immune system has, are significantly less likely to have high viral loads, which makes it harder to pass on the virus, and if they do manage to pass it on, there‚Äôs less of a viral load for the recipient to have to deal with. Great if you‚Äôre vaccinated, because you‚Äôll likely be asymptomatic due to a fast immune response to a low viral load. Better but not perfect for unvaccinated individuals, because if left unchecked by an unaware immune system, the virus will multiply quickly. Significantly more deadly for immunocompromised folks that were unable to get a vaccine, as their immune response is crappy at best. Best possible outcome, the virus was stopped in its tracks in the vaccinated individual before it could affect the immunocompromised unvaccinated person.  Choosing to not get vaccinated is selfish if you‚Äôre capable of getting it. We are a society, we‚Äôre supposed to come together and help one another in times of struggle. Choosing to not get vaccinated puts the health and wellbeing of other people at risk. People say ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù for vaccination, but they also forget that other people didn‚Äôt consent to being infected by a virus that‚Äôs capable of being quite deadly. If you choose not to vaccinate, then you need to accept the consequences of your actions.   You absolutely have the freedom to choose what you put in your body, but you *do not* have the freedom to harm other people with your choices. Freedom doesn‚Äôt mean immunity from consequences. And if that means getting fired because your refusal to do something is capable of hurting other people, then that‚Äôs the consequences of your actions. People have been fired for less‚Ä¶at least now it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a matter of public health and safety, of which I believe is an acceptable reason.	1642810246.0	hto926c	t3_s9gzx4	t1_hto5mn3	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/hto926c/

They're all assholes who are projecting their own insecurities on others to make themselves feel better. Your husband? He's a cheater. He is a piece of shit for that, especially when you have been there for him.  You know, I am very happy for you getting out of there. But don't think of it as leaving for HIM or society. Fuck them both. You're leaving for you! Because you're a beautiful person who deserves all the happiness in the world. This is an opportunity for you to love yourself and eventually find someone who loves you for who you are (if you want). Your ex husband does not reflect how a man is supposed to treat the woman he loves. Not even close. a man who truly loves you would never think about cheating for a second. He'd defend you, tooth and nail, if someone was rude to you in such a ridiculous manner. Hell, a man who truly loves you would lay down his life for you if he had to.

You should leave him because he‚Äôs a cheater an asshole, not because he deserves better. And I am sorry he doesn‚Äôt love you. If he did, he would‚Äôve not cheated. Let him go. You deserve much much better.	1642810912.0	htoapog	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htoapog/

When I returned I picked up the drink and took a big drink to only be surprised by a big ass, dead cockroach in my mouth. I hate cockroaches and I never leave a drink unattended if I can't see what is inside the bottle or can.	1642810994.0	htoawzb	t3_s9f844	t3_s9f844	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f844/i_love_my_husbands_phobia/htoawzb/

12or1c	This is what baffles me! I live in a smaller town (so more conservative) and used to work at the doors asking people if they had COVID symptoms.   The clinic/hospital had just enforced a vaccine mandate on all of it‚Äôs workers when I started there. If they didn‚Äôt get vaccinated by x date they would be let go. There were protests every day outside the hospital regarding the mandate and many people actually left because they didn‚Äôt want to get vaccinated.  One of the nurses was talking about how it‚Äôs a choice and yada yada and I GET IT. But YOU WORK WITH SICK PEOPLE! People who can die from this shit if they get it. Get fucking vaccinated or go find a different job.   My Mom has to go in to that particular clinic every week for blood transfusions. She has lupus and is super immunocompromised because of it.

9acb802b	I don‚Äôt understand being exhausted with life.  Seems to me that people who get exhausted with anything at all are those who don‚Äôt know what they want. They recluse from the caring because they feel they do not get as much care or love as they perceive they should get. Look, the world don‚Äôt owe anyone anything. We actually owe the world everything.  We are not entitled to anything but the world is entitled to our care and love despite us not getting any. It is a clich√© I know. But it works. It does not matter how many relationships you go into or what type of relationship it is. You will not feel love if you don‚Äôt give love. You will not feel you are cared for unless your care for others.   As for you, remember this, hurt and pain subsides. They will always come knocking at your door and fly out of your window unless you hug them and wouldn‚Äôt let go like your favorite pillow or doll. We have a saying, all these will pass. What is important is not to close yourself to other people just because you get bad experiences. Learn your lesson and move on. Maintain your self respect. It doesn‚Äôt mean you move on that you will throw yourself to other people like a doormat. Limit yourself but do not stop caring and loving. You‚Äôll see that the world will be a better place for you. I hope I am making sense to you.

erx9r8qq	I am not sure I have anything meaningful to add to this but I will try (sorry I didn't read the responses because there were so many!)  I really hear your frustrations. I was also a girl, now a woman. I read from your edit to your post that people have attacked your father in the comments. People in this era are very volatile and I know you didn't want to raise any hate towards him.  It is also to be said that he doesn't seem to be of today's world where we regard girls and women equally capable of becoming successful and going into the world on their own. It's an important lesson to any young person to look around and widen their horizons. I was 16 when I went to Spain to study. Though in my case it wasn't that my father trusted me to be OK but more like he didn't care.  It is very unfair that you are regarded as different from your father by your dad. I would be really, REALLY angry and frustrated as well. Missing out on an opportunity like that meant that you missed out on experiences that would cultivate you further in life. It's not a small deal! I so wish I had any comfort for you to not feel that sting.  All I have to offer is to say that in the future, you can maybe do what a lot of women and girls did before. When it's not just about the upset over your missed opportunity but about the big picture where so many bright girls like you are missing the opportunity. What we've done is to speak up. Tell the stories. The villain doesn't have to be your father, but the system that makes him think the way he does.  You're a bright young lass, I hope you will conquer your own life by your rules.	1642811679.0	htoclew	t3_s8y8k5	t3_s8y8k5	/r/offmychest/comments/s8y8k5/i_hate_being_a_girl/htoclew/

ankznxkm	I am so sorry for your loss. I do believe you could seek out therapy so you can live with this in a healthier way- it‚Äôs kind of beautiful that you were the love of her whole lifetime. What an honor! I hope you realize that.  Sometimes it‚Äôs just hard to understand the parts that everyone around us have been assigned: small or big but they are all important and so is yours! So I hope you are staying happy and as healthy as you can.   There is also a possibility that on top of genuine love for her, you formed a trauma bond with her. Those are really hard to work through, seeking help of a therapist or counselor might be just the thing to help you work through these memories.

5lgbim1x	It sounds like he has quite some issues that are *clearly* not your problem.  You are absolutely right that you are worthy.   I think what happened was that he slowly come back to his actual self after your relationship left the honeymoon stage. As hard as it sounds, I think it's actually better that he shows his true face before the relationship went further and/or deeper.  My ex is pretty much the same. One of the worst things about the whole thing is that he then admitted to me, according to him later because I was the best intimate partner of his life, that he created a persona for every person in his life. He *never* showed up authentically.  I dated someone who doesn't even exist.  Sure, sometimes his true self "shines" through that fake exterior, but I thought that the "healthy" him, much like your ex in the early stage of your relationship, perhaps, was real. It never was. He told me who he was and I believed it and ran for the hill.	1642811767.0	htoct80	t3_s8ji9n	t1_htlwztx	/r/offmychest/comments/s8ji9n/my_experience_with_my_ex_what_next_gaslighter/htoct80/
7f2ltpql	Hi, I found your story just recently and followed it with great interest and am so pleased for you! It definitely brings out great emotions, but also questions. Mine is did you feel *any* sort of strong *biologic* pull while spending time with them? I know you love your parents, this takes nothing away from them. But just strictly on a DNA level though, how do I say it? Did you recognize any of yourself in them? Like maybe you and your bio father have the same hands? Did you feel that you came from their DNA, or was it just like meeting two strangers that you were getting to know? I'd like to know that aspect of it, if you don't mind.   Because of my weird familial situation (out of my hands) my immediate and most of my extended family are not in my life anymore, for quite awhile now. But what's a trip for me is when I visit with a few cousins of mine, (that are in the same situation as me) I'm *always* struck with a visceral reaction of familiarity. Of certain features that I share with some of them or even the sound of their voice or way of speaking. And one of my cousins has now had some children and that always blows me away because I will recognize my eyes as they looked in childhood pics, ect. It's just *different* when I'm around blood relatives and it actually really surprised me how much it hits me that we definitely *belong* to each other for lack of a better way to describe it. It's very different from the feelings I have being around my other unrelated loved ones, no matter *how* much I love them.   I wonder if only I experience this, or do you understand this feeling? It doesn't take away from the love I feel for the other ppl in my life. But it's just a trippy feeling of well, I guess sharing biological material with someone. For me it might be different because I *was* raised with my biological family and a very large extended family, and when that got taken away from me at a somewhat early age, now seeing the few biological family that I still am able to see, it brings out a visceral reaction of happy familiarity in me. I wondered if you'd experienced that yet, or maybe it's still too soon?	1642811780.0	htocudo	t3_s9jdy5	t3_s9jdy5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9jdy5/met_my_biological_dad_for_the_first_time_ever_and/htocudo/

9cok0czl	How is it ridicules? I‚Äôm still me, I still believe and value the same things as I always did, I still loved my partner with all my heart. The only thing that changed was the label I gave myself.   Where does the deceit come from? I‚Äôve spent years trying to figure out who I am as a person, I‚Äôm still very far for having everything properly mapped out with clear labels and probably won‚Äôt ever have just the right words to summarize everything into neat little boxes. It‚Äôs unrealistic to assume someone has everything about their identity figured out and it‚Äôs ridiculous to assume you know everything about someone because dated them for awhile.  Ultimately as long as you don‚Äôt start a relationship you know will end in heartbreak because you are pretending to be something you know you‚Äôre not (ie. Knowing you are gay and dating a woman) you haven‚Äôt done anything wrong.  What I do find upsetting is it shouldn‚Äôt difficult to talk to your partner about stuff that‚Äôs bothering you, no matter if a change in your favorite color or a change in sexuality. Your long time partner has your trust and if you open up to your partner and they blow up on you that shatters trust and makes them less likely to open up in the future.   It‚Äôs confusing to me why people see coming out about a possible change to an aspect of identity as deceit and that gives them an excuse to be an ass to their loved ones. You can be shocked or angry or saddened by something and still conduct yourself with respect and love for the people around you.	1642811948.0	htod8z1	t3_s6d0vr	t1_htk3riu	/r/offmychest/comments/s6d0vr/i_apologized_for_my_sexual_orientation_today/htod8z1/

9acb802b	Get yourself into a charity or advocacy organization that will assign you overseas or elsewhere where you are unfamiliar. Sometimes you need a change in scenery, culture and people around you to change your whole perspective in life. That change can force you to do things you do not want to do that will make you better and make you forget depression. As to suicide, that is where charity or advocacy kicks in. Depression is forgotten if you feel you have a purpose in life.  Look for your interest and see what you can do to further it/them.   By the way, you cannot achieve your long term plan unless you break them down to short term plans.

gw4td9sb	I'm going through exactly the same thing right now but it's my partner who's lost his feelings of love.   It's a very difficult thing to face. What do you do when the romance is missing? Do you walk away? Many do and if that turns out to be my partner's choice,  I will respect it.  For myself?  I would stay.  Why? Because I have been uniquely blessed to have personally survived a very bad relationship and to have witnessed a very strong one that lasted nearly sixty years.    There are times when the romance won't be there.  There are times when you'll consider murder. There are times when you'll collapse at the end of the day and just be grateful for the familiarity and shared experiences.    The romance comes and goes.  Commitment makes it work.	1642812847.0	htoffvs	t3_s9mn92	t3_s9mn92	/r/offmychest/comments/s9mn92/i_think_im_falling_out_of_love_and_im_scared/htoffvs/

It‚Äôs a great place to be! You don‚Äôt have to try and you still look good, but not so good that people are hitting on you constantly and  annoying you in public. But throw in some effort and boom you‚Äôre a 10 on a good night when you want that extra punch (date nights!).   If I could offer a piece of advice, you‚Äôre only 21. The braces will come off soon and you‚Äôll figure out the attributes you like best about yourself and highlight them more. Have a favourite freckle? Darken it with some makeup. Whatever it is that will make you appreciate your uniqueness. Then go and be yourself loudly and proudly. Get involved, strengthen your values and personality, and honestly you‚Äôll see a completely different person staring back at you in the mirror by 25. And again by 30. Don‚Äôt let young angst and these weird Covid times colour the way you see yourself too harshly.	1642813525.0	htoh2aa	t3_s8n86p	t3_s8n86p	/r/offmychest/comments/s8n86p/what_people_dont_tell_you_about_being_attractive/htoh2aa/

You do not deserve to be with someone who would do something so horrible to you. You deserve someone who defends you, really loves you, and only wants you, body mind and heart. I'm so sorry and I can't imagine the turmoil you've been through, I think along with the divorce learning some self-love will help bring you back up. I don't know if you have access to therapy, but i think that would definitely benefit you in that journey.  I see you have such a broken but loving heart, don't waste it on this human garbage fire.

3uzura36	When I was 10 year old my grandmother told me: ‚Äúan attractive man (of any color or age) is going to be a cheater. Never let yourself to fall in love with one.‚Äù But I failed that wisdom.   She was a very beautiful woman‚Ä¶all men married and otherwise continuously pursued her everywhere. She used to tell me that they are like a wolf pack sit around her salivating anywhere she goes. She told me: ‚Äúmen are not worthy of ANY woman. They are filthy animals with zero self control or conscious when they see a beautiful woman they want to have sex with. They will do anything for only a chance and will wait years. They will betray those they love without a second thought‚Ä¶‚Äù and they all did. ü•∫üò¢Maybe they didn‚Äôt actually cheated having sex (because my grandma wasn‚Äôt like that) but they were ready to, they did that choice in their mind!!! Taking about an attractive guy‚Ä¶he has opportunities other men do not have. Attractive men way more rare than attractive women. He is going to use this advantage. Period.   I have seen this situation far too often. He probably indeed loves you. BUT would the loss of you be to painful to bare for him or he is going to replace you the next day?  Tell him straight forward: his cheating ruined the woman he supposedly love. Either he sacrifices ALL other future sex opportunities for the sake of love, this marriage, and true happiness he can have or you need to leave. If he promises something he can‚Äôt keep then it will be his final choice.  We are all have to make impossible choices in life. And let‚Äôs us all make the right ones.

Just being you is the most liberating feeling ever. If you dislike how people on grindr treat you or talk with you then let them know, if it doesn't stop, then you can stop.  I love clothing man. Art is my life you know? I bought a dress half a year ago and it's fucking beautiful. Does that make me anything apart from myself? Idk, not really. I'm still me, except I'm wearing a dress every now and then and looking super awesome. Recognize when you're in a state you don't want to be in and just do what it takes to get there. If you're in a skirtless state, get into a skirtfull state, you know. If you're unhappy then maybe look into other areas you can focus on, art is not just fashion, it's so so much more there's beauty around every corner. You say you wanna go back, but never go back! Go forward into something new into something better, maybe try to understand the old beauty you're longing for and ger inspired by it.

c20kys0t	When I was in my early 20s, I always had women who were 20+ yrs my senior who would be drawn to me. Women even in their 60s. Surprisingly, I never found it repulsive, in fact, to this day, I am.drawn to older women. Now as a 41M, i do have quite a few younger women who are curious about me too.   Too bad you had disdain for men my age when you were younger but luckily, i haven't come across many women who are like you were in your 20s.   I can think of many reasons you would feel this attraction to this younger guy but none of it "wierd" (to me at least lol).   The only issue I would have is the fact that you work together.

gk5839nn	I've been with my partner for nearly a decade, and this is kind of how we ended up moving in together when we did. It was sooner in our relationship even, i think about 2 years in? He point-blank told me he was going to move out with or without me, but wanted me to move with him. I didn't want him to do it without me, so even though i was super nervous and didn't know if i was ready, we moved in together. And we have been together ever since, and have lived together ever since. I will say we are having our issues now, but any long term relationship will have issues either way. My point is that you'll never feel READY for it if you think about it too much.

5aay6jzy	Ads are specifically targeted based on your online activity - things you searched online, things you interact with, things you spend time looking at more, that way they have a higher rate of succes aka you finding loads of things you are into through ads and buying it. The  offers can also cater to a specific user behaviour, such as remarketing strategies do. Let's say last week you added some things in the cart on a website and left them there without ordering. And then surprise, a few days later the same items are now on a super discount! Your brain instantly goes ahhh, now thats a great deal, and not taking it literally makes you anxious and like you're missing out an opportunity . This is the brain dance of advertising, it gets to play so deep into your thoughs that it influences your emotion and behavior, to the point where all a lot of the money you earned by hard work (where most of the average persons time and energy is spent) into useless crap that ends up forgotten in a box somewhere. Are those things equally valuable as your time and energy ? The useless mass produced break-fast buy-another type of stuff produced by companies that deliberately  push to manipulate your own thoughts to do their bidding , that contribute to pollution and the destruction of the planet, that exploit workers to gain wealth and power, and turn humans into consumers, stripping us of any other purpose than working and buying? Go to work so you can buy more, give them more money and power they will use to do harm, slave your life away, support those who are causing humanity's abandon of any greater purpose and goals than owning useless crap, all so you can get that sweet deal on your 16th pair of shoes that tears up after 3 months. Your 5th makeup palette that lies in the drawer, your cute notebooks that lie on a shelf gathering dust, the stuff you store in boxes because you never ever need it and aren't sure why you're keeping it  in the first place are literally the reasons why we are failing as a fucking species.

An ‚Äòus and them‚Äô approach maintains aggressive discussions.  Telling people that ‚Äòthey‚Äôre batshit crazy‚Äô is not ideal (even if you think it). Try empathy. Communication channels must remain open.  Additionally, consider that arguing from a scientific and factual standpoint is unlikely to impact what is mostly a value based belief.

cxvrt4s0	I really feel this.  I‚Äôm more of an extreme introvert to the point I like to spend all of my time alone when I‚Äôm not working.   In no way is this a bad thing, but I totally agree that it‚Äôs socially stigmatized as ‚Äòbeing boring.‚Äô People are always asking me what I did over the weekend and I‚Äôm like wellllll nothing? But to me, being alone and doing things by myself is fun. I feel like I don‚Äôt have to hang around and wait for people and I can just be myself.   You cannot control your default personality anymore than others can control being extroverts. Some people NEED social engagement or adventure to relax, but people like us recharge by being away from people. As an introvert, I couldn‚Äôt imagine finding going out with people to be relaxing, to me it‚Äôs stressful, hectic, and exhausting and it‚Äôs taking away from my ‚Äòme‚Äô time.   I think introversion gets mistaken with being asocial, but they aren‚Äôt the same things. It‚Äôs not that we CANT be around others, it‚Äôs just something that we find to be tiring. I find myself getting mad when I have plans with people, I have a low tolerance for conversation, and the entire time I just envision being home by myself.   Because a lot of people tend to be more extroverted or at least enjoy social engagement, it‚Äôs become the ‚Äònorm‚Äô so our lifestyle gets viewed as standoffish and weird. But it isn‚Äôt.

2xezgw4u	Is your father Libertarian? Libertarians have a strong belief in personal freedom. I'm sorry he was fired.  No one should be fired for not being vaccinated yet corporations and governments can certainly implement that requirement with some exclusion based on religious beliefs and midecal conditions. My ex-boyfriend had Guillian Barre Syndrome as a teen. He almost died. He said he won't be vaccinated, and I said I totally supported his choice and anyone's choice not to be vaccinated. I've been vaccinated early in 2021 and contracted Omicron along with my entire family. None of us went to the hospital or clinic fortunately.  COVID-19 is not going anywhere vaccine or not. It won't disappear if the entire world is vaccinated because COVID-19 persists in very large animal populations such as deer. Deer aren't affected by COVID-19 but we certainly are and humans easily come into contact with deer regularly. A wide variety of animal species have contracted COVID-19. This country and other developed nations aren't sharing or helping the entire planet be vaccinated, so what's the point of your dad and every single person in America being vaccinated when this country can't exist in a vacuum. It's far too late for that. Also, vaccinated people are contracting Omicron at record speed along with unvaccinated. This government is being completely irrational because we can't vaccinate the whole world every 6 months, let alone this entire country. COVID-19 is here to stay.	1642817440.0	htoqeqv	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htoqeqv/

14337n	My brother might be close to doing the same thing. He's a firefighter getting ready to go to Paramedic school but the hospital that his department uses for the clinicals requires the vaccine and he's refused to get it. His fire captain, or maybe it was the chief, basically said if he didn't get the vaccine, he'd be fired.   His job is about as high risk as it can be when it comes to potential exposures and he's already had Covid once which he freely admits was a hellish experience for him, particularly because he has asthma.   He has a wife who doesn't work and 3 kids including an infant. He's also living at our moms house because of other dumb decisions he made.   The fact that he's even considering not getting vaccinated and jeopardizing a good paying job, decent health benefits for himself and his young family.......  I just don't get it.   He's risking everything for his pride, for his misguided notion that he knows better. He's always thought he was smarter than he actually was but this is a whole new level for him.	1642817499.0	htoqjru	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htoqjru/

I don‚Äôt know any 19 yr old who has life figured out, or has even the slightest idea what they‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre barely out of high school, there‚Äôs no need to put so much pressure on yourself.   I changed career paths and went to school multiple times in my 20s, and I might go back to school again. A lot of kids from my high school transferred, switched majors, dropped out. This is an exploratory time period for you, just like everyone else. It‚Äôs so young in the grand scheme of things, but I know you feel old in the moment.   As for the physical health aspect, have you asked your doctor about maybe switching meds up? I find sometimes I hit a plateau with meds and get really depressed which makes me lethargic and chronically sleepy. I know some meds can also slow your metabolism which might be impacting you. Weight loss can also be a slow process‚Ä¶have you considered seeing a dietician to find a meal plan that might help?

The "do your own research" crowd is my favorite. What is this research you're doing exactly? Are you googling "vaccine bad" and only believe the stuff that already aligns with your views?

ha2wdekr	We don't live together anymore. I actually was there and very involved. I Taught her the alphabet, and numbers. Birthday cakes year after year. She adored me more than her mother. I loved being there and being a part of her life. That really was the center piece of my life. Relationships don't always work out. It's been a very difficult experience. One part of me could say I couldn't imagine a world without my child. Another part is saying I have to. She is my child. But this new version of father is not how I wanted her to see me. I'm not truly father anymore. The time I'm able to get just doesn't feel like enough. And I don't get to be there for the important moments in her life like I could before.

dkvbqeou	Society is so cruel to Black women and it‚Äôs easy to internalize the violent anti-Blackness and misogynoir regularly promoted in both subtle and blatant forms. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve found yourself in spaces and in the company of people that‚Äôve taken away your ability to see your beauty. I‚Äôm a fully Black woman and I know the struggle of wrestling with Eurocentric beauty standards, especially in an environment where you don‚Äôt see a lot of people that look like you or those people are painted as the antithesis of beauty. When the veil lifts though, it‚Äôll be obvious that these ideas only exist to make you feel and play small, and hold no truth whatsoever.   Your husband didn‚Äôt cheat on you because you‚Äôre dark and ugly for the simple fact that the latter isn‚Äôt true‚Äîdarkness is not synonymous with ugliness so that fact takes nothing away from you. He cheated on you because he‚Äôs a serial cheater and that‚Äôs what he wants to do. Cheating is a violation on a relational, physical, and emotional level and for subjecting you to any of those risks, he doesn‚Äôt deserve you. I‚Äôm so sorry for the pain you‚Äôve been subjected to, I‚Äôm so happy that you found the strength to walk away. I hope you can be kinder to yourself and, when you‚Äôre ready, find someone‚Äîor people really‚Äîthat makes loving yourself easier to do. I‚Äôm speaking healing, the decolonization of beauty standards, peace, and whatever other kind words come to mind later into existence for you.	1642818406.0	htosovi	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htosovi/

Like, to fake the (US) moon landing, there would be pretty close to half a million people involved. So if it had been faked, there would have only be around 3.7 years before it was revealed. And obviously there is no lower limit, a (true) conspiracy could be revealed just moments after it happens. The 3.7 years is a good estimation of the upper limit, though.	1642819144.0	htoug6h	t3_s9gzx4	t1_hto9uer	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htoug6h/

7dm2soga	Hi! You sound like a great person : )  I think this is a time when a lot of our own buckets are empty or near empty and it‚Äôs hard for people to give to others what they are not feeling within themselves.  As you‚Äôve touched on here, what we give to others can also speak to what we hope to receive for ourselves and you deserve for others to know what you are feeling you need. Sometimes when I‚Äôm relating in a certain way to someone I care about, like wanting them to know how much they matter, that can be a time when I am also struggling with wanting to feel mattered . If I say to my friend something heartfelt that is also something I‚Äôm hoping to hear and it‚Äôs not reciprocated, I can definitely relate to having a hard feeling that‚Äôs associated with someone not giving us what we are willing to give to them .   I think sometimes people just don‚Äôt know the meaning we make out of certain things that are said (or not said ) so can just be a bit dense  around what specifically feels good to  individual friends .   Also, it sounds like you are someone who is willing to be vulnerable and say meaningful things to others. That‚Äôs at the heart of what helps people feel close so it‚Äôs a wonderful quality about you . For others it‚Äôs trickier to be vulnerable in that way  and so they don‚Äôt always say the heartfelt or complimentary things they may feel due to difficulties with vulnerability.   What would it be like to let certain close friends in on how you‚Äôre feeling?	1642819619.0	htovkkr	t3_s9krkg	t3_s9krkg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9krkg/i_love_to_make_people_feel_wanted_and_included_in/htovkkr/

6jy83ogh	But those vaccines weren‚Äôt rushed!!  Totally just kidding‚Ä¶. And also, sure, the vaccine was ‚Äòrushed‚Äô as in they didn‚Äôt wait for step 1 to finish, before starting step 2x and they also started steps 3,4 and 5 at the same time as step 1.   But this took place a freaking year ago, at this point there is sooo much data on the vaccines. And the vaccines (in the US) only have a 0.0022% possible death rate. But really it‚Äôs much lower than that really low number since that‚Äôs just the number of people who got the vaccine and then died soon after. There is absolutely no proof that the vaccine *caused* the deaths.	1642819787.0	htovywh	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htobdcp	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htovywh/

omw6q7b	Oy! Look here. Girl you need to dead that shit immediately. Your attitude toward yourself is completely wrong, as is your devotion to this man. His infidelity has helped shape this view that you are somehow unworthy of the respect you deserve.   I do not even need to see you in order to tell you that you are not ugly. You are suffering from dysmorphia, a condition in which a person has a negatively distorted perception of their own self image.  Whether your complex stems from your man's gaslighting, or was something already present and of which he has taken advantage, is irrelevant. It is a chicken or egg situation, but it's a negative feedback loop.  As a white cis man, I cannot speak to the emotional troubles experienced by women in general, or minority women in particular, but I must strongly inform you, that being black does not make you unattractive. Being a shitty person  makes you unattractive. Being a sad sack makes you unattractive.  I think your love and devotion to this man is anchored to the misperception that if you leave him, you will be alone forever. I think that your dysmorphia is fed, in ways both subtle and artless, by your husband's disrespectful treatment of your relationship.  I counsel pursuit of individual therapy (not couple's therapy because I believe this guy to be emotionally manipulative trash) and divorce.  Don't let this guy make you feel like anything less than the wonderful human being you are. Even a life of solitude is superior to a life of feeling shitty about yourself. And I straight up GUARANTEE there are men out there that will treat you better and would relish the opportunity to do so.  Be strong, sis, and believe in yourself. I extend my emotional support and auspicious wishes for future contentment. It is my hope that you one day soon look in the mirror and say, "Fuck yeah. I'm finer than frog's hair."	1642820152.0	htowu14	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htowu14/

a21l8nol	Start by calling a family doctor and going in for a check up. Sounds like you should have one anyway if you haven‚Äôt been to a doc in a while. If there is a specialist they can refer you to, they will. Or if they can treat you, they will. More importantly, they are able to diagnose minor mental health issues and can refer you for services as well. It sounds like you could benefit from speaking with someone. Life is fulfilling without sex. Intimacy comes in many forms.   Most importantly, I do think that you can find help for this. Don‚Äôt just give up because someone else did. Their situation may not be yours.	1642820342.0	htoxa6d	t3_s9s40d	t1_htowsf9	/r/offmychest/comments/s9s40d/i_have_peyronies_disease_and_i_never_even_got_to/htoxa6d/

Unfortunately, you may never know the truth, even if you asked Mr.D himself. It‚Äôs entirely possible he could‚Äôve made others unintentionally uncomfortable too.  This of course doesn‚Äôt make him a bad person or anything like that, just a series of unfortunate events.   Normally I would suggest emailing him to express condolences, and perhaps to give yourself some closure, but due to the nature of the situation I‚Äôd suggest talking to another teacher about this idea, if you end up wanting to do so, for both legal and safety reasons, as well as getting more feedback.	1642820883.0	htoykby	t3_s9rsrd	t3_s9rsrd	/r/offmychest/comments/s9rsrd/my_favorite_teacher_was_fired_and_i_feel/htoykby/

6zfseecl	Trust me when I say no friends are better than toxic people. Especially if you have trauma.  I‚Äôm kinda in the same boat. But I‚Äôm working on my self i.e. therapy for CPTSD. I actually am not ready to be a good friend right now. I want friends of course but I became friends with my neighbor next door and we really hit it off but then I got triggered by her neglecting her 3 small children. A lot of my trauma stems from being neglected as a child. I fell into a deep depression and told her that I couldn‚Äôt come out anymore to talk with her and it really hurt her. So until you can become a good friend to someone else you have to make sure you have the mental capacity to do it. Take good care of yourself and take the time to heal. Good luck.	1642821047.0	htoyy3h	t3_s9nh2w	t3_s9nh2w	/r/offmychest/comments/s9nh2w/no_friends/htoyy3h/

4izrmz9q	Hi hi! pardon my excitement but its nice to see someone else with misophonia! I completely understand where your coming from and surprisingly enough I also have a dad that's chewing is one of the worst sounds I've ever heard in my life! my whole family makes a variety of noises that trigger me on a daily basis so I've made it a point to politely let them know. Like "hey, if you could go finish that somewhere else or back up a bit that would be great!" or something to that effect. Sometimes it's definitely hard to say it calmly tho, still working on not making myself sound so aggressive lmao. But after having an honest discussion about things with my folks, it became a lot easier to be around them because they knew my boundaries and knew what I could and could not handle. Ik its a bit different bc your dad has a binge eating disorder, but I think talking about it honestly with him might help you both figure out some solutions! And one more thing, just because it's "your fault" for feeling the way you do doesn't mean you have to be so hard on yourself! I have to remind myself of that all the time, it's hard, but you can't help the way you react just as much as they (usually) can't help but make that sound. You can't help it and neither can I. its just an issue with our brains and triggering of our fight or flight responses and misophonia is still generally new in the world of disorders, so please be more forgiving with yourself. Hope this helps a bit! \^ \^;	1642821143.0	htoz666	t3_s9rgdb	t3_s9rgdb	/r/offmychest/comments/s9rgdb/my_misophonia_makes_it_so_hard_to_be_around_my/htoz666/

cxvrt4s0	I do understand this, actually.   I have a hard time showering sometimes due to my own PTSD. And I know a lot of people with depression who have hygiene issues, so I have a lot of empathy for that.   I‚Äôm a survivor too, and man I feel for you, but you need to explore healthier ways of getting back your power from your abuser that don‚Äôt involve sacrificing personal hygiene. I‚Äôm saying this with love, but not cleaning yourself can cause a lot of physical issues, aside from just making things harder socially.  Is there anything else that helps you feel like you can take back your control? Like getting tattoos or piercings? I think as survivors we tend to want to do anything to take back power over our own bodies because they‚Äôre so tied to our traumas; for me it was an eating disorder and self harm.    I‚Äôm not trying to push you to change at all, but maybe explore some ways you can take care of your body that make you feel powerful and confident that don‚Äôt involve needing to sacrifice hygiene.   No pressure, just be open to it.  Thinking of you, buddy.	1642821257.0	htozfm0	t3_s9paqp	t3_s9paqp	/r/offmychest/comments/s9paqp/tired_of_everyone_giving_me_shit_for_body_odor/htozfm0/
3tvfayu7	Hi  I know it‚Äôs scary. I know it can seem terribly overwhelming and maybe even hopeless, and all of it can weigh heavily and be confusing. That‚Äôs alright. It‚Äôs a very complicated and tense time, you‚Äôre not alone in feeling lost.   But don‚Äôt loose hope yet! No matter what, there will be an option for you. If you‚Äôre uncertain about classes, or a major or things like that, perhaps taking one or two classes at a community college while you explore other options, will not only allow you to make progress on a degree that could help in the future depending on what you want to do, but also give you room to explore your own interests. Look into scholarships, financial aid. Look into internships. Some colleges offer career exploration courses or things of that nature of which also qualify for credits towards associates degrees and whatnot.   Look into local hair salons and see if any would be interested in training you or have any possible position for you, talk to them about your situation, maybe you could work something out or pick up a thing or two!   Basically, the long and short of it is- look into all your options. You don‚Äôt need to dive head first if you‚Äôre not ready to, be it emotionally, physically, or mentally, but it won‚Äôt hurt to do a little exploring or making a small bit of progress as you learn about what‚Äôs out there and yourself.

5aay6jzy	I remember when I was 19-20, what I knew about life, I was basically still believing in santa claus. I moved to a different town, I gained a lot of weight, I was so anxious I would have a panic attack if I had to order pizza, I was always scared to speak in class even if I knew the answers, I had sex with lots of dudes who didn't care about me, I did so many drugs that i was unable to make a basic calculation, my relationship with my parents was horrible, I didn't care about my wellbeing at all, I wouldn't eat or sleep for days or go to the doctor if i had health issues. I would only eat bread and jam or sandwiches for weeks because i was to anxious to buy groceries. I was a complete fucking unprepared kid, who didn't know anything about this world or how to handle it, had no fuckin idea of what I'm gonna do with my life. Now I'm 24, and im a complete different person, like you would never guess now that used to be me. I work as a web designer and marketer, speaking to clients on the phone with no issue, also begging to start my own business, I have great confidence and self esteem, a great relationship, i take care of myself, i look great, i managed to raise a nice amount of money because manage my finances with great care, I have no problem speaking in public or with anyone, i get praised by my bosses who think im doing a great job, i managed to finish my masters and dissertation paper with almost perfect score while i was working the web design job, job id never thought I'd get and i actually love. Give yourself some time, your life is just getting started, your basically an adult toddler right now, it's normal to not know who you are.  And you say you work out daily, that takes some true motivation and ambition. I cannot bring myself to do that, even if i keep saying I should. Youre doing it. The same motivation and determination you have should be invested in other aspects of your life that contribute to your happiness and wellbeing. You know you have it. So go for it.  Because adult lesson #1, life is sometimes gonna bring problems your way. Now, you don't want to help them kick your own ass and shoot yourself in the leg. No, you put on a cheerleader costume for yourself, take some pom poms and cheer for your own self to kick the problems ass. You gotta be there for you, fight for yourself, fight for your happiness, accept your flaws and your mistakes and forgive yourself. You are tho only one that gets to feel all this, nobody else does or ever will. You will have to spend every single moment of your life being who you are and feeling what you allow your self to feel. Nobody else will share this with you, it is you and you alone in your mind forever. This is all we get, and then life ends. So why not be your own friend? Why not say '' you know what, fuck all those insecurities, I'm gonna do everything in my power to bring myself up and love myself. If i said something stupid? I'm allowed to say something stupid, everyone does, nobody cares, if they do - fuck them. I'm allowed to have cellulitis. Do people find it unattractive? Giving random people a boner as I walk by is not a priority by any means to me, trying to impress them in any way is not worth my time. You think I did something awkward or weird? Oh, too bad i don't care about the opinions of people that judge others for trivial shit. I'm only gonna care about what people I love, admire and genuinely care about think of me.	1642822006.0	htp15jo	t3_s9pli8	t3_s9pli8	/r/offmychest/comments/s9pli8/currently_crying_about_who_i_am/htp15jo/

wyjja	I am dealing with such heartbreak over that. When we visit I go to bed early and sleep late. Fox is on from 0700-2200. Every.damn.day. I don‚Äôt mind listening from time to time, but their house is tiny. And there‚Äôs nowhere to go.   My FIL has called my husband a socialist (because he asked what both parties could agree on) told him he doesn‚Äôt get a say in the country‚Äôs politics bc he was in the military, and my favorite, that if you don‚Äôt agree with the republicans, you are not American. (And he means it. Completely)  Not once has he ever asked my husband‚Äôs (or my) opinions on politics and we‚Äôve never given them. I know we haven‚Äôt bc we‚Äôve made it a game btwn the two of us to see if they ever ask. They haven‚Äôt. He just assumes.   As my sister says of her fellow church members , ‚Äúthese are the kindest, most generous people I‚Äôve known for years. (They would literally break their bank accounts for you) But I don‚Äôt know the people they‚Äôve become.

Even the mere thought of doing something like that makes me sick to my stomach.     I wouldn't even "dream" of doing that with anyone else. The closest I would ever get to that would be to ask her to dress up as a video game character or something and do some sexy roleplay.      What you've got going on though? I dunno...I'm questioning how much you actually love this man.	1642823313.0	htp44lt	t3_s9t01b	t3_s9t01b	/r/offmychest/comments/s9t01b/i_have_the_urge_to_cheat/htp44lt/

5aay6jzy	I'm sorry, but at 34 years old, I do not see how you can blame your mom for the way you live anymore. Living there for so long and accepting this situation is the result of your own actions. Unless you are unable to work because of medical reasons, it's time to own up to your own decisions and stop blaming others for the consequences of your actions. Do something about it, get a shitty job and the shittiest rent somewhere and share it with roommates and start from there, this is how most people start their adult life, you're supposed to act independent and build your life from there.	1642823388.0	htp4az1	t3_s9plfn	t3_s9plfn	/r/offmychest/comments/s9plfn/i_just_want_to_have_my_own_place_god_damnit/htp4az1/

3qb5g3oh	Difficult to equate ideas when you use incredibly obvious bias to generalize people.   For reference, I live in a less populated. I haven't lost people from the virus, I wear a mask, and I identify personally -along with many others I know- as pro-choice, regardless of pandemic status or other external happenings.   I don't WANT to die, and neither do you, as has been pointed out. However, I understand that I MAY die, and accept the risks that go along with being alive. The difference between you and I is: first of all, belief that the medical industry, corporate entities, and political figures have my individual best interest in mind (in relation to this scenario, at least). And second, willingness to accept information formally presented (media, group-think, etc.) (also in relation to Covid).   We all do things that aren't perfect and amazing for our physical, mental, and spiritual health. We know the affects of eating McDonald's, yet we do it anyways because it's advertised on TV. We don't even know the long term affects of the vaccine. Y'all can judge me all you want, just know it doesn't matter how you feel about me or how I feel about you. We all out here being alive, baby, making our own choices. Drop the fear and hate, and embrace the love and hope.	1642823514.0	htp4lfv	t3_s9by4g	t1_htm4754	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htp4lfv/

3yark750	Air Force/Army brat, can confirm.  We had housing on Ft. Dix that was condemned after we moved out of it.  Dad was transitiioning from Army to Air Force (yes, it's weird, I know, his commanding officer in the Army knew his new commanding officer in the Air Force, and they all had been in Vietnam together, from what I gathered).  In any case, we transferred from Fort Campbell, where we lived in a nice house off base, to Kennedy Courts on Fort Dix.  There were bugs literally crawling on us as we slept.  It was so bad, and we had nowhere else to go, that we wound up camping in tent accommodations on McGuire AFB that summer until our quarters were ready.	1642823528.0	htp4mmx	t3_s9f844	t1_htn3kcp	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f844/i_love_my_husbands_phobia/htp4mmx/

imtoepdd	Personal experience in cursive, in case you want to jump it or in case it might help you since it relates to your experience:   *I had to put my 19 year old dog to sleep last year. I had them since I was 4. I didn't want to do it, but after seeing how painful it was their breathing, how much weight has lost, how they didn't recognize me anymore, the restlessness, the fear everytime it was too dark since they had cataracts and apparently dementia... I understood that my exhaustion wasn't anything compared to theirs, and it felt like the only reason they hadn't go away yet it was because they were waiting for me to be ready.*   *We hadn't a scheduled appointment, it was more like waiting for the right moment and the vet was 5 minutes away in case something happened. They were in bad shape, but suddenly were fine, and then they won't recognize me, and next day they greet me with a happy tail. This went for at least a year, first it was maybe a bad week and 2 months fine, the last times it always a bad day with some few hours or minutes fine.*   *One day, I felt like I had to say goodbye, it was an okay day but I felt something was coming. I pulled an all-nighter and we went for walk for the garden, mostly me carrying them and letting them feel the breeze and sitting in the grass for a few minutes, seeing them smell a little around. Everytime they got tired of walking, I carried them again until they wanted to smell a little more. When they got sleepy, we came back in home, they were cold so I gave them a warm blanket and slept with them in their bed. They looked at me as if they were able to recognize me for the first time after months, we cuddled and went to sleep. It was barely a few hours, it was around dawn, and we were awake by what it seemed to be a heart-attack; the look from last night wasn't there anymore, just a painful and scared face, so to the vet we went, and from the vet I came alone.*   *I didn't want to do it, and I was lucky to be able to be with them in the last moments, but that last hours was what gave me the peace I needed to make my grief later, I knew we visited their favorite places in the garden and that they were warm and next to me.*     So my advice is to take it easy and just focus on him these hours left. You can find guiltiers later, you can hate the world later, you will mourn him when they aren't here anymore, the exhaustion will hit you and you might sleep 24 hours straight, or you might feel like you can't even sleep. But right now he is here, let him have whatever he want, let him sleep in your bed or sleep with them, take him around the house, let him have his favorite food, if he doesn't want to do anything then sit with him even if it means sitting on the floor for hours, make sure he is the most comfortable possible. Just one moment at the time.   I hope you can find a way to be with you dog during the last time, maybe having the vet to do it in your house. It's really fast, if the vet is patient with you or you have to sign something it might take a little more, but the process itself it's less than 3 minutes. And wheter you can't be with him or not, bringing one of your clothes or a toy when you go might help him feel more relaxed.   As for you, you still have hours left before saying goodbye, treat yourself nice too, drink something warm, eat something you like, put on comfy clothes. In my case, watching some videos about it on youtube, listening to some songs about it, walking around the house and cleaning their space one more time, helped me be less anxious and the most important part, it helped me to cry. In trying to be strong for them, I numbed myself and forgot I was hurt and needed to cry and mourn and miss them correctly. It feels unfair we outlive them, but the good memories is what makes it worth it, to be able to give yourself away and for them to have a human who will miss them as much as you loved them, so try to honour that by showing the good impact he had on you whenever you feel like lashing out or being mean to others, it's hard now and it will be hard later, but this too shall pass.	1642824104.0	htp5wnt	t3_s9s1q8	t3_s9s1q8	/r/offmychest/comments/s9s1q8/i_have_to_put_my_dog_down_in_12_hours_and_i_want/htp5wnt/

61dj2sg1	I'm sorry, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it or tell you anything you're probably tired of hearing. But I'm sure it's become clear to you that those aren't friends. And yeah it's hard to cut ties because maybe you're afraid they'll have no one to help them. But I want to ask you how you're doing, and if being hospitalized gave you any insight, I want to know if you were given better resources to navigate your mental health journey.. I know what it's like to be the quiet kid who gives advice and comfort for people who bring you their problems. Being in high school is a mess, a stressy- depressy- and hormonally deranged mess. But there is a radically different life after graduation. You won't be surrounded by people your age anymore. You'll be able to seek out more emotionally mature people and you'll learn to live with yourself. If I had to tell you anything it's that nothing you do now besides maybe your grades, the pursuit of your aspirations, and navigating your health- is going to matter in a few years. If you're able to, focus on your quality of life. Try not to get overwhelmed by your future or the people who are using you and draining your will to live just to sustain their personal image and narrative. Try and prioritize having a balanced give and take in your relationships. And let go of who needs to be let go. I know you'll get through this, with your own willpower and the kindness of others you meet along your way. It's rare to have a constant source of kindness and genuinity but not hard to find smaller sources of it.

2n59w2nd	The sad thing is...  Takes a bunch of rich people to cultivate such a society to attract those who believe this path will get them close to the lifestyle they wanted but in reality, they're just feeding the money-grubbing goblins, and soon, these "leaders" will abandon the idea and run with the support money given to them.    After a few years, these conspiracies and ideologies will dissipate.    The remaining members will continue to push the BS because their lives revolved around it and tarnished themselves, making it impossible to reintegrate into society.    Other members will struggle on seeing the realization of reality but keep themselves silent because of the disbelief of what is true and what is false.     Those who were able to pull themselves out of the hole will just regret the whole experience entirely and be mocked/ridiculed by their peers for believing such false claims until the jokes/insults go stale.	1642824493.0	htp6r3q	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htp6r3q/

3qb5g3oh	The vaccine barely decreases the rate of spread, and natural immunity is just about as effective (if not more so against future variants).   It's really more like  One side: Hey we want everyone to wear a mask and vaccinate because we feel it's the moral choice. Also if you don't agree with us then you don't deserve to go to restaurants, work, or even leave your house in some countries.   Other side: Hey we feel that morally, anybody wanting to take choices away from us is not the good guy, and we choose to not support an oppressive ideology. Coercion is not ethical (if ethics is what we're talking about). Anyone truly afraid of the virus should personally take any and all precautions and not selfishly expect others to do the same.	1642824588.0	htp6ygi	t3_s9by4g	t1_htn42ze	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htp6ygi/

Mixed race black women are increasingly seen as more desirable and beautiful in the media such as IG, Netflix or Hollywood. This has NOTHING to do with your race or how you look! He is a CHEATER, so divorce him! Please do not take his actions and these disgusting things said in society to tear your self esteem down and make you feel strong. Black is beautiful. My friend went to Egypt and said they called her a queen there, they were so in awe of her being black. You are beautiful, I am white but from an Eastern Europe country which never colonized or took over other countries. We defended our own country so we do not see things the way West European Nordic or Anglo people do. I see Black people as a beautiful painting or sculpture and just the good they have to offer to humanity. Very close minded to think anyone is less than cause of how they were born and we are all connected by energy. We are all one.

Your husband is the hideous one, and I don't care how good he looks physically. You deserve so much better than this unfaithful asshole. I can tell by the way you speak of him that you are very loving and loyal, and he doesn't deserve someone as wonderful as you. He needs to go to hell and you need to realise that no matter how he made you feel in the past, you are better than him.	1642825582.0	htp916z	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htp916z/

My triple vaccinated wife and I are both isolating at home with covid now, I only found out I had it because she tested positive at work. Second time I‚Äôve had covid without symptoms now, makes it really hard for me to go voluntarily line up for 3 jabs but if my cushy job was ever on the line I certainly would.	1642825604.0	htp92u9	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htp92u9/

Not connecting to nature or getting enough sunlight is INCREDIBLY risky. Working a boring, unfulfilling job is detrimental to mental health. People die from all kinds of things.

9lrofwqe	I was in a relationship about two years ago where I had the same mindset. Told myself I wasn‚Äôt good enough to be on my own and really just hated myself and used that to justify staying with a partner that made me feel terrible all the time. He too never showed me affection, we fought all the time, and he was completely selfish in bed.  My point is finally I had gotten to the point-and it sounds like you‚Äôre there too-where finally I had had enough. We had gotten in yet another major argument and I was feeling so low after leaving his place that I had to pull my car over because I couldn‚Äôt see through all the tears. I gathered myself together and decided that was enough. I didn‚Äôt care anymore that I felt so horrible and insecure with myself, he wasn‚Äôt worth it. I broke up with him the next day. I won‚Äôt sugar coat it and say the process was at all easy, but I can promise you that I felt such a major weight off my shoulders. No more fighting, insults, etc. I really gained confidence and learned to appreciate myself more and I raised my standards moving on for new relationships. Leaving him made me so happy (with time), I know you can do the same and in fact I would encourage you to. You owe it to yourself even if you don‚Äôt believe you do.	1642826294.0	htpahq6	t3_s9qh6i	t3_s9qh6i	/r/offmychest/comments/s9qh6i/my_boyfriend_sucks_im_not_happy_with_him_at_all/htpahq6/

ja2v5	My two cents, as an internet stranger -   Continue to do kind things that are "effortless" for you, cause, you know, you are a kind person.   Think about kind things that you do that are hard for you - and maybe drop them, if you feel like you're being a sucker (slowly building resentment) instead of being a saint.   Think about also the community(s) that you're in. It's also possible that these are toxic communities where your gestures aren't appreciated and get taken advantage of, but there may be other communities where these are acknowledged. We can get used to toxic environments and not realize there are better waters out there.	1642826557.0	htpb0wo	t3_s9krkg	t3_s9krkg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9krkg/i_love_to_make_people_feel_wanted_and_included_in/htpb0wo/

I never know what the right thing to say is and I don't want to come off too strong. I feel like a lot of people feel the same way, and aren't sure how much emotion/affection to show towards others, including their friends.

imtoepdd	Look, the scars you have are your war marks, one war that you just overcome it recently, so it's normal that the emotional hardships related to them makes you uneasy to show them. But look around you, look how many around have a not perfect skin for what the society impose, how many have stretch marks, scars, wrinkles, spots, moles, without some limb, with burn scars, etc., and how that doesn't make you avoid them. Some people are more shallow, it's true, and it's normal that you're afraid that those shallow people might make comments about you, but there's also people who will look beyond that, there's people who will hear your story and say "wow, she's so strong for overcome it, that's the kind of person I want to have an influence in my life". You want mutual recognition, if you can recognize others value even when they might not like things about themselves, why do you think you don't deserve the same? And it's your body, you're the one watching yourself every day, it's expected that for you that scars are one of the main parts of yourself right now, but being real, for others it's probably not that big of an issue.     That being said, it's also okay if you don't like them. It's okay if they remind you of a bad past and you want to get rid of them. You are still healing, it can take a few years before you know how the scars will fade and how visible will they be. Give it time, try to keep a good care of your scars so they heal the best they can, take care of your mental health while you wait, and if in some time you are still uncomfortable with them, ask your doctor about other options. The ones I can think fast are medical tattoos or laser therapy that might help you conceal them, or straight up normal tattoos that make those scar into a pretty drawing.	1642826663.0	htpb8df	t3_s9r2y4	t3_s9r2y4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9r2y4/im_scared_my_scars_will_make_it_hard_to_be_loved/htpb8df/

dzpfwq3i	Yes, HE said it. He could be biased and mischaracterizing his dad. Or his dad could be a Q-Anon follower and believe every conspiracy. Or maybe he believes a few things that sound to the poster like they come from Q-Anon. Or maybe he just started following Q-Anon and believes only some of what he sees there. My point is that we are relying on someone's political enemy to tell us what his enemy thinks--which is generally not a very reliable way to learn what someone actually believes.

an5tmyq3	Yeah I did promise them I won't speak about it but after I literally broke down infront of them because what my sister has done and me having to keep it private has really been affecting me and I just cracked. And even recently I've been crying because of it. The issue is the friend is a child of whom my parent is dating. So if I do mention it to my sister and my parent, there's bigger risks because of it. My sister has always caused me issues making my mental health terrible for a long time but I literally fixed it and was doing fine, until now.  So yeah, I can't do anything and it sucks, so I just have to suffer with it alone in private.	1642826905.0	htpbpic	t3_s9tzr8	t1_htp9x2i	/r/offmychest/comments/s9tzr8/my_18f_sibling_22f_is_ruining_my_reputation_and/htpbpic/

8e6kdine	Easy, my gf lost her job during the pandemic and since she has no college she hasn‚Äôt been able to find anything else other than food service which pays almost nothing. We have two cats and a dog. Rent on our decrepit disgusting place is 1400/month and we don‚Äôt even have a full functioning kitchen. I have a modest car that I bought used, but thanks to some stupidity in my teens my car insurance is almost 300/month and that‚Äôs not including car loans. I also have private student loans that never went on pause. I have regular student loans I‚Äôm going to have to pay back soon too. I have credit card debt from the time my cat had to go to the emergency vet. Commuting to the city coasts over $350/month via train (parking would be more expensive almost $50 a day where I work) did I mention sometimes I have to do things like eat, or leave my apartment sometimes.	1642826968.0	htpbty5	t3_s9sz72	t1_htpagqk	/r/offmychest/comments/s9sz72/i_just_got_a_promotion_and_a_raise/htpbty5/

dhpegqua	Oh yeah... power-tripping is a good way to put it. I'm thinking of a situation I learnt about last year where the organizer/runner of a fan awards event told me privately that she "withholds awards/prizes" for people who "piss \[her\] off." This was after she (wrongfully) accused me of cheating, even though she allows her own stuff to be both nominated and it mysteriously, without any official vote count results shared, wins every year.   I couldn't share any of this in the community because why even bother? It was clear she'd established her clique of lackeys, and she'd had the favor of some popular creators who may have looked the other way if they ever suspected she fabricates the results. It would be a cluster if I shared it, would only lead to the nice people who had won the event getting their feelings hurt, and I was already stepping back. It just wasn't worth it the drama. I figured she could enjoy pretending to be powerful all she wanted, just so long as I didn't have to deal with it.	1642827089.0	htpc2lo	t3_s9t517	t1_htpaj6h	/r/offmychest/comments/s9t517/tired_of_the_clout_chasing_in_online/htpc2lo/

Although, he‚Äôs not really the type to want to go to the doctor for his mental health any further than he has to go. It‚Äôs not totally out the questions to assume he my have other things going on, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not as hard on him. Also, yes he does support me in all other areas of life. He‚Äôs there when I need anything and is super dependable. He does so much for me and would drop everything and help me in any way I needed. There is no doubt in my mind that he cares for me and loves me dearly. This is the only thing that seems to be the issue so far with him so I try not to push it, especially knowing how difficult it is when you‚Äôre struggling mentally.

2vn999ws	25 seconds? Damn I wouldn't consider that a relationship if it happens every day, sorry. She may have got very shy cos she doesn't know what to speak with you as her boyfriend, Some people need less compromise and much reassurance to let lose again but you could try bringing up things you've already know she likes to talk about to subliminally let her know that you're the same old you and its ok to talk. Maybe ask if she plays something or has a hobbie you could do with her, could exchange a theme and do drawings base on them or any other long distance activities you can find. It could be that you have some pastime that you can invite her to. She may also just not be interested but doesn't know or has the courage to tell you. Tho I believe you should just ask her directly instead of just following advice, cos sometimes things aren't happening how or for what we believe. Who knows maybe she has a sick family member.

He doesn‚Äôt really love you or care about you if he‚Äôs sleeping with other women.	1642828240.0	htpeapn	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htpeapn/
9ptyv	Oh okay. That‚Äôs kinda where I figured this was going.. because it‚Äôs his fathers obligation to finically support his grown son, right? And he can‚Äôt make his own choices based upon what he wants to do with his own body because you know. His adult son needs his money. Do you m is how entitled and absurd that sounds? My wife is a single mother who put her self through college while working full time before I came along to help support her.literally all on her own. His father doesn‚Äôt owe this man a thing! The entitlement is bewildering. Why does the left constantly berate people and tell everyone that ‚Äúpeople should be able to do what they want with their bodys!‚Äù When it comes down to literally any other issue such as sex changes and abortions. But when they disagree with what someone wants to do with their own damn body, they throw a fit. Like I said, literal nazis.. do you seriously think that any man on the face of this earth should conform to doing anything to his body that he doesn‚Äôt want too in order to finically support his grown son? Like really?! Especially when said son obviously has no respect for his own rights, or him for that matter based on the way he‚Äôs talking about him. Look, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù . I‚Äôm actually for people getting it! But what I am not for, is people telling me and others what the fuck to do with my own body. Listen pal, I‚Äôve smoked enough k2 when I was a teenager that covid isn‚Äôt gonna hurt me. I do not socialize with anyone almost outside of my own family. Me not getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt effect anyone else. It‚Äôs my body, it‚Äôs my choice! I don‚Äôt think the vaccine will hurt me, I just know that covid won‚Äôt either. I just think that such as we should respect women being able to choose if they abort or more should also respect people‚Äôs decision to not get vaxxed. My wife got it, everyone I love got it and it makes me extremely happy they did. But the idea of belittling my Loved ones because they chose not too is sickening. Can you understand where I‚Äôm coming from?	1642828276.0	htped83	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpdjx7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htped83/

I was so terrified I start throwing cookies at it. Friend arrived 15 min later with cookies all over living room and throw it outside. When she met my husband she told him that story to make sure he'll take care of all the nasty bugs in the future when she's not around lol  He said it's not a problem as long as it's not snakes and we started laughing because I actually like snakes and realized we're definitely a perfect match	1642828278.0	htpeddm	t3_s9f844	t3_s9f844	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f844/i_love_my_husbands_phobia/htpeddm/

We say something is a conspiracy for many reasons.  Does it mean that everything is?  Not in a true sense, but a part of that story could be.  The goods and services we consume all have stories.

31c7kwp8	So after attempting to cheat on you he secretly takes steps to knock you up, and has repeated the behavior, but thinks sticking around to continue manipulating you somehow excuses it? I‚Äôm rarely at a loss for words but‚Ä¶fuck, I‚Äôm so sorry you were tricked into building your future with such a piece of shit.  This behavior of secret condom removal is called stealthing, some states like CA have criminalized this and have gone so far as to consider it sexual assault. It‚Äôs a way for guys to get a quick nut with an unsuspecting partner, and it results in STD/STI transmissions and other lifelong consequences like children.  My father was similarly trapped into his first marriage by a woman lying about her infertility and BC, and he had a kid at 22. At 28, I live my romantic life having learned vicariously of the dangers of this kind of entrapment. You can‚Äôt stop thinking about it because you know it to be revolting behavior that has permanently altered the course of your and your children‚Äôs lives. I sincerely hope you DO NOT let it go, and find the strength to hold him accountable for this behavior. Whatever that accountability looks like is ultimately up to you, but for this egregious a sin I don‚Äôt think anything is off the table.	1642829942.0	htphkyo	t3_s9rcs8	t3_s9rcs8	/r/offmychest/comments/s9rcs8/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_it/htphkyo/

Its better for you and him to divorce, if he wants to be with his family, be toxic and be a lonely bachelor then so be it but not at the cost of damaging you in the process, neither you(nor him) deserve to suffer this already toxic tragedy and please be kind to yourself  As for the cultural thing? Its your life, why does their opinion matter and who are they to judge you for doing and deciding whats best for you, who knows, divorcing him and cutting them off might be one of the best decisions you'll ever make, nobody deserves to be treated like that.

They said must be fully vaccinated by nov 22. Then they extended that to some time in Jan this yr. Unfortunately he had more than 3 months to plan for being fired. I understand this isn't much help and that the government isn't necessarily great for doing so but in today's world to get a job and try and keep it vaccines are becoming mandatory.

I got back on track w my career for real, and have been lucky enough to experience what someone really caring about me feels like. I‚Äôm starting to discover what true love looks like, what it *should* be according to my dreams (instead of his fucked up reality).  And I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. üòá   I‚Äôm glad that dude treated me like the trash HE was bc it pushed me so hard to get to a much more authentic and fulfilling life.

I've felt the same way and regretted it, cried due to it and wanted to cover them up with concealer and tried to use so many scar creams to fade it away. I constantly kept saying if I have more scars people will hate me or not talk to me, thankfully my therapist, my family and my friends told me otherwise, they never looked at me differently and I've stopped trying to mask them or use creams, I just let it heal like it's supposed to. Sometimes I look at them and feel bad but I was just trying my best to live and that's all that matters, I appreciate myself on how far I've come rather.

You were pressured by an asshole manipulator to send them. Don't give it a second thought.   When you get older, you will see how all of this was on him and not you.

bco4zdn7	Ok right off the bat a bunch of red flags.  Disregarding and invalidating your circumstances + guilt tripping you into doing what he wants? Yeah thats screaming emotional manipulation and the fact that he knows you love him, well you're basically under his thumb and hes obviously using that to his advantage, pressuring you into a nude is a good example and you need to cut him out.  And his reaction to you not contacting him? Well that isnt healthy, he wants love and intimacy? Then its his responsibility to work on it regardless if he needs special needs or not.  Loving a person with mental illnesses can be hard, heck loving anyone can be hard. But when this type of stuff starts? Back the hell away and think for yourself. Alas take this with a grain of salt.   Please be kind to yourself and think about whats best for you, nobody deserves to be treated like that nor be taken advantage of.   Regarding you parents well, from what I can see their a bunch of shallow a-holes.	1642832392.0	htply2m	t3_s9v9fj	t3_s9v9fj	/r/offmychest/comments/s9v9fj/pressured_into_a_nude_i_want_to_die/htply2m/
31c7kwp8	You gave someone you love a second chance and got back together with him ‚Äî sometimes that works out, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. That doesn‚Äôt mean you were the one responsible for this situation. You operated under false pretenses and your trust in the person you love was used against you to isolate you.  That resistance you‚Äôre feeling towards breaking up the family unit? He‚Äôs betting on that dependence, he‚Äôs tried to create that dependence from the beginning. From the way he is already gaslighting you since discovering his stealthing, he will double down and make this a very difficult process. Rather than scare you into submission, I sincerely hope that galvanizes you to take serious action.  In my dad‚Äôs case, his wife used their child at every turn as a tool to manipulate and further injure my father. My dad divorced her after a few years when his son was 5 or 6, and he did everything he could to provide and be there for his child whenever possible. Despite this, his child was reduced to leverage by his ex-wife, and it permanently marred their relationship.  Food for thought: your kids may pick up on their father‚Äôs traits. Your kids may also be used as weapons against you by this manipulator. Your kids may take cues from you as well, and learn to rationalize abuse or breaches of trust for the bigger picture. Your kids may also grow up to learn their mother stood up for herself and left someone who thoroughly wronged her, and did her best to provide for them the best life she possibly could despite not having the picturesque nuclear family. My gf‚Äôs mom divorced her serial-cheater husband when she was still pregnant with my gf. It was single parent life for a long time, but it taught my gf the importance of self advocacy at an early age and to never let yourself be a victim if you can help it.  I don‚Äôt mean to be preachy, but your story resonates with a lot of my personal experiences. I sincerely hope you seek counsel of trusted friends and family and potentially legal help as well. I wish you nothing but luck and future happiness, and if you need to talk this out further feel free to message me directly.   You‚Äôve got this.	1642832441.0	htpm133	t3_s9rcs8	t1_htpjzyo	/r/offmychest/comments/s9rcs8/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_it/htpm133/

When I explained I unfortunately would not be coming to the Christmas celebrations due to this reasoning, they aggressively said that it was ‚Äúmy problem‚Äù that my husband is immunocompromised and that they were ‚Äúsorry I felt that way.‚Äù I hung up and have not spoken to them since, nor have they tried to reach out to me after speaking so terribly to me about my husband and basically insulting him and his well being.

7ofrd77w	There are valid criticisms here that put a lot of people off, even me, avid anime consumer. The forced expressions and representations of emotions are made to be so exaggerated that it feels shallow. All I can think of is the people in the studio being made to seem like something so eerily inhuman. It's clear to even my friends 11 year old sibling that normal people don't interact with others in the way they do in most anime. I can kind of see the reasoning behind it in shows directed towards a younger audience, even american shows do the same thing, but in more mature anime like Death Notes infamous chip scene, I have to wonder if they couldn't find a way to raise stakes or increase the energy of the scene in a more subtle or effective way.	1642832609.0	htpmbc6	t3_s9uw8b	t1_htpio5d	/r/offmychest/comments/s9uw8b/i_hate_everything_japanese_and_i_dont_know_why/htpmbc6/

Growing old together sounds amazing but knowing who you are and who you want is an incredibly big part of what growing older is.   While I‚Äôm not advocating for you two to break up it‚Äôs amazing you have been together so long during such a Discovery time of life.  Something a friend of mine did with his now wife of 6 years and partner of 12* who met at about 15 and now have 2 children; which is very unique but worked for them is agree to ‚Äúseperate‚Äù for a year to literally get anything and everything out of there system.  They both went out and dated and had sexual relationships with others because they wanted to be sure they new they had the right person because of how young they were when they met and never really got a chance with anyone else before finding the ‚Äúone‚Äù  Worked wonders for them because even in the worst of times they come back to joking about how shit other people were in relationships.

24nzpqj9	Please find someone who is your equal in looks so that you will both appreciate each other for more than physical attributes. I HAD a friend who's wife was very plain looking.  But she was such a sweetheart! I really liked her kindness and personality.  I didn't know what was happening in the background between them.  BTW, my friend was what a lot of people would consider an Adonis. This guy was tall, tanned, very physically fit, a voice like Barry White, a face that you see in high fashion magazines! And no, I'm not into dudes before anyone goes there. I couldn't believe the reactions women had around him. Basically he was a ladies man all his life and he has his way with just about all of them.  He told me stories of how rich women in California would keep him in their big homes, fancy cars, clothes, fine dining,  money, jewelry, practically he was a kept man. I asked him why he left them or why it ended.  He said cz they were old news to him after awhile.  Well,  one day I was at his apartment. We were sitting at the table talking.  He casually raised his hands in the air, man! His wife almost jumped our of her chair. I was like WTF just happened?  He went outside for a bit without me.  I asked his wife what was the deal?  She said that he is a WIFE BEATER! She showed me holes in the wall from him picking her thin frame up and throwing her into walls in bouts of anger!!! Anyway,  I spoke to him about this . He said, "if she wasn't rich and expecting a huge inheritance I'd leave her already ". Well,  I can't be friends with a wife beater. I stopped my association with him. I told his wife leave him before anything worse happens.  Several years later I was told that he had six kids with that same wife. She had inherited so much money they had bought a huge home. Anyway, I bet it's still not a good relationship for her. Best of luck to you. You deserve better. If your man is an adonis believe me he will have his share. Take care of yourself.

Or he wants you to feel unsecure about it and more dependent. Either way, in your next work, use the colours you like and paint for yourself.

I had my kids at 21 and 23, having to give up on college ultimately to raise them. I‚Äôve been very upfront about the struggles then and shared the things I do regret missing out on. My mom was 15 when she had my sister and 18 with my brother and I admired her for years. The mom I saw was so accomplished and strong. I definitely wasn‚Äôt aware that she ever struggled to raise them.	1642833754.0	htpo8qd	t3_s9w1nt	t3_s9w1nt	/r/offmychest/comments/s9w1nt/i_fear_for_my_daughters_future/htpo8qd/

He's the first person I talk to in the mornings and the last person I talk to when I go to sleep. He makes me happy and now I don't know what to do I feel so empty when I talk to him but it hurts worse to know he's not there to talk to.

She is refusing to let him see their baby. Recently I got wind that the police are looking for her for stealing packages off of peoples porches. If she were to be turned in, I know it would have affect with her and her child but I know at that point he would be able to have a better case with allowing him to see their baby. I feel wrong turning her in. On the looking for her note it shows a glimpse of her but I know Exactly who she is, what her name is, where she works.  My point is, am I wrong to want to turn her in solely for the opportunity for the baby‚Äôs dad to get to see her?  It‚Äôs not my place and I don‚Äôt know them too personally. But it hurts me to see fathers not being able yo see their child. He loves her so much and it is so incredibly clear.	1642834378.0	htpp9dz	t3_s9wbyk	t3_s9wbyk	/r/offmychest/comments/s9wbyk/all_the_young_fellas_with_no_kids_be_careful_who/htpp9dz/
c8oqde2g	Thanks. I appreciate it. My oldest knows it was no picnic being a teen mom. I have always been honest about the fact that I never regretted having them, but I gave up a lot and missed out on a lot. The other two didn‚Äôt come along for another 16 years, until I was in a stable and loving marriage. So they didn‚Äôt live through the struggles of being so poor there was no water or heat in the apartment, or moving around a lot, or never seeing mom because I had to work two jobs to make ends meet because the father split. They have only ever known a solid two parent home. In all fairness to my oldest, his childhood sucked big time. He is a grown, successful man, husband and father now. I didn‚Äôt want any of them to follow in my footsteps.	1642834404.0	htppawb	t3_s9w1nt	t1_htpo8qd	/r/offmychest/comments/s9w1nt/i_fear_for_my_daughters_future/htppawb/

bco4zdn7	Sadly at this point I dont think the boy and bestfriend you fell in love with is there anymore(hate to break it to you). Those happy memories? Theyre in the past. You have to think whats best for you(and him) and move on, this isnt healthy nor good for either of you, and I might be stepping out of line here(forgive me) but you seem a bit dependent on him, you may need to work on that, you both need to work on yourselves and go from there. If you still hold hope that he would change and everything will turn out ok, be my guest but as of currently, take a step back, think and be kind for yourself, nobody deserves to be treated or 'loved' like that.	1642834641.0	htppodu	t3_s9v9fj	t1_htpob1u	/r/offmychest/comments/s9v9fj/pressured_into_a_nude_i_want_to_die/htppodu/

fh9i71kx	I didn't force him.  He didn't want to have to plan anything, because it isn't his strong suit.  I told him since it was important to me, I would manage it since it wasn't anything big, and he agreed.  I didn't hold a gun to his head, and he himself at the end of the day said he enjoyed it and was glad our friends could come out.  I've actually talked to him since I made this, like I said to another commenter.  He's totally on board with having a "delayed reception" kind of thing, and said that we will plan together and a little more carefully this time.  After experiencing our wedding day, even if it wasn't perfect, as well as seeing a few of his friends and family planning weddings, we had a conversation about how he didn't realize that this was something so important.  He has family history of "dates" not being made to be special, and that doesn't make him a bad person.  I appreciate his willingness to see things from my perspective.  I hope you don't jump to conclusions like this in your relationships.  You or u/-HappyLady-, since your comment made me return to the thread they started.  If I felt like this was going to ruin our relationship, I would have posted in one of the many relationship advice subs.

She was sick on the Monday she came up, blew it off and took painkillers and came anyway because she didnt want to miss out. I was patient zero and became very unwell by Thursday. Partner was sick the next day, and I tested positive on Sunday.   We had visited my partners friends house - who was caring for his terminally ill uncle. His whole family tested positive around the same time as us.

You cant look in to the brains of other people, we will never know, why they have been treated badly. I have a chronic disease since many years and I made horrible experiences with doctors, nurses, colleagues and friends because of it.

58mgxqdm	I‚Äôm sorry that you feel this way. That sucks. You‚Äôre not alone in this.‚Ä¶ Will make you feel better. At the end of November, I divorced my wife of 13 1/2 years. We ended up getting divorced and should‚Äôve gotten divorced literally seven or eight years earlier, but we both try to make it work for our children. That was a mistake. We put on a big fa√ßade about our marriage and how happy we were. That was a mistake.  You can take a tiger out of the jungle, but you are not going to take the jungle out of the tiger. If you think that his old ways have completely gone with this woman, I am here to tell you that this is highly unlikely. If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I can sell you.  Living Well Is the Best Revenge. I applaud you for making your child a priority. Strong girls come from strong women. I‚Äôm sure it gets to you at times.   It bothers me like hell that after all the shit we went through, she can‚Äôt seem to be alone. She has jumped from relationship to relationship to relationship since we have been separated. I think God that I have 50-50 custody with her and I try to give my daughters a different view than what she gives them. My daughters knew that something was wrong with me. They are now seeing me rebuild myself and they are seeing that it is possible to get back up after you‚Äôve been knocked down. I know it‚Äôs hard but you can do the same thing.

They both told me he cried at first and kept asking her for full details to be sure that this really did happen. And she sent him a pic of me we took at the restaurant.

7ofrd77w	Answering definitively is difficult just because of how easily this can turn into a situation with a lot of moving parts. Women & especially teenage girls take appearance very seriously, not in all cases but generally that is the case. It could end up leading to a lot of mental issues that in turn lead to physical health issues.  Comforting & affirmations can only go so far after a certain point. Same thing with logic, if you're using some sort of 'analysis' style way to logic out of issues like that emotions usually win.  The best bet is to end it as soon as possible. What you tell to your mother depends a lot on the kind of relationship she has with your father, with you, & what she thinks of the situation herself. You could use your own experience as evidence against the problem, or at least what things like this do to other people but also know that there's a wall in most people's brain that tells them "yeah but this is an exception" or they might not want to believe that their actions could have negative affect on someone if it isn't blatantly obvious.  To me at least, it's trying tell someone to identify a camouflaged animal in a photo, it's there but you can't see it unless you know what to look for. At the end of the day whatever you say to your mom will have to convince her that there's an issue, & convince her to help end it.	1642836595.0	htpsqaj	t3_s9wtm0	t3_s9wtm0	/r/offmychest/comments/s9wtm0/what_do_i_say_to_my_mom/htpsqaj/

I've been there.   It honestly seems like your mom just didn't want to deal with any issues in the beginning and that's why she said what she said. That's not okay.    You deserve to be happy, and people today need to understand that in a relationship, BOTH people need to be happy. Not one. Not one person is more important that the other and it seems like they believe it's more important that he is happy rather than you too.  As for the living situation, that is always hard. Are you both financially independent or do one of you rely on the living situation?   It never hurts to ask a friend, or even look for a roommate situation (a bit tricky but better than nothing).	1642838585.0	htpvo0m	t3_s9wtvb	t3_s9wtvb	/r/offmychest/comments/s9wtvb/ive_been_in_a_relationship_for_over_almost_a/htpvo0m/

b6uoh2ub	Sounds like you really need to talk to her about how this is affecting the relationship.  I'd also suggest what I've suggested with my husband (we both have way too much screen time) and suggest phone free evenings. Doesn't even have to be the whole evening, doesn't have to be every evening (likely do less phone free time to start and try and build up the amount of time and how frequently cos they are addictive)   Essentially keep the phone out of reach, pop it in the bedroom or something. Then have dinner without it it simply watch a movie together, play a game.   I can't see someone being mad with you wanting to spend more quality time with them.   My husband and I do quite frequent date nights too, so the phone is always away anyhow.   But as sad as it sounds start small because social media can be addictive and going cold turkey could be very hard for some people.

a39ko03x	Take this alright, and listen well.  There is a difference between being a good guy and being a pushover. You are being a pushover.   Now, you must understand that it is absolutely great to be a good guy. You understand that the world doesn't revolve solely around you, and you understand the value of mutual trust, respect, cooperation, and kindness.   Those are all good things.   However, if you don't put boundaries, you get abused by the people who don't understand what you understand. It's not the good people abusing you, but the bad people.   So what do you got to do?   Have some boundaries. Understand that if other people are valuable, then you are valuable too. And if other people get your help because they have needs, then understand that you have needs too.   And also, get away from people who are only out for themselves. These people are bad for you, because they will take advantage of you.   Stay a good man mate! You won't regret it! Stay away from bad people, and be with people who share the good values in life.	1642839298.0	htpwplb	t3_s9xmva	t3_s9xmva	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xmva/im_tired_of_being_the_nice_guy/htpwplb/

9azhu6bj	You can be nice without letting be people take advantage of you.   I was shy and probably too nice when I was younger and I let people walk all over me. It started with abusive friendships and then lead me into abusive relationships down the road.   I learned to always be kind, like I was raised. But to stand my ground when needed. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with sticking up for yourself. And there‚Äôs definitely something to be said about sticking up for other people when in need.   Your friend sounds like an asshole. And you shouldn‚Äôt hang around them anymore.   You should hang out with people that respect other people. Just because I don‚Äôt like most people, doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt respect them and be nice to them. If I feel threatened, or see someone else being threatened, then that‚Äôs another story.

3drbxh1h	Well, there is always a place to start, so maybe reevaluating how you view yourself and where your low self-worth comes from is a start! Being better comes slowly with its bad days and good days, but at least you can learn how to prioritize yourself. You must find out why you are not happy with yourself, and for me, I have started doing this thing where I find something good about myself, no matter how small, and appreciating it. Even if it is so simple like cooking something decent or a facial feature of mine. You will slowly find your opinion of yourself increasing. Learn to put yourself first, say no to things that hurt you, and try to take care of you and how you feel. As for your partner, I have no clue what goes on between you two, but maybe you two should talk about how he can talk to you better, in a way that you think you may not feel attacked with! Slowly branch out and try to build a support system, it is hard but slowly and surely, while you care for yourself, you will be able to build one by mutual hobbies or anything of the sort. And of course, if you need anyone to talk to, I'm here!	1642840169.0	htpxywh	t3_s9dgdg	t1_hto29op	/r/offmychest/comments/s9dgdg/does_it_ever_get_better/htpxywh/

I knew I had allergies before getting the first dose, but all my vaccinated friends and colleagues and even doctor told me "it's very very very very unlikely you get an allergic reaction." well, I did  in the end.  The vaccinated people who are telling everyone the vaccine is safe are the ones who are spewing bullshit. No drug or vaccine is 100% safe. There will always be risks associated and each person has the right to decide for their own medical condition if they are welling to take that risk or not. I took it and ended up with a chronic skin condition on my face as a delayed allergic reaction. None of those who were pushing me to get vaccinated paid for my treatment did they? None of them could do anything but say "oh so sorry you had to go through that"  Where do I cash their sorry asses now?	1642841051.0	htpz88g	t3_s9by4g	t1_htp77sn	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htpz88g/
7jvt6j2u	I'm from Poland and recently my friend has told me a part of his family migrated to Austria around late 90s and their lifes improved immensly, you know, Poland being poor and underdeveloped, and Austria being one of those nice highly developed western countries (a ton of families migrated back then). And in November they said they are comming back to Poland. Just like that, after 20 years, leaving behind the life they've build (not without struggles)! They dont have anything in PL, they dont know the current market and social conditions, they dont understand that they wont be able to support their current comfy lifestyle. All that because AUSTRIA IS GOING TO ENFORCE VAXXING. They somehow managed to avoid getting vaccinated, however barely and now they truly believe that they are doing something "for the cause" lmao they truly believe they are the modern day heroes for abandoning their life in the "oppresive austrian regime". Of course they are conservative, alt right almost, so our government's rhetoric and propaganda are sufficient for them to think they will do ok in Poland. Well, it's extremly probable they won't.	1642841052.0	htpz8b6	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htpz8b6/

phbia	I don't have as much of an issue having friends, although in my experience most people don't have as many close friends as you might think they do. There's that old saying don't compare your insides to other people's outside. People show you what they want you to see and want you to think that things are going really well for them when maybe they're not. That said I have had at least one person who tried to be my friend for a long period of time and it just wasn't happening. I would say it's possible that you're barking up the wrong tree sometimes and you just need to let people go if they're not going to be the right people for you as friends. One thing that I have found that works for me in terms of making friends is opening up about myself. It's hard to be vulnerable and it makes me feel a little afraid they're not going to like me but it's really pretty much the only way to get a true friend.	1642841661.0	htq045b	t3_s9xnos	t3_s9xnos	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xnos/navigating_life_as_an_adult_without_any_friends/htq045b/

h2w9bty7	Thank you for this! I absolutely agree with you on a lot of things.   This was the biggest point I was talking about with my friends and colleagues, before I goy my first dose, I knew I had a severe allergic reaction before and the cause was unknown, so I booked an appointment with a doctor and told her. She  dismissed me and said "it's very rare that you get an allergic reaction from the vaccine, you should go get it." She did not do any tests, she did not ask me any more questions and she did not even want to see my medical history. So I went and got the first dose, as per her recommendation, and after having an allergic reaction I felt quite shocked. I felt that I can't trust the doctors because their biased preconceived judgments are preventing them from adequately examining their patients (at least now during the pandemic). The blanket advice that "you should go get the vaccine, it's safe" is a pretty dangerous one and can put certain people's health at risk. Those who have a genuine concern about suffering an allergic reaction to the vaccine should not be dismissed. Even if they smoke and eat unhealthy food, their lifestyle choices should not be a reason to downplay their concerns.    I did get all my vaccines growing up, some of which did require a second dose that I had to take months apart. But the only difference is that I never had to get a booster of vaccine every 3-6 months annually (which is the direction the governments and mandates are going in). My parents are physicians and I grew up knowing that, although our own immune system is the best defence system and is a very intricate one that no drug can parallel, medications and vaccines are important because they support your immune system. They never are substitutes for it, they only help you fight off whatever inflammation or virus or bacteria that can put your health at risk. Vaccines were never about transmission, they are about protecting YOU. So I was quite surprised that vaccines this time around were being advertised to do things that are quite strange like reducing transmission! I was surprised that	1642842211.0	htq0wln	t3_s9by4g	t1_htnmoav	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/htq0wln/

The rest of the family just is skeptical about the covid vaccine. The worst part of all this is that my sister is a nurse. I don't understand how you can be a nurse and be anti vaccine. My mom had to get the vaccine for work and after she got it she was acting all paranoid and looking up stuff on the internet of how to detox from the vaccine (as if that is even a thing). Anyways my family is relying on what my sister says because she is a nurse. She was allowed to get a religious exemption at her hospital and she isn't even religious. She has convinced everyone that covid isn't that bad. Pretty much everyone in my family has gotten it besides me. Last year a bunch of my family got it after a family gathering. My uncle got it but didn't get tested and to this day he says he didn't get it; he just had a cold. Yet his sense of taste is still messed up and he always complains about it. He acts like covid isn't even real.  Last week my brother got it and said it was bad. Yesterday my brother in law got it for the second time since Thanksgiving. Last time he wasn't that sick,  but this time he is pretty sick. I told my mom I'm glad he is really sick because I'm tired of my sister and him acting like covid isn't that bad and the government/media is just causing a stir.	1642842614.0	htq1g2j	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htq1g2j/

cvh73	I‚Äôm sending you hugs and love and strength. Right now you are blaming yourself and being so cruel to yourself but one thing your deep wisdom and heart knows is this just doesn‚Äôt feeling right. And you are taking that courage you have and leaving him. With time I hope you remember alllllllll the reasons why you‚Äôre SO WORTHY and so LOVABLE‚Ä¶ and with time you‚Äôll see this was your husband making you feel insecure unsafe in your relationship like you‚Äôre replaceable and ugly and like there is something wrong with you. I am so sorry he cheated on you. That type of betrayal would shatters anyones self worth. I am going thru a breakup with a good looking white man who comes from a wealthy upbringing. I am also a woman of color. He  made me feel sooooooo ugly. So unworthy. He would flirt with 18 year olds in front of me and he would get mad at me if I shared that that made me insecure and sad. He would get mad and blame it on his adhd. These are bullshit reasons. How people treat you is a reflection of how they feel about themselves. Him cheating on you has nothing to do with you and everything to do with his character‚Ä¶..  I‚Äôm sending you hugs darling.

If it's truly unsafe for people to get vaccinated with booster 3-6 months after the first dose, then I don't think it would be happening everywhere... right? I mean, immunocompromised people are being told they can get a second dose of the booster already... also doesn't the shingles vaccine require a booster only 2-6 months after the first dose?   Idk. If you have any sources that talk about this in detail, I'd like to read about it.

It feels *damn good* to cry.  I told her that I always felt like I was on the verge of tears at all times and she was like ‚Äòdo it‚Äô.   Crying and feeling is the only true way to get over it. I recommend therapy to help you navigate the feelings that come up. It‚Äôs hard. Like really fucking hard. But it‚Äôs the best thing I have ever done for myself.  It is more than okay to feel bad for yourself. Let those feelings visit, but give them a curfew.

What makes it even worse is that i can‚Äôt even share all my feelings and thoughts with my partner because she doesn‚Äôt completely understand how i feel. Today i just want to spend time with her on our day off, its a way to help me not thinking about my own problems, but she still chooses to be on the phone for the whole day and not making any plans to spend time together. I feel so lonely and empty even  though my partner is next to me. I don‚Äôt usually share my personal problems to anyone in real life and i Never thought i would seek for a place on social media to get something off my chest.

h5vne	I‚Äôm going through the same thing right now, just graduated last year. That leap into the adult world after college is fucking *terrifying.* I have no long-lasting connections from school aside from a girl I‚Äôve known my whole life who lives so far away now (basically off the grid) it‚Äôs hard to get in contact with her. My best friend throughout all of grade school turned her Instagram private after we left for college and repeatedly declined my follow requests. It stings to learn that we mean little in the lives of others.   The mindset that really helped me was to realize that it‚Äôs not on me, that I‚Äôm not the one causing it. It‚Äôs unfortunate to be in this sort of situation when humans rely so heavily on our relationships with others, but it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault. People come and people go, and the *right* people will stay. Perhaps we just haven‚Äôt found the right people yet. Cherish the bonds you do have, and find joy in the little interactions you have with acquaintances.  And hey, if you ever do need a friend‚Äîso do I. Reach out if you need anything or just want to talk, lord knows I need the socialization, haha.	1642845067.0	htq4shj	t3_s9xnos	t3_s9xnos	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xnos/navigating_life_as_an_adult_without_any_friends/htq4shj/

Secondly, your husband is a piece of shit. When you love someone, you care about their feelings. You try to never willingly hurt them. I‚Äôm sorry to tell you this but this man doesn‚Äôt love you. At all. You put him on a pedestal and and he knows it. He knows that you have so many insecurities that you would put up with anything cause you don‚Äôt love yourself.   You should divorce him. Not because you‚Äôre dark and ugly but because you‚Äôre worth way more than this. You need therapy, you need healing. There‚Äôs a lot of self hate and internalized racism in this rant.

Almost all men I have had "guy talk"with love the overall look of a woman. This includes graphic admiration chats about girls that are "flat". I have known men who love and only date "flat" women.   I don't discriminate. I have loved all kinds of body shapes (not obese or anorexic!!!). Tiny boobs, medium, large, very large...so long as the woman who has them is a sweet feminine woman, you take off your bra in front of me...your boobs are getting sucked and loved on.

4lh1kkgg	That is great! Hope it helps boost you up a bit.  Unfortunately, I had the opposite happen to me. I don't get to my grandparents often but was over like 2 years ago. I noticed that they had my brother, sister, 2 cousins senior pictures up and also pictures of their 2 great grandchildren. The picture of me was nowhere to be found.  I've had problems with addiction, a bunch of legal trouble, been in a bad marriage where my ex wife didn't like my family so I kind of was distant and didn't talk to my family. My ex wife had gotten into an argument with my sister which led to problems with my mom. My mom is their daughter, so I guess everything I put them through caused them to not really like me anymore.	1642846875.0	htq78ta	t3_s9u8v5	t3_s9u8v5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9u8v5/my_grandparents_replaced_one_of_my_moms_wedding/htq78ta/

Divorce him and go talk to a therapist, because it seems that these thoughts are too deep in your head that you think that is the truth but i swear it isn't.

You‚Äôre not a label, you‚Äôre you and that‚Äôs perfect.   Before you ask him to hang out, have you guys had break or lunch together at work?  If that‚Äôs a possibility I‚Äôd start there.

7qwermio	I know how you feel... It really sucks when you feel like nobody cares or even notices but one of the biggest steps to getting better is realizing you have an issue that you need to deal with. Even if nobody else will help, you can help yourself have the life you want. Trust me I've been in those exsact shoes before. I had a very abusive and toxic upbringing and I became very depressed and suicidal in my teen years and I still have upp and down patches. I got to a point where I was addicted to pills and cutting. I tried to kill myself, I literally had nobody. And then that was when i realized i needed to change even if that meant keeping my head down for the next few years until i could move out. About a year later I met the love of my life, on a video game, he lived Half way across the world and I worked my ass off with 2 jobs and going to school and cleaning my entire parents house and taking care of my brothers, to save up enough money to start a new life. And although it was very rough It was honestly the best decision ive ever made. Sometimes you have to just do something, anything for yourself to remind you that you matter even if you only matter to you thats enough because at the end of the day you are who you are stuck with so you might aswell use all that sadness to motivate you into becoming someone you are proud to look at the mirror everyday.	1642848739.0	htq9s2m	t3_s9znia	t3_s9znia	/r/offmychest/comments/s9znia/just_needed_to_tell_this_to_someone/htq9s2m/

5lgbim1x	Is you inner child still trying to adjust to your surrounding?  I try to be nice as well, but more because I have filled my needs and have the power, capability, and authenticity to be nice. What's the point of being nice if all I want is good image and attention from others? I am being nice because I believe in being nice. If people are not being nice to me, that's not my problem.   Some other commenters mentioned boundaries. I agree. Having healthy boundaries is very important, because unless you know in what way you can healthily coexist with the world, it's easy to get enmeshed with others' problems that are not necessarily ours.	1642848787.0	htq9ufu	t3_s9xmva	t3_s9xmva	/r/offmychest/comments/s9xmva/im_tired_of_being_the_nice_guy/htq9ufu/

I often wish I was born a pretty white woman, just to be seen as the default race (which it is not but it's deeply ingrained into our society anyway. It's to a point where most books being written need to tell readers in some way when a character isnt white). I don't wanna be "brave" or "diverse" or "pretty but in an Asian way" or whatever, just default and beautiful.	1642849092.0	htqa9jn	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htqa9jn/

We did not speak to each other for around 6 months (we have always been extremely close). After that things thawed out  never disrespected my wife again and they get along fine now. When your mom disrespected your partner she not only disrespected him but you as well.

iwdl0yik	Ahh yes, I know this feeling all to well. I‚Äôm 24 and experienced all those feelings around the time I was 21.   First, I want to start off with saying that ‚Äúlife is a marathon, not a sprint‚Äù, and honestly you can use that with anything. Working out for example, you start off not lifting as much for several weeks and wonder how you‚Äôll ever be at your ideal bod, but the thing is usually you won‚Äôt see any major changes in a week or maybe even months, but the more you work at it I can guarantee that later down the road you‚Äôll notice how far you‚Äôve came. Even if you do take time off‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll come.  With that being said MINDSET, mindset is a huge benefactor especially this day in age. I said the same thing you said ‚ÄúI feel behind in life‚Äù. I said that to my dad so so so many times, but realized that I was only comparing myself to others (friends or people on social media). Comparing can damage your mental. Once you change that mindset (which obvi takes practice) you‚Äôll realize everything will turn out EXACTLY the way it‚Äôs supposed to. I can guarantee that you truly never know what you‚Äôre comparing yourself to when you look at social media. I knew a girl that I thought had the perfect marriage. I didn‚Äôt actually get to know that same girl until the midst of her divorce, and later realized how miserable her marriage really was. Social media can be a facade.   Nonetheless, this is your life, it is what you make of it. F it if you veer off track. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day (:  Try reading Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey. It‚Äôs a memoir of his life and experiences.  ‚ÄúKeep that twinkle in your eye. Keep on laughing and never take yourself too seriously. You can take your work as seriously as a heart attack, but don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously. Be able to laugh at yourself. Control what you can control, and when you can‚Äôt, go with the flow as best you can.‚Äù	1642849856.0	htqbc4a	t3_s9zcl5	t3_s9zcl5	/r/offmychest/comments/s9zcl5/i_wasted_2_years_doing_nothing/htqbc4a/

hujw1	This post makes me sad on so many different levels. It is so obvious that you have extremely low self worth. You even say "I still love him but I think he deserves better". Why does he deserve better? A man cheating on his wife is plainly an asshole, I am really sorry but this is the way it is. But even for that you try to find excuses for him, trying to justify his behaviour and putting yourself down. No man should cheat on his wife, especially for superficial reasons like the one you claim, i.e. looks. There is always someone better looking around the corner, does that mean a husband should go off  every time he meets someone better looking than his wife? That's not love.  Work on loving yourself and demanding the respect you deserve. So that you can move forward and find a person who will appreciate you for who you are, for both your looks and your personality. You don't deserve to feel like that because of the foul behaviour of your husband. Find the courage to stand up for yourself. I really hope you find the strength to move forward ‚ù§Ô∏è	1642849945.0	htqbgmz	t3_s9c18f	t3_s9c18f	/r/offmychest/comments/s9c18f/im_divorcing_my_husband_because_im_dark_and_ugly/htqbgmz/

You got this!	1642851671.0	htqdwum	t3_s9z1p6	t3_s9z1p6	/r/offmychest/comments/s9z1p6/the_only_reason_i_havent_killed_myself_is_because/htqdwum/
9nf2dpbw	Im so sorry this happened. You're not alone in this. I just found out I was molested as a young kid.   I wish i knew what to say to help but all i can say is FUCK your therapist!  I mean who tells someone that they should be "over it already" that's insane. It takes YEARS to heal.   I think that was a really hurtful, cruel, inappropriate and just false thing to say to you.   There is no timeline for healing from this and I would seriously consider telling your therapist how out of line that was and if possible trying to get a new one who knows how to help with this specific trauma.   Honestly your therapist is just wrong about this.	1642851747.0	htqe0sa	t3_sa0f0k	t3_sa0f0k	/r/offmychest/comments/sa0f0k/im_still_traumatized/htqe0sa/
4v7t09it	Why do you think you‚Äôre not supposed to be hurting? You and your wife are both going through something. Yes, she may have to carry the bigger burden, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt also hurt. It is ok that you are struggling.   There are other ways to build a family, you can foster, adopt, use a surrogate, get really friendly with some gay couples and help them become parents then co-parent with them. You know, all that jazz. You and your wife need to have a serious conversation about what this all means to you both and what it means for your future.   Some things you can do are clean up immediately after yourself just to keep the house a bit more tidy. Meal prep the next few days so neither of you has to worry about making food, you can just heat something up. Those are both small things, but they‚Äôll minimize other daily tasks.   And lastly, run down to be local convenience and get some condoms.   I am sorry you‚Äôre going through a hard time. I really hope you both make it through stronger and together.	1642851806.0	htqe3vj	t3_sa0dn3	t3_sa0dn3	/r/offmychest/comments/sa0dn3/im_kind_of_struggling_with_my_wifes_abortion_even/htqe3vj/

95ta5g32	I'm sorry this happened to you also. This happened to me in my early 20s. He even said he enjoyed it when I said no, because it felt like he was raping me. I rationalized that I must have consented because I didn't try to get away. I felt so ashamed, I told myself it wasn't rape so I could push it out of my mind. When I had finally admitted it happened years later, I started to heal. None of this was your fault.	1642851876.0	htqe7ii	t3_s9k8oi	t3_s9k8oi	/r/offmychest/comments/s9k8oi/was_i_raped_30f/htqe7ii/

They kept him multi-status (not sure the official term) so he was technically in both services at once. This made it easy for him to be moved to whatever facility needed his problem-solving abilities.    Of course, his explanation was that the Air Force was where you landed if you were too smart to be a soldier. ;)	1642852580.0	htqf83s	t3_s9f844	t1_htp4mmx	/r/offmychest/comments/s9f844/i_love_my_husbands_phobia/htqf83s/

Vaccines don‚Äôt exist to reduced symptoms they are meant to stop transmission, the media changed the narrative when they realized that these vaccines will not get us to herd immunity (the CDC actually changed their definition of vaccinated from ‚Äúprovides immunity‚Äù to ‚Äúprovides protection‚Äù). Not to mention the insane amount of ‚Äúrare‚Äù heart inflammation and blood clotting tied to this shot. This vaccine has killed more people in one year than every vaccine on earth administered in the last 30 years, this is not helping us it‚Äôs hurting us.	1642852652.0	htqfbtd	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpy564	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqfbtd/

trngu	Sounds like you are a more introverted person. As an introvert myself, the best advice I can give is to STOP feeling as though wanting to be alone is wrong. The second you get over that thought, it becomes desired to be alone.   The more time you spend alone, the more true to your actual self that you can become. The more of your actual self you can show to others, without the weight of questioning what others will think hovering over you, the more that people will be drawn to your personality.   Early-late 20's I didnt have friends, and honestly didnt want them. Just focused on living my life, finding out what I like when im truly alone. Just figuring out life, and the path along it I wish to lead. Once I figured that out, and started working towards what I wanted, without worrying about others, then people began to be drawn to me. Mid 30's now, have a great job, awesome coworkers and a spectacular girlfriend. Just enjoy the ride of life, and stop worrying about others.

9nf2dpbw	That is an awful situation to be in. It must be so unbelievably hard.   This may not help you but I am studying to be a funeral director and my textbook says that if you can channel your grief into making something pysical and tangible it can help you a little bit.   Especially making something by hand, like an artwork or a quilt or making a stuffed animal or a birdfeeder or something.   If it is something meaningful to the person's life, personality, hobbies, etc it can be helpful as a way to honor them.   But also it can help if you make something that is a physical representation of your grief, like an abstract thing.

ao6iji6k	Deep down, do you really think you want to be with him still or are you just afraid of not being with someone?   I just went through a breakup too. He wanted a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù but I knew it was over. I freaked out cuz he broke up with me out of the blue, 4 days after my birthday. He lead me on for 6 weeks after that‚Ä¶ too afraid to say it was really over. He basically forced me to end it. It was cruel and selfish. He said he needed time to himself but then at the end said he had feelings for someone else now‚Ä¶ like it just happened in the last 2 weeks. Oh and they hooked up the night before we planned to meet to talk.   Anyway‚Ä¶. Now that it‚Äôs completely done with I can confidently say that it wasn‚Äôt right for me and I was trying to salvage something that was just ok. There was never any major spark for me. We got along great and had fun, but it could never have been long term. Over the weeks that he lead me on I was a mess. I was panicky and anxious and couldn‚Äôt eat. But it wasn‚Äôt about losing HIM. It was about losing a partner and being alone. I see now that I have some codependent issues and I‚Äôm going to take this time to work on myself. This time is a gift.   I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre situation is similar, but even if it‚Äôs not and you truly feel that he was your person‚Ä¶. You WILL be ok no matter how it works out. You‚Äôre very young and have so much time to see who you are and find the perfect match. It‚Äôs so sad and scary to go through a breakup, but I‚Äôve serial dating since I was 15 and I‚Äôm now 35. I‚Äôve gone through so many breakups where I felt like I would die from the heart break. I was miserable and sad and thought no one would love me again‚Ä¶ but I was wrong. I was always wrong. I was always ok and I always found better and better relationships. You learn from each experience and you grow and then you keep finding better partners. So even if it‚Äôs scary and hurts right now, that‚Äôs ok. I can very confidently say that you‚Äôre going to be fine if it ends.   Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about why it is happening or what you did. Sometimes things just run their course and then that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs ok to grieve for what you had, but know that the world has something even better in store for you somewhere.	1642855773.0	htqk4fl	t3_sa1lsd	t3_sa1lsd	/r/offmychest/comments/sa1lsd/i_got_dumped_without_any_reason/htqk4fl/

On the day I arrived she was ashen grey at home. That evening she couldn‚Äôt breathe and I went with her in the ambulance to the hospital. The doctor said directly to her that she was in her final moments and to say what she‚Äôs needed to say. When she died, I lost myself, my world, my love. Even as I write this, my tears are welling and I‚Äôm holding back tears. It‚Äôs going to take time to feel again. I know you don‚Äôt want to hear it, but you‚Äôll find your laughter again.

Anyone who falls for conspiracy theories and QAnon bullshit was fed the koolaid, not people who trust science and want to keep themselves and others protected against a virus.

3ukffzf5	 Loosing love for someone after that long isn't normal, my experience says he's probably either going through a big transition or his hormones are off so he needs time to himself to figure it out. But if nothing has changed for him either he kept you around because he didn't have another option and you were easy to keep around for his benefit, and now that's not the case, or you've done something to him he can't get past.   Give it time and see, but I wouldn't beg for him to come back when he doesn't want to, who wants to be with someone that doesn't want them?   Sometimes people are in relationships because they're scared to be alone, not because they really like the person.	1642856810.0	htqlvhy	t3_sa1lsd	t3_sa1lsd	/r/offmychest/comments/sa1lsd/i_got_dumped_without_any_reason/htqlvhy/

cc3i2x1	I say keep doing what you're doing because you play an important part in keeping things together. I think some confuse your typical kindness with special kindness which is why certain acts might get overlooked. Something as simple as the enthusiasm you show for a friend or potential friend might come off as "oh they're always just like that" instead of seeing you're excited to hang with them specifically. That doesn't mean you need to dim your light, but be intentional when you want to show interest and connect with others, whether that means reserving some of the nice things you do for certain people or going the extra mile when you really want to show that you care.

3yaj2rnt	I lost my father to suicide in 2019. For a long time afterwards (hell, even now, on occasion), I felt exactly as you did. I hated the world for taking him from me. I hated everyone who made him feel so alone that he thought his only way out was eating a bullet. I hated my mom, I hated myself, everything. Seeing other people happy made me angry because they should have been suffering like I did. My whole world was shattered and everyone else‚Äôs was spinning like normal and I hated it. Eventually, the memories of the good times will come to the forefront. Just give it time.

9nf2dpbw	I have had painful bunions since I was 11. (im 23 now)  The pain is really awful but my mom always told me to ignore it and that it was normal so I got used to it and actually kinda forgot that I was in pain. I kinda thought everyone lived like that with horrible foot pain everyday.  As a teen I used to dream about the day that I could finally get surgery and have an excuse to use a wheelchair for a bit and not have to walk on my feet anymore but I didnt realize it was because of the pain.  Long story but basically I totally get what you're saying about the idea of being able to use one being a relief!  I started using a wheelchair this summer and the first day I used it I was so shocked to not be in pain anymore. I didnt know what it was like to live without pain.    Obviously I dont know your situation but maybe you could have something like that, on top of as the not recognizing your legs/not wanting your legs to be there anymore.  Just a random idea because it happened to me, doesnt mean that is is what is happening to you :)	1642858552.0	htqowst	t3_sa1v2a	t1_htqmm84	/r/offmychest/comments/sa1v2a/i_want_to_amputate_my_own_legs/htqowst/

anpof6yp	I figured someone was going to ask, long story short, she was being physically abusive towards me, she comes from a abusive family. I was tired of her getting upset and thinking it was okay that she can put her hands on me. Its no excuse how mad we get each other, we should never put our hands on each other. Even during her pregnancy she felt it was okay to get violent with me and break up my belongings because ‚Äú she is upset ‚Äú. She knew i would never physically attack back. I warned her once our child got here i was not going to put up with that shit. One day she decides to grab a belt and try to choke me out with it, we tussled and i ran out the house. I called my family members and decided i need to break up with her, thats when she turned spiteful. I have seen my daughter once at my college graduation ( my mom and her friends persuaded her to bring my child, so she wouldnt miss out on being there when i walked the stage ). I had went to her house last night with a cop to check on her, she told the cop i wasnt allowed to see her, and when the cop asked why, she claimed that i was ‚Äúangry‚Äù and wouldnt bring her to the door to let me see her. When asked why she wont reply to me or my family request to see her, she had no answer, literally shrugged her shoulders.	1642858828.0	htqpf3z	t3_s9wbyk	t1_htqog0c	/r/offmychest/comments/s9wbyk/all_the_young_fellas_with_no_kids_be_careful_who/htqpf3z/

9319mxt	Men have a higher successful suicide rate than men. Women actually attempt suicide more often but are less successful. Gender differences in suicide are not the issue, prevention of all suicide attempts is. You have exactly the same rights to help as anyone else. With that said, this response is based on a western (UK) perspective so forgive me if your country has different rules that discriminate against men.   If you‚Äôre insecure about your height, that‚Äôs a totally valid issue but the your insecurity is the only issue that you actually have the power to do anything about.  I know plenty of great short guys who‚Äôve been super successful in relationships because they have been able to overcome their insecurity in one way or another. They‚Äôve found great girls who don‚Äôt care that they are short. Some women will always be shallow about men‚Äôs looks. Some men will always be shallow about women‚Äôs looks. The only way you can ever feel better about that in the long run is by working on YOUR state of mind.   And I agree, society has historically disregarded men‚Äôs feelings and told them to ‚Äúman up‚Äù. But this is changing for the better and today men do not have less access to mental health resources than women do. They have the same sick allowance, the same drugs and therapists etc. The only reason it seems that mental health support is more geared towards women is that women have a higher occurrence of specific issues that disproportionately affect them (I‚Äôm referring to sexual assault/harassment, domestic violence, wage gaps, parental gender roles, menstrual issues, etc). Men struggle with these issues too and have their own specific issues but some simply are not as prevalent or severe.  That does not mean nobody gives a shit about your problems. But if you interpret this as such, you clearly have deeper rooted issues that you need to work through and that is absolutely OK.  And just as an aside, here in the UK I have watched countless men who access mental health support services be seen quicker than women and get referred to specialists more often, presumably because the male suicide rate is so much higher and also because men access these services less frequently (because of toxic masculinity or stigma or whatever other reason). Women‚Äôs mental health issues are stigmatised too. Peers and colleagues are far more likely to associate them with menstrual cycles, being an exhausted mum, or just being too sensitive and a doctor is more likely to interpret them as less severe or valid. So as a man you‚Äôre actually more likely to be taken seriously by a GP and get a higher level of support than women if you just access the services.   Seek the mental health help and support you need. It is out there and your barriers to accessing it are the same as that of a woman. If the people (men and women) around you are bringing you down because of toxic masculinity or shallowness, choose to associate less with them and more with decent people. There are far less decent people out there but they do exist. And please understand that by asserting that men have it so much worse than women, you are totally undermining women‚Äôs issues. We all have our crosses to bear and we can understand each other on a 1 to 1 basis if we are willing to listen.	1642859782.0	htqr8qe	t3_s9zwcs	t3_s9zwcs	/r/offmychest/comments/s9zwcs/i_fucking_hate_being_a_man/htqr8qe/

30gbe4cv	Hiii :) I see a few other comments have said this too but omg I relate *hard*... I've always done my best to build people up and do whatever I can to help basically anyone, and a lot of times that has lead to me getting hurt or doing things I don't want to do.  The 'specific' examples you gave - I relate to all of them ;-; it hurts when people say things like 'yeah come of you want, I don't mind' because then I just worry that I'm overstepping or they're just being polite.  I'm working on it though. For a few years I've been so invested in one of my friends because we have a lot of similar interests, but they really aren't a supportive person - which is fine, but I feel like we're kind of incompatible as close friends. It sucks because I feel like I'm being mean and rude to them, but I'm just not putting in the *extra effort* any more and mentally I'm a lot better off. I feel conflicted about it, but know that it is okay to not go above and beyond sometimes, especially if you don't get the support you want in return. A few comments have said be careful noone is taking advantage of you as well, I'm so bad at this because I want to see the best in people **all the time** but it is true, be careful!   I made a group of friends online last year who I feel so supported by, they mean the world to me and I feel like they give as much to me as I give to them, it's fantastic. When you meet people you can reply on like that, it energy they give you is amazing. They helped me be more supportive in the right ways, and help me be a better person every day. Keep going!! I'm sure you'll find your tribe.   I just want you to know that you are seen, and people appreciate all you do for them so much. Some people might not show it, but that doesn't mean what you do is less important. The world needs more people like you friend <3	1642859943.0	htqrjxb	t3_s9krkg	t3_s9krkg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9krkg/i_love_to_make_people_feel_wanted_and_included_in/htqrjxb/

chxgjqks	I am not sure your taking the national mindsets into account properly, or in the case of NK assuming they have the sanity in the "Divine" leader *coughs* lardass.   Russia has 80% of its population in 20% of its land and has always been able to exchange space for time in the past but that isn't the case right now with the loss of the so much territory in the last 30 years, so many of the critical pieces of Russian identity are either belonging to a different country (Sevastopol in Crimea to Ukraine despite the illegal occupation) and or within striking range of a coalition that was formed to keep, albeit a previous incarnation of the country, at bay that is currently expanding into it former territories, also illegally sized and occupied. The Russian mindset is more akin to an abuse survivor, your logical assumption of rational action doesn't apply because that is not the rules they are adhering too. 1940's Germany wasn't able to sustain a long war or a two front war and yet look at how it unfolded.    China likewise is in a strong position compared to their Century of Humiliation, and their military is stronger than you are giving credit for I fear, not in contrast to the US but against Taiwan's defenses before America can get there. Look at the history of China starting with the First Opium War and you see how China was not a viable power in the world stage because of the Qing's close mindedness and how it was forced to sign the Unequal Treaties and how the scars of the past are source of shame that they are trying to overcome still.	1642860320.0	htqsa9q	t3_s9e3fb	t1_htmm9lk	/r/offmychest/comments/s9e3fb/a_domino_of_wars/htqsa9q/

It‚Äôs a strength that you have! It‚Äôs why you‚Äôre compassionate towards others. The downside is that you need to be included. BUT! You can have conversations with the people closest to you about this and they can be sure to include you.

Just remember it does not define you and you can absolutely be anything you want. I saw your edits about how you can't study without help from your dad, I understand that and I'm not gonna pressure you to, but please remember that you are strong beautiful and powerful despite what your family friends or what society has to say about it.   You can always join the peace corps someday but I'm not sure of the requirements. I'm sure most people can join as long as your not a criminal, its not studying but its all paid for and you get to travel around the world learn new languages and help people in need. I'm gonna be doing that after earning my bachelor's, so maybe I'll see you there!!

2ej5xkow	Ugh yup you guys, NO conspiracy theories at all exist! There wasn't any sort of child-raping occurring! God it makes me so sad because right when we catch Jeffrey Epstein with his little black book, all of a sudden there's a popular conspiracy theory going around that blows the idea way out of proportion and makes anyone talking about people in power raping children look like they support trump and are alt-right.   You guys do know and recognize there are a bunch of rich people raping kids every day right?  Not that that gives creed to QAnon, but try to understand, the influence of power is massive. I fully believe QAnon was intentionally started because it made the child rape talk seem preposterous. Our response to stimuli can be conditioned without us even knowing it. Like, my personal friends are able to see this stuff too - yet, when I go to talk about it with them, the air of the conversation just starts dulling out in a way, like it's not being taken seriously.  When Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, surely people knew that pointed to an agenda unshared by those with it to the world, to keep secrets quiet. Why in the world should we declare that all potential bad things we don't know about beyond a certain level, *cannot* occur??  Also, just as a fun additional part, note how the Kyle Rittenhouse trial received tons of medial coverage and was the talk of the day for a bit, whereas Maxwell was very scarcely talked about and some of my friends didn't even know she went to trial. Yeah it's hard to keep secrets but it's easy to suppress the journalistic reporting of anything. How many repubs know that Trump doesn't pay most of his taxes?  How many people knew about Jeffrey Epstein BEFORE he got in trouble?	1642861601.0	htquujr	t3_s9gzx4	t1_hto9uer	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htquujr/

i4rplyk5	I know you disagree with him, but in reality it‚Äôs his body his choice. When getting a vaccine, you sign a contract understanding the risks associated and basically if one of these risks harm you then you can‚Äôt sue for damages. If he‚Äôs unwilling to sign that agreement, and take on those risks, that‚Äôs his choice. It‚Äôs annoying, but it‚Äôs his choice. Perhaps maybe instead of being annoyed and angry, try talking to him. I talked to my friend who isn‚Äôt anti-vaccines she just doesn‚Äôt trust the covid-19 vaccines. I don‚Äôt agree with her, but I can see why she‚Äôs concerned. I myself do not trust the Pfizer vaccine, but I made the decision to get the AstraZeneca vaccine instead. By listening to her concerns and not immediately calling her a conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxer, danger to society, I made her feel comfortable and safe to talk about it. She hasn‚Äôt been vaccinated yet, but she is about to once this new vaccine, that I encouraged her to research, comes out in my country. We have to accept some people are not comfortable doing things, but we should be accomodating and positive and make them feel safe to talk about their concerns instead of just calling them an idiot. I love my friend, and I empathise with her concerns, and I have helped her find a way to be both vaccinated and comfortable with the situation to accept the risks and sign that contract. Mandates are also proven to lower vaccination rates, the famous case being britain enforcing a vaccine mandate I think it was in the 70s or 90s. Try talking to your dad and maybe you‚Äôll be able to convince him and he‚Äôll be able to get his job back.	1642861651.0	htquyae	t3_s9gzx4	t3_s9gzx4	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htquyae/

57gwj	That sucks, I'm sorry they are behaving this way. It is one of the pitfalls of being the organizer/the person who is always in touch with people. Usually others forget that it needs to be reciprocal and they start taking it for granted.  Sometimes, if you're more outgoing, you will make friends with people who struggle to reach out, as well. I myself have that difficulty because I feel when someone doesn't talk to me, it's because they don't want to, not that there may be something else that came up. I wouldn't write them off completely, but maybe take the opportunity to reach out to them and see who asks you about your absence. They may also be thinking that something is going on that you are trying to deal with and didn't want to share with them. I think their reaction to you reaching out again will tell you more about your friendship.  It is hard to make friends as an adult, that is true, but that doesn't mean that it's healthy to hold onto people who aren't supporting you in the friendship, either. You sound like a good person and I hope you have people in your life who treat you with respect and care about you.	1642862000.0	htqvogb	t3_sa2xmi	t3_sa2xmi	/r/offmychest/comments/sa2xmi/i_deliberately_cut_myself_off_from_my_friends_to/htqvogb/

i4rplyk5	I can sympathise with your dad. I believe the Pfizer vaccine is slightly untrustworthy due to reports of unhygienic lab conduct, falsifying test results, and dodgy human testing. Some of these things are not confirmed, but there have been many whistleblowers recently. I also didn‚Äôt completely understand how the Pfizer vaccine worked. I refuse to get the Pfizer vaccine also due to their attitude to shutting people down and calling them idiots and stupid instead of trying to politely communicate and educate them and create a positive environment. Instead, I researched other vaccine options and found AstraZeneca made me feel comfortable. They were majority privately funded, they didn‚Äôt seem too concerned with earning a profit, and there were a few things that made me a bit annoyed such as the lack of research on how it affects womens menstrual cycle, but overall I was happy with it. Try talking to your dad and allow him to express his concerns and questions without criticising or judging him. Try and help him find a vaccine that makes him feel comfortable. By creating a positive and comfortable environment for him, you can help him find a covid vaccine he feels comfortable taking and then it‚Äôs a winning situation for all	1642862413.0	htqwk1u	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htnfi1m	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqwk1u/

8zbb6	It‚Äôs not paranoid to have a low enough risk tolerance that a vaccine that hasn‚Äôt done long-term testing. It‚Äôs perfectly valid to be afraid in that case.  Also, fine. Fire the unvaccinated. Next is the obese; they cost too much in medical insurance. Then it‚Äôs the smokers; they‚Äôll likely develop cancer and the company is stuck hiring someone else, why go through that trouble? Then younger women; at least 90% of the time, it‚Äôs their choice to have kids and leave for 12-18 months. Hell, let‚Äôs extend that to anyone with kids; they‚Äôre always asking for accommodation to bring their kids to appointments and stuff.  I don‚Äôt believe in any of that, I‚Äôm 100% for equal access to employment. But I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a slippery slope towards them rejecting competent candidates for something that has nothing to do with the job. I say that especially from the perspective of someone living in Quebec: we‚Äôve had the strictest lockdown rules in North America this whole time and were the only place in North America to instate a curfew *twice*: give them an inch, they‚Äôll take a mile.	1642862532.0	htqwt5r	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htppfdt	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqwt5r/

i4rplyk5	I agree. I think OP should try and talk to their dad and make sure it‚Äôs a comfortable and positive safe space. If they could make him feel heard then maybe they could help find a vaccine option that what make the dad comfortable. Also, a vaccine is considered a contract, and there are many countries with laws against ‚Äúbacking people into corners‚Äù to force them to sign a contract. Also, it‚Äôs his body his choice. There is also no duty of care the dad has to anyone else when deciding to get the vaccine. We need to create a safe space for people to voice their concerns about the vaccine so that we can understand their feelings and make them feel heard.	1642862676.0	htqx4jy	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqnv56	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqx4jy/

bpk3faen	He‚Äôs not the one who deserves better. The problem is not that you‚Äôre ugly or not good enough for him, it‚Äôs that he keeps cheating on you, and you are feeling ugly and not good enough for him as a result.   Just like, as I‚Äôm sure you know, people with darker skin are not inferior, but often feel inferior as a result of lighter skinned people - and our global society as a whole - treating them is if they are inferior.   Another thing these two scenarios have in common is that people often treat other people as if they are inferior in order to keep them down - whether it is done consciously or not.   Divorcing him definitely sounds like the right move. Not giving the time of day to people who ever imply that you don‚Äôt deserve the love of your partner would be a good move too.

i4rplyk5	I do believe that your family members shouldn‚Äôt have been fired. It is their choice to be vaccinated. However, comparing mandates to the Holocaust is an extremity. The Holocaust is a tragic and god awful historical event that is just so hard to explain in words of how awful it was. It is wrong of them to downplay such an awful part of history. However, vaccine mandates are more comparable to ‚Äúbacking people into a corner‚Äù to sign a contract. I think it would be best if someone listened to their concerns and made them feel heard, perhaps try and help them find a vaccine option that makes them feel comfortable. By creating a positive and safe place for people to discuss the vaccine and instead judging them we can increase vaccination rates.	1642863071.0	htqxzwr	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqvoqc	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqxzwr/
7muapoa5	Some people would never think of doing this. Testing their friendships. I don't know the dynamic here, but it comes across a bit manipulative. I'm sure you have your reasoning, but consider this example.  Ex. Offering to pay for something and accrediting yourself as a nice person. While the act is nice, make sure you're not doing it for the wrong reasons, creating expectations.  Consider in this scenario the person is more than likely capable of paying/helping themselves. They don't just "give things." You in turn the following week ran out of money and this friend doesn't offer to pay. How do you react?	1642863171.0	htqy7ym	t3_sa2xmi	t3_sa2xmi	/r/offmychest/comments/sa2xmi/i_deliberately_cut_myself_off_from_my_friends_to/htqy7ym/
587rvh26	Hey girlie, it makes me so sad to hear you bash yourself like this. Your insecurities are real, and although I‚Äôm white and will never ever understand what it‚Äôs like for you to constantly be told by society that you‚Äôre not beautiful, I‚Äôm so sorry that you have to hear those words and I want you to know that I don‚Äôt believe them for a second.  Although I‚Äôve never felt the way you do, I‚Äôm in a mixed race relationship and have had similar conversations with my SO about him not feeling good enough for me. I didn‚Äôt really understand how deep these issues go for POC people until he explained it, and how much it really starts from childhood. To me, he‚Äôs just my wonderful amazing partner. I try to remind him that I think he‚Äôs amazing and cute a lot, but I know that his confidence issues are something that he is slowly getting through by himself, and that years of being put down by stereotypes and being told that his nonwhite features ‚Äúaren‚Äôt attractive‚Äù (no matter how BS that is) cannot be done away with overnight. Ultimately, I can‚Äôt imagine him looking any other way because he‚Äôs the one I chose to be with, and I hope that someday he feels that way too. And, by extension, I hope you feel this way too as well.   I‚Äôm sorry your husband made you feel not good enough, but really (and I know you won‚Äôt believe me right now) that‚Äôs not a you problem, that‚Äôs a husband problem. I don‚Äôt know you, but you are beautiful and you are worthy of love and care. You are worthy of someone looking at you and seeing you as the most beautiful and attractive person they‚Äôve ever seen. Someday I hope you will get there.

3cn48val	Have you reached out to the deaf community? One of my children is slowly losing their hearing and it‚Äôs very hard. I have been told lots of positive things about how welcoming and inclusive the deaf community is.   Do you know sign language? Are your friends willing to learn sign language? Or can you lip read? Hopefully they are good enough friends to try to keep you included.   Cinemas do showing that have captions on that are deaf friendly and you and your friends can go to those showings.   I‚Äôm not going to down play your concerns because they are totally valid and life is a lot harder for those who are deaf or blind or disabled in anyway. Things that regular people take for granted are harder or more involved or require working around. I‚Äôm sorry that this is the case. I could point out that things are hard for everyone in different ways, your obviously bright and intelligent and articulate and life is harder for people who don‚Äôt have those skills but it won‚Äôt help you at the moment because this is not about them, or anyone else it‚Äôs about you and life is hard.   Are you in therapy? Do you have family or friends that you can talk to about this? Can you reach out to the deaf community in your local area? Honestly there are a lot of great supports out there that can help you and you deserve that help and support.  It is hard and it‚Äôs ok to be angry and frustrated about it, but do get help too. Your life is going to be great, I can tell from the way you wrote that you have a lot going for you, you just need help to unlock your potential. Please reach out and get that help.	1642863395.0	htqyplg	t3_s9yze8	t3_s9yze8	/r/offmychest/comments/s9yze8/ive_accepted_that_i_probably_will_never_fit_into/htqyplg/

il1qxnb0	As someone else said in the comments: "make sure to give yourself the same level of kindness you give to others."  And by that I mean, stand up for yourself. If someone cuts you off, let it be known, like wait until they finish their sentence and then say something like "As I was saying..." and continue what you were saying initially. It may sound petty but it shows that you don't back down and people will respect you more for it. If they keep cutting you off though, I'd just leave that conversation either physically or I'll go on my phone if I can't physically leave. What's the point of being in a conversation if you can't say a word?  From my experience being kind but letting people treat you unkindly is a recipe for being taken advantage of, or worse, being abused. It's important to be kind but it's just as important to not let people disrespect you. I used to let people walk over me and no one cared because I never stood up for myself (I was very insecure then and struggled with depression/anxiety). I saw myself as not worthy enough to have a voice, and that negative self-image reflected on the way people treated me.  Ever since I started standing up for myself, not only did it help with my confidence and dealing with confrontation in general, but people stopped trying to take advantage of me because they knew they couldn't manipulate me or use me anymore. They know that while I'm kind, that they shouldn't abuse my kindness.  Though I'll also mention that when being nice to people, unless it's your partner or best friend, you shouldn't expect kindness back. Do it because you enjoy being nice and making people's days a little brighter if you can - but when you start expecting that same kindness back, you're setting yourself up to be disappointed or even resentful. It's rare to find genuinely kind people. So yeah that's just my advice, as someone who was in the same exact situation as you a few years ago :'D I hope that helps!	1642863478.0	htqyw2z	t3_s9krkg	t3_s9krkg	/r/offmychest/comments/s9krkg/i_love_to_make_people_feel_wanted_and_included_in/htqyw2z/

i4rplyk5	I slightly disagree with your comment. I can sympathise with OP‚Äôs dad. He doesn‚Äôt trust the vaccine, and that is his choice. Prior to receiving the vaccine, you should have signed an agreement that you understood the risks associated with it and that if these risks harmed you, you or your kin could not sue for damages. That is a contract. I am a law student, and in my contracts subject we are taught about legislation in my country that protects individuals from being ‚Äúback into a corner‚Äù and forced to sign a contract. Instead, we can create a comfortable and positive safe space for people who do not trust the vaccine to voice their concerns and opinions to help them feel listened and comfortable. We can then aide them to help find a vaccine choice that they are comfortable with. I did this with myself, I found Pfizer to be rude and I could not trust them. I also did not understand how their vaccine worked. So, I did research and found AstraZeneca to be more trustworthy and I also understood how it worked. If we did this for everyone, for our friends and family, we can increase vaccination rates. Vaccine mandates have also proven to lower vaccination rates, as evident by a vaccine mandate brought in by the British government between the 70s-90s (sorry I couldn‚Äôt remember exactly). I disagree with the dad‚Äôs decision but I sympathise with him. I also think it is good he stuck with his beliefs and morals instead of being backed into a corner. It is also important to remember vaccines is an individual‚Äôs choice as it will affect the body. Their body their choice. They have no duty of care to anyone, and I slightly believe it is entitled and selfish to demand someone get vaccinated whether it be against their beliefs. Since there were claims that a fetus‚Äô cells were used in the production of the Pfizer vaccine, many people refused to get it due to religious reasons. I did not believe the claim was real, but what if it was? Pfizer just shut down these people before trying to hold a safe and positive conversation to address their concerns. Do you think this kind of attitude inclines them to get vaccinated? However, instead of calling these people selfish and stupid, I talked to them about it and convinced them to instead research into other possible vaccine choices that aligned with their religious beliefs, and made them feel comfortable.	1642863774.0	htqzjix	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqxfzl	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htqzjix/

I've literally live your example. God knows how many times I've bought the cinema tickets, bought the drinks at the pub, been the designated driver, etc. and asked for nothing in return. However, I'm not asking for exact equilibrium in my friendships so I never expect a 50/50 relationship. But I wanted to know if there was at least any desire to keep me in their lives without making too grand a gesture.

i4rplyk5	Agreed! I think people need to understand that sometime throughout their life they‚Äôve gotten a cold and maybe they went to work, school or just out. They then passed that cold onto someone else, and maybe that person came into contact with a vulnerable person and that person eventually died. This is the law of nature. You could be vaccinated against measles and still pass it. A good example is how my older sister got exposed to the chickenpox virus when she was a newborn baby. She was still breast feeding and therefore had antibodies from my mum. I got chickenpox and then my sister got exposed to the virus a second time, but she didn‚Äôt have the vaccine yet because she was too young and didn‚Äôt have natural immunity. Therefore, she got shingles. I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it because I can‚Äôt control a virus. Even now being vaccinated against covid, I can still get it and spread it. It could be spread to my grandma by accident. This is the sad truth but reality to diseases and unfortunately it‚Äôs something we have to accept. Yes we can try and minimise the damage, but how many people skip their flu shots or actively went to work when sick and didn‚Äôt care if they were a danger to others back then?	1642864482.0	htr13q3	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htpz5gu	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htr13q3/

8zbb6	People don‚Äôt see either of those elements, so they squabble between vaccinated and unvaccinated instead of seeing the real problems:  The virus. We need non-political, science ONLY-based guidelines *officially* given to a territory by doctors and researchers who are actually in communication with doctors elsewhere. No more of this ‚Äúwe pass recommendations to the big cheese, he puts his own spin on it‚Äù bullshit, which I will get into later. I feel like having clear, common sense directions that aren‚Äôt changing every week will make it easier for people to follow and protect themselves properly. People will probably follow basic health measures a lot more if there‚Äôs some kind of transparency and consistency worldwide. People need to work together to fight the virus, and that‚Äôs hard to do when you‚Äôre constantly being divided by the media and politicians.  Which brings me to the incompetent politicians, better known as parasites. Again, I‚Äôll use Quebec as an example. I already mentioned tougher measures than elsewhere, curfew, there‚Äôs domestic vaccine passports that you can‚Äôt even get into Costco or Wal-mart without now, there‚Äôs a constant witch hunt against the unvaccinated, with new measures directed at them by a smirking minister of health, there‚Äôs micromanagement of how we can spend our private time and where: everything is closed, and you can‚Äôt be at any private address besides your own except some exceptions that intentionally leave out the age group that mostly didn‚Äôt vote for him. Oh, but I am forced to follow class in a room with 30 people for 3 hours, like all other students. I can go on, but here‚Äôs what they haven‚Äôt been spending money on: ventilation in elementary and high schools, which are a huge vector of spread partially for their bad ventilation, increases in hospital capacity and staff, since our hospitals fill up almost every flu season already. Here‚Äôs what they did spend money on: divisive language and cultural policies, a hockey team (that didn‚Äôt go through with Bettman), never-ending project studies for a bridge/tunnel that isn‚Äôt needed, radio and TV commercials, development of a vaccine passport system and app, and countless hours of police OT and gas to patrol during the two curfews, one of which was four months long (if I remember correctly, I don‚Äôt remember the end date, but it was at least four). All pandemic decisions are made by the premier‚Äôs ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù to please his boomer voter base, and as soon as you question him, you‚Äôre a labeled a conspiracy theorist. That‚Äôs another thing we have to unite and fight against: we need to get these crusty, crooked career politicians out of office and replace them with professionals who will put advancement of society over being re-elected. We need to get rid of an over-zealous dictator that, instead of fixing what‚Äôs wrong with the system that got us here, insists on doing the same things that had more harm on people‚Äôs mental health than benefits to the pandemic, and constantly shifts the blame onto others. First it was the travelers, then the 18-30 year olds, today the unvaccinated, but never the government, and we always pay for it. But again, with the divisive tactics by the government and media, forget everyone coming together.	1642864573.0	htr1b6i	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htqxehf	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htr1b6i/

3u7g53gi	Sometimes the simplest way to change your thought process is to remind yourself of the Law of Attraction. This is only one of the twelve laws of the universe. Maybe knowing that thoughts have frequency and when this frequency is emitted into the Esther it in turn will attract and return more of the same thoughts to you keeping you in a vicious cycle of the very thing you are trying to escape. When you are triggered to begin this particular thought process be aware and work to change it to a new frequency. Thoughts that will help get you to where you want to be emotionally and physically. Just my advice in hope of helping. I have been in that loop of beating myself up over and over again and it was through learning to let go, understanding that life is trial and error, adversity isn't a weakness it's our greatest strength and that risks are necessary in order to evolve. Negative thought patterns just keep us stuck and in a victim mentality..a victim of our self abuse..you are amazing for taking a leap of faith..credit yourself for being brave enough to do that..because of that you are not a failure. Success isn't about how much money you make or what you own. Success is to be fearless , take chances and if it doesn't go exactly as planned you keep going forward with the same courage and persistence and not let it forever hold you back. All the roads you travel are full of lessons to learn on this journey we call life. Evolving to a higher level of consciousness is what life truly is about and adversity is one of the greatest teachers.	1642864976.0	htr28hc	t3_sa3bzn	t3_sa3bzn	/r/offmychest/comments/sa3bzn/i_want_to_wipe_my_memory_clean/htr28hc/

3xt6vhcg	I think that non defined relationships are harmful for both parties, you two need to know what kind of relationship you‚Äôre having, is it a platonic colleague friendship or is it dating. If its a friendship then it must have boundaries like not talking about topics too personal and that overall talks that isnt about university subjects should be reduced so that none of you gets too attached to the other, but if its a dating/ getting to know each other as in finding if you two fit as a couple then it shouldn‚Äôt take longer than like a 3 month friendship that a decision mush be made whether you want to be together or not. Peoples emotional capacity is limited and it will be so harmful mentally if you two got attracted to each other for a long time and couldn‚Äôt make it work.

Get yourself doing something you‚Äôve always wanted to get better at and they will come back around. At that point it‚Äôll be your choice to receive them happily or not. Ive distanced myself from friends aswell in the past and it has only benefit me personally. They now respect my presence more than I‚Äôd ever want. I kind of just pop in to remind myself why I got out in the first place. I‚Äôm 26 for reference. You got this dog.   Also be mindful that other people have their own things going on. It might not be as priority to them as much as it is to you. If you‚Äôve never voiced anything you may benefit from trying that before going radio silent and hoping they chase you.. as we get older it‚Äôs hard to justify keeping someone around who is emotionally unstable and does tacky or spiteful things to the people they care about. Not say that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing at all but it might benefit running your thought process through that filter once or twice. I have been in your exact position though that is for sure so I wish you the best of luck. Hopefully find some friends that genuinely appreciate your company.

I didn‚Äôt see a problem with changing it but she got so angry and looked at me like I was less than human. I‚Äôm not Hispanic but I look Hispanic and typically, they are very racist towards Hispanic people in my area, even the ones who work at the grocery store. They make them do the very dirty work in the food mart which I feel so bad for them.   The Japanese people here in my area stay to themselves mostly and are respectful. The Chinese people are super cool and don‚Äôt give a crap lol. Every Filipino person I met is awesome too and whatnot.

(It would help you to get a job with really good pay) ‚Äî> I am not saying having more money can make you instantly happy but it helps you use it to travel and meet new people in different states or countries.

9cfeplpz	Totally agree with your post. It‚Äôs difficult with this side of the family because they‚Äôre against vaccines in general. Their children haven‚Äôt been vaccinated AT ALL, for anything. The amount of conversations I‚Äôve tried to have with them about this is insane, I‚Äôve tried to make it as positive as possible. They‚Äôre just so engulfed in the Facebook medical community. IMO, using the holocaust as a comparison is unforgivable. They want to be segregated so bad to push the narrative of ‚Äúgovernment bad‚Äù. Just sucks because they‚Äôre super cool people but this has really deterred me from wanting to see them. My aunt also made a fake vaccine confirmation so she can still do things socially, which is illegal.

i4rplyk5	Understandable. If they‚Äôve placed themselves in an environment such as Facebook anti vaccine groups, it‚Äôs difficult to communicate with them. One of my cousin-in-laws used to be anti-vax, but then my uncle (a doctor) was very polite to them and showed them all the medical research on every vaccinate available to their children. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend isolating yourself from them as it might reinforce the echo chamber they‚Äôve placed themselves into. I‚Äôm very happy to hear that you were as positive as possible, a lot of people aren‚Äôt like that and it‚Äôs such a shame. I think it mainly stems from not understanding how vaccines work, and false reports and studies such as the one that states vaccines cause autism. I read a study that people who have studied vaccines in school and understand how they work are substantially less likely to be anti-vaxed. In my country and state, we have a law that states you cannot receive government assistance if your children are not vaccinated but only with vaccines that have been approved by like our version of the FDA. However, my country‚Äôs FDA is very strict and is much better (less prone to corruption due to legislation etc). I am against the vaccine certificates, but what your aunt is doing is wrong. I strongly believe in upholding the law. When she gets caught, definitely reinforce the idea that she broke the law willingly. Perhaps if you persist with a positive attitude, and try and break them from the echo chamber, it could lead to a breakthrough?	1642867451.0	htr832b	t3_s9gzx4	t1_htr6qh7	/r/offmychest/comments/s9gzx4/my_dad_got_fired_for_not_getting_the_vaccine/htr832b/

sms5yzv	Being the person that hardly ever reaches out, I will leave you with my side of thoughts:  Most of the time it's not you, but me. I'm easily distracted, I get into bouts of mediocre depression, I'm easily excited and I'm very much a homebody so I don't often like to go out. Friends have told me to reach out but for some reason it's the last thing on my mind until it's two weeks later. I seriously don't even know how it happens sometimes. I'm not always like this, sometimes I will reach out and can be 'normal' for months on end and then something happens. It's all sorts of things that trigger this response, a lot of times it's  so little of a change in my mood my friends dont realize until they haven't heard from me in a while. (Also my friends are amazing people so don't think this is on them)  That being said, I know I do this and have communicated this with friends now. Although, I have lost a LOT of friends from it in the past. They felt the same way you do that I didn't care. Perhaps instead of trying to play the same game as them reach out and see if there's something going on. TELL THEM that when they don't reciprocate the communication that it hurts you. That's how I realized what I was doing and if  I know one person is taking it extra hard I will literally set alarms in my phone to contact them to make sure I'm not being a shitty friend.   This is all stuff I'm working on but progress can be slow and communication is definitely key. If you communicate this to them and you dont see at least a bit of change, that's when you should leave.

Just remember that everyone has their own speed in life, and you are not late. Youre right on time. Your life excists in your tempo, and trying to change that to fit others messes up you rythm. Do things in your own time. Trying to better yourself and go forth in life is a good thing, but TAKE YOUR TIME.

epgrbcm	Personally for me, due to past trauma, wearing anything super close to my neck makes me panic. There are very few other options for women with large breasts to be fully covered. Most shirts are cut in a way to enhance breast appearance (not saying it‚Äôs right) so if you have large breasts it can be hard to avoid cleavage and also still represent personal style.

1r35rb5v	Here‚Äôs a different perspective to maybe consider - I saw another comment that said if y‚Äôall are all around the same age then they‚Äôre prob busy with life/work etc or maybe you‚Äôre the extrovert in a group on introverts.  Different people have different meanings of what a friendship looks like - I‚Äôm around the same age as you and between life and work I usually only see my friends a couple times a month and talk a couple times a week. Whereas it sounds like maybe you view friendship as a daily conversations thing. If your friends are used to you reaching out first, they might not think much about reaching out themselves bc that‚Äôs how y‚Äôall‚Äôs dynamic has always been. I know I can get easily caught up in life and forget to reach out to my people, but I‚Äôm always happy to make room in my schedule when they invite me out!  Like another commenter said, 4 days really isn‚Äôt a long time - I‚Äôd recommend still taking some time to reflect on what you need from a friendship, and then just talk to them! If you express your needs to them like ‚Äúhey I feel like I‚Äôm usually the one getting the group together/reaching out, I‚Äôd love if y‚Äôall could invite me out sometime instead!‚Äù The people who value your friendship would more than likely make time to hang out, and then others might drift away. Just know that your value isn‚Äôt based on the people who choose to spend time with you or not, and that there‚Äôs always more people out there to meet and connect with!	1642867897.0	htr95fi	t3_sa2xmi	t3_sa2xmi	/r/offmychest/comments/sa2xmi/i_deliberately_cut_myself_off_from_my_friends_to/htr95fi/

9ild2vyx	Heya, 18 years old here and lived with emotionally abusive parents my whole life. Never knew they were abusive till i was institutionalized for being a fucking schizo due to a lot of underlying issues. Let me put this real simple. Talk to a family friend. Not your school. Not your Police. Nun of that. Go and talk to one of your friends parents. And go from there. It‚Äôs ASTOUNDING how shitty of a situation you‚Äôll realize your in when you hear what a actually healthy family is like. I wish you the best of luck on this. This an issues i hold personally, and i was lucky enough to run away and disappear at only 16. Fuck the system girl, fuck your parents for having to, SLANDER a child for there own pride and gain. Be your own individual, because the sooner you learn the easier it will be to turn your back on those that are hurtful.

The question is whether we can ever align on something that finds some compromise like agreeing on when there is a duty to try and protect the unborn.

It just means you won't get seriously ill and cripple a probably crumbling medical system for the people that genuinely rely on those services outside of the pandemic.

iwpgfyfr	So I don‚Äôt have kids and my situation is slightly different but I want you to know, you are doing the best for both of you. My mother (and dad too) is abusive. For a long time, I believed her when she said I was the problem and she was just reacting to what I did. I believed I was the crazy one. I overcorrected myself into trying to please her that I‚Äôve become someone who gets anxiety if someone is just mildly upset with anything, not even necessarily pertaining to me. And I KEPT trying, even after finding out I have CPTSD and borderline, to please her. It‚Äôs exhausting trying to correct someone else‚Äôs behavior and moods. And it was taking a huge toll on me.  I recently finally found a therapist who doesn‚Äôt try to tell me that ‚Äúshe can‚Äôt help it‚Äù or ‚Äúshe is probably coming from love‚Äù or ‚Äúare you sure you did nothing to provoke that violence‚Äù when I talk about my experiences. (Yes, terrible doctors but I also fully own that I have screamed at her, I did push her back one time, and I did once throw something at her. I‚Äôm not perfect either.) But my current therapist told me that boundaries don‚Äôt mean forever. But forever can‚Äôt happen if I‚Äôm no longer around.  Maybe it‚Äôs that whole idea of mothers and daughters being close - the way society tells us it‚Äôs mothers that girls need - because I feel guilty as a daughter that I need to separate myself from her. I feel like I failed as a daughter that the only way I can heal is to not be around her. But I want to live, actually live. And you deserve that too. You‚Äôre not a bad mom. You‚Äôre one of the best moms out there. I can‚Äôt say this will bring you closer but it also might. It could be a big wake up call for her. Or, it can just be something that brings you peace. You‚Äôre a person first, before anything else, and your well being matters.	1642868419.0	htraf6k	t3_s87llp	t3_s87llp	/r/offmychest/comments/s87llp/im_giving_my_daughters_custody_to_her_absent/htraf6k/

Now I'm 22 and the only two friends I have live miles away and I only interact with them online.

14i58m	I‚Äôm not saying this is an attempt to be a dick, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned the hard way over the years that will make your friendships much more fulfilling. You shouldn‚Äôt be contacting friends for anything with any form of expectations they will give back what you‚Äôve put in. You‚Äôre not doing yourself any favors by putting stock in whether or not they reach out to you. It would be wonderful if we could do that and it actually work out, but your kindness doesn‚Äôt require them to give you theirs. Meet new people, try these things you‚Äôre doing with your old friends, and it works that‚Äôs great, but if not move on and try again. You‚Äôll find people willing to put effort in as well eventually and it‚Äôll be worth the search.

4ezg1zny	I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I‚Äôve been there, too. I have BPD and ADHD, and I worked a crappy office job while living with my dad after my mom died because I couldn‚Äôt afford to move out on my own since my medications and therapy were so expensive. My dad never told our family financial stuff, either.  I was driving my sister‚Äôs old car that my dad had bought for her (she got a new one), and a knock came on the door one day. I heard the guy at the door asking my dad about the car, and my dad lied and said it was in another city with my sister (it was parked in the garage at the time). When the guy left, I asked my dad what was going on. He said the car was out for repossession (he had been in charge of the payments since he bought it for my sister). I asked him how much the payments were, thinking I could go without treatment to take them over since I needed the car to get to work. He said it was too late, that the debt had already been charged off. So that explains why he always made excuses to try to get me to park in the garage and not on the driveway.  I was freaking out, and I asked him what else he neglected to tell me about our finances. Turns out the house‚Äîmy dead mother‚Äôs house!‚Äîwas being foreclosed on in three months. So I found out in one a day I was about to be homeless and carless with all of my mental health issues dragging me down at the same time. I got through it, thank goodness, and I never relied on my dad for help again.  I‚Äôm not gonna give you any advice because I don‚Äôt think you asked for any, and I always hated unsolicited advice myself. But stay strong! Things may be tough for a while, but you can get through this, too. Being scared is okay, but try to hold onto hope.
