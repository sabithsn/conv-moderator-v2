I'm not interested in some petty slap fight on reddit with someone who wont even read a few pages.  Their strategy has been to get western capital to gut itself voluntarily emptying all their industrial capacity into China where it can be allowed to grow but remain under tight control. And it's worked brilliantly. From that they've been able to develop their nation and raise conditions for workers at a one of the fastest rates seen in history. Literacy, housing, life expectancy, infrastructure, and wealth for the average worker have all been on nearly straight line up.	1642662282.0	htfi05d	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htfe2mo	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfi05d/

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:  >18. In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker.   Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

bizzqh4f	> No they didn't. Gay marriage is STILL not legal there.  I didn't say gay marriage. I said legalized homosexuality. And they did. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, the US legalized homosexuality in 2004.  > You assume much about me. And you do so incorrectly.  No assumptions are needed, you were homophobic in the edit of your 2nd reply to me. Maybe you aren't typically but that doesn't change your comment.  > That doesn't explain why there are billionaires-- a product of capitalism-- in a state that alleges to be communist.  Let's get some terms straight. Communism is the goal of all socialists — anarchist, marxist, or anything else. All forms of socialism besides anarchism believe that it's impossible to instantly safely go straight to full stateless communism, that a transitional state in order to weather counterrevolution and outside capitalist aggression is needed. Socialist who are not anarchist but are revolutionary tend to call themselves communist. A communist country is not a country that has fully moved to communism, that's a contradiction in terms of course, it's a country led by communists.  This in between period, where communism has not yet been established but political power has been taken out of the hands of capitalists is called socialism, also called a Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Dictatorship is meant in the old sense of "rule", not autocrat as we often use it today. This means 1 or more working class parties have seized control of power and that capitalists have been removed from political power and are being oppressed by the state.  Some Chinese capitalists are billionaires in the sense that they own shares of a company worth this amount, but that ownership is very precarious for them. If they step out of line the government is very quick to seize their assets, jail them, and often even execute them. As [has] (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/05/china-sentences-top-banker-to-death-for-corruption-and-bigamy) happened [repeatedly.] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-07-23/china-executes-14-billionaires-in-8-years-culture-news-reports)  The capitalist class acts as conduit to the outside world, prevent China from being encircled and sanctioned to death and allowing them to receive investment that then gets channeled into development. But they are kept on a very tight & lethal leash.  > A communist country would not have homeless people in it.  I never said they were perfect, far from it. There are very few people living in the street but there are still people who lack permanent housing, the majority of their homeless population lives as migrant workers. That's still an area that they're improving on, but fortunately their homeless rate has been on the decline for a while.	1642666249.0	htfnjb9	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htfisvk	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfnjb9/

9ga26	I remember reading once that forcing a smile tricks your brain into actually feeling happy. I would always "put on a happy face" before my first class would come in and because of that, the class would start off on such a great note that carried through to the end. By the end of the day I actually *was* in a great mood. But then I'd go home and have to spend hours planning my lessons because there was no time to do that at work, and thus my mood would fall, and then the cycle would continue with me putting on a happy face for my first class the next day.	1642666910.0	htfoekg	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htc96f5	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfoekg/

df3v7	Thank you for giving your reasoning for posting the video, and explaining the insights it gave you. I think however, that in order to truly understand how and why we need to change society, and which methods we should use in the struggle, we have to grasp the basic concepts of Marxism and learn to apply them.  Marxism is a science. Scientific socialism was a term once used by many well-known Marxists at the beginning of the twentieth century, to emphasize the origin of their political ideology. As Marxists, we look at matters from an objective, scientific perspective, because of the philosophy of our ideology, dialectic materialism.  The dawn of class society (antique society) meant the development of many forms of oppression. From circumstances where every individual was equal (primitive communism) humans subjected each other to slavery. Women were bound to the home and subjected to men. However, from a greater perspective, this was a progressive development. The surplus product that was produced by slaves meant that a few people no longer had to work, and were able to develop science and art. Over the centuries, this system of class society allowed people to create beter societal circumstances over all.  Capitalism, when it first arose, was a massive step forward for the entirety of humankind. It has been able to develop the means of production to an astronomical level. The problem is, however, that most humanity can't benefit from it, since they are only used to generate more capital. Like u/International_Ad8264 said, moralism is subjective. In any given society, the dominant ideas are always those of the ruling class, and such is the case with morals. From the moral point of view of a capitalist, capitalism can be justified. From the point of view of a worker, it can't be. This is not what we base ourselves on; we look at, from the objective material conditions, what is *progressive* for human society. And capitalism is no longer progressive; therefore it should be abolished.	1642676802.0	htg0wlk	t3_s7y2it	t1_htd5nf0	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/htg0wlk/

With that said, the Chinese avg. annual income is closer to 13k-25k rmb, so a teacher's salary of around 30k is no joke.

if29jgcc	It can only be used in a life or death situation, yes the ability to properly aim is important. Lethality is based off caliber and ammunition type. A hollow point 9x19mm is the most commonly carried and it has serious wounding potential. Lethality concerns arise when someone is using the wrong caliber (.22lr, .380, etc) with FMJ ammunition. Shot placement however is still the number one determining factor in that situation.   But there is not a good chance it won't be lethal, anything above the belly button is serious, debilitating, and if not treated within the hour, often fatal wound, and most people place 2-5 rounds on target in these situations, the psychological effect of being shot plays a big role as well. I go for two to the  heart/lungs followed by one to the brain, it's what the army taught me and it is 100% effective, 100% of the time.	1642678499.0	htg38rz	t3_s8b6q0	t1_htff8ev	/r/socialism/comments/s8b6q0/i_honestly_cannot_believe_how_ignorant_the_right/htg38rz/

7ss1axks	Anarchists, communists and many socialists have the same end goal. The dissolution of the state. The main difference is the way to obtain said goal. With the dissolution of the state, we can only postulate what it would be like. Most likely local communities solving their own issues and working together. A key issue is that we cannot think of it in the context of modern and preexisting cultures. A huge cultural shift is a part of socialism in which we refocus attention from the individual to the community. This was the goal in states like the USSR, China, Cuba, the DPRK, Vietnam etc. And they have made great progress towards shifting attitudes. We cannot think of a stateless future based on our societies today, but based on what we want them to be.	1642689762.0	htgobay	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgobay/

We can't say how *exactly* our society will look like, that will be up to future generations, however what I mean is what is the framework of stateless society. How, approximately, it will look like? How do you see that?   Marx presented the framework of Socialism, who will be the owner of means of production, distribution, and exchange, who would be ruling class in Socialism e.t.c. So my saying is, what would be the framework for the Anarchy, what does abolishment of State mean?	1642690688.0	htgqk1k	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgobay	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgqk1k/

7ss1axks	For anarchists, they wish to immediately abolish the state. This is what most other leftist ideologies have a problem with, as it is quite utopian sounding. They do not want or have a transition period, and have not elaborated the processes that would take place, nor have they had a chance to experiment in the real world. I believe this is why they have not seen any successes at all despite being an older ideology than socialism.

But in anarchism especially, the freedom of association is very important as well for a people in a system to regain autonomy.

The goal is not just to create a system with x characteristics, it's about making it as good as possible so people want to stay in it out of their free will.	1642691100.0	htgrk33	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrk33/

The prominence of information technology makes this task very possible, just make an electronic referendum and let people decide this, the lawmakers don't make these decisions instantly and it takes several days for them too.   What I mean by "system of regulating relations". If we go according to principle of "from each according to their abilities to each according to their needs" then how do we make sure that canned soups produced in Vermont can reach the people in need in Wyoming? Relations not only economic but also economic and societal. How do we make sure that proposed laws don't just benefit some but hurt others just because those who proposed these laws were more numerous (for example question of Native Americans)?	1642691636.0	htgswo7	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgqu5q	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgswo7/

It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail." - Manufacturing Consent, p. 23  Chomsky is constantly hinting at a material analysis of academia, but never applies it to his own career or political beliefs. His work is important and academically rigorous, but always incomplete without understanding Gramsci and Parenti.  Still, he was incredibly important for the western left, and is perhaps more responsible than anyone for the anti-imperialist trend and more explicitly socialist operations like the Empire Files or the Jakarta Method.  Debating him on the USSR is beating a dead horse. Besides, there are much better uses of his time and his work.

542njka0	The only answer isn’t “a moral one”. “Freedom” isn’t an inherently moral notion either. “Freedom” can also be obscured as relative. You have to chose and then *define* a measurement or framework, like materialism, in order to bring more precision.  Materialist ethics aren’t simply framed under “morality”. It is based on conclusions derived of logic and necessity due to evidence from observation and examination of relational (dialectal) material conditions.  Capitalism dismisses and devalues the very conditions required for it to function (which one could argue as immoral or unethical), but could better and more precisely argue is irrational. Through observation and evidence, it can be concluded that profitability, production, and efficiency are not most adequately and sustainably met through exploited laborers, exploited labor, or exploited living conditions.  You can reasonably argue that consistent and peer reviewed study of human nature and biology presents solid evidence that taxed (exhausted, sick, stressed, anxious, despairing) individuals are not optimally functioning and so unsustainable as a workforce and that low wages coupled with high costs of living displaces flow of commerce. Ultimately a marginalized, exploited, unsustainable, and undercut workforce is counterproductive and counterintuitive to the objectives and sustainability of a capitalist economy.  Hence our current state of late stage capitalism and the inevitability of it’s inherent collapse.  There is no sense of morality or ethics requiring of factoring into this conversation. Yes, ultimately dehumanizing people is immoral to many, but it is simply counterproductive for a thriving capitalist market economy.	1642699884.0	hthf15i	t3_s7y2it	t1_htdes5c	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthf15i/

542njka0	Yes. The notion that happiness and contentedness actually factor into achieving an economically thriving and successful society is just beginning to creep back into the conversation.  I prefer ethics as well. “Morality” seems a dogmatic (typically religious) notion which wants to isolate and distinguish itself from all rationale or reason.

561em	I totally disagree.  Economics does not try to answer the question of how society *should* be organised.  Economics tries the answer the question of how a economy or society *could* be organised to accomplish a given goal.  Morality is a social construct. Morality itself is malleable by the social dynamics that economics studies.  To try to prove or argue a point of economics with morality is like trying to pull your self up by your own boot laces.	1642703086.0	hthnupd	t3_s7y2it	t3_s7y2it	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthnupd/
2owiyvu3	The reason why you were banned probably has to do with the fact that your initial question was answered and rather than accept the answer given, you dug your heels in and initiated what could be considered a debate.  Granted you weren't being rude, but rule #6 of the sub is "no questions or debates." You broke the rules more than once. It is not a debate sub or an educational sub. Also there's a rule in the sub against criticizing AES, as it is a sub for criticizing liberals.  You probably wouldn't of been banned had you not continued your line of questioning which was answered very well by a comrade.  Also the way you formulated your questions could lead to them being taken in bad faith, in my opinion. Your first question was answered and than you asked "how do you explain the poverty in China?"   You literally started from the assumption that China is impoverished, rather than asking if its true that China is impoverished. (It isn't btw look into poverty elevation in China) Had you not framed the question like this and began asking questions/debating, you'd probably be left alone.	1642703391.0	hthoouw	t3_s8oq6l	t3_s8oq6l	/r/socialism/comments/s8oq6l/just_got_banned_from_shitliberalsay_because_i/hthoouw/

By the end of the day I actually *was* in a great mood.

How do we enforce transparency if the people in power are put there undemocratically. It could seem nice on paper having experts be judge jury and executioner in a particular area, but having it be a form of government seems ripe for abuse.	1642672260.0	htfv3t4	t3_s88bmn	t1_htesafa	/r/socialism/comments/s88bmn/on_technocracy/htfv3t4/

Really, I'd just spend less time worrying about it, because that gun is almost certainly just going to remain an expensive accessory to paranoia and anxiety about a nonexistent threat (if it doesn't get stolen by someone who can use it more effectively, that is). It doesn't really matter how effectively your mum is going to be able to handle a situation if it never happens.

df3v7	Thank you for giving your reasoning for posting the video, and explaining the insights it gave you. I think however, that in order to truly understand how and why we need to change society, and which methods we should use in the struggle, we have to grasp the basic concepts of Marxism and learn to apply them.  Marxism is a science. Scientific socialism was a term once used by many well-known Marxists at the beginning of the twentieth century, to emphasize the origin of their political ideology. As Marxists, we look at matters from an objective, scientific perspective, because of the philosophy of our ideology, dialectic materialism.  The dawn of class society (antique society) meant the development of many forms of oppression. From circumstances where every individual was equal (primitive communism) humans subjected each other to slavery. Women were bound to the home and subjected to men. However, from a greater perspective, this was a progressive development. The surplus product that was produced by slaves meant that a few people no longer had to work, and were able to develop science and art. Over the centuries, this system of class society allowed people to create beter societal circumstances over all.  Capitalism, when it first arose, was a massive step forward for the entirety of humankind. It has been able to develop the means of production to an astronomical level. The problem is, however, that most humanity can't benefit from it, since they are only used to generate more capital. Like u/International_Ad8264 said, moralism is subjective. In any given society, the dominant ideas are always those of the ruling class, and such is the case with morals. From the moral point of view of a capitalist, capitalism can be justified. From the point of view of a worker, it can't be. This is not what we base ourselves on; we look at, from the objective material conditions, what is *progressive* for human society. And capitalism is no longer progressive; therefore it should be abolished.	1642676802.0	htg0wlk	t3_s7y2it	t1_htd5nf0	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/htg0wlk/

With that said, the Chinese avg. annual income is closer to 13k-25k rmb, so a teacher's salary of around 30k is no joke.

if29jgcc	It can only be used in a life or death situation, yes the ability to properly aim is important. Lethality is based off caliber and ammunition type. A hollow point 9x19mm is the most commonly carried and it has serious wounding potential. Lethality concerns arise when someone is using the wrong caliber (.22lr, .380, etc) with FMJ ammunition. Shot placement however is still the number one determining factor in that situation.   But there is not a good chance it won't be lethal, anything above the belly button is serious, debilitating, and if not treated within the hour, often fatal wound, and most people place 2-5 rounds on target in these situations, the psychological effect of being shot plays a big role as well. I go for two to the  heart/lungs followed by one to the brain, it's what the army taught me and it is 100% effective, 100% of the time.	1642678499.0	htg38rz	t3_s8b6q0	t1_htff8ev	/r/socialism/comments/s8b6q0/i_honestly_cannot_believe_how_ignorant_the_right/htg38rz/

7ss1axks	Anarchists, communists and many socialists have the same end goal. The dissolution of the state. The main difference is the way to obtain said goal. With the dissolution of the state, we can only postulate what it would be like. Most likely local communities solving their own issues and working together. A key issue is that we cannot think of it in the context of modern and preexisting cultures. A huge cultural shift is a part of socialism in which we refocus attention from the individual to the community. This was the goal in states like the USSR, China, Cuba, the DPRK, Vietnam etc. And they have made great progress towards shifting attitudes. We cannot think of a stateless future based on our societies today, but based on what we want them to be.	1642689762.0	htgobay	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgobay/

We can't say how *exactly* our society will look like, that will be up to future generations, however what I mean is what is the framework of stateless society. How, approximately, it will look like? How do you see that?   Marx presented the framework of Socialism, who will be the owner of means of production, distribution, and exchange, who would be ruling class in Socialism e.t.c. So my saying is, what would be the framework for the Anarchy, what does abolishment of State mean?	1642690688.0	htgqk1k	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgobay	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgqk1k/

7ss1axks	For anarchists, they wish to immediately abolish the state. This is what most other leftist ideologies have a problem with, as it is quite utopian sounding. They do not want or have a transition period, and have not elaborated the processes that would take place, nor have they had a chance to experiment in the real world. I believe this is why they have not seen any successes at all despite being an older ideology than socialism. Communists have a very specific set of methods to dispose of the state, in part from Marx/Engels/Lenin/etc.	1642691042.0	htgrezl	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgqk1k	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrezl/
5xddq	Yes and no - partly!  This is one example of a quality of realized anarchism/communism. But in anarchism especially, the freedom of association is very important as well for a people in a system to regain autonomy. So there are other structural things that needs to be in place concerning how you create organizations and such. The goal is not just to create a system with x characteristics, it's about making it as good as possible so people want to stay in it out of their free will.	1642691100.0	htgrk33	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrk33/

The prominence of information technology makes this task very possible, just make an electronic referendum and let people decide this, the lawmakers don't make these decisions instantly and it takes several days for them too.   What I mean by "system of regulating relations". If we go according to principle of "from each according to their abilities to each according to their needs" then how do we make sure that canned soups produced in Vermont can reach the people in need in Wyoming?

It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail." - Manufacturing Consent, p. 23  Chomsky is constantly hinting at a material analysis of academia, but never applies it to his own career or political beliefs. His work is important and academically rigorous, but always incomplete without understanding Gramsci and Parenti.  Still, he was incredibly important for the western left, and is perhaps more responsible than anyone for the anti-imperialist trend and more explicitly socialist operations like the Empire Files or the Jakarta Method.  Debating him on the USSR is beating a dead horse. Besides, there are much better uses of his time and his work.

542njka0	The only answer isn’t “a moral one”. “Freedom” isn’t an inherently moral notion either. “Freedom” can also be obscured as relative. You have to chose and then *define* a measurement or framework, like materialism, in order to bring more precision.  Materialist ethics aren’t simply framed under “morality”. It is based on conclusions derived of logic and necessity due to evidence from observation and examination of relational (dialectal) material conditions.  Capitalism dismisses and devalues the very conditions required for it to function (which one could argue as immoral or unethical), but could better and more precisely argue is irrational. Through observation and evidence, it can be concluded that profitability, production, and efficiency are not most adequately and sustainably met through exploited laborers, exploited labor, or exploited living conditions.  You can reasonably argue that consistent and peer reviewed study of human nature and biology presents solid evidence that taxed (exhausted, sick, stressed, anxious, despairing) individuals are not optimally functioning and so unsustainable as a workforce and that low wages coupled with high costs of living displaces flow of commerce. Ultimately a marginalized, exploited, unsustainable, and undercut workforce is counterproductive and counterintuitive to the objectives and sustainability of a capitalist economy.  Hence our current state of late stage capitalism and the inevitability of it’s inherent collapse.  There is no sense of morality or ethics requiring of factoring into this conversation. Yes, ultimately dehumanizing people is immoral to many, but it is simply counterproductive for a thriving capitalist market economy.	1642699884.0	hthf15i	t3_s7y2it	t1_htdes5c	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthf15i/

542njka0	Yes. The notion that happiness and contentedness actually factor into achieving an economically thriving and successful society is just beginning to creep back into the conversation.  I prefer ethics as well. “Morality” seems a dogmatic (typically religious) notion which wants to isolate and distinguish itself from all rationale or reason.

6abl09fe	so i saw a post and in the comments they were talking about china. i was asking whether or not china is still economically socialist or not bc i happen to think it’s not really that socialist and more like state corporatism-ish (though i’ve heard some people call it a different form of capitalism) . anyways so i wanted to hear why some people think it’s still economically socialist and also happened to ask that same person for the reason behind chinas poverty, to which they gave me an answer that made sense and i agreed with. anyways so then i check and see that i was banned from the subreddit and i was like huh. the reddit mod said the following: “ay, juanito, tomando basura gringa otra vez.” i was like did this mf really just call me juanito wtf. and the then i questioned him about it and saw that he muted me. and on top of that he sent a quote of what i said in another post where i responded to some fascist the following : “ so you either got brainwashed or can’t think critically”. yeah, all in all whoever the reddit mod is should really not be the mod. also their subreddit is always backing up china which yk they get shat in by us propaganda but ofc they fuck up too bruh. literally every country does. i really don’t know why they are so afraid of criticism. anyways yeah that’s all	1642702143.0	hthl9nj	t3_s8oq6l	t1_hthjvf6	/r/socialism/comments/s8oq6l/just_got_banned_from_shitliberalsay_because_i/hthl9nj/

561em	I totally disagree.  Economics does not try to answer the question of how society *should* be organised.  Economics tries the answer the question of how a economy or society *could* be organised to accomplish a given goal.  Morality is a social construct. Morality itself is malleable by the social dynamics that economics studies.  To try to prove or argue a point of economics with morality is like trying to pull your self up by your own boot laces.	1642703086.0	hthnupd	t3_s7y2it	t3_s7y2it	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthnupd/
2owiyvu3	The reason why you were banned probably has to do with the fact that your initial question was answered and rather than accept the answer given, you dug your heels in and initiated what could be considered a debate.  Granted you weren't being rude, but rule #6 of the sub is "no questions or debates." You broke the rules more than once. It is not a debate sub or an educational sub. Also there's a rule in the sub against criticizing AES, as it is a sub for criticizing liberals.  You probably wouldn't of been banned had you not continued your line of questioning which was answered very well by a comrade.  Also the way you formulated your questions could lead to them being taken in bad faith, in my opinion. Your first question was answered and than you asked "how do you explain the poverty in China?"   You literally started from the assumption that China is impoverished, rather than asking if its true that China is impoverished. (It isn't btw look into poverty elevation in China) Had you not framed the question like this and began asking questions/debating, you'd probably be left alone.	1642703391.0	hthoouw	t3_s8oq6l	t3_s8oq6l	/r/socialism/comments/s8oq6l/just_got_banned_from_shitliberalsay_because_i/hthoouw/

qdt83	Think of it more in the plural "socialisms" the thing they all broadly share in common is that it's a mode of production in which the workers, either with some apparatus or directly, control the places they work.   When you talk about it descriptively it's not tied to a particular government structure or economic model, there are a variety of approaches with different transitional states to achieve this.

xslxo	>Do you guys really think life was great for women in the 70s in soviet bloc states?  Yes.  >I mean, crime against women was most likely terrible during those periods.  Is this a gut feeling or are there academic sources for such claims?  >Not to mention that women were still seen as objects in these regions/times  Were they? Can you give an example of what it looked like?  Remind me, was it after the collapse of the USSR or before that women became overtly sexualized in the eastern bloc countries in order to advertise products? Was it after or before the collapse that sex tourism became popular in the East as more women fell into inescapable poverty? Was it after or before kindergartens and child care started becoming privatized and unavailable for poorer women? Was it after the collapse or before that education stopped being free thus limiting the opportunities for women? I can continue these rhetorical questions, but I think you understand the gist.   &#x200B;  > I'm all for socialism, but this kind of information is a nothing burger, and really doesn't do our cause any good.  Its pointing out that even in the USSR, which was not as developed as the US, women still enjoyed higher equality in daily lives. This is like pointing out that Cuba under many sanctions still manages to have a higher life expectancy than the US. These qualities are the goals of our movement, when even during scarcity its possible to have a more equal society.	1642726650.0	htja10f	t3_s8s37u	t1_htj4zdj	/r/socialism/comments/s8s37u/wonder_why_eastern_europe_was_on_top/htja10f/

I am In one of the DPHS Econ Classes and oh boy I have to tell you, They all actually are pretty bad at teaching economics as it is, Both regular and honors. Maybe as well as AP Macro.

9yw0k1tk	The CPC believes that [globalisation is an unstoppable trend of the times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202201/1246218.shtml) and argues that instead of fighting against that current, that we should 'go with the flow' instead, bending the market in such a way that it creates the conditions necessary for global communism (or as China calls it nowadays: [a community with a shared future for mankind](http://kotakinabalu.china-consulate.org/eng/zlgxw_2/202112/t20211204_10462303.htm)). This process, will undoubtedly take centuries to complete, but nevertheless, in my eyes, it can be a real chance at building communism in the long term whilst seriously decreasing the risk of WWIII by effectively 'dragging out' the class struggle over a longer period of time.   I think this article is a gem. [The Long Game and Its Contradictions](https://leohezhao.medium.com/the-long-game-and-its-contradictions-8ff92823cf68)  To quote a bit:  >Internationally, China’s socialist foreign policy is decidedly not a continuation of the past socialist export of revolutions, but focused on the restructuring of global trade. It is a new form of internationalism based on the promotion of independent economic development of the over-exploited nations of the Global South, through mutually beneficial relationships and a policy of peaceful co-existence. The long term goal is nothing short of the elimination of the primary contradiction of imperialist capitalism — inter-continental inequality. Ending the fundamental injustice of our age, disparity between rich and poor countries, will also spell the end of myriads of cascading ancillary injustices. Alleviating poverty, promoting trade and learning, and building relationships based on respect and cooperation, new economic alliances between colonised regions will together displace Western hegemony, break imperialist cycles of violence, and end capitalist domination.  >The creation of a more equal and level global playing field will have two major effects upon the world. One: workers in the imperial core, the Global North, the “first world”, will again have bargaining power to make demands, because their jobs will no longer be easily exported to poor regions with low wages. Two: people of the imperial periphery, the Global South, the “third world”, will be empowered to set the terms of their own engagement in the world, and have the chance to build independent economic strength. This reduction of global inequality produces the material conditions necessary for global socialism with local characteristics.	1642729420.0	htjgfec	t3_s8r6ex	t3_s8r6ex	/r/socialism/comments/s8r6ex/why_hasnt_china_abandoned_there_mix_economy_yet/htjgfec/

895z4	I’m answering more as a communist than a socialist. Imagine money isn’t a thing; there are distribution centers for things people need, like food, clothes, medicine, etc. Everyone who participates in doing the work to keep society running has access to those places and can take what they need when they need it.  To start a new “business,” you’ll need space, materials, and workers. We can have some mechanism where someone with an idea goes to a committee and says “hey, I have this idea and I think it will be useful in this way. I’ve got signatures from these people who say they’d like to see my idea be implemented and this is how it would benefit them.”  We need to stop thinking of businesses as being something a person can own for profit, instead looking at them as something that either helps or hurts society and the environment.	1642784999.0	htmczm7	t3_s9e476	t1_htm8th8	/r/socialism/comments/s9e476/curious_to_hear_about_how_a_business_would_work/htmczm7/

5xddq	As has been pointed out, "risk" has to be defined in this context. Risk in modern economics is having capital to risk. Even without considering if our hypothetical socialist society is moneyless or not, or of it has labor-vouchers for that matter, capital doesn't exist in socialism since the goal is to get eid of it.  "Risk" makes it sound like someone is not going to eat if you do bad business ... Oh how ideology is contained in language, right in front of us!  So to better refrain your question - will the workers share responsibility for the venture. Well, absolutely - not in an absolutist sense since everyone does different things. If someone specializes in being the treasurer, they have a greater responsibility to manage the "risk" of the budget. But in a general sense, if a business fails they all share the responsibility to manage the bankruptcy in what form it may take on this society. They might need to see that the remaining resources gets distributed to the community.	1642785724.0	htmeyfd	t3_s9e476	t3_s9e476	/r/socialism/comments/s9e476/curious_to_hear_about_how_a_business_would_work/htmeyfd/

cwl7ysxq	I find it genuinely confusing how someone can simultaneously believe that the state is more “organized and militant” than ever and that a revolution can be achieved via *talking*. Both statements are beyond absurd and completely ignore the history of state repression and armed struggle against states, including ones far more militarized than the modern American one.  I agree that militias (specifically, democratic ones accountable to the public) should be entrusted with arms and that this is a viable path toward healthy gun control, but such a thing could only ever be possible after the working class has already seized power. Implying that this can be done without arms, however, is a wildly naïve and frankly dangerous statement. We can only build a new world peacefully when possible, and forcefully when necessary.	1642786973.0	htmidie	t3_s9c35u	t1_htmgii0	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htmidie/

10l3oh	Yea I always saw the purges as one of the darkest moments in Soviet history. They left the nation vulnerable when the nazis invaded, and to think that people who helped build the Soviet Union were deported to the Nazis as well is insult on top of injury. So many needlessly killed and imprisoned during and as a result of the purges after the Nazi invasions. Obviously the nazis are primarily responsible for the deaths in their invasion, but I would not be surprised that if Stalin kept more of his veterans in command and did not constantly try to appease the Nazis that the mass casualties in the early months of the war could have been avoided. But anger at the "social fascists" seems to have blinded them to the threat of the literal fascists.	1642791363.0	htmu7vk	t3_s9hpwg	t3_s9hpwg	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htmu7vk/

I’m not a fan of the United States government by any means, but the plans of Disney/Marvel aren’t synonymous with state planning/funding. If you wanted to make a more valid comparison it probably would’ve been better to reference something such as the U.S.’s continued funding of Israel, or any other illegitimate project that the U.S. government is actually currently involved in.  Additionally, how does the technological plans or advancements of either country, by association, reflect the rights/well-being of their workers, or more specifically the relationship/ownership of workers to the means of production? This post seems less related to Socialism as Marx or Engels articulated it, and instead an irrelevant comparison between two nation-states, neither of which reflect a classless and stateless common society.	1642791653.0	htmv00n	t3_s9h09m	t3_s9h09m	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htmv00n/

isx3s	This is a really tricky thing. It's hard to know what works for a given person. For me personally, I think the biggest influence is just exposure to more and different kinds of people. When you find a fellow worker who does something that bothers you in your interaction with them in their job, politely ask them why they do it. Explain that you've always wondered about it and you don't know their industry very well. Try to understand the factors that create the end result you're seeing. When I see the things that produce other people's behaviors I don't like, I find it becomes easier to see the systemic nature of it.	1642792469.0	htmx7xj	t3_s9i9xq	t3_s9i9xq	/r/socialism/comments/s9i9xq/do_you_ever_struggle_with_unlearning_capitalist/htmx7xj/

3nhpoje1	This is well known. Here's some more examples:    "There were other consequences of the Pact too. During the detailed negotiations, the German side raised the question of German political refugees in the Soviet Union. Stalin had no interest in protecting them; indeed he was deeply suspicious of foreigners of any kind who had found a home in Russia, and of many of the Russians who came into contact with them. So he agreed to send them back to the Third Reich. Some 4,000 German citizens were duly rounded up and handed over to the Gestapo by the Soviet authorities after the Pact had been signed. Between 1,000 and 1,200 were German Communists. Some, like Margarete Buber-Neumann, had already been imprisoned by Stalin’s secret police before being sent to a German concentration camp; her husband, Heinz Neumann, had been purged from the German Party leadership in 1932 for urging a united front with the Social Democrats against the Nazi threat; sent first to Spain, then Moscow, he had been arrested in 1937 and executed. His widow was deported directly from a Soviet labour camp to Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1940. For those German Communist exiles who were Jewish, an even worse fate was in store. The conductor and composer Hans Walter David was one of their number. Born in 1893, he had fled to Paris in 1933 then Moscow in 1935. He fell victim to Stalin’s great purge in 1937, and was sentenced to a labour camp in 1939 for allegedly spying for the Germans, an example of Stalin’s paranoid suspicion of foreigners in the Soviet Union. In April 1940, David was informed that his sentence had been commuted into one of deportation. He was handed over to the Germans on 2 May 1940, and murdered by the SS."	1642792536.0	htmxejp	t3_s9hpwg	t3_s9hpwg	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htmxejp/

68a85	Transcription:  Eight Stages of White Settler-Colonial Denial   1\. "They didn't exist"   - Complete denial of Indigenous presence in a given area (country, province, etc). Includes denial of Indigeneity, e.g. "Indigenous Peoples are Settlers too". (terra nullius)   2\. "If they did, they weren't here"   - Denial that Indigenous People inhabit/travel/harvest/exist in a specific area. Often based on euro-centric definitions of evidence of occupation. (terra nullius)   3\. "If they were, they didn't use the land"   - Denial that Indigenous People have a connection with the Land. Often based on euro-centric worldviews of the land as something to be owned and extracted. (doctrine of discovery)  4\. "If they did, they didn't deserve it"   - Denial that Indigenous People have rights to their Lands. Often based on euro- centric value judgements of "primitive vs. civilized", “nomadic vs. sedentary". (great chain of being)   5\. "If they did, they lost it"   - Denial that Indigenous People retain their rights to their Lands. Often based on colonially imposed European systems of law /"might makes right" worldviews. (right of conquest)   6\. "If they didn't, it doesn't matter any more"    - Denial that Indigenous Rights are still binding and take precedence. Often based on false claims of supremacy of colonial legal institutions and systems.  (Westphalian sovereignty)  7\. "If it does, we need to move on".   - Denial that violations of Indigenous Rights requires redress. Often based on claims redress is "disruptive/unfair/reverse racism" & false calls for "equality". (liberalism)    8\. "If we can't, we are you"   - Denial of separateness of Indigenous Peoples and Rights. Often based on attempts to reduce Indigenous Rights to Human Rights, claim Indigeneity, etc. "Eieht Stages of Sertler Denial". **(self-indigenization)**	1642794725.0	htn3gi9	t3_s9j4x9	t3_s9j4x9	/r/socialism/comments/s9j4x9/eight_stages_of_white_settlercolonial_denial/htn3gi9/

m2l6l	Turns out that it takes a *while* to catch up to industrialized societies with a two hundred year head start and the accumulated wealth of at least *five hundred* years of colonialism and Imperialism.  That's actually a really important thing to note, if China was willing to colonize, they'd be advancing much quicker like the West did, at the expense of their exploited subjects, of course. But imperialism runs directly contrary to the most basic ideas of socialism and communism, so developing the means of production necessary to begin the transition to socialism is taking longer.	1642795214.0	htn4tbj	t3_s9h09m	t1_htmsua8	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htn4tbj/

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day.

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day.

454o3	The marxist-leninist system is roughly (although not exactly) similar in China to what we currently can see in Cuba and used to in the USSR - although the chinese is the one I know the least about, so you should definitely research this yourself. [Here's a video that goes into more detail than I can cover in a reddit post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpOzT7alVK8).  In these systems you don't vote for parties but directly for individuals to your local council or assembly, these people are folks who live in your territory so you will probably know them, may or may not be party members, and may even be you if you get the votes necessary to be elected. All layers of government above this one are constituted from delegates from the lower levels.   The party does not participate in this process, it is in fact explicitly banned from campaigning for any candidate (at least in Cuba), so we can't really draw comparisons to parties in liberal democracies because the communist party runs parallel to the actual state apparatus, not within it. The one-party systems are more accurately described as no-party systems.	1642798233.0	htnd5s6	t3_s9h09m	t1_htn9yeq	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnd5s6/
hjrsfrzf	This is a great answer thank you. Obviously you can’t speak for everyone but this is kind of what I gathered from reading the sub. I usually assume when someone in the west self describes as being socialist or having socialist economic values, they mean they’re for universal healthcare, free tuition, and higher taxes on the 0.1 percent. Reading the sub however it seems people adhere closer to the definition haha.	1642798269.0	htnd9j4	t3_s5mbaz	t1_hsyfu71	/r/socialism/comments/s5mbaz/what_do_most_people_on_this_sub_mean_when_they/htnd9j4/
7suvr	That's not the reality at the national level. Freedom House explains pretty well why this process is not democratic, I encourage you to read it if you are interested, particularly the electoral process part. (https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2021). The idea is that since all candidate members of the NPC are vetted by one-party it doesn't matter who is elected in the end, because they will oppose no resistance to the ruling party. Therefore it is not democratic since people do have the power to influence the decision of their government.	1642799129.0	htnfo2a	t3_s9h09m	t1_htnd5s6	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnfo2a/

2vu9zikv	I think arming up in a right proper "workers controlled production" society will be unrecognizable to anywhere in anglo-capitalist today, regardless of context.  Gun fetishism (both meanings) is bad, but familiarization with guns is good, and in some cases (arguably america the most), use of firearms may need to happen outside of certified revolutionary^tm moments.  Almost all states in the west have volunteer armies that go abroad to bomb poor people. On balance, a reactionary indoctrination force, not a proletarianizing one, with some exceptions. Even then it's of the "socialism is when free cafeteria and Veterans medical benefits" not "socialism is when my job is run by workers" kind of impressions.  We need to flip armies, and there's no question about it. But it should be clear that it's not just a two way fight anymore.	1642799729.0	htnhcew	t3_s9c35u	t1_htn6pdq	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htnhcew/

7suvr	I think their assessment is pretty clear and fact based. If the party controls who can be a candidate than the essentially control the election, I don't see how that is controversial. Additionally, I feel I don't need to explain why a state that meet political dissenters with violence does not offer a viable ground for democracy. The fact that they don't allow their own citizens to fully access internet while (pretty much) everyone uses VPNs is proof enough that the citizens are not in control of state policies, otherwise their great firewall would be long gone.	1642800145.0	htnii0c	t3_s9h09m	t1_htng77a	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnii0c/

2vu9zikv	Socialism grandpa Karl, in 1850.  > The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition, and the revival of the old-style citizens’ militia against the workers, must be opposed.  > Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.  In fact you can see how it's different from the 2A, which calls for arming people in defense of a capitalist state that was at the time an unlimited chattel slaving (versus today where you have to go to jail to be subject to "involuntary servitude" under 13A) native-genociding apparatus. Instead of being "citizens", marx calls for a subjectivity of "workers" to be armed with basically anything and everything, and an inalienable right to defend themselves and their collective interests.	1642800753.0	htnk6y4	t3_s9c35u	t1_htngjx6	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htnk6y4/

hrlimt9j	Partially yes, and it could be argued that this is due to the divide between different spectrum of the left, from the social democratic liberal to the Marxist-Leninist.   The main culprit of this phenomenon in my opinion is over a century of red scare propaganda that has been cultivated in the imperial core. Potential Marxist-leninists are repelled from associating with it due to smear campaigns like "100 million dead from communism" (this is actually taken from the Black Book of Communism, which includes nAzi deaths during WW2 as victims of communism). Likewise Marxist-leninists are reluctant to associate with SocDems because many of their policies are liberal and rely on capitalism and they only accept reform through electoralism (read Vladimir Lenin's book, State and Revolution if you want a ML point of view ;).  The red scare not only demonised and vilified socialists and communists, generally anybody who was even remotely left leaning. This was most common during the cold war but thanks to the rise of the internet and social media red scare ideology is once again taking hold and becoming more relevant.  This is just my take on it and I have only recently dived more deeply into theory. My recommendation is to read theory and get educated. The people who wrote prominent socialist literature have a much more solid grasp of ideals than most likely any of us.	1642801022.0	htnky67	t3_s9j83o	t3_s9j83o	/r/socialism/comments/s9j83o/i_feel_that_the_left_suffer_because_they_dont/htnky67/

Republican or democrat, conservative or liberal, they are both fundamentally secondary to private economic actors who control their funding and asset allocation. Nearly every attempt to elect a socialist through conventional channels has descended into fascism or been overthrown in a coup (a la Pinochet). If you still think socialism can be achieved through solely through “representative” democracy than you’ve learned nothing from the lessons of the last century.	1642805517.0	htnx2yz	t3_s9h09m	t1_htn5ea6	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnx2yz/

The other forms of colonization might have a different stage setup, though I don't personally know enough about how other cultures were affected by colonization to speak on it.  This list seems pretty accurate for how white colonialism has evolved thus far.     And I suspect the reason there isn't a "good place" is because we haven't achieved that yet and still aren't sure exactly what that'd look like.  We need hindsight for that, and so far none of the issues of white colonialism have been resolved. We haven't won that "happy ending" yet.	1642810518.0	hto9qav	t3_s9j4x9	t1_htnn9on	/r/socialism/comments/s9j4x9/eight_stages_of_white_settlercolonial_denial/hto9qav/

I can’t speak for every country but in mine more profits than ever are being spent on stock buybacks and share holder dividends enriching billionaire. So nearly every dollar of profit is going into the wealth of the richest untaxed and not into any investment that would benefit the workers. Also it goes untaxed because instead of selling stocks and classifying it as income they borrow against their investments avoiding taxes, that’s how Elon Musk paid no taxes for ten years.	1642811805.0	htocwkn	t3_s9g5vi	t3_s9g5vi	/r/socialism/comments/s9g5vi/how_can_this_tax_plan_be_fair/htocwkn/

4dkb6kkn	There seems to be a few holes here, but I'm also having trouble sorting out propaganda and the real thing.   The idea that "Ukraine is historically Russian" is a bold statement and ignores it being Polish-Lithuanian and even independent for a long time.  Additionally, from what I've been able to sort out, most of the ethnic Russians in Ukraine were communities established through Stalinist programs displacing and replacing locals. Crimea is neither Ukrainian nor Russian historically, but rather Tartars are the rightful occupants.  Also, the current government doesn't seem to have started as a facist one, but is rather colluding with them despite their lack of popularity.  I'd like to see reliable analysis and reports with more details, but from what I can find, this is tipped way more in the opposite direction than anything I've seen in the neoliberal media.	1642819581.0	htovhbp	t3_s9ojk7	t3_s9ojk7	/r/socialism/comments/s9ojk7/roots_of_the_ukraine_crisis/htovhbp/

bizzqh4f	After the Spanish-American war Cuba was a colony of the US. During this time the US took Guantanamo Bay and made it into a naval base. Eventually the US gave Cuba-faux independence under a friendly puppet dictator, but kept the bay & military base.  When the revolution happened now Communist Cuba wanted the bay to be returned, but also didn't want to start a war with the US if they didn't have to. So the US has ignored Cuba request ever since.  As for legality? Legal according to whom? Not according to Cuba.	1642822778.0	htp2wr7	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htp1f46	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htp2wr7/

ocfey	Oh, that is a weird claim (as in my brain couldn't process someone saying "I'm indigenous" when they aren't- reality is satire) to make so the title threw me off, leaving me much confused for context in the following weird wording.   "Denial of separateness of Indigenous Peoples and Rights." sounds like we're separating peoples and rights. I would write that "Indigenous Peoples and their Rights" if I'm reading it correctly now.  "Often based on attempts to reduce Indigenous Rights to Human Rights," again is a weird claim. I'm not sure what this would mean in actual application.   "claim Indigeneity," without the aforementioned context of colonizers claiming to be indigenous this was really confusing.	1642823605.0	htp4t2n	t3_s9j4x9	t1_htorizd	/r/socialism/comments/s9j4x9/eight_stages_of_white_settlercolonial_denial/htp4t2n/

1fysj11v	Here's what I understand about the orthodox marxist view on robots and automation under capitalism.  Most (if not all) Marxists are proponents of the labor theory of value. Meaning they believe that value is created through our labor.  Robots aren't sentient, and so they aren't people. If they aren't people then they can't create value. If they can't create value, then there is no surplus value that is being extracted from them.   So no exploitation and therefore no oppression.   That doesn't mean that Marxists shouldn't be opposed to capitalism's feverish efforts at automation. Automation is a part of what Marx called "dead labor". Dead labor combined with capitalism's profit-driven production inevitably results in crises of overproduction. This is because, paradoxically, as productivity increases, the rate of profit decreases.   So not only does automation result in short term losses for the worker whose job is replaced by a machine, but it also results in long term crises of overproduction. Sadly, The burden of these crises will inevitably be placed on the worker's shoulders.  There ya go, hope that made sense.	1642833872.0	htpofo2	t3_s9ujak	t3_s9ujak	/r/socialism/comments/s9ujak/are_robots_should_be_considered_oppressed_workers/htpofo2/

48egpu0v	If you listen to the video, he's kinda flimsy on what exactly he means. I bet he's thinking the potential for a European war like this hasn't happened since WW2, but yeah, it doesn't really make sense the way he worded it. Plenty of nuclear powers have invaded other countries since WW2. Russia invaded Afghanistan, then the U.S. did so as well. You've got Korea and Vietnam which involved a mix of Russia, China, and the U.S.. Let's also not forget that any invasion France has participated in since 1960 was technically an invasion by a nuclear power.  More modern examples would be obviously Crimea, as well as China siezing small pieces of territory from India.   Then there's always the potential China will invade Taiwan, or that the U.S. will find a new cause to stick their noses in.	1642835719.0	htprdqy	t3_s9qwnw	t3_s9qwnw	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htprdqy/

5rc91lv2	> I don't think the purpose is to "cover over"  My argument wasn't about Alex de Jong's purpose. Here's what i said in parenthesis:   > historical context (which is covered over by anti-communists)  The official anti-communist historical memory of western states cover over the millions of refugees saved by the USSR during that specific time period. You just don't hear about it even though it's a historical fact that impacted millions of peoples of lives. The Prague Deceleration and 'victims of Nazism-Stalinism' commemorations speak for themselves. By not mentioning it in a socialist perspective on those events, this article played into that dominant anti-communist covering over. It should have been mentioned at least briefly in a single line. That would not detract from the article's "focus" one bit.   So my argument wasn't originally about Alex de Jong's "purpose", but since you want to talk about that we can. Alex de Jong is a representative of a trotskyist Fourth International journal in the Netherlands. In a previous article he claimed that the CPP-NPA-NDFP are "orthodox Stalinist monsters marching towards irrelevance" and specifically singled out Joma Sison, a political refugee of that movement living in the Netherlands, as an alleged perpetrator of grave crimes (something the current government of the Philippines also claims in requests for his extradition). The article was the subject of many debunking by [members of the National Democratic movement](https://pinoyweekly.org/2015/08/capitulation-no-substitute-for-national-liberation/), among others.	1642839030.0	htpwbkp	t3_s9hpwg	t1_htptcss	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htpwbkp/
39afm	It was definitely awkward and any of us can be forgiven for not understanding exactly what he meant. I think your interpretation is where he landed by my the end of the statement, but what he was thinking at that exact moment we’d have to ask him. What we shouldn’t do, though, is jump to the worst possible conclusion and act like there’s no other interpretation for something that wasn’t clearly spoken. My read is it’s just RNC Report pushing the senile thing.

edim0bd4	So when the west secures Kosovo's independence, it is OK but if Russia does the same with the donbass then that's too much? I'd even argue the other way around since in Kosovo back in 1999 there were at least a significant amount of people who did not want to split from Serbia while in donbass 2014 there was basically no one who wanted to stay in the same country with the fascist ukrainian regime.	1642839763.0	htpxe8w	t3_s9qwnw	t3_s9qwnw	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htpxe8w/

The agents were mostly Polish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian exiles who had been trained in the United Kingdom and Sweden and were to link up with the anti-Soviet resistance against the communist governments (the cursed soldiers, the Forest Brothers). The naval operations of the programme were carried out by German crew-members of the German Mine Sweeping Administration under the control of the Royal Navy.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642840643.0	htpynay	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htpym22	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htpynay/

But if a country does anything wrong under capitalism, oh well.  Humans are humans. They make mistakes, they make bad decisions sometimes. The double standard is ridiculous.

122z72	Socialism references a wide variety of ideologies, it's actually kind of hard to land on a super precise definition.  I tend to work off the assumption that socialism is a desire to organise the economy in an aggressively egalitarian manner for the benefit of the lower classes, this can be done via the state or other means (like worker co-ops).  To help give a clearer picture, I'd like to give you the following questions that help paint a clearer picture of the current socialist landscape:  * How should we understand historical states like the USSR? What triggered their collapse? * Is China currently a legitimate socialist project? * What is the most practical method to achieve to socialism? * When is it possible to pursue socialism in an immoral manner? * How should we relate to cultural issues like religion and nationalism? * How do we deal with anti-socialists?	1642841357.0	htpzo2o	t3_s9x6pr	t3_s9x6pr	/r/socialism/comments/s9x6pr/what_is_difference_between_socialism_and/htpzo2o/

Point 2: derailed freight train,s seriously injuring workers, burned 12 cars of a freight train and destroyed air pressure hoses of others. Point 3: blew up road and railway bridges; placed explosives on a railway bridge on the Berlin-Moscow line but these were discovered in time - hundreds would have been killed. Point 3: used special acids to damage vital factory machinery; put sand in the turbine of a factory, bringing it to a standstill, set fire to a stile-producing factory; promoted work slow-downs in factories; stole blueprints and samples of new technical developments. Point 4: killed 7,000 cows of a co-operative dairy by poisoning the wax coating of the wired used to bale the cows' corn fodder. Point 5: added soap to powdered milk destined for East German schools. Point 6: Raided and wrecked left-wing offices in East and West Berlin, stole membership lists; assaulted and kidnapped leftists and, on occasion, murdered them.

My thought was that they rejected social classes, Gautama coming from a privileged aristocracy are not much different from Che, people twisting it into something else is exactly what happens even to this day. Given the the time period I'd say it's revolutionary, else why do people today have entire religions in their name?	1642851340.0	htqdfpg	t3_sa03ye	t1_htqb1om	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htqdfpg/
f1r7djnh	Compare the GDP of the US to Russia. If Putin could afford it he would be doing the same shit.  Russia has been competing with the US in subverting local governments for their own interests. And these interests are no longer defensivd and/or in the interests of implementing socialism.  Some drivers of Russian Capitalistic Imperialism:  Its massive energy corporations which are the main component of its economy.  Rozneft, Gazprom, Transneft  Its remerging MIC in direct competition with the US to sell arms.  Russian so called military aid is imperialist in the sense it seeks to protect existing and gain additional financial assets. For example in Syria.  To prevent the construction of a US/Qatar backed Pipeline or a Iran backed pipeline which would compete vs Russian Pipelines into Europe.  Syria is critical in that it offers pipelines routes or Russias competitors through to Europe.	1642851673.0	htqdwys	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htporyp	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htqdwys/

In Jesus’ case the brutality that was unleashed in his name was unmatched and has huge ramifications in the past, present and future.  In Buddha’s case the sangha’s that were created exclude the majority of people seeking to become monks and in so doing they’ll become lay Buddhists instead. This is so they’ll support the monastics of which they are very few.	1642853553.0	htqgmtd	t3_sa03ye	t3_sa03ye	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htqgmtd/

bdtzv	Thank you so much. That is a very good quote, "An injury to one is an injury to all".   I think the pen often leads to the sword.  I don't know who said this originally, but I know I've heard that "revolution is war with bloodshed, and politics is war without bloodshed". I think that is very apt, and I think that we have arrived at the point now where there is much more politics than there is war. The right to bear arms was relevant in 1791, but I think our arms have changed. In a sense, our arms have always been our voices, our vote, but I think now the second amendment has very much become synonymous with the first: the freedom to assemble and petition the government to change. That is revolution, that is politics, in the current age.  And that's what we're trying to do here. We're trying to show people that their voices still have power. But instead of assembling in the street, we're assembling online, and we're concentrating our voices in one direction to have the maximal effect. We saw this with SOPA, what the internet could do, and we're going to see our power again with takejohndown.com. It starts with my landlord, but it's not going to end there.	1642860426.0	htqshoq	t3_sa08uf	t1_htqmmbt	/r/socialism/comments/sa08uf/takejohndowncom_has_had_over_3000_people_visit_it/htqshoq/

The distrust is valid. But due to a lack of education and critical thinking skills, that distrust is exploited to fuel the culture war, the class war and really just keep everyone confused and divided while the oligarchy reaps incredible Capitol and Power/Influence.

Palestinians revolt because their homes are stolen, not because they hate Jews. And by the way, victims of Israeli colonialism aren’t just Muslims, but Christians and Atheists as well. Western media paints it as a ethnoreligious conflict because viewing one side as mostly Arab Muslims means it’s easy for audiences to see them as the “bad guys,” because Arab Muslims are always the “bad guys.”	1642863118.0	htqy3oa	t3_s9ir4v	t1_hto3ne3	/r/socialism/comments/s9ir4v/dozens_of_israeli_settlers_attacked_palestinian/htqy3oa/

I'm actually surprised that it wasn't used as an opportunity to revv up the war machine and to reiterate "China bad" given that China had nukes in 1967 and they invaded Vietnam in 1979.  He missed a homerun propaganda opportunity to engage in projection and to frame China as *the* major threat to global peace and stability by adding a caveat like:  "*...except for China when they invaded Vietnam in '79, of course.*"   &nbsp;  I really hope this is indicative of their consent-manufacturing machine failing.	1642863682.0	htqzc76	t3_s9qwnw	t3_s9qwnw	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htqzc76/

If you listen to his whole answer, Biden isn’t simply conveying a gross mischaracterization of history (ie [Russia defending itself](https://youtu.be/7zZwhGHeIYM) is literally Nazi Germany invading Poland; whereas NATO expanding right up to their borders is just another case of the Good Guys spreading democracy and rainbows and unicorns, as usual).  No, the context, the nuance, that’s missing in this discussion is that he used that mischaracterization to convey a thinly-veiled threat, not just to Russia, but to the entire world: The US is willing to risk starting WWIII in order to continue its encirclement of its near-peer competitors; we will jeopardize life on earth in order to win a game of chicken that we started in someone else’s driveway.

5xddq	Have at it with the numerous sources listed on the Wikipedia page about it:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus  This talk with historian, and professor of religious studies, Bart Ehrman specifically addresses the ideas spread on the internet about this (I think it's even quoted on the Wikipedia page):  https://youtu.be/hnybQxIgfPw  We have very limited information on exactly who Jesus was, and a lot of the specifics are of course mythical due to that the earliest sources happen some 20-30 years after Jesus' death, Paul for an example. But there did exist a preacher of some sort, probably named Jesus/Yeshua, who had followers who created the religion afterwards.  I recommend reading up on early Christian history, it's quite fascinating! Things like early theological debates and developments about whether Jesus was divine, or God himself, or not, which the synoptic gospels don't assert - only his resurrection by God is attested.	1642868195.0	htr9vcw	t3_sa03ye	t1_htr5glv	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htr9vcw/

One day Minty won £100,000 on a lottery scratch card and Gramsci immediately turned on him and bit his knees off, then fled.

The attitude towards Russia is highly negative of Crimea and this translates to Russian nationalists/vatniks not being quite welcome. Can't blame the Ukrainians for that quite natural reaction.

4207vzct	If we take what you are saying as true, which we shouldn’t because it isn’t, but for the sake of argument we’ll say you are correct. I wonder why “straight” socialism never works? Let’s ask ourselves that.   The most glaring and obvious reason is American imperialism and hegemony. They will do anything to prevent socialism from being enacted anywhere. They even supported a regime change in Bolivia just recently. Even though, as you said, Morales is running more of a social democracy.   But the other reason is that most states who attempt socialism are more or less incredibly impoverished, sometimes third world, countries. They don’t have the resources to adopt a post scarcity society. So they have to make some sacrifices in order to build the economy they need to actually build socialism.   But again, this is pointless because pure socialism has, does, and can work. Why are you on a socialist subreddit if you think otherwise?	1642879251.0	hts25ke	t3_sa5z39	t1_hts0ux9	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/hts25ke/

Alex de Jong claimed there was a ["assassination campaign" by the CPP-NPA-NDFP based on the allegation of Walden Bello](https://pinoyweekly.org/2015/08/the-war-rages-on/), a former revolutionary who became a government official and Ford Foundation employee ([Ford Foundation has a history of being used as CIA front](https://petras.lahaine.org/the-ford-foundation-and-the-cia-a-documented-case-of-philanthropic-collaboration-with-the-secret-police/)). Bello's allegation which forms the core of Alex de Jong's argument is based on an Ang Bayan chart from December 2004 showing trotskyist splits that is mischaracterized as a "hit list" (there is no call to extrajudicial violence attached to the chart). [You can see the chart here](https://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-47/041207eng.pdf)  It's certainly at least worth a look at, just like I read this article you posted even though I find Alex de Jong's politics contemptible.	1642881469.0	hts7o7t	t3_s9hpwg	t1_hts4ndj	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/hts7o7t/

gz0ki	I think comments like this downplay the revolutionary potential of the proletariat and other classes who comprise of the people in being the leading factor in waging a democratic revolution and socialist revolution. Imperialism still very much exists in Bolivia even after all these years of the so-called "pink tide", so until imperialism is militarily and politically defeated in the area Socialism i.e. the dictatorship of the proletariat should be very much out of the question. Not to mention that Morales has been willing to court PRC imperialism becoming its comprador. But then again we have to look at the source of the tailism: Jacobin Magazine. Most certainly not Marxist let alone even Marxist-Leninist-Maoist.	1642883437.0	htscgpr	t3_sa5z39	t1_htrbmyp	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/htscgpr/

8n3vb	The garage thing could be due to ordinances. In our city parking is “impacted” and technically homeowners can get fined if their garage doesn’t have space to park their car, because that means their car is on the street contributing to the massive parking problem. It barely ever gets actually enforced, but the ordinance is there anyway so rental agencies have to have it on paper probably that garages are only for cars so they have their asses covered.   The rest of it sounds like blanket rules because they don’t want to have to deal with neighbors complaining about “unsightly” or “offensive” decorations or furnishing so they just no to practically everything.	1642890068.0	htsss9m	t3_saapmt	t1_hts9f3f	/r/socialism/comments/saapmt/landlords_are_leeches_on_the_back_of_the_working/htsss9m/

Bolivia would have been violently invaded, if not before the Bolivian military staged a coup or some shit. Which a coup did end up happening anyway because even social democracy is generally not tolerated by the west in the global south. It cuts into the western world's bottom line.  The imperial western core will do its best to install and maintain puppet politicians in the "third world". There are some exceptions but those are very contextual and extraordinary.

The white/European working class should seize control of the means of production and the stockpiled wealth of the capitalist class and use that to help Africans in the diaspora, indigenous people, and all colonized countries/nations/people build themselves up from the position European colonialism and capitalism has put them in.  So yes, but it must be done in a systemic way on a mass scale in the context of socialist revolution.

4lpkqm5q	I mean this really depends how you approach it and your personal perspective in how you understand the marxist tradition.  As someone who comes from a classical marxist approach of Marx/Engels, with Lenin added on. And someone who thinks Gramsci/Rosa Luxemburg despite being flawed in some areas have a lot to offer. And that Trotsky was much closer to Lenin and also a very useful theorist (has his own flaws) and Stalin was pretty much a party bureaucrat grifter. To where the USSR by the 30s was a degenerated workers state and Stalinism is a form of bonapartism. I tend to follow a similar analysis of China. Although i will conceed Mao is way more theroetically advanced than Stalin and China has a lot more differences in how it came to be and how what it transformed into.   The book i forget the author but its China from permament revolution to coubter revolution. Is a pretty good introduction and very persuasive. Although it definetely comes from a much more hard line approach of the tradition i tend to follow.    The events in China are in one hand over blown and in one hand not. It is very clear the Chinese bureacuracy is a totalitarian and anti-worker government that has repeatedly conceeded to captialism. However the US specifically has a lot of overblown criticisms aimed to support their own personal inperialist agenda.   My position i take is one step removed from Cuba. Cuba is also somewhat degenerated owning to its own revolution. But overall still attempts to stand for socialist principles especially the people to where the illegal blockade by the US and constant antagonistic behaviour is worth to support them against. But with the caviat of a critical defence, one where we want them to push further to a true workers state.   China i see as a lesser version of this, where we should not support US imperialism against China, but also shouldnt support Chinese imperialism. Hong Kong and Tibet are prime examples despite what are personal opinions are which tbh mine are somewhat pro-China, us as socialists support the Right of Nations to self determination something Marx and Lenin wrote extensively about and this is something that should not be blocked. That doesnt mean as I said you fall for US imperialism, just that you stand against both and always stand for workers and people. China is currently the only imperialism power to reliably challenge US imperialism, but is not a socialist saviour. We must defend China against imperialist aggression, because we stand against imperialism, but simultaneously stand against their and only support the advancement of the workers in both the US and China. As we are internationalists and shouldnt be blinded by national bias.	1642894700.0	htt44iv	t3_sa6i5t	t3_sa6i5t	/r/socialism/comments/sa6i5t/question_about_china_ugh_i_know/htt44iv/
5xddq	First of all, I'm not a dude.     You are just being rude and obtuse. There has never in this conversation been a claim that there's historical proof for a divine Jesus. There has never been a claim in this conversation that the stories in the gospels are all historical truths. The gospels are later texts based on oral sources, they contradict eachother. They're used in research as important sources, but they're not read as such *uncritically.*  I'm not sure if you're trying to troll me - the first sentence of the wikipedia articele very clearly states the consensus, and it is repeated many times in the article.     The claim is simply that the academic consensus is, to paraphrase the wikipedia article, that *Jesus is accepted as a historical figure.* I could go through all the different points about how history works as an academic field, what this means, what the limitations of this claim are etc but I have a hunch it's a time of waste.  &#x200B;  (Not that the story about Herod is true - or believed to be as such by historians - but the actual estimates for Jesus birth isn't 1 CE you know, but rather 6-4 BCE. Which you can find out if you just do some basic research. The estimates for Herods deaths are, unsurprisingly, listed in the wikipedia article on him. Have fun: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod\_the\_Great#Year\_of\_death:\_either\_4\_BCE,\_or\_5\_BCE,\_1\_BCE,\_1\_CE)     And that concludes this conversation.	1642894714.0	htt45t4	t3_sa03ye	t1_htrs677	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htt45t4/

While I'm not entirely sure about the political leanings of the protesters, (I've heard a lot, and I'm sure there was a great mix) one must recognize that fighting back against the army being sent in to a protest is reasonable.   Even if the army had yet fired a shot, *they are the army* their job is to kill.

bxap9g57	There was no "massacre" in Tiananmen Square.   An Indian diplomat there basically said very few people died, it was a huge overexaggeration from the West to call it a "massacre."  Basically under the reform and opening up era, there was a liberalization of China's political orientation (a dialectical process from the earlier period of Cultural Revolution).  Faith in Marxism Leninism worldwide was also fading for a variety of material reasons. The Berlin Wall did fall 4 months later after-all, so you can say it was a global process.   So there were a bunch of protesters asking for more liberal reforms, thought maybe the Leninist single party state that was formed post 1949 wasn't the best decision, thought Western "Liberal Democracy" was maybe the better system, after-all Japan and South Korea got rich with that.   Eventually the Party did what was needed to defend the Chinese Revolution and save the one party state. Sent in the tanks and told the protesters to leave and there will be mass amnesty.   That's what basically happened. Most people left, the more violent ones fought the PLA, and less than 100 died overall. What should be emphasized was no one died in Tiananmen Square, it was outside the square.   My overall verdict of it: I personally think it was the right decision, though I don't celebrate people dying, even if they are brainwashed by liberal idealism. What exactly should Deng Xiaoping done otherwise? Disband the Party? Have complete anarchy?   The difference between China and Eastern Europe post 1989 is all the justifications I need for supporting Deng's decision for decisively ending what looks to be a liberal counter revolution, supported by CIA, in a very humane manner I must add.	1642897286.0	httagsn	t3_sa6i5t	t3_sa6i5t	/r/socialism/comments/sa6i5t/question_about_china_ugh_i_know/httagsn/

bxap9g57	Well it is somewhat contradictory, which is why there was never any socialist revolution in rich Western countries.   On one hand, especially in US, the workers here are being drained by Wall Street vampires of all their labor value. 70% lives paycheck to paycheck because the ruling class who controls the FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate, coined by Micheal Hudson) jacks up the price of housing, rent, insurance, medicare, to the point where most people have nothing left at the end of the month.   On the other hand, US workers benefitted massively from Capitalism, because they live in the highest stage of Capitalism, Imperialism. There is a massive difference between a worker in the US living in "poverty" making $50k a year, and a sweat shop worker in Indonesia making $0.50 an hour making nike shoes, and lives in the slums on the outskirts.	1642898178.0	httcpms	t3_sadowt	t3_sadowt	/r/socialism/comments/sadowt/most_obvious_ways_westerners_are_hurt_under/httcpms/

2h8owb	>Russia defending itself    >   >expanding right up to their borders  It takes a lot of gall to say you're justified "defending yourself" from other countries' internal matters. As this post points out, and you seem to have conveniently forgotten, *Russia already invaded Ukraine in 2014.* And now you're pointing to Ukraine's defensive maneuvering to say that what Russia provoked through aggression justifies more aggression?   You're arbitrarily putting the burden of not starting a war on the country being invaded. And to disguise that fact, you pretend like it's the US spearheading this and not Ukraine asking for help. "How dare you state your desire to defend yourself and ask for allies to aid you if necessary?"   Plus, Ukraine doesn't qualify for NATO membership anyway. It doesn't meet the democratic standards required. It could, perhaps, in the future, but for now it falls short. But even if it did, why should Russia get a say in how other countries act to protect their borders? It's like saying the local burglars should get a say in whether you install a security system. Ukraine has its own agency, and if Russia weren't threatening, it could just as easily ally itself with them over the countries to its west.	1642898992.0	httenm1	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htr05gv	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/httenm1/

Cultural norms are vastly different, and nobody likes debt or credit (no, I mean there's a fanatic hatred of such systems). There are things you are allowed to do and others you aren't (all within reason). Essentially, if you're in sync with the cultural norms, you're fine.

oyt3d	They would be paid for by the state, but pretty obvious to remember that these are systemic changes that would be made. No one is suggesting it would just be cash and if it was then the banks and companies and landlords would have all that money back in their hands in five years. Massive systemic changes, police and prison abolition, investment in communities and community institutions, etc. Also it’s not payment for white privilege as much as payment for the reasons those privileges are not universal and to overcome all the barriers and oppressions dealt with. Coates wrote a good article explaining why reparations for Jim Crow and Redlining are needed too so it’s strange that only slavery is discussed.	1642905424.0	htttit5	t3_sadsyf	t3_sadsyf	/r/socialism/comments/sadsyf/should_white_people_pay_reparations_to_black/htttit5/

hgxlfkxk	In the context of the U.S., it should be the U.S. government which pays reparations, as the U.S. government was responsible for the existence of slavery in this country. I think this is a much better way of framing this - as a historic national debt.   This avoids people saying things like "my family didn't even immigrate until after slavery" because existing national debts are something citizens have to accept as part of their citizenship even if they were incurred before you became a citizen.	1642907196.0	httxj4v	t3_sadsyf	t3_sadsyf	/r/socialism/comments/sadsyf/should_white_people_pay_reparations_to_black/httxj4v/

Goldman wrote this in response to Trotsky's ["Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm)  > Wasn’t she writing from Russia?  Pretty sure she was in Spain when she wrote "Trotsky protests too much." She went there in 1936 to help the CNT-FAI and returned to Canada in '39.  > Wasn’t Berkman just broken after he tried to shoot Frick?  He was sent to prison for over a decade which certainly did a number on him.  > Was any of this relevant to anything when both of them died two years later?  No, but it was relevant to what Trotsky put forward.

1fqiovyr	Since MLK never belonged to any specific party or socialist organisation it might be hard to tie him to anything specific. But it is interesting to note that one of MLK's early influences were AJ Muste, [at least according to the AJ Muste institute](https://ajmuste.org/):  > Muste was a central (yet largely unknown) figure who introduced a young college student and seminarian named Martin Luther King, Jr. to the notion of nonviolent activism and, by doing so, changed him and, through him, the entire country.  > When Muste first presented his views to King, the two men fell into a “pretty heated argument,” before King could agree. A.J., not Gandhi, was the first to influence King in his turn toward nonviolence.  AJ Muste himself was a sort of christian democratic socialist, and ex-trotskyist.	1642922811.0	hturzq2	t3_sabk9o	t3_sabk9o	/r/socialism/comments/sabk9o/was_mlk_a_democratic_socialist_or_a_social/hturzq2/

8w585ut2	Alienation. Even in imperialist nations with robust welfare, alienation is inevitable. It's fairly easy to point out that workers, no matter where they live, are treated as objects and that they have no ownership of their labor or the means of production. Producing under capitalism and the alienation that comes with it is incredibly demoralizing and everyone feels it at some point.  Imperialism also affects westerners because of the wars in the middle east, in particular the Iraq war and lies about WMDs. Imperialism also causes jobs to go overseas which reduces available production jobs within the borders of the imperialist nations.	1642924250.0	htutymn	t3_sadowt	t3_sadowt	/r/socialism/comments/sadowt/most_obvious_ways_westerners_are_hurt_under/htutymn/

5m8iwqrr	> Yikes. Nobody likes spending their hard earned money on taxes. Tax money doesn't go nearly as far either. Too much beaurocracy and too many unions involved in public sector.  Too many CEOs and shareholders in the private sector, and still the same bureaucracy but not for the public good. Unions are also better unless you hate yourself or actually own a company and want to exploit workers more   > The best socialism is no socialism.  Gibberish.  > But that doesn't mean we should have no socialism. Some things are better served by the government simply because they don't lend themselves well to private industry.  So even with your complete misunderstanding of what Socialism is, no socialism _isn't_ the best socialism.  > Most things are better kept private. Certainly much cheaper and less wasteful.  This is just ideology with no evidence. Actually privatisation has proven you wrong many times over.  This isn't a sub for you to get praise for jacking yourself off over capitalist myths. Fuck off somewhere else.	1642926452.0	htuwx9x	t3_sa5z39	t1_hturpub	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/htuwx9x/

ghip6kvy	I don't know if that was made by a kid but it's tremendously real. I have seen many graphics, diagrams and other and I think this one is the most real I have seen.   - First as tragedy, then as farce (das eine Mal als Tragödie, das andere Mal als Farce).  That's what's represented in that drawing. Political parties are made to confuse and entertain us by blaming the other one.	1642930423.0	htv20sa	t3_sajbe4	t3_sajbe4	/r/socialism/comments/sajbe4/is_this_propaganda_realistic_in_any_way/htv20sa/

hw9dg	Yes, except it does something a lot of this kind of propaganda does: draws a false equivalency between capitalists/bigots and the New Left.  The founders of BLM are Marxists and so are many members. So is a big part of the LGBTQ community. A more accurate propaganda shows them protesting against Capitalism *and* bigotry, rather than what this shows, which is marginalized people and their oppressors squabbling with each other while the Capitalists reap their profits.  It reeks of "the problem with our society is that the 'elites' are sowing 'division' between us", as if marginalized groups and their allies are equally at fault for these divisions as those who are marginalizing them. Liberals, POC, and queer people not being anti-Capitalists *is* part of the problem; the much, much bigger part of the problem is the right-wing which is not only *more* pro-Capitalist, they're vehemently anti-anticapitalist on top of being bigots.	1642932502.0	htv4nm5	t3_sajbe4	t3_sajbe4	/r/socialism/comments/sajbe4/is_this_propaganda_realistic_in_any_way/htv4nm5/
