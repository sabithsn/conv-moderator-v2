5wevy	It is a vibration in your ear, caused by the changing pressure wave, but the vibration is on a much larger scale than individual molecules.  When we say 'molecules are vibrating', it typically means 'the bonds between atoms in the molecule are vibrating', which is the point monkey is making here. Temperature is a measure of kinetic translational energy in a gas.  If molecules are vibrating (and rotating), they are storing additional energy in the gas on top of the kinetic translational motion that causes pressure, and is measured by temperature.  That's why two gases of different molecules produce the same pressure for a given temperature, but take different amounts of heat energy to change their temperature.	1642693585.0	htgxvkf	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgvd4r	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgxvkf/

axrw5	what they measure in these studies is gray matter volume as seen in an MRI scan. they aren't counting cells, but measuring how much space is taken up by gray matter.  so, you can imagine that the volume might change for many reasons. cell death is one, but more likely causes of reduced volume are changes in cell *size*, essentially atrophy. and those kinds of changes would be reversible - death is not (i.e. you can't really grow new nerve cells in the cortex).	1642693845.0	htgyk3x	t3_s78e8q	t3_s78e8q	/r/askscience/comments/s78e8q/does_abstinence_from_addiction_regrow_grey_matter/htgyk3x/
hgk5l	Sound does travel better over water in many cases -- if the water is colder than the air -- but it's not because it travels *faster*. It's actually because it travels more slowly.  Like other waves, sound waves will refract towards a medium where they travel more slowly. Usually, the atmosphere gets colder the higher you go, so sound gets bent upwards and disappears into the upper atmosphere. But if there happens to be a layer of colder air near the earth (an "inversion"), sound will get bent downward instead of upward, so it's possible to hear things from a greater distance.  The same effect happens with light, where it's called a superior mirage. On hot summer days you can sometimes see islands or ships that are quite far "over the horizon," if you are looking across a cold body of water.	1642694051.0	htgz40d	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgv581	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgz40d/

d9g6t	That's a great question! If you ever take a chemistry or thermodynamics class, you will learn this. An ideal gas is a theoretical model of a gas assuming that all the particles interact only by colliding with one another, not by any other forces (e.g. electro-magnetic forces) and that the average speed of a gas particle is related to its temperature. Virtually all the predictions about ideal gasses are based on these assumptions. Real gasses don't follow the rules of ideal gasses, especially at low temperatures and high pressures. However, as temperatures get higher (to a point, once they become plasmas this breaks down) or pressures get lower, they behave more and more like an ideal gas.   Ideal gasses have very predictable properties that let you determine things like what the density of a gas will be at a given temperature and pressure. The most important rule is the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where P=pressure, V= volume (in an enclosed container), n = the number of particles, T= absolute temperature, degrees above absolute zero, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.31 Joule/mole-Kelvin).  The ideal gas law lets you predict any of those variables as long as you know the other 3 (not counting R, since that's always the same).   I know that's all a lot to take in all at once, but if you ever take a chemistry class, or do some of your own reading, it will become clearer.	1642694130.0	htgzbj9	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgwwlr	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgzbj9/

gekpw	We're talking about a gas, which is a collection of *many* individual particles (think Avogadro's number). The physics of this gas is going to depend on how those individual particles interact with each other.  The simplest case is that they just don't interact with each other at all. And that turns out to be a great description of gases for many applications.	1642694244.0	htgzmh2	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgy0rk	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgzmh2/
d76le	I study sound. In my experience, by far the biggest misconception that people have about sound is that sound speed increases with density. In all materials, the speed of sound is equal to sqrt(incompressibility / density). Incompressibility is the ratio of pressure change over volume change for small compressions/rarefactions. Note that, with a little bit of math, this agrees exactly with the answer by /u/RobusEtCeleritas for the specific case of ideal gases.  So, density is in the *denominator.* Why do denser materials tend to have higher sound speeds then? Turns out that incompressibility actually increases faster than density as you go from, say, air to water to rock, so air has the lowest sound speed of those examples.  On the other hand, consider a foam of water and air. Water is hard to compress, air is easy. Water is dense, air is light. The incompressibility of the mixture is closer to the air, and the density of the mixture is closer to the water (at least on a log scale). As a result, the foam has an extremely low sound speed due to having a low incompressibility and a high density.	1642694416.0	hth02zq	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth02zq/
ajweh	Thanks for taking the time to explain mate. Let me take a stab at this, excuse any ignorance. So an ideal gas, is gas that's speed and direction is just affected by temperature? And if we know 3 of the 4 variables it would dictate the fourth?  This is just me trying to make sense. Also, what and why is R? I think I understand what constant means. I think this means the interaction between gasses and temperature is always the same for all gasses?	1642695461.0	hth2u1w	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgzbj9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth2u1w/

6y75e	A UV light could still work actually, it would just need to be so powerful that the light coming back from the toy is brighter than everything else.  At night, the toy and UV light interact to emit light in the visible spectrum (fluorescence). Because there is very little other light reaching your eye from other objects, it's easy to detect this source that stands out. During the daytime, the toy is still emitting light when you shine the UV light on it, it's just that that light + the light that is reflecting from the sun is not much brighter than the light being reflected from everything else, so it doesn't stand out. If the UV light was (ridiculously) powerful enough, the toy could be as bright as a lightbulb and that might be easier to spot.	1642696470.0	hth5kft	t3_s8m6cp	t3_s8m6cp	/r/askscience/comments/s8m6cp/is_there_something_similar_to_uv_light_that_would/hth5kft/

gekpw	If the density is low enough, the mean free path (the average distance traveled before interacting with something) can be much larger than the average distance between particles in the gas. So that means that on average, each molecule will simply pass by many other molecules before ever interacting with one. And in such a case, it can be appropriate to neglect their interactions entirely.  You can modify the ideal gas equation of state to account for interactions, but that generally makes it harder to calculate things with little improvements in precision, since the ideal gas model performs so well.	1642696558.0	hth5t48	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth3g1l	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5t48/

jfvca	Yes, they can get actual antibody concentrations, and yes, they can differentiate between vaccine-induced and infection-induced antibodies.   The way they do that is by measuring 2 different antibodies: against spike protein, and against a different COVID-19 protein (I forget which one). The non-spike antibodies would only result from actual infection.   As a minor wrinkle, if you have non-spike antibodies, your spike antibodies will be from both vaccination and infection; at that point the relative contribution of each can't be teased apart.	1642696695.0	hth66gx	t3_s8mbjb	t3_s8mbjb	/r/askscience/comments/s8mbjb/what_do_common_antibody_tests_reveal_can_they/hth66gx/

7p334elw	Can I just clarify this is nonsense.  Complications of cavities traveling up the softer tissues inside your teeth has more to do with communication to open spaces in the head.  bottom teeth communicate with the submandibular, submental, lingual, and buccal spaces.  Infections in this area can trigger an infection the can comprise your airway, and/or lead to sepsis.  Infections in particularly your maxillary canines (top pointy teeth in front of your face) can lead to space infections around your eyes leading to loss of vision or brain abscess.    It doesn’t really have anything to do with the nerves necessarily.  I guess the nerves travel through those spaces along with vessels.

106abc	Another way to think of it is an ideal gas is a real gas but with the equations simplified enough that you can actually solve them.     A similar thing happens with packing problems. If we assume an infinite sized box (an "ideal container") we don't have to worry about having the box and the balls it holds being in the same place at the same time. (I included this because it seems simpler than gases to me. If it's not for you, then just ignore it.) But when you try to put oranges in a crate for shipping? You absolutely have to take the size of the crate into consideration.	1642698683.0	hthbn7b	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgzbj9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthbn7b/

d6t1oytl	> Pressure waves are propagated by molecule interactions through collisions.  For a gas this doesn't give the whole picture.   Imagine a box with a diaphragm which we can move into the box very fast - faster than the speed of sound. Outside the box is gas at atmospheric pressure. Now we withdraw the diaphragm into the box so quickly that no molecules of the gas have moved. The new volume available to the gas, through which we have moved the diaphragm, contains no molecules. Consider the place where the diaphragm was - the volume on one side has an atmospheric pressure of molecules, and the volume on the other has no molecules. Without any collisions between molecules some of the molecules which were already travelling towards the diaphragm will continue in a straight line. But there are no molecules travelling the other way. The atmospheric pressure gas in front of the original position of the diaphragm will decrease in pressure, and the volume without molecules will increase in pressure. The same will happen outwards for subsequent volumes of gas with less extreme differences in the number of molecules. Therefore a pressure wave can move through a gas without collisions.	1642699514.0	hthdz1k	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgv31c	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthdz1k/

It would definitely be faster than an airliner would descend under pretty much any other controlled circumstance, but it's still 'only' going to be something like 6,000 to 8,000 feet per minute; if I (and Google) did the math correctly, 8000 fpm is just shy of 80 knots of vertical velocity. Vmo varies but is generally in excess of 300 kts for jet airliners.

There is just about always some kind of solubility limit, or at least the ability for small particle of a substance to remain suspended in aqueous solution.

4gpe3ud6	There are so many other variables involved in atmospheric density and pressure, let alone flight, that a general answer is impossible. There are a lot of interrelated factors like the amount of atmosphere, gravity, composition, temperature, etc. The relationships are not even absolute--for example lower gravity does not necessarily imply a lower pressure or density. Atmospheres depend on a lot more than gravity and magnetic fields, and we have a lot more to learn. For fictional or hypothetical purposes there are a lot of possibilities. Even the limited sample size of our solar system has different examples to consider.  For level, constant-air-speed flight, the sum of the lift, weight, drag, and thrust vectors must be zero. In the simplest scenario of level flight, lift cancels weight and thrust cancels drag. Weight is linearly proportional to gravity, and lift and drag (at a given velocity) are linearly proportional to air density. Thrust comes from the aircraft engine.  [https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg)  It is indeed possible for flight to be much easier in a low gravity environment. The air pressure at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan (with surface gravity less than 1/7 of Earth's) is \~1.5 atmospheres. Titan's atmosphere is about 20 percent more massive than Earth's, despite having only 40 percent of the radius and 16 percent of its surface area. The surface air is four to five times denser than Earth's because it it is so cold (around -180 C). Generally it is easier to fly on Titan because of the low gravity (lower weight) and denser air (higher lift). (But the higher drag means more thrust is needed.) NASA will be sending a rotorcraft drone to fly around Titan, one much bigger than the Ingenuity demonstrator sent to Mars. Supposedly--all other difficulties like cold unbreathable air aside--a person could even strap on wings and fly on Titan. The cold temperatures cause other problems, though. For example, due to the cold temperature the speed of sound on Titan is \~190 m/s, much lower than the speed of sound on Earth (\~340 m/s at room temperature, \~300 m/s in the cold stratosphere). As an aircraft, or parts of it (i.e. propeller or rotor blades), approaches the speed of sound the aerodynamics become more complicated and difficult to deal with (sound barrier).  Take Venus as another example. At its surface, the air pressure is over 90 atmospheres. The density is over 50 times that of Earth air at sea level (and 1/15 that of liquid water). It is less than 90 because gas density decreases with temperature. The gravity is slightly lower than Earth. Practically speaking, though, flight near the surface of Venus would be much harder than for Earth. The high temperature weakens, in some cases even melts, most materials, especially common electronics. The high pressure necessitates heavier construction more like a submarine than an aircraft. And furthermore, the "air" at the surface of Venus is not even really a gas. Because of the temperature and pressure the CO2 is a [supercritical fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid) with properties of both liquids and gases. At high altitudes, the density and temperature drop, becoming almost Earthlike (though not both temperature and density/pressure at the same altitude, and there is the little matter of sulfuric acid clouds). Flight there would be more or less as difficult as on Earth--though so far the only aircraft on Venus were a couple Soviet balloons.  Another factor is that most powered flight on Earth uses combustion engines, which only work in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. You need to rely on electric power from batteries (for prolonged flight charged by solar or nuclear) to power a propeller or rotor, which (with today's technology at least) increases weight. Or you could bring your own oxidizer and use a rocket, but that would be even less efficient.  Flight is indeed much more difficult on Mars because of the low air density (\~1.6 percent that at Earth's surface), despite the low gravity (38 percent of Earth's surface). The thin air also can't carry heat away as rapidly, so overheating of motors is a major concern. Again, the cold decreases the speed of sound, decreasing the maximum speed the rotors can be allowed to rotate.  Note, though, that Titan is much less massive than Mars, and both Mars and Venus lack an internally generated magnetic field. There is a lot more to having and retaining a significant atmosphere than surface gravity and magnetic fields.  Edit: Planned or completed non-rocket flights on other worlds include:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega\_program#Balloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_program#Balloon)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity\_(helicopter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter))  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly\_(spacecraft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(spacecraft))	1642706707.0	hthxpcc	t3_s83qe8	t3_s83qe8	/r/askscience/comments/s83qe8/how_is_our_atmospheric_pressure_connected_to_the/hthxpcc/

fhodm	When root canal treatment is necessary, the nerve is often not fully dead, and is sending the pain signals giving you a severe toothache.  But a properly done root canal is painless because of anaesthesia. If pain is experienced that means the anaesthetic was not adequate. This can be because of unusual anatomy that some people have, or genetic resistance to anaesthetic. Anaesthetic resistance is well known to be associated is red hair. A good dentist will use alternative injection sites or sometimes a different anaesthetic to overcome this. (There's one anaesthetic, I don't remember the name, that dentists usually don't use because it takes many hours to wear off, but they can order it in specially if it's needed for an anaesthetic-resistant patient.)  There may be rare exceptions, but that is by far the normal situation.  The other reason people think root canal treatments are painful is they are remembering the pain of the toothache that the root canal was performed to treat.	1642707324.0	hthzc68	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthzc68/

gekpw	If the density is low enough, the mean free path (the average distance traveled before interacting with something) can be much larger than the average distance between particles in the gas. So that means that on average, each molecule will simply pass by many other molecules before ever interacting with one. And in such a case, it can be appropriate to neglect their interactions entirely.  You can modify the ideal gas equation of state to account for interactions, but that generally makes it harder to calculate things with little improvements in precision, since the ideal gas model performs so well.	1642696558.0	hth5t48	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth3g1l	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5t48/

The way they do that is by measuring 2 different antibodies: against spike protein, and against a different COVID-19 protein (I forget which one). The non-spike antibodies would only result from actual infection.   As a minor wrinkle, if you have non-spike antibodies, your spike antibodies will be from both vaccination and infection; at that point the relative contribution of each can't be teased apart.	1642696695.0	hth66gx	t3_s8mbjb	t3_s8mbjb	/r/askscience/comments/s8mbjb/what_do_common_antibody_tests_reveal_can_they/hth66gx/

7p334elw	Can I just clarify this is nonsense.  Complications of cavities traveling up the softer tissues inside your teeth has more to do with communication to open spaces in the head.  bottom teeth communicate with the submandibular, submental, lingual, and buccal spaces.  Infections in this area can trigger an infection the can comprise your airway, and/or lead to sepsis.  Infections in particularly your maxillary canines (top pointy teeth in front of your face) can lead to space infections around your eyes leading to loss of vision or brain abscess.    It doesn’t really have anything to do with the nerves necessarily.  I guess the nerves travel through those spaces along with vessels.

106abc	Another way to think of it is an ideal gas is a real gas but with the equations simplified enough that you can actually solve them.     A similar thing happens with packing problems. If we assume an infinite sized box (an "ideal container") we don't have to worry about having the box and the balls it holds being in the same place at the same time. (I included this because it seems simpler than gases to me. If it's not for you, then just ignore it.) But when you try to put oranges in a crate for shipping? You absolutely have to take the size of the crate into consideration.	1642698683.0	hthbn7b	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgzbj9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthbn7b/

d6t1oytl	> Pressure waves are propagated by molecule interactions through collisions.  For a gas this doesn't give the whole picture.   Imagine a box with a diaphragm which we can move into the box very fast - faster than the speed of sound. Outside the box is gas at atmospheric pressure. Now we withdraw the diaphragm into the box so quickly that no molecules of the gas have moved. The new volume available to the gas, through which we have moved the diaphragm, contains no molecules. Consider the place where the diaphragm was - the volume on one side has an atmospheric pressure of molecules, and the volume on the other has no molecules. Without any collisions between molecules some of the molecules which were already travelling towards the diaphragm will continue in a straight line. But there are no molecules travelling the other way. The atmospheric pressure gas in front of the original position of the diaphragm will decrease in pressure, and the volume without molecules will increase in pressure. The same will happen outwards for subsequent volumes of gas with less extreme differences in the number of molecules. Therefore a pressure wave can move through a gas without collisions.	1642699514.0	hthdz1k	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgv31c	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthdz1k/

Many of the CBD and cannabis drinks on the market use proprietary formulations based on these. There are also certain steps in the process, such as sonication or mild heating, that improves the distribution of the terpenes.

eb3o8	Be cautious when you read that something is totally insoluble. There is just about always some kind of solubility limit, or at least the ability for small particle of a substance to remain suspended in aqueous solution.  The bulk of terpenes used in food and fragrances are monoterpenes, which are much more soluble than their olgiomeric cousins that are more resinous. I found one paper that showed solubility as low as 155 ppm and as high as 6990 ppm. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00982309	1642703257.0	hthobm1	t3_s87r0u	t3_s87r0u	/r/askscience/comments/s87r0u/how_do_drinks_that_contain_terpenes_solve_them_in/hthobm1/

4gpe3ud6	There are so many other variables involved in atmospheric density and pressure, let alone flight, that a general answer is impossible. There are a lot of interrelated factors like the amount of atmosphere, gravity, composition, temperature, etc. The relationships are not even absolute--for example lower gravity does not necessarily imply a lower pressure or density. Atmospheres depend on a lot more than gravity and magnetic fields, and we have a lot more to learn. For fictional or hypothetical purposes there are a lot of possibilities. Even the limited sample size of our solar system has different examples to consider.  For level, constant-air-speed flight, the sum of the lift, weight, drag, and thrust vectors must be zero. In the simplest scenario of level flight, lift cancels weight and thrust cancels drag. Weight is linearly proportional to gravity, and lift and drag (at a given velocity) are linearly proportional to air density. Thrust comes from the aircraft engine.  [https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg)  It is indeed possible for flight to be much easier in a low gravity environment. The air pressure at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan (with surface gravity less than 1/7 of Earth's) is \~1.5 atmospheres. Titan's atmosphere is about 20 percent more massive than Earth's, despite having only 40 percent of the radius and 16 percent of its surface area. The surface air is four to five times denser than Earth's because it it is so cold (around -180 C). Generally it is easier to fly on Titan because of the low gravity (lower weight) and denser air (higher lift). (But the higher drag means more thrust is needed.) NASA will be sending a rotorcraft drone to fly around Titan, one much bigger than the Ingenuity demonstrator sent to Mars. Supposedly--all other difficulties like cold unbreathable air aside--a person could even strap on wings and fly on Titan. The cold temperatures cause other problems, though. For example, due to the cold temperature the speed of sound on Titan is \~190 m/s, much lower than the speed of sound on Earth (\~340 m/s at room temperature, \~300 m/s in the cold stratosphere). As an aircraft, or parts of it (i.e. propeller or rotor blades), approaches the speed of sound the aerodynamics become more complicated and difficult to deal with (sound barrier).  Take Venus as another example. At its surface, the air pressure is over 90 atmospheres. The density is over 50 times that of Earth air at sea level (and 1/15 that of liquid water). It is less than 90 because gas density decreases with temperature. The gravity is slightly lower than Earth. Practically speaking, though, flight near the surface of Venus would be much harder than for Earth. The high temperature weakens, in some cases even melts, most materials, especially common electronics. The high pressure necessitates heavier construction more like a submarine than an aircraft. And furthermore, the "air" at the surface of Venus is not even really a gas. Because of the temperature and pressure the CO2 is a [supercritical fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid) with properties of both liquids and gases. At high altitudes, the density and temperature drop, becoming almost Earthlike (though not both temperature and density/pressure at the same altitude, and there is the little matter of sulfuric acid clouds). Flight there would be more or less as difficult as on Earth--though so far the only aircraft on Venus were a couple Soviet balloons.  Another factor is that most powered flight on Earth uses combustion engines, which only work in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. You need to rely on electric power from batteries (for prolonged flight charged by solar or nuclear) to power a propeller or rotor, which (with today's technology at least) increases weight. Or you could bring your own oxidizer and use a rocket, but that would be even less efficient.  Flight is indeed much more difficult on Mars because of the low air density (\~1.6 percent that at Earth's surface), despite the low gravity (38 percent of Earth's surface). The thin air also can't carry heat away as rapidly, so overheating of motors is a major concern. Again, the cold decreases the speed of sound, decreasing the maximum speed the rotors can be allowed to rotate.  Note, though, that Titan is much less massive than Mars, and both Mars and Venus lack an internally generated magnetic field. There is a lot more to having and retaining a significant atmosphere than surface gravity and magnetic fields.

fhodm	When root canal treatment is necessary, the nerve is often not fully dead, and is sending the pain signals giving you a severe toothache.  But a properly done root canal is painless because of anaesthesia. If pain is experienced that means the anaesthetic was not adequate. This can be because of unusual anatomy that some people have, or genetic resistance to anaesthetic. Anaesthetic resistance is well known to be associated is red hair. A good dentist will use alternative injection sites or sometimes a different anaesthetic to overcome this. (There's one anaesthetic, I don't remember the name, that dentists usually don't use because it takes many hours to wear off, but they can order it in specially if it's needed for an anaesthetic-resistant patient.)  There may be rare exceptions, but that is by far the normal situation.  The other reason people think root canal treatments are painful is they are remembering the pain of the toothache that the root canal was performed to treat.	1642707324.0	hthzc68	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthzc68/

14iaj1	This doesn't hold true for all solids either. Eg steel vs lead.  Hence, the above comment you are replying to holds correct and is an overall excellent reply. But this misconception comes from imprecise education.  Sound speed scaling with density is broadly true when looking at a very "zoomed" out pictures of materials (eg comparing air, to water, to steel). But this is because the atomic/molecular features that make a material less compressible also tend to make it denser (with exceptions). And they tend to drop compressibility much faster (by order of magnitude) than they increase density. As the above comment says.  Teaching the true definition c = sqrt (dP/dRho)|s, however is extremely educationally expensive because it requires the student to have an education grounded in thermodynamics, with the ability to plot and work with an isentrope/hugoniot or equation of state (even if its just ideal gas law).  So it is much easier to simply teach the short-hand version of: denser materials have higher sound speeds. This is good enough for most people.	1642707793.0	hti0mbk	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth3mti	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hti0mbk/

14qlcjyd	Yes, but salvia works on different receptors, actually opioid receptors (different ones than the ones affected by opioid pain drugs). But regular psychedelics can also cause dysphoria. These drugs have wide-ranging, complex effects that can cause tons of effects depending on the dose, mindset, setting of when and where it was taken, etc. A “bad trip” can create a state of dysphoria and can occur from using shrooms, lsd, salvia, and other psychedelics.	1642708326.0	hti235f	t3_s7rzkk	t1_hthwb9l	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/hti235f/

That formula doesn't check out. Look at the units of measurement:       Pa*m^3 = particles * J/(mole*K) * K      N*m = particles * J/mole      J = J * (particles/mole)      J = J * (Avogadro number???)      ???

Similar to how CosmoSounder explains that matter is created with a net-zero charge, we also expect there to be a net-zero matter/antimatter balance. As CosmoSounder mentioned, the process that creates an electron also creates a positron. A positron is an antimatter particle with positive charge. It's creation maintains the balance of both net-zero charge and net-zero matter/anti-matter.  For some reason, the universe has net-zero charge overall but is almost entirely made up of matter with negligible amounts of anti-matter.

h4kepu69	Using other mechanisms than thermal radiation is the point of energy saving light sources such as discharge/luminescent light bulbs and LEDs. Here electrons are excited to a higher energy band in some way and emit a photon as they change back to the lower band.  In general, photons are just the wave-particles of the electromagnetic field so wherever there's an electromagnetic wave, it consists of photons. So every radio antenna emits photons.	1642712615.0	hticii7	t3_s7jken	t3_s7jken	/r/askscience/comments/s7jken/is_every_photon_created_by_black_body_radiation/hticii7/
88jxl	Ok, so, Tm will be at some initiation of your melting curve. You won't see any melting below the actual melting point (unless you're getting some unexpected reaction creating a lower melting point mixture). If you take it as the peak of your endotherm you're going to be greatly conflating it with your heating rate. Just imagine an infinitely slow ramp rate's curve versus an infinitely fast...the first will be a delta function while the second will stretch out forever.  For nicely behaved materials you can probably do something like looking for some level of deviation from your baseline. Honestly it's been almost a decade since I've done DSC, otherwise I'd pull up the software and tell you how the instrument software did it.  Thinking about back when I last did a procurement, I remember one of the big DSC companies actually made their software free.

9h2hic0v	Crystal or amorphous polymers work pretty differently. We usually do a 1st and 2nd beat on same sample as thst will review the initial state of what was locked in during processing on the 1st heat and more underlying base material behavior on 2nd heat. The rest of your analysis to OP is pretru good, there are so many ways to look at Tg, Tm etc. Thst to OP i would say often times onset is most critical as in where the slope first changes a certain %, midpoint Tm or Tg is often the inflection point of the transition. Of course these are all induced by a purely thermal process in a DSC, if you have a DMA and the material is suitable you can also measure a mechanical induced Tg with the tan delta and decide which one is more accurate for the application.	1642713190.0	htie3r2	t3_s84eo5	t1_htfhfma	/r/askscience/comments/s84eo5/is_dsc_analysis_of_melting_solids_any_different/htie3r2/

15ss4k	Coloration is a trait that can have multiple functions. From an evolutionary perspective, traits that are beneficial tend to stick around. Since humans don't have skin coloration that would be used as camouflage, it's likely that our ancestors either A) never produced the mutation to allow that trait to occur, or B) that trait never was beneficial enough to stick around in the population.  However, while we may not have camouflage, we do have skin pigment, which is beneficial from a non-predatory survival standpoint. We don't use our skin to "blend in" like a polar bear, but our skin pigments are useful in blocking out UV radiation from the sun. It's not surprising that humans residing closer to the equator, where the sun's rays hit more directly, evolved darker skin than populations residing further away from the equator.   In short, humans did in fact evolve a form of coloration!

15ss4k	To my knowledge, there's no benefit to having different hair textures from a survival standpoint. My understanding is that hair textures are likely "linked traits," which are traits with a high probability of being passed on together. For example, if you have the red hair trait, it's super likely you also have the trait for freckles. These two traits are controlled by different genes, but since they're linked, you have a high probability of having both.  I think it's likely that hair texture is linked to other beneficial genes like skin color or eye color, and when those skin/eye traits got passed down, the hair texture traits were just along for the ride.	1642715850.0	htili1a	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htezf1g	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htili1a/

Many of our airplanes can operate easily at this altitude. Gas turbine powered airplanes (jet and turboprop) cruise most efficiently at altitudes above this.  On your theoretical planet, our current technology -- piston engine or turbine engine -- would be able to propel an airplane with no problem. Further, an airplane that looks much like it does here on earth should work fine. That's not to say an earth airplane would be a good solution. A lot of tweaks to the design would be made to fit the environment. But, I can't see that any major breakthroughs in technology would be necessary.  One more note, if the aircraft were being piloted by earth people, then a pressurized cabin would probably be mandatory (assuming all other things being equal, 20% oxygen, etc).	1642716809.0	htio20f	t3_s83qe8	t3_s83qe8	/r/askscience/comments/s83qe8/how_is_our_atmospheric_pressure_connected_to_the/htio20f/

4imu6	A slight well actually: it's not really correct to say these antibody tests give concentrations. They are at best "quasi-quantitative". That is, they can report a titer value, which is a relative rather than absolute measure of concentration. Your natural immune response is a polyclonal melange of antibodies with differing affinities to a given antigen. Two antibody clones at the same concentration may both bind an antigen but will result in different assay readouts. Because of this, it's not possible to ascribe a concentration to a given readout. That said, titer values still measure the relative intensity of an immune response and still have clincal relevance.

There are a number of processes, including using pressurized carbon dioxide, water, or organic solvent like ethyl acetate/dichloromethane.

Look at going at 40 K/min, 20 K/min, 10 K/min, 5 K/min in a single long run on a single sample. If you see the onset shifting, you'll know there's some kinetic component.

9h2hic0v	A DMA measures the storage and loss modulus simultaneously while applying a set amount of strain rapidly back and forth in the sample of a known shape, usually a rectangular prism.  It does this through a temperature sweep and you'll get a large tan delta peak as the transition occurs from glassy state through the plateau.  This is commonly regarded as the Tg in this analysis but again the onset is of upmost importance as you now have a temperature at which you know the ratio of your moduli are going to begin transitioning. This could be important for building things and engineering specs compared to just the DSC measured value.	1642726317.0	htj99ad	t3_s84eo5	t1_htj3n1a	/r/askscience/comments/s84eo5/is_dsc_analysis_of_melting_solids_any_different/htj99ad/
nt7w2	Here is what an NIH paper concluded:  "The current literature does not support the notion that dietary cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease in a healthy individuals. However, there is an ample evidence that saturated fatty acids and trans-fats increase cardiovascular disease risk. The fact that dietary cholesterol is common in foods that are high in saturated fatty acids might have contributed to the hypothesis that dietary cholesterol is atherogenic"  source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024687/  So the science is tricky since saturated fat and cholesterol usually occur together and the studies are not conclusive.   For me personally, I choose to remain on the safer side by going with a diet low in both saturated fat and cholesterol. Excluding the "French paradox" most heart-healthy diets around the world tend to be heavily plant based.	1642726318.0	htj99c1	t3_s8gy96	t3_s8gy96	/r/askscience/comments/s8gy96/does_dietary_cholesterol_raise_serum_serum/htj99c1/

mzc4g	The locus (genetic address) of a gene is predictable from person to person. If we look at a specific chromosome at a specific locus, we should find a specific gene. If not, that is called a translocation and that could be really bad.   As for inherited chromosomes, they will have the same genes at the same loci. There are some ways to determine which genes came from the mother vs. the father the gene amplification techniques. Obviously the Y chromosome comes from the father, so that’s easy and mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother.	1642727532.0	htjc29w	t3_s8d461	t3_s8d461	/r/askscience/comments/s8d461/are_genes_arranged_basically_the_same_in_most/htjc29w/
82t1bcky	When I worked in the hospital, probably a decade ago, I jumped in on six different codes. As I was not licensed to do injections (atropine and lidocaine), I was typically the one doing compressions.   What they don’t teach you in CPR certification courses is that the ribs will break. It’s not a question of if, it’s a matter of how many are left after the first minute. That will definitely hamper recovery if they survive, due to the struggle to breathe or do any kind of straining. CPR in the hospital often means intubation, as well, so you end up with a really sore throat…if you survive.   Out of those six, all died. Granted, these were more critical patients so it wasn’t all that surprising. Those who do survive should be able to recover fully if they put the effort in. Ribs heal, sore throat goes away, but it’s up to the individual to take the steps to fix their health.	1642727616.0	htjc95x	t3_s87303	t3_s87303	/r/askscience/comments/s87303/what_percentage_of_patients_who_survive_due_to/htjc95x/

4dtr16bt	It depends on the NTP service, carrier, etc. I do cyber forensics and it is one of the most frustrating things. There is also a thing called sway, which describes the offset from your phone or computer (endpoint) and the NTP server. Some will allow a sway as much as 5 minutes before issuing a reset to NTP time. Some also only reset that time at certain times (like at reboot) so they don’t set a time during event logging. Imagine a process that logs a start time of 5:03 PM and finishes at 4:49 PM because the NTP protocol reset the clock.	1642731473.0	htjl4zm	t3_s7ev0q	t1_htbfa2n	/r/askscience/comments/s7ev0q/how_accurate_are_the_clocks_on_our_phones/htjl4zm/

dzwe44qg	I teach this and the analogy I use is passing buckets of water to put out a fire. If you have more people densely packed then it takes longer to pass the bucket a given distance because your passing the bucket between more people. The atoms move and send a force to neighboring atoms. The more densely packed the atoms the more atoms have to respond to the movement of their neighbors. Only analogy that ever made sense to me, so I hope it helps.	1642732628.0	htjnt1h	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htjnt1h/

11obfu	For Japan in particular, you google "etymology of Japan", and you get this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Japan  in summary, basically the Kanji Nippon is read as Re Ben, which sounds like Jepang to Malay and Indonesian, and the European first heard about this country from them, and so it ended up with Japan in English.

clz9x6pv	Sleep is regulated by a whole lot of different things. Light is one of the bigger things. When we perceive light this signal is interpreted by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus of the brain. Light stimulation causes the suprachiasmatic nucleus to inhibit the pineal gland from producing melanin. Less melanin = harder to fall asleep. But to answer your question, blue light stimulates the nucleus much stronger than the light coming in through your window. Harvard did a study on this.	1642737188.0	htjy2tm	t3_s8bnij	t3_s8bnij	/r/askscience/comments/s8bnij/why_does_blue_light_mess_up_your_sleep/htjy2tm/
16wrcx	False according to who? Steven Pinker? Sure. Noam Chomsky? Definitely. Here's the issue:  Both Pinker and Chomsky don't have a shred of empirical evidence to back up their nativist claims on language; but nativism (the view that you obviously agree with) doesn't have much of a leg to stand on, and we've known this in Behavioral science for decades.  Your example, along with the idea of maternal imprinting behaviors in birds (popularized by Konrad Lorenz), has only demonstrative evidence, and no known mechanism. Gilbert Gottlieb, however, did have many empirical articles that back a non-nativist approach to development he called Developmental dynamics, which I describe in my previous post: [sauce](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dev.20269)  Pro tip: if you call someone's perspective false, at least cite your sources so that your readers can make up their own mind as to the validity of your claim.	1642737291.0	htjyaub	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htjhp1x	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htjyaub/

68e5u1yf	No. There are different types of arterial blockages but I'll talk about 3 common ones: coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease.  For coronary artery disease, this is when there is atherosclerotic blockage in your coronary arteries, or the arteries that directly supply your heart muscle. Your heart is a very active muscle/pump and therefore needs a constant blood supply. Without adequate blood, the muscle starts to die = myocardial infarction = heart attack. This happens when your arteries are very clogged. To diagnose it, we do coronary catheterization, which can also be therapeutic. In milder cases, deploying a stent will relieve the obstruction. In more severe cases (there are defined criteria), the patient will require a CABG to bypass the obstruction. Since coronary catheterizations are invasive, we generally don't do it for asymptomatic people. Now, there is newer technology using CT scans to image the coronaries but to my knowledge, that is also not used on a large scale to diagnose asymptomatic people.   For carotid artery disease, we typically don't catch those until they become symptomatic, at which point the obstruction is causing problems. In other words, we don't screen for this. Once it's symptomatic, treatment depends on the degree of obstruction and patient-specific risk factors but can include endarterectomy.   For peripheral arterial disease, this is one that gets diagnosed when patients develop claudication symptoms in the lower extremities. Usually an ABI is done at that point where the systolic BP is measured at the ankle and at the arm and the ratio between the two is determined. That is diagnostic of PAD. We don't routinely do this for asymptomatic people because it would likely be normal until the obstruction is pretty advanced.	1642737712.0	htjz759	t3_s88jeh	t3_s88jeh	/r/askscience/comments/s88jeh/do_arterial_blockages_get_diagnosed_regularly/htjz759/
68e5u1yf	We don't do exercise stress testing or CT scans on asymptomatic people to prevent MI.

d468q	For your specific examples: Germany was a "region" of many small kingdoms, duchies, counties, principalities, etc. long before it became a single country in the 1860s. The word "Germany" was based on what the Romans called part of the area *(Germania)*. Germany has different names in different languages, partly because different outside groups ended up referring to it using the names of different former constituent places or tribes, e.g. *Allemagne* in French after the Germanic tribe known as the *Alemanni*. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names\_of\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Germany).   This is an example of a country getting its name from specific real or historical places or groups within them. The informal English name "Holland" is also kind of an example of this. Another example is how English and many other languages use the name "China" (based on an ancient dynasty that controlled much of the modern country) while Russian uses the name *Kitai* ("Cathay") (based on a different not-as-ancient group that also controlled much of the modern country).  "Austria" comes from an attempt to render *Oesterreich* into Latin. Lots of country names come from this kind of process, trying to make the name easier to pronounce in the destination language -- think *Espana >>* "Spain".  "Japan" seems to come from a combination of Portuguese explorers hearing Malay traders call it *Japun* and Venetian explorers hearing Chinese people calling it *Chipangu*. It seems that these were how the kanji characters, which are read as *Nippon* in Japanese, were vocalized in some Chinese dialect. Same characters, different pronunciation.  A somewhat related example to this might be how we pronounce "Mexico" based on how the letter "x" is pronounced in English, even though the "x" represents a different sound in modern Spanish, and the whole thing is an approximation of the original Nahuatl name which sounds like *MeSHIH'ko*	1642738073.0	htjzz0i	t3_s8rbw0	t3_s8rbw0	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htjzz0i/
b42gnjuj	I'll add some more info for clarification.  *Channels* are based on number of satellites, this determines the accuracy of your geolocation information. You actually need 4 satellites to get an accurate GPS location, not 3. Most commercial receivers like your cell phone have 12+ channels nowadays, military receivers almost always have at least 24.  *Signals* are just the frequency that the information is sent at. Dozens of satellites broadcast over the same signals. Currently only the military can use L2 and L5 signals, though they are in the pre-operational stages of adding L2 support to the commercial sector.  One thing about having a receiver that can read multiple *signals* is that you can compare the two frequencies and correct for ionosphere distortion, which is the largest source of error for modern receivers. Once they go live with the commercial L2 signal in the next couple years, you'll be impressed at how much your phone's accuracy improved.	1642738380.0	htk0m9u	t3_s8qpe8	t3_s8qpe8	/r/askscience/comments/s8qpe8/why_are_there_only_two_signals_used_in_gps/htk0m9u/

441dt1hr	Would it be more correct to say that sound speed is dependent on temperature rather than density in this case of warm air vs cold air?  For example if I had two boxes at same T, one with air at 2atm and one at 1 atm, wouldn't sound speed be equal even though their densities are different?

ytxkpj6	Assuming we don’t have to worry about the mass of the parachute itself, there is no reason it shouldn’t work. You just need to pick values that make terminal velocity survivable.   The formula is Vt = sqrt(2mg/(rho•A•Cd))   Weight on Mars is about a third, density on Mars is about a hundredth. You end up with something like Vt =sqrt(2•23/A). So to get back to the equivalent of an Earth parachute you have to have ~23 times the parachute area than you would on Earth.   A parachute for a 200 lb mass on Earth has about 200 sq ft of cross sectional area. The equivalent Martian parachute needs to have 4500 sq ft, which is an 80 foot diameter. That’s for a person. For something like a 2000 pound rover? You’re looking at a parachute the size of a Walmart.	1642739746.0	htk3gb0	t3_s8oqq7	t1_htjti09	/r/askscience/comments/s8oqq7/would_terminal_velocity_on_mars_be_the_same_as_on/htk3gb0/
7cj1qe	You're really extrapolating here. You said "no behaviors, be it human or animal (or plant for that matter) are hard-wired into our biological systems" My claim is that you are wrong, there exist behaviors that are biologically hard-wired. I never generalized to nativism. As the original post did not include a source, I didn't think it was necessary to include. If you Google "fixed action patterns", you will also find that inate behaviors, reflex actions, and kinesis are also hard-wired behaviors.  You are debating philosophy. I am citing biology.  The currently hotly debated theory, as you have clearly expressed an example of, is that behavior is effected by multiple mechanisms.  None of that answered the op about monogamy, which still could come from either mechanism(behavior, biology), both, or something completely different.	1642739902.0	htk3ro7	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htjyaub	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htk3ro7/

12c9th	Great answer, just to add on: This is why in 50% of people the presenting symptom of coronary artery disease is sudden death.

b42gnjuj	Yes you are right. Two signals almost entirely corrects for it, three signals would correct even better. Check out [this link](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog862/node/1715) for more details.   The reason they don't is that dual signal correction already provides accuracy down to tens of centimeters. Most GPS applications don't require sub-millimeter accuracy. And to utilize three signals, you would need bigger hardware, more complex electronics and much more power.

For example in the artic there is what's called hard ice that has been there for many years and survived many thaws, this ice is extremely hard, won't shift or break away. While the ice that is formed that year has a tendency to move a lot with the current of water underneath.

8drz0	There are no "true" ideal gases because while it wasn't mentioned, ideal gases are point particles aka the atom/molecule has no volume which obviously doesn't describe any real gas.  Being in the molecular flow regime (where the mean free path is greater than the volume of the container you're considering) is also not really important for ideal gases. Really, really high pressures can make it break down, but a few atmospheres   More importantly, in realistic situations ideal gases get you a notably wrong quantitative answer, but it's pretty likely to be qualitatively dead on. For example, sound is really different gas molecules translating in phase with other nearby gas molecules. Considering a more exact equation of state for the gas molecule doesn't change that, so you're still going to come to the same conclusion.	1642743197.0	htka1vc	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth80fg	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htka1vc/

16qgmh0f	This is incorrect. The panelist, and the sourced paper they conveniently included in their reply to OP, are correct. Yes, the speed of gravity = the speed of light, but it is also true that rotating objects are gravitationally pulled toward the "current" location of the other, not the time-delayed location.   As RobusEtCeleritas mentions, it is a nontrivial problem, and doesn't have an intuitive answer (unless you are familiar with enough of the right sort of physics, then it is expected - electromagnetic fields have the same behavior, which is also mentioned in the linked paper).	1642747426.0	htkh6ya	t3_s8yph3	t1_htkf6dx	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htkh6ya/
5qad2	As you say, *Austria* is a Latinization of Old High German *Ostarrichi*, but that itself is likely a translation of Latin *Marchia orientalis*!  In regards to Germany being a region of many small principalities (the *Kleinstaaterei*), there was no real question from the emergence of the Ottonians-on that "Germany" was a "thing". There has been no point in recent history where some state or organization representing "Germany" has not existed - the Kingdom of the East Franks (colloquially *Germany*) within the Empire, Napoleon's Rhine Confederation, the German Confederation (briefly the *German Empire*, the North German Confederation, and finally the German Empire.  Most of the foreign names are *older* than the ethnogenesis of Germany in the Early Middle Ages. So, I would say that the *Kleinstaaterei* doesn't have much impact in this case - when most foreign names were adopted was well before that situation, back when *Germania* was still largely tribal.	1642748648.0	htkj0v3	t3_s8rbw0	t1_htjzz0i	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htkj0v3/

If immediately, does this not violate the principle that information cannot transfer faster than the speed of light?	1642750907.0	htkm8b8	t3_s8yph3	t1_htk6xo9	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htkm8b8/
orj14	We also never had the same scientific abilities. The current number of active researches and scientists (in general) is assumed to be bigger than the \*overall total of scientists ever\*. Again, not sure what the source for that information, but considering how high level education and production have entwined in the last century, it sure at least hits close to reality.  The spanish flue wasn’t that different from Covid-19, but we had in no way the understanding or the technological abilities to achieve such a deep inside into the illness, or it’s progress through human society, to the point that nobody can prove how it somehow stopped after a few years (most of the “develops into less aggressive strain” theories are just that, theories; we have a good idea why it might happen, but no data to really underly that).  So from a perspective of history theory of science, this is all very interesting; how to we build an understanding of the world compared to before, and how does it influence society, good and bad?  Because what has enabled us to this deeper insight is, at the same time, what partly made Covid harder on the world; due to the much higher mobility and world-wide entanglement, things spread faster and deeper - which is true both for information and contagious diseases.	1642752368.0	htko85k	t3_s7ny5j	t1_htgiekr	/r/askscience/comments/s7ny5j/are_there_any_studies_suggesting_whether/htko85k/

qbughz6	There is energy input and exchange.  Think of the two mediums as different objects.  The more dense one is also more massive (for the same volume), and that's the key.  The heavier mass sinks, spending it's gravitational energy (lets say 100 J).  The less massive (less dense) matter rises.  Sure, it gains gravitational energy (90 J), but it doesn't gain as much as the heavy mass loses.	1642754010.0	htkqfjb	t3_s90t6g	t3_s90t6g	/r/askscience/comments/s90t6g/how_do_less_dense_material_rise_in_a_denser/htkqfjb/

34d5o	It does, but counter-intuitively. If you liken a solid to a stiff spring, and air to a softer spring it's maybe good enough for the population at large. At least in that way, their intuition will not harden around density of the medium, which works in the opposite direction.	1642754993.0	htkrpo0	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htkqvil	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htkrpo0/
14iaj1	This is true. However you have to remember that at the K12 level liquids and solids are generally presented as incompressible.  So your analogy works for air vs water, or air vs steel, but if you use it to compare water vs steel you essentially need to teach compressibility in general.  I personally don't think it is a stretch, but curricula are really strained these days.	1642755170.0	htkry2r	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htkrpo0	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htkry2r/

14qy8i	1. The nerve might not yet be fully dead. If there's bacteria or more precisely their toxins in the tooth substance near the dental pulp or already in the pulp itself, the pulp tissue reacts with an inflammation. Due to the fact that the pulp is entirely encased by dentine which is very hard, the edema that follows basically stranglulates the nerve, leading to excruciating pain. It is often strongest upon outside stimuluses like warm or cold drinks.  This is called an irreversible pulpitis   2. The nerve is dead and bacteria have migrated all the way down to the root tip. The pulp isn't perfused anymore, thus immune cells can't fight the infection in the tooth. However, they can do so in the bone right outside the root tip and oh boy they do, rendering the periapical bone into the Somme of 1916. The immune response locally dissolves the bone and the infiltrate, granuloma or abscess that develop are especially painful upon biting down on the tooth. There might also be swelling under the gumline and general discomfort.  This is called periapical periodontitis, granuloma or abscess.	1642758967.0	htkwr01	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkwr01/

dr4vx	There's been a fair bit of back and forth about a lot of these points, but this https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12128 seems to sum up the current consensus. In short: there was some loss of diversity in certain groups in the very late Cretaceous that may have made the ecosystem more fragile, but no long-term decline, and no particular reason to think dinosaurs couldn't have recovered diversity as they had before; any large group will regularly experience disruptions and recoveries like this. And while the Deccan traps couldn't have been particularly healthy, the timing and pace of the extinction still seems best explained by the impact.	1642761258.0	htkzk5t	t3_s8cd4m	t1_htjtx2c	/r/askscience/comments/s8cd4m/after_the_kt_extinction_how_did_the_survivors/htkzk5t/

abuva	Sperm cells do divide, but they have a different method of division that occurs in 2 rounds, so you end up with 4 cells instead of 2. The cells themselves come from stem cells. Another factor is that Eggs/Sperm have to have half the number of chromosomes in order to get the correct number when combining, so they don't have a back up set of genes, so DNA errors are likely more lethal.	1642763643.0	htl2njn	t3_s43r3g	t1_hsp77lk	/r/askscience/comments/s43r3g/if_dna_decays_over_time_like_how_older_people_get/htl2njn/

q81tq	That theory is General Relativity.  The gravitational field is not just dependent on where the object is, but it's also dependent on its velocity and (to some extent) its acceleration. For orbiting objects (but not always) the net result looks very close to the scenario of instantaneous propagation. The small difference to that scenario is linked to the emission of gravitational waves.	1642764471.0	htl3s34	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl2e7a	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htl3s34/

15rzik	Let's take the Germanic people and the names they gave to the various countries as an example.  In the Proto-Germanic language, the word "theudo" meant "the people", and came to mean the German people (as we would think of them today).  Within the Germanic group, there were many tribes, each with thier own names for themselves, in different regions.  In the core of Germany, as proto-Germanic evolved into modern German, the pronunciation of that word evolved into "Deutsch", meaning "German", and hence "Deutschland" for the country.  Some of the germanic people ended up in low-lying land bordering the North Sea.  They still called themselves by the same name, but as their language evolved, that word ended up being "Dutch". They called the place they live "the low land", which in their language is "Nederland". In modern German that is "Niederland", and in English "Netherlands" (nether meaning low, as in ones "nether regions").  One of the tribes living to the north lived in a borderland country, and the word for that kind of country is "Mark" or "March" (the borderlands between England and Wales are sometimes called the "Welsh Marches").  That group called themselves "Danes", so their country is "Danemark", or in English, Denmark.  Another group of people left mainland Europe and settled on an offshore island. While several germanic tribes migrated, the dominant tribe were the "Angles", and they called their new country, "Angleland", or England.  The French people, just across the channel, also called this place the land of the Angles, but in French, so it became "Angleterre".  One group of Germanic people, who settled in the Black Forrest and upper Rhine were the Allemani.  The French speakers nearby used their name for all German people, so the name of the country to them was "Allemagne". Likewise, on the Baltic Coast, the Germanic people living there were the Saxons, so the Finns and Estonians used that name for all of Germany.  In the Southeast, some Germanic people lived in an eastern border region, which they called the Eastern March (there's that march word again), but when it became established as a country became the "Eastern Realm", which in German is Österreich.  In the Alps further west, a bunch of cities and their surrounding countryside decided they didn't like paying taxes to their duke, so formed a confederation to kick him out.  This confederation was formed near the city of Schwyz, and the people who belonged to this confederation came to be called "the Swiss".  An older English name for someone from Schwyz was a "Switzer", so their land is Switzerland.  As the confederation grew, it came to encompass other alpine groups, who spoke French, Italian and Romansch.  In each language they referred to themselves also as "the Swiss", so we have "Die Schweiz", "la Suisse", "La Svizzera" and "La Svizra".  Not wanting the trouble of having four names for the country, the Swiss decided the sensible solution was to pick a neutral language for the official name, and turned to Latin.  When the Romans went into the Alps, some people called the Helvetii lived there, so the Swiss decided to name their confederation the "Confederatio Helvetica".  This use of Latin is a common source of names.  Because Latin was important in Europe for so long, many countries used a Latin name for their country, and other countries also used that Latin name.  In cases where the Romans actually went there, the Romans had a name for the place, generally based on the people who lived there.  The greeks encountered some weird people wearing face paint on a damp island, who called themselves, Pretani, and the Romans called their island Britania.  Some people living north of France were the Belgae, while people living east of the Rhine and north of the Alps when the Romans were around were the Germani.  Not all places had been visited by the Romans, though, so they had to come up with a latin form of their name, in order to work with the European system of doing things in the Middle Ages.  One such place was Österreich.  There seems to be some confusion about how exactly these people arrived at "Austria" as a suitable name, but they did, and it stuck.  When a name enters another language, it generally gets adapted to the spelling, grammar and pronunciation standards of that language, so minor variations, like "Belgium", "Belgien", "Belgique" etc or more major ones like "Tyskland" from "Deutschland" happen.  Where names have very specific and clear meanings, the whole name can get translated.  The name "United Kingdom", for example, becomes "Royaume-Uni" in French and "Vereinegtes Königreich" in German, as literal translations.  In the case of further away countries, several methods can produce different names.  One process is that people hear about a far off country from some group of people in between, and adopt their name for it, which may different from the domestic name for the sorts of reasons above.  Another is that the people arrive and just make up a name (Australia, for example, comes from Terra Australis, or southern land).  Then there is the comical misunderstanding.  The Iroquois word "Kanada" means village or settlement.  When Europeans arrived in the St Lawrence area and asked locals, "what do you call this place", they assumed that word was the whole country, hence "Canada" (no, it wasn't named by drawing letters from a hat and announcing them as, "first letter is a C, eh.  Next is an N, eh, now a D, eh").	1642765386.0	htl530e	t3_s8rbw0	t3_s8rbw0	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htl530e/

As for the synthesis: i can only speak from a molbio view, but in order to label cellular compounds, you basically starve the Celle and then grow them in/on a medium with only C13 atoms.   I can only guess, but i suppose you use labelled precursor molecules to synthesize labelled compounds.

I don't know how to write those phonectic markings (or read them very well), but I'll try in another way.  The 'au' in "sauna" is pronounced like 'ow' (like what you say when you get hurt). 'A' is basically 'aah' and 'U' is 'ooh'. Since there is only one of each letter, they are pronounced shorter than that, tho. The whole word would be something like 's-ow-nah'. There's probably a youtube video with the proper pronounciation somewhere.

Then you can work up to the molecule you want. It also depends whether you want a molecule with all carbons as the isotope or just a specific one labelled.   There are a few other simple  molecules with just one carbon atom that you could use as a basis for synthesis but when you have more than one carbon you get molecules with multiple different combinations of C-12 and C-13 which would make separation more difficult.  A  post-synthesis separation approach for a molecule with multiple atoms would be  nightmare.	1642770710.0	htldwno	t3_s93g0c	t3_s93g0c	/r/askscience/comments/s93g0c/how_does_one_create_a_mass_labelled_standard/htldwno/

4fzvw	Redshift is a uniform effect. Every single photon gets redshifted by the same amount. The shape of the spectrum - how much light there is at each wavelength - is the same, just uniformly shifted.  If a star was a perfect blackbody, then the difference between a blue star and a red star would look the same - the smooth spectrum is just shifted towards the red or blue. However, stars are far from perfect blackbodies. In particular, they contain absorption and emission lines at very specific wavelengths.  When an atom or ion absorbs or emits a photon, it kicks an electron up or down between energy levels. The energy gained or lost by the electron is given to or absorbed from the photon. This means a particular atom or ion can only produce or absorb photons of certain specific energies that correspond to difference between electron energy levels. The energy of a photon tells you its wavelength.  So what you get is very sharp spikes or dips in a spectrum, corresponding to very specific transitions between electron energy levels for specific atoms or ions. If you can identify these "spectral lines", you know from lab experiments what the wavelength of these lines "should be", and you can figure out the shift in wavelength for these lines, and therefore the redshift of the object.  Now, this works great if you do have a spectrum of the object - but sometimes all you have is broad-band imagery, sort of like an RGB filter, rather than getting every wavelength separately. Then you really need  to do tricks like looking at populations of stars to really tell what's redshift and what is intrinsic colour. Even more important is dust "reddening" - dust will absorb blue light and emit red light, making stars look redder. So you need a good model of the dust along your line of sight to disentangle redshift too, if you don't have a spectrum.	1642775079.0	htln7vi	t3_s8l47a	t3_s8l47a	/r/askscience/comments/s8l47a/when_using_telescopes_to_map_out_the_universe/htln7vi/

71e52	 >Both can be difficult to anesthesise because the pH value in an inflamed tissue is acidic which keeps the anesthetic from entering the nerve. If it can't enter the nerve, it has little to no effect.  Isn't regional block type anesthesia "normal" for deep procedures / in presence of inflammation, for exactly this reason?  I.e. anesthetizing at some distance along the nerve leading to the painful tooth.  I remember having this and the more common infiltration type anesthesia for dental work, and while I found the application of the regional block somewhat more uncomfortable, I found it much more effective - pain is not only reduced but "switched off", and the mouth feels much less weird without a huge area that's superficially numbed like the infiltration results in.	1642775363.0	htlnvuf	t3_s8mble	t1_htkwr01	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htlnvuf/

1kaot5hy	In the addict community I see a general consensus of people including me, using cannabis as the drug of choice after a large experimental period. Is this because it has the least negative impacts and most medical use? I think cannabis helps with controlling other impulses from rooting you in the present.

1z28h	Have you done any research into how full CB2 agonists can attenuate the development of opiate tolerance, dependency, and lessen withdrawal symptoms?  I remember reading a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29192123/) done by Eli Lilly on a osteoarthritis drug they developed called LY2828360, which is a CB2 full agonist, and in mice (rats?) they found that the development of tolerance to morphine took significantly longer to develop.    But I didn't hear a lot about this discovery after that, until 2020 when I saw a similar [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32896549/) posted where they showed that it also attenuates physical dependence (amongst other things) as well.  If nothing else, I think these 2 studies need to be promoted publicly because of how groundbreaking this discovery can be. A lot of people fall into addiction because in the past they had to continually increase their dosage, either in higher quantity per dose, or higher quantity of doses per time period, making it more difficult to stop using it in the end.  Imagine you could start someone on a CB2 therapy, for a few days before opiate treatment starts, they could stay on the same opiate dose for years before having to change dosage, and then when they wanted to stop using it, the withdrawal symptoms were significantly diminished.  So to tie this into what you do, there are some compounds in Cannabis that are seemingly full CB2 agonists, like Cannabigerol (CBG), to which it could possibly become therapy that people use alongside opiates.	1642777350.0	htlsq24	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlsq24/

46u4gfyz	Hello! I have often heard among cannabis users the mantra that opiates, nicotine, and other drugs are “biologically addictive” while cannabis is “psychologically addictive.” The explanation I have been able to find for this is that many drugs can change the body such that it does harm to itself in the absence of that substance, whereas cannabis addiction (or other addictions like playing video games or gambling). Is there truth in this? If so, what are the physical and psychological mechanisms behind each type?

77c9s	Could a system exist where all drugs are legal and sold by the government, but the availability would depend on how harmful and how addictive they are? For exemple, you could buy cocaine at a dispensary, but the daily/weekly threshold is linked to your social security number, and you have to submit a request if you wish to increase occasionally this amount. Request could trigger an appointment to a psychiatrist to assess your addiction profile.  Some molecules require a simple statement form, others require a government authorization, and so on?	1642777865.0	htlu0sj	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlu0sj/

cmht5eup	To some extent it does help, but the most important thing is number of satellites. The process used by GPS receivers to calculate their position is trilateration (or more precisely multilateration) which takes a number of distances to known points (satellites) and uses those to solve for position. The process is slightly complicated in GPS as the true range to the satellites is unknown, only the pseudo ranges are known (differences in range between pairs of satellites).  The pseudo ranges are determined by measuring the differences between in a time signal  eoadcast by  one satellite and a second time signal broadcast by another. Yiu need a minimum of 4 satellites to give enough pseudo ranges that an unambiguous solution is obtained. More pseudo ranges give you capability to detect erroneous signals or average out noise (for example if you have 6 signals, that gives you 6 combinations of 4 satellites, so you can solve each group and get 6 position solutions, then average them - although better techniques are used in practice).  Multiple frequencies can help in some other ways. The different signals transmit the time code in different ways. The transmission on L2 is higher resolution (but it is more difficult to track and acquire - you generally need to use L1 to calculate your position and precise time to give you enough information to tune in the L2 signal). The L2 is encrypted, but survey grade receivers can still extract some useful information from the signal.  Hiwever, the main advantage of multiple frequencies is that the ionosphere distorts the speed of the radio waves. This results in distortion of the pseudo ranges measured by the receiver leading to position errors. Different frequencies give different distortions and by measuring the disagreement between multiple frequency measures of the same pseudo range, it is possible to get a good estimate of the total distortion and subtract it out.  There is a modernisation of the GPS signals underway, with a new high resolution civilian signal being deployed on L5. This is partially operational and some phones and commercial GPS receivers are able to use it. However, few satellites have it active, so it doesn't work very well at present.  The European Galileo system has L1 and L5 signals active on its satellites, but the satellite constellation is not complete so performance is not optimal although it does work and commercial dual frequency civilian recierves work fine with it giving noticeably better resolution.  In principle triple frequency could give better ionosphere correction but it's considered less important, as there are already ways of getting millimeter precision without it by comparing measurements between two receivers (one at a precisely known position and one mobile) which can be done in real time by connecting the two receivers together over a cellular data link	1642778419.0	htlvg1m	t3_s8qpe8	t3_s8qpe8	/r/askscience/comments/s8qpe8/why_are_there_only_two_signals_used_in_gps/htlvg1m/

6xj6pn0t	Stars are made up of gases. Gases are composed of atoms.  As light travels through a gas, electrons in the atoms "absorb" the energy of the light. Looking at the light with a spectrograph shows dark "absorption" lines called [Fraunhofer lines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines). Each gas has a different pattern of Fraunhofer lines. We know from shining light through gases in laboratories at what wavelengths Fraunhofer lines appear when gases are not moving toward or away from us.   When stars or galaxies are moving away from us the pattern of Fraunhofer lines for each gas is not at the wavelength we see in the laboratory, but [shifted toward the red end of the visible spectrum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)  When stars or galaxies are not moving away from us the pattern of Fraunhofer lines for each gas is at the wavelength we see in the laboratory. A red star not moving away from us just looks red, but its  Fraunhofer lines are not redshifted.	1642778653.0	htlw1rq	t3_s8l47a	t3_s8l47a	/r/askscience/comments/s8l47a/when_using_telescopes_to_map_out_the_universe/htlw1rq/

yue6s	To your knowledge, do any studies address the effect of *M. speciosa* or its primary alkaloids on the fronto-cerebellar and fronto-insular systems of the brain (as a decrease in gray matter volume is seen in chronic opioid users)?   Also, what do you perceive to be the general opinion of *M. speciosa* among your peers? Given the DEA's attempts to schedule the plant in the past decade and ongoing efforts via the FDA, WHO, and state legislatures, in addition to the not-insubstantial (and often extraordinarily successful) activist efforts to *prevent* its scheduling, I'd imagine you and your colleagues are aware of the plant. As a follow-up, do you find the general opinion among your peers to be grounded in the literature, or conversely borne of a healthy fear of opioid receptor agonists in the midst of this terrible opioid crisis?

whgrg	A rough analogy is that of the wake of a boat. It always points to where the boat *is*, not where it *was* when that part of the wave was emitted - assuming it hasn't changed course or speed since then.  General relativity also - somehow - allows for some acceleration and jerk (change of acceleration) to be "encoded" in the gravitational field, so objects are still attracted to where an object is (or should be) even if it is undergoing predictable acceleration.	1642784239.0	htmax57	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl2e7a	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htmax57/

3ms1b	To add to the other posters' great answers, I'd like to make a simplified analogy:   Think of all the different proteins in your body as tiny machines, each doing a different task. Like, if your body was a country, each cell would be a city, and each protein like an automobile or a soda fountain or lawn sprinkler or whatever.   When different small molecules bind different sites on proteins, they can alter its function, in ways that are dependent on (1) what the small molecule is, (2) what the protein's function is, and (3) where on the protein the small molecule binds. Some of these small molecules are naturally occuring in the cell and are "supposed" to interact with it, while others can be from outside (diet, drugs, etc) and can have effects that are different than what "normally" happens.  > So and how do different molecules lead to different expressions. Two molecules bind to the same receptors but they can still cause different effects?  Let's think if a hypothetical protein that is like an automobile in our city-analogy. If I take a handful of powerful glue (our "drug") and stick it onto one of the tires, it will make it so the car can't move. But if I take that glue and instead stick it onto the steering wheel, the car can move but it can't turn. Or, if I stick it inside the radiator the car can move and turn, but it will eventually overheat. Or if I use it to cover the car stereo speakers, the music won't work. etc.etc. The effects of our "drug" depends on the characteristics of the drug (in this case, powerful stickiness), and where exactly on our  protein "machine" the drug is bound.	1642784642.0	htmc0q2	t3_s77bg3	t1_htbh9cj	/r/askscience/comments/s77bg3/why_do_different_molecules_bind_to_different/htmc0q2/

The concentration of particular cannabinoids is obviously important, but it's rare to see researchers acknowledge and address that cannabis isn't a homogeneous product. Opioids don't really have the same issue as there is considerably less variance.   Also, is the mechanism of addiction to cannabis also related to activation in the ventral tegmental area of the PFC?

gekpw	Basically, the gravitational field that Object A produces depends on where it is, but also on how it's moving. So a time d/c later, when Object B sees the gravitational field of A as it was, the *direction* of the field is sort of "extrapolated" in the direction where A is moving. So by the time that B experiences that field, it's pointing in the direction of A now, and not in the direction where A was d/c time units ago, assuming A continues to move in the way that it was d/c ago.  Can you use it to send information FTL? No. Because that "extrapolation" to the future position of A depends on how it's moving at that moment d/c ago. If you were to suddenly change its trajectory in some way (where this can be defined rigorously in terms of which time-derivatives of the position are nonzero), the "extrapolation" to its future position would simply be wrong.	1642792812.0	htmy5pj	t3_s8yph3	t1_htmr6ym	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htmy5pj/
g9awn	>because apparently diphtongs are very hard to pronounce for many people, as is evident in how most foreign people pronounce 'sauna' as 'soona'  If by "many people" you mean "English speakers", then the basis for the English pronunciation is not a difficulty with diphthongs, since that diphthong exists in most varieties of English. Rather, *sauna* is pronounced with the COT vowel because of the spelling. In English, probably through the influence of French <au> usually represents a low back (monophthonic) vowel, such as in *authorize*.  For contrast, in German, where <au> represents the same diphthong as in Finnish, *Sauna* is pronounced with the original vowel. However, the <s> is rendered as /z/ for similar reasons.	1642792926.0	htmyh4z	t3_s8rbw0	t1_htkqwi1	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htmyh4z/

Also most cholesterol tests only roughly approximate the actually dangerous sized cholesterol molecules at less than 25 nanometers, called LDL type B's.

gekpw	[Previous thread about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fhnt7z/in_nuclear_reactors_why_is_it_that_light_water/).  Every material is a moderator, and every material except the fuel is an absorber. But some materials are much better at moderating or absorbing than others.  Light water is a good moderator, a good coolant, and a moderate absorber, all at the same time.  >Is the water defined as a coolant because it absorbs neutrons from fission, or simply because of its thermal properties?  It's a coolant because of its thermal properties; the neutronics of it are not relevant for that purpose.  >And if it can absorb neutrons, thereby slowing the chain-reaction of fission how can it also be a moderator in LWRs?  Because it does both of those things. It downscatters neutrons to lower energies, and then some of those neutrons will induce fission in the fuel, some of the will be absorbed, some of them will simply escape the core. You can't use light water for its scattering cross section (moderation), but "turn off" its absorption cross section (absorption). If the rate at which neutrons are absorbed by light water is too high for your particular design, you consider a different material instead. For example, CANDU reactors in Canada, which use heavy water. Heavy water is still fairly good at moderating neutrons, but has much lower absorption than light water. And that reduced absorption allows for fuel of lower enrichment to be used.	1642793736.0	htn0pc2	t3_s9gm3p	t3_s9gm3p	/r/askscience/comments/s9gm3p/how_can_water_act_as_a_moderator_in_lwrs_if_it/htn0pc2/

For example, DC could simply be a constant (zero frequency), or it could be a time-varying waveform that doesn't change sign (like a rectified sine wave, or a sine with a large enough DC offset). And AC could be a pure sine wave, or any arbitrary time-varying waveform.  But terminology aside, you can have whatever kinds of waveforms you want.

Your statement, "behavior emerges from the interactive effect of a biological system and an environmental system[because one cannot exist without the other]" is impossible to refute because it is not possible to seperate a biological system from all environments. I can manipulate the environment and observe the behavior across many varying environments(and we have), but no matter what experiment manipulation I do, you will always be able to argue that environment was involved.   Can't prove you true and can't prove you false. That means you can't conclusively be correct nor incorrect.   I, and my Cognitive Scientist professors, conclude that we can't reject that there can exist some biological behaviors.   You are free to think what you like, but what I was correcting is that nothing is conclusive and purely biological behaviors can exist.	1642796336.0	htn7v36	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htk52z9	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htn7v36/

We need to reduce stigma which will enable more people to seek treatment and the money that is used in the criminal justice system for drug use should instead be moved to developing much needed research and evidence-based treatment programs around the country. But drugs are not addiction. Crimes conducted while taking drugs would still be crimes and treated as such, but individuals in accounting for their crimes would get treatment while in prison and afterwards. With that said, it is also clear that more education programs are essential to develop in a knowledge-based manner to prevent initiation of drug use which can indeed lead to psychiatric and addiction problems.	1642796408.0	htn82c2	t3_s997hz	t1_htl8tgz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htn82c2/

14p9xc	Has there been any research into using marijuana to treat opioid addiction, and if so, are the results looking promising?   This is completely anecdotal, but I've seen several people have to quit smoking marijuana, and then develop an addiction to their prescribed pain meds when they've had no issues before. Likewise, I have seen friends start smoking marijuana, and either take less, or stop taking their pain meds altogether, whether prescribed or if they were purchasing off the street.   This wasn't 100%, I've seen some people both smoke heavily, and also abuse opioids, but it has definitely been enough people I've noticed a pattern.

For me,  the goal is to provide addiction medicine physicians with more clinical tools since we have really been using the same medications for decades with no truly new treatment strategies. I think that current research will provide not only new non-addictive pharmacological treatment strategies, but will also develop neurobiological devices where can target specific brain networks even strengthening, for example, prefrontal cortical function that will also be helpful. In regard to psilocybin the jury has not even been convened as yet since it is still so early. There is still a lot of fundamental research that is needed to be done.

g1t74	If you only get a small amount of the vaccine, you would still produce a bit of immune response, but not enough to prevent infections to a meaningful extent.   When vaccine researchers design the study, they would first test the virus and see how much antibodies are required to kill it, and then they would test several different doses in human volunteers, and see how the body responds. They would then choose a dosage that produces a nice level of antibodies that also does not produce too many side effects. Pfizer went with a smaller dose that still produced the desirable amount of antibodies, while Moderna went with a bigger dose, which generally speaking had more side effects, but later proved to be a bit better at preventing infections and hospitalizations than Pfizer.   Sometimes scientists don't get it quite right, for example, the Pfizer pediatric trial found out half way through their trial that the dose they went with was too small for an ideal antibody response. https://khn.org/morning-breakout/pfizer-to-test-third-vaccine-dose-for-young-kids-after-trials-miss-immunity-marks/	1642800406.0	htnj832	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htnj832/

cf5q6h0e	Why are opioids not used more in psychiatry?  As a patient with both chronic pain and depression, I noticed that a low opioid dose completely eliminates pretty severe depression - for a short time. (After 1 - 4 months, the anti-depressing effect fades, even though it still works as a painkiller.)  Usage suggestion, just as a patient: Use for max. 4 weeks, while starting treatment with an anti-depressant. Then, the anti-depressant needs to "take over".  Obviously, this method has the same addiction potential as when used as a painkiller. So it would only be viable when closely monitored, no contraindication for opioids exists (e. g. addiction in the past), and only when the patient really, really can't make it through the next few weeks otherwise.  I did pretty much exactly that "by accident"; however made the mistake to keep taking the opioid long after the anti-depressant was effective, thus making withdrawal from the opioid unnecessarily unpleasant.	1642803510.0	htnrqui	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htnrqui/

eokd2zcx	There's a lot of evidence that the criminality of illicit drug use in the United States is part of a racist social control on people of color. And a highly lucrative one at that, because the incarcerated are put to work for pennies on the dollar.  One article reference: [Nixon Adviser Admits War on Drugs Was Designed to Criminalize Black People](https://eji.org/news/nixon-war-on-drugs-designed-to-criminalize-black-people/)  >Between 1980 and 2011, arrests of African Americans for violent and property crimes fell, but rose dramatically for drug offenses. As the Washington Post reported, African Americans are far more likely to be arrested for selling or possessing drugs than whites, even though whites use drugs at the same rate and are more likely to sell drugs.  Book reference: [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness-ebook/dp/B086CFB2NT)  > Since it was first published in 2010, it has been cited in judicial decisions and has been adopted in campus-wide and community-wide reads; it helped inspire the creation of the Marshall Project and the new $100 million Art for Justice Fund; it has been the winner of numerous prizes, including the prestigious NAACP Image Award; and it has spent nearly 250 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.  >Most important of all, it has spawned a whole generation of criminal justice reform activists and organizations motivated by Michelle Alexander's unforgettable argument that "we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it." As the Birmingham News proclaimed, it is "undoubtedly the most important book published in this century about the U.S."	1642804248.0	htntpkr	t3_s997hz	t1_htn82c2	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htntpkr/

t7kb9jh	The latest research shows that COVID-19 is mainly an arterial disease, possibly changing a number of characteristics of the arterial walls and affecting interactions with platelets and clotting. The lungs have some of the most complex and smallest arterial structures, and therefore are greatly affected by the infection. There is damage done to the organs during the infection because of blood flow and oxygenation issues, and there is evidence of long term arterial changes/damage to the entire body after infection but it varies greatly person to person.  The brain is incredibly complex and medicine has known for some time that cognitive damage can occur even when oxygenation seems to have been kept appropriately high (see postperfusion syndrome or "pump head".) These symptoms can be temporary or can actually get worse over time.  The sooner the virus is cleared, the better off the outcome. The vaccine helps to prime your immune system to recognize the virus faster, and therefore clear it faster reducing the damage it can do.  Because of the way COVID-19 works, a person can have a pretty serious infection going but only feel minor symptoms until the organ systems are really in bad shape.  So the answer is absolutely yes. The evidence from multiple studies shows a reduction in post-recovery cognitive issues for those were vaccinated and still had a positive COVID-19 test result.

15uz6k	>Hello! I have often heard among cannabis users the mantra that opiates, nicotine, and other drugs are “biologically addictive” while cannabis is “psychologically addictive.” The explanation I have been able to find for this is that many drugs can change the body such that it does harm to itself in the absence of that substance, whereas cannabis addiction (or other addictions like playing video games or gambling). Is there truth in this? If so, what are the physical and psychological mechanisms behind each type?  Cannabis is like other drugs in that it too is biologically addictive. Meaning that when it is not present, it does lead to physiological changes, not just craving/anxiety which many consider as “psychological” addiction. The effects of cannabis are mediated by cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain that underlie craving, anxiety and mood. However, cannabinoid receptors are also expressed throughout the body.	1642807932.0	hto3b0p	t3_s997hz	t1_htltsko	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto3b0p/

Depression and anxiety are highly co-morbid with cannabis use disorder. There is also evidence that individuals with ADHD have higher cannabis use. It is often believed that cannabis is used to “self-medicate” these underlying conditions, but unfortunately the use of cannabis, especially high potency THC, will exacerbate them.	1642808771.0	hto5f3o	t3_s997hz	t1_htlal59	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto5f3o/

7zmonkxb	Last year I had major surgery and ended up with osteomyelitis - I went in as a recovering opioid addict (oxycodone) with six years clean. I genuinely thought I would be fine with a few days of pain meds, but because of the osteomyelitis, I was on and off Vicodin for months. After I was healed, I still relapsed a few times, and finally have stayed clean since the end of December again. My psychiatrist put me on naltrexone which combined with therapy and sober buddies has made a huge difference. I went from constant cravings to only wanting to use when I’m in the midst of a panic attack. I’m 29 now- how long do you think someone can safely stay on naltrexone without adverse long term effects?	1642808858.0	hto5mv3	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto5mv3/

15uz6k	It is clear that neurobiological changes induced by cannabis and THC persist long beyond acute intake, but different systems can 'normalize' at different time periods. Nevertheless, it appears even for some neural systems that might appear "normal" that they may still show long-term sensitivity during challenging situations later in life. Onset, frequency and duration of cannabis use all contribute to persistent long-term effects. Importantly though, research has shown that these long-term effects are mediated by 'epigenetic' mechanisms which is basically how the environment puts tags on the DNA to turn on and off genes. Since epigenetic mechanisms are reversible it means that cannabis-related alterations should also be reversible.	1642809333.0	hto6tll	t3_s997hz	t1_htlakn3	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto6tll/

15uz6k	Medical marijuana has different meanings with some thinking that it is CBD, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid, and for others cannabis with THC.  Our preclinical animal research had shown that CBD could reduce cue-induced heroin-seeking behavior. We then followed that with clinical pilot studies that showed indeed that CBD could reduce cue-induced craving and anxiety in individuals with heroin use disorder. We are now in the process of conducting larger clinical trials first taking a look at different CBD formulations. Other researchers are also trying to replicate those findings.   CBD is non-intoxicating so some investigators are also looking at cannabis itself to treat opioid use disorder as a more harm-reduction reward substitution strategy using a drug like marijuana that does not have the high mortality risk as opioids. Research is though still just starting.	1642811746.0	htocrf1	t3_s997hz	t1_htlh1z6	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htocrf1/

15uz6k	No, I have never had experiences with the various substances that I have studied. I do agree that experience can bias in either direction.  It is also clear that bias also relates to the context with which you are familiar with the drug. Since I work in a hospital research setting we mainly interact with individuals who suffer tremendously from their addiction. Of course though there are many people who will use the same drug and not develop a problem. Our goal is to understand the aspect of risk and resiliency which for substance use disorder is quite complex with multiply factors.  The endocannabinoid system on which THC works plays a critical role during neurodevelopment in hardwiring the brain. as such, it is not surprising that exposure to cannabis during development can impact  various neuronal pathways. This is demonstrated mainly in animal studies. In our human fetal studies, we also observed significant changes in the expression of genes in brain areas that will eventually mediate, for example, emotions, goal-directed behavior and cognition. These changes were more affected though in those with mothers who had more daily frequent use of cannabis.	1642812762.0	htof89h	t3_s997hz	t1_htlbfkg	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htof89h/

olsa8	So true. All of the responses are very typical of what you see from addiction researchers seeking grants. The constant focus on the idea that “we need better treatments” including pharmacological treatments (so far off if you ask me) is telling and misses the point completely. It ignores why some people use various substances obsessively to begin with, which is at the heart of the problem with addiction. It’s not about the substances Dr. Hurd, it’s about people and their circumstances.	1642821517.0	htp01k6	t3_s997hz	t1_htlqxny	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htp01k6/

ifqoplk4	Tl:dr..pcr data interpretation is..complicated.  I've noticed an interesting issue I've been had with a PCR test..maybe 1 reaction out of every 100. Instead of the usual logarithmic increase in fluorescence, I see a small increase that creeps up and above the threshold I've set (essentially resulting in what could be considered a 'false positive') However, after noting something was "off" I looked at the raw data and noticed something interesting. These increases in fluorescence are no more notable than that in any of the negative samples overall..and something is causing the software to select an early baseline. This means that any increase at all in fluorescence is determined by the software to be more drastic than it actual is. So, my conclusion is that there is an odd random increase in fluorescence that happens sometimes with this assay, which tricks the software into thinking it's a meaningful increase. It then essentially "hits record" and starts blowing subsequent increases in fluorescence out of proportion and giving you a "false positive." Now imagine this happening on a test that just spits out a "positive" or "negative" result with no human intervention meticulously going over the data and saying "hmm, this one isnt actually positive.."  It's not easy to design software that can account for every random thing that may be observed in real-time PCR data.  This whole post is only accounting for software issues though. There are equally as lengthy posts that could be made about the other potential false positive causes	1642824169.0	htp61rt	t3_s9kcvi	t3_s9kcvi	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htp61rt/

Helped quite immensely with manic depression, and seemed to bring pain levels down. So much so that I barely had any. I currently take Suboxone, initially to kick opiates, and now to treat chronic pain caused by a nerve disorder that presents with the symptoms of parsonage turner syndrome. Though as I've gotten older, some of those symptoms are no longer congruent. It was not a decision made lightly. I also have to take gabapentin, and antiinflammatories. The Suboxone has and still does work better for my pain, combined with the other meds, than normal opiates ever did. The normal line of pain killers eventually did barely anything but get me high, and very little for actual pain.

As the air inside the balloon heats up, the molecules inside have more kinetic energy; they move faster and hit the sides of the balloon harder, which puts more force on the walls of the balloon, causing it to expand.  No air is entering or leaving the balloon, so if heating up the balloon causes it to expand, then the same mass of air takes up a larger volume when hot, so its density goes down as it heats up.  A smaller density at higher temperature means that a volume of hot air is lighter than an equal volume of cold air.	1642827813.0	htpdhfe	t3_s79sx8	t3_s79sx8	/r/askscience/comments/s79sx8/why_is_warm_air_lighter_than_cold_air/htpdhfe/

6h26t	So outcompeting requires that infection with one variant produces antibodies that block the other.  Even with Omicron, that seems to be the case (at least for infections close in time, as one would expect with "competing").    In general, viruses evolve towards whatever helps them reproduce the most.  (As do all organisms, although a virus is not technically an organism...)  Most of the time, that's a trend towards increased infectivity.  Sometimes it's also a trend towards less virulence within the host, because if the virus kills the host too quickly, then it doesn't have time to jump to new hosts and propagate.  To be clear, no viruses "want" anything -- they don't "want" to kill.  It just turns out that using a large portion of your organs to reproduce results in the virus killing you.	1642829245.0	htpg8qs	t3_s8pwmg	t3_s8pwmg	/r/askscience/comments/s8pwmg/are_we_tending_towards_more_infective_variants_of/htpg8qs/

bvi9ioq1	Hello! I am a heavy THC user between delta-8 and flower. In the last few months, Ive been waking up nauseous. If I ate badly or drank a bit of alcohol the night before, I sometimes throw up. I recently read about CHS, and I am taking a T break just in case this is what I am developing. From what I understand, the cyclical vommiting stage is the one you dont come back from, and it generally requires hospitalization and an IV drip. Given that I am nowhere near this bad, do you think I am taking a break in time to be able to enjoy cannabis later? How long of a break would you reccomend? Do you have any advice related to my situation in general? I was thinking about 30 days, doing cardio each day. Would I need to completly reset my tolerance to avoid progressing the CHS, assuming this is what I have? Im 6'2, 175lbs, and was vaping about 250-750mg of 94% delta-8 distilate per day.

But then it can just as easily send you to the emergency room.  This makes it very difficult to know for certain what it might do.  As for vaccines, they will reduce your chances of contracting the disease, and they are even more effective at preventing serious symptoms.  But nothing there is 100% either.  So, my educated guess would be that the vaccines will almost certainly reduce your chances of any serious side effect.  Brain damage included.

The great vowel shift had finished, so it would be somewhat similar outside of a few words and terms. Think talking to a real rural speaker of some obscure dialect in north wales or smth. You'd call it a thick accent with a couple made-up words  But reading?

Tesla coils for example can cause electricity to flow through the air (and air is usually a very good insulator).  A conductor is just a material that has high conductivity and a low resistivity. Pure (deionized) water has low conductivity and high resistivity, so it's not a conductor.	1642842018.0	htq0mhn	t3_s52po9	t1_htohnta	/r/askscience/comments/s52po9/jupiters_surface_how_we_know_what_its_like/htq0mhn/

2miwna93	For original, internal names (endonyms) mostly descriptions. They can often be VERY boring/blunt/descriptive. Exonyms typically come about because of odd bits of history.  For example:  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "Nippon(koku)" = "The Sun's Origin", in Japanese. Some might say "The Land of the Rising Sun". It's also pronounced as "Nihon". It is written 日本, 日 = Sun, 本 = Start, because the Japanese learned to write from China (This is why reading Japanese is difficult, and why the Koreans agreed to throw that system out).   "Japan" on the other hand is the result of what amounts to a game of multi-lingual telephone. Japan's European name(s) was/were taken from China, as they had heard of it second-hand.   In Cantonese, 日本 is pronounced like "yat bun", which is where the Dutch got their word "Japan" (Yapan). The Portuguese on the other hand heard it from another group of southern speakers. In Min Chinese, 日本 was, and still is read as something like "Ji̍t pún".   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "Deutschland" on the other hand came from "Diutisciu Land", or "Land of the People" ("Diot" meaning "People")   "Germany" came from latin "Germania", or "Land of the Germani". The Germani were a Germanic tribe that likely inhabited the rough area of Germany (Technically the Rhineland) when the romans were around. They moved, or were otherwise displaced by another people.  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "France" came from Latin "Francia", meaning "Land of the Franks", because it was was home to a people called "The Franks" or Frankish.   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "Russia" is Latin as well, came from "Land of the Rus".   The name "Rus" itself is thought to be a loanword from Proto-Finnic, and it was the name for the Swedish (\*Ruotsi), which meant "the men who row" (rods-).   In some Finnic Languages, like Veps, their version of the word "Ros" still means "Swedish".   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  *Estados Unidos Mexicanos*, or Mexico, came from "Mexihco", the name of for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, aka The Valley of Mexico.   As to where "Mexihco" came from, we don't know.   Some think it came from "Mēxxīcco", which would mean "Place at the Moon's Navel", but that would require some odd simplifications, and isn't widely accepted... We don't know a lot about the Nahuatl language's history, because the Spanish burnt a lot of it some 500 years ago. ***Thanks, Hernan Cortés >:\[***	1642843100.0	htq245c	t3_s8rbw0	t3_s8rbw0	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htq245c/
yvq1g	You are referring to a gravitational field. A gravitational wave is a ripple caused by a sudden change of a field - just like you have the electromagnetic field of a radio emitter and electromagnetic waves (that can carry information) that are caused by rapid changes of this field and can propagate much further than the field itself.  There is a very popular visualization of a gravitational field as a 2D curving of a 2D planar surface ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg)). This has its limits - gravity happens in 3D and curves a 4D spacetime - so you cannot really visualize the slope. Just like any field, it has both force and direction in every point. Two identical fields with opposite directions in one point are reduced to zero.	1642843489.0	htq2mz9	t3_s8yph3	t1_htokiyh	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htq2mz9/

g1t74	It mostly does, it's just not linear or consistent. Moderna's Phase 1, for example, found that antibody levels correlate to dosage. "After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-μg group, 109,209 in the 100-μg group, and 213,526 in the 250-μg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). " https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483   Pfizer also found that "RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose." They tried 10μg, 30μg and 100μg.  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4 if you look at the graph in Figure 4, you will see that bigger doses had higher antibody levels. The lower levels at 100μg past 21 days was due to the fact this group did not get a second dose - Pfizer decided the difference was too modest to justify the increased side effects.	1642848969.0	htqa3d5	t3_s9f960	t1_htq64yd	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htqa3d5/

quthw	Well thats not really true I guess, if you are addicted to cannabis  (smoking on a regular basis for an extended period) you probably will have some withdrawal symptoms that can be both psychologically and physically.  People tend to report symptoms like headaches, restlessness, anxiety, apetite changes/stomach problems and insomnia as withdrawal occurs.	1642851892.0	htqe8ar	t3_s997hz	t1_hto6p8o	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqe8ar/

The only type of vaccine that can cause the illness it tries to prevent is live attenuated virus vaccines which use a live but weakened virus. This vaccine type include the MMR vaccine, chickenpox, and smallpox and a couple less common ones (in the US).  This pretty much only happens in people with weakened immune systems and such people may be advised to avoid these vaccines.	1642852004.0	htqee3n	t3_s9b9ja	t3_s9b9ja	/r/askscience/comments/s9b9ja/is_there_any_small_possiblility_that_humans_get/htqee3n/

z4z1h	Primer selection is the key problem in designing a highly selective PCR.  Primers are short synthesized nucleotide sequences that bind to the viral nucleic acid and allow sequence replication via reverse transcriptase elongation.  The primers are selected based on viral sequencing to identify unique sequences within the viral genome so that one primer replicates one strand in the up direction and the other primer initiates replication in the other direction so that the replicated strands are complimentary and can bind to one another.  The replicated strands are then heat denatured to separate them and the primers are then recycled to initiate additional rounds of priming and sequence elongation; repeat many times until the replicated sequence is present in great enough amounts to be detectable.    The problem comes in when the primer selection is not optimal and detects nucleotide sequences not unique to the intended target nucleotide sequence; for example, there are many strains of coronavirus which may share a large amount of sequence identity or similarity that could confound results of PCR and show up as a false positive if the target is intended to by Covid-19 specific and the primers have not been designed to exclude non-Covid coronavirus sequences.  This is a significant problem because in order to design completely specific primers it is necessary to identify unique viral regions specific for the virus in question, which requires whole genome sequence databases for every type of nucleic acid (viral, bacterial, host) likely to be present in the test sample.  This is just one of the possible reasons for false positives, but an important one.	1642854572.0	htqi67q	t3_s9kcvi	t3_s9kcvi	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htqi67q/

One in particular is the increase in phosphorylated Tau protein (a marker often seen in neurodegenerative disorders like dementia) in the brains of individuals with heroin abuse. This was replicated in our animal model (heroin self-administration) and related to specific epigenetic changes associated with the gene that regulates downstream Tau phosphorylation.

15uz6k	This 'chicken and egg' is still a major question in research. It is clear though that the arrow is in both directions. Mechanistically, individuals with risk for certain psychiatric disorders have underlying perturbation of neurobiological systems that are the pharmacological target of some drugs of abuse. Thus, using drugs can make some individuals feel  'normal' but eventually bring them down a path of addiction as they need more and more of the drug. And on the other hand, even in individuals without a psychiatric risk, the repeated exposure of potent drugs can change the neural signature to mimic that seen with psychiatric illnesses.	1642862740.0	htqx9gg	t3_s997hz	t1_htlk6wl	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqx9gg/

15uz6k	A number of longitudinal and epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that early onset of cannabis use is associated with worse outcomes than those who started later in life. Animal models also verify such findings.  There are no laws that can really prevent young people from experimenting with drugs.  Open, non-judgmental evidence-based education is critical.  Improved treatment and access would improve if laws are changed, for example, in the restricted manner in which opioid treatments are provided to individuals suffering from opioid use disorder.	1642863193.0	htqy9qj	t3_s997hz	t1_htlo5y7	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqy9qj/
157xv3	There are a couple of ways this can happen, and this list is by no means exhaustive. The authors in this paper also don't seem to claim any one of these mechanisms as the culprit; at this point, it looks like they've just identified the SNP. The actual mechanism could be one of these or none of these:  1) The SNP could affect intron splicing. Some mutations in introns can actually impair intron removal, leaving the intron in the mature mRNA. As you can imagine, this would have profound impacts on protein translation.  2) The SNP could be a mutation in an miRNA that has yet to be identified. miRNA genes sometimes (certainly not always) reside in the introns of other genes, and those miRNAs could be involved in the regulation of any number of processes in the cell in which the gene is typically expressed.  3) The SNP in the intron could interfere with how well the gene is transcribed. Introns sometimes boost gene transcription even if they don't directly promote transcription factor binding.  One thing is clear, however. When I started grad school studying genetics, I was still taught "junk DNA" was a thing, i.e. there were large chunks of DNA sequence that didn't do anything. By the time I got my PhD, it was painfully clear "junk DNA" could be anything but junk.	1642863280.0	htqygjo	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htqygjo/

15uz6k	Thank you. It has been a challenging road when many initially thought that the focus of our research was not important to support.  We have identified interesting epigenetic effects (e.g., acetylation, histone methylation) associated with cannabis and heroin use that are unfortunately beyond this forum to detail. However, it is intriguing that the epigenetic changes can be targeted pharmacologically which gives hope for potentially developing novel non-addictive treatments.  We have had a number of unexpected findings. One in particular is the increase in phosphorylated Tau protein (a marker often seen in neurodegenerative disorders like dementia) in the brains of individuals with heroin abuse. This was replicated in our animal model (heroin self-administration) and related to specific epigenetic changes associated with the gene that regulates downstream Tau phosphorylation.   Other interesting findings include detecting cross-generational effects of THC.	1642863540.0	htqz0xl	t3_s997hz	t1_htlpn7z	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqz0xl/

1fa1t	There are are regulatory and enhancing regions of gene expression (particularly at thee 5' end of the gene) as well.  It's also possible that there's an unrecognized transcript isoform of the gene where a portion of the intron (from one isoform) is actually an alternate or optional exon of another.	1642864185.0	htr0gbu	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htqygjo	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr0gbu/
157xv3	Most of the time, mutations don't really do much of anything. Less than 3% of the human genome actually contains protein-coding genes, and even variations in those genes are commonly found in the population.  One thing I learned during my research (I've been in research since 2005) is that it's pretty incredible how resilient life can be. It's pretty rare for people to find a seemingly random mutation that has such a big effect, which is why this paper for published in such a big-name journal.  The cool thing is when you find a mutation like this. At first glance, it shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it is. That means we don't understand something, that there's a gap in our knowledge. That's when we can learn something new and weird!	1642864193.0	htr0gw2	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htqz211	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr0gw2/
15uz6k	The glutamatergic system which ketamine targets is critical to the underlying neurobiology of addiction including the transition to compulsive, drug-seeking behavior.  The brain is the most complex organ so it is not surprising that there is still so little that we know. That is why it is so exciting to be a neuroscientist which really is being an "explorer" of a new world.   Unfortunately we are often in a catch-22 situation since everyone wants new potential medications for psychiatric and addiction disorders to work especially those that get initial hype so they can sometimes quickly end up on the market despite knowing relatively little about their mechanism of action. This even goes for some new drugs and nutraceuticals being promoted to help neurogenesis and neuroplasticity to fix the cognitive decline you noted.

15uz6k	Cannabis can cause harm as the legal drugs you noted.  A number of research groups have shown that cannabis can cause psychological changes even in individuals with no known susceptibility and animal studies verify those findings. Dose (i.e., THC potency), early onset of use, frequency of use all of course increases that risk, but indeed, it accelerates psychological issues in those who are already susceptible.	1642864628.0	htr1fp0	t3_s997hz	t1_htlgxr0	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr1fp0/

15uz6k	The questions you raise are very important for human studies since the environment under which a child develops is critical for increasing the risk that cannabis (or other drugs) can have on the developing brain. Indeed, impoverished and adverse environments alone can be more detrimental to brain than the drug use. In our developmental human studies, we do try to account for multiple coexisting conditions but we of course can't know everything so other factors could impact the results we say are linked to cannabis. that is why we also conduct animal studies in which we can control their environment to see does the drug itself lead to brain and behavioral consequences as seen in humans.	1642864906.0	htr22og	t3_s997hz	t1_htlagul	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr22og/

157xv3	Well, some mutations could be silent, i.e. they change the DNA sequence but not change the amino acids sequence of the protein because multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Or, a protein could tolerate a different amino acid in a certain position even if it slightly changes the protein structure or skewers the protein function in a way that doesn't hurt cell function too much.  But instead of calling anything that's not a gene junk DNA, I prefer to say it's DNA that didn't have a known specific function yet. I say this mostly because of I call something junk, I'm almost sure I'll be proven wrong almost immediately.	1642865084.0	htr2h8w	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htr1n1g	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr2h8w/

is3s1a47	The ancient Egyptians used siphons at least as long ago as 1500 BC. The siphon principle was described around 240 BC by Greek mathematician and inventor Tesibus of Alexandria. Aristotle was a Greek teacher who lived from 384 BC 322 and he articulated the scientific fact that water seeks it's own level.  Water within a siphon conduit will seek it's own level and no matter the length when a running siphons outlet is raised to the level of the inlet water level the flow has achieved equilibrium and the flow will stop.  A siphon will continue to run if the outlet is sufficiently positioned below the source level and the crest  can be raised over 25 feet without  stopping  the flow.   Scientists believed it was a violation of the law of conservation of energy to receive water above the source with a siphon because the total energy related to siphons remains constant.  It wasn't until as recent as the 1990s that a cyclical way of dispensing liquids from an inline  canister above the source was invented.  A Siphon Pump Having a Metering Chamber accomplishes this seemingly  impossible task.	1642865291.0	htr2y54	t3_sa4353	t3_sa4353	/r/askscience/comments/sa4353/can_a_siphon_dispense_liquids_above_the_source/htr2y54/

Like others have said introns are oftentimes important regulatory or enhancer regions. Important intron sequences can oftentimes be discovered by looking at how conserved the sequence is.

15uz6k	Cannabis and heroin are not under the same umbrella or harm.  Opioids, though of extremely beneficial for acute relief of intense pain, have a higher addictive potential and increased mortality than cannabis.  However, cannabis is not benign, especially for the developing brain. Different cannabinoids have different benefits and risks. THC especially at high doses found today has more harm whereas CBD is non-intoxicating and our research showed that it reduced heroin craving and anxiety. Yes, anything if you look hard enough can have a risk. We need to therefore look at what people are actually consuming and not being alarmists.	1642865985.0	htr4ksp	t3_s997hz	t1_htm3rxm	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr4ksp/

14vn06	Alright, so, if we pull back a bit from the abstraction that DNA is simple a 'code', it is also a physical thing.  Though the Intron is not directly used in gene expression, it is still part of the overall structure. Removing, adding, or changing a piece of the overall structure can result in a change in how the DNA folds, it can change the distribution of chemical charge across the structure, and it could even turn what was 'junk' DNA into something that would no longer be ignored. Any of those changes modifies how the RNA machines that interpret, trim, or replicate the DNA are able to interact with it.  Ultimately, though Introns aren't directly involved in the literal output of DNA transcription, they are still impactful on how Gene expression occurs.	1642866395.0	htr5jv8	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr5jv8/

Mood is the reason a lot of people consume THC, but it also has effects that aren't usually considered. But I definitely see a lot of individual differences in how much it takes for one person to start having noticeable differences.     I've got some friends who smoke regularly, and they have no major changes, then another friend who smokes with the same frequency, who could smoke the same amount, and almost have a psychotic episode.

Some through intramuscular injection.   Some through intravenous injection.   Heroin is the last one. I've never personally tried it but I've read about it years ago and intravenous is something like 99+% of the drug gets used whereas someone who eats it is something like 50% and snort/smoke is 60-70% (I don't remember any numbers except the 99% one, just used them as an example.

3yvxcpj4	As someone who has run PCR a lot, I can elaborate on non-specific reactions. If the reaction temperatures are off, you can have the primer bind to non-complementary DNA which will lead to amplification and a false positive. This leads to trade offs with reaction temperature between specificity (low false positives) and sensitivity (ability to detect small amounts of target DNA).  And as someone else mentioned incorrect temperatures can also lead to the primers sticking to each other (primer dimerization). That is why primer design is an important step, since this can minimize the chances of primer dimerization for a wider temperature range.  This is a lesser contributor to false positives though since negative controls are used. The same reaction mixture is run without the sample. If primer dimerization is happening, most likely the negative control will amplify too, telling you something is wrong.	1642868991.0	htrbtnf	t3_s9kcvi	t1_htocyry	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htrbtnf/

6y75e	Color is not "essentially a wavelength". There are various color experiences we have that do not correspond to any single wavelength of light (non-spectral or extraspectral colors like pink, purple, and brown).  Our experience of color is the result of the interaction of light (combinations of wavelengths at various intensities) with our visual systems. Our visual systems are not simply "photon detectors". In fact, with a single kind of receptor (cone cell) it is impossible to distinguish between different wavelengths (because the response of the cell is modulated by both the wavelength and the intensity and changes in response can be dur to changes of one or the other or both).   The wiki page on the [color wheel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel) is actually pretty reasonable, but a more detailed response cannot be given without talking about biology, specifically the color-opponent organization in the retina.	1642869774.0	htrds5v	t3_s9ur6b	t3_s9ur6b	/r/askscience/comments/s9ur6b/why_is_a_colour_wheel_a_circle_and_not_a_straight/htrds5v/
xwpqi	The earth system warms slowly, but there are natural processes that remove CO2.  If we reduce emissions to the point where our input equals the natural removal and concentrations stay constant, the Earth continues to warm by a degree or two over a century or two.  If we cut emissions to *zero*, the natural CO2 removal works against the delayed warming, and temperature stays more or less constant for a few centuries before starting to fall.   https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached	1642869926.0	htre5vm	t3_q6ht1t	t1_htr9x6a	/r/askscience/comments/q6ht1t/isnt_co2_emission_reduction_without_carbon/htre5vm/
fjghl	Sinuses need gravity to drain. In zero gravity, your sinuses fill with mucus.   Burping is impossible. Without gravity the contents of your stomach can’t settle into gases on top of liquids and solids, so if you try to burp you’ll vomit.   As a result of no burping, people are WAY more gassy in zero gravity. But that’s ok because everybody’s sinuses are blocked, so nobody can smell.	1642870013.0	htredm5	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htredm5/

13t99v	So this question is same question as why are some medicines pills, and why are some injected, and why are some suppositories, why some are inhalers, etc.  With the exception of topical drugs (creams, patches) etc., drugs work by getting the active molecule in the bloodstream. The percentage of drug eventually found in the blood versus what was ingested through whichever means in known as the bioavailability of a drug.  Essentially, injecting a drug intravenously results in 100% bioavailability, with all the drug in your blood immediately. So why not inject all drugs, legal or not? Well, sometimes you want a slower, long-lasting absorption, like slow-release tylenol edible THC. Injected drugs also need to be very soluble in both whatever the dosing mixture is and blood, since you want to keep the injection volume low while not precipitating out the drug. Also people just don't like needles. But some drugs, like anitbody based drugs (like the covid one) won't survive in the acidic stomach and/or can't be absorbed through the cell membranes of the intestine, so IV is the only way. C'est la vie.  As for the smoking question - smoking, chemically speaking, is a very harsh way of getting a drug into a vapor form. The high heat of combustion isn't (ideally) burning the drug itself, but all the other stuff around it, and that heat vaporizes the drug molecule which is the inhaled and absorbed the the nose and lungs and such. So consider crack cocaine vs. freebase cocaine - cocaine is actually a salt form of crack. As a salt, compared to a neutral molecule, it's boiling point is much, much higher. So much higher in fact, that if you heat it up, it will just decompose instead of boiling. Therefore, cocaine is just snorted, while crack can be smoked and the vapor inhaled.   TL;DR: the properties of a molecule and the desired dosing profile affect how it can be administered.	1642870621.0	htrfy1b	t3_sa5bj1	t3_sa5bj1	/r/askscience/comments/sa5bj1/why_is_heroine_injected_more_commonly_than_other/htrfy1b/

gekpw	The orbiting object is still in free fall. But a non-inertial frame of reference fixed on the object is not just rotating with a constant frequency with respect to an inertial frame, there's also linear accelerations.  So the total fictitious force experienced in such a frame is not purely centrifugal. That makes the idea of considering the orbit from the rest frame of the orbiting object a little more complicated than just **F***_gravity_* = -**F***_centrifugal_*.	1642870861.0	htrgkj5	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrflnr	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrgkj5/

rjwag	I think this explanation is a bit shit, and I don't know the exact math, but I'm pretty sure if you had a Box moving at c, an object inside the box moving at 1m/s from back to front, would be moving at c+1m/s. And that is not allowed. Therefore your Body would literally cease to function due to relativistic effects between parts of your body at near-light speed.  Like, for example, if you're facing the front of the ship, and your left hand is behind you, and your right hand is infront of you, an electrical impulse from your brain may arrive at your left hand in seconds, but the same impulse may take hours to arrive at your right hand since it has to travel with the direction of the ship, which is already near c.	1642871073.0	htrh434	t3_s4ve57	t1_hstpbhw	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htrh434/

gekpw	A box can't move at c, but let's take a box moving at c - (1 m/s), and have something inside the box move forward at 1 m/s in the rest frame of the box. From the point of view of an observer watching the box move by at c - (1 m/s), the object is not moving at [c - (1 m/s)] + (1 m/s) = c, because that's using non-relativistic velocity addition. If you use relativistic velocity addition, it'll actually be ~0.99999999666c.  But anyway, that's all irrelevant to the comment above, because moving at constant velocity with any speed is not harmful to your body, it's the acceleration that's relevant.  >Like, for example, if you're facing the front of the ship, and your left hand is behind you, and your right hand is infront of you, an electrical impulse from your brain may arrive at your left hand in seconds, but the same impulse may take hours to arrive at your right hand since it has to travel with the direction of the ship, which is already near c.  No, because in your rest frame, you're simply stationary. Your body parts are not moving at relativistic speeds relative to other parts of your body.	1642871662.0	htrimxw	t3_s4ve57	t1_htrh434	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htrimxw/
rjwag	Well, I think you would be able to reach, c, if you had infinite energy and time. The reason you can't go faster then c is because mass approaches infinity. But infinite energy means you are able to reach infinite mass, as accelerating infinite mass will require infinite energy. To keep going, you would need greater than infinite energy, or less than infinite mass. (Which is why the solution to basically all FTL travel equations is "have negative mass")  I think. Infinity is weird, and doesn't really make sense in the concept of real world physics as well understand it at least. As far as I know, the only infinities we observe in the real world are produced by Black Holes, and events like The Big Bang, which aren't well understood and don't really fit cleanly into the known laws of physics.	1642871696.0	htriq1l	t3_s4ve57	t1_hstwclr	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htriq1l/

bk71dslb	Steven R. Lindsy has theorized dogs do have the ability to identify their siblings later in life and can also identify their parents as well. However, this is generally only the case for puppies who spent their critical socialization period with their siblings from when they were born to about 16-weeks old.  However,  it is unlikely they recognize a familial relationship only that they have spent more than 16 weeks in close association with another dog.	1642872203.0	htrk0pg	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htrk0pg/

114i25	I work on RNA splicing so I think I can answer this. Introns contain a lot of regulatory elements essential for faithful splicing of coding genes. However, because of how large introns tend to be (average length is 800-1000bp), most SNPs are harmless because they fall in regions with no regulatory significance. In this paper, the author noticed that the primary hotspot SNP is C/T, with T being the risk allele. One possible explanation is that this is an activating mutation. The 5’ splice site is typically GT, so the T allele here could be activating a cryptic 5’SS. This typically leads to production of premature stop codons (PTC) or causes a frame shift. Either way, the gene becomes inactivated. Another explanation is that this activates am intronic splicing enhancer or silencer signals (ISE or ISS). This will also lead to gene expression disruption. To know for absolutely sure, the authors would have to zoom down to the nucleotide level to see where the SNP tend to occur. That’d give further clue regarding how it can loss of smell and taste.	1642872432.0	htrkmet	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htrkmet/

rjwag	But isn't c an absolute value? A photon outside of the box cannot move slower then a photon inside the box. This also applies to you.  Lets say the box is moving at c-1ms. And you have a photon in the box moving at c relative to the box. And is shot out the front of the box. Would it not be moving at 2c-1 relative to other photons once it leaves the box? Or would it suddenly stop moving at c relative to the box and move at 1m/s relative to the box once its outside the box. Or would the photon be limited to moving at 1m/s in that direction, even within the box. This would also apply to matter as well.  You could also apply this to another box in that box moving at c-1 being shot out of the front of the box at 2c-2 relative to a photon outside the box.	1642872722.0	htrldon	t3_s4ve57	t1_htrimxw	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htrldon/

12dqku	Hi - studied splicing in detail before. Many ways a SNP in an intron could be deleterious but the two most big ones are:  a) It could affect ability to splice itself. For example, if it's in the branchpoint A, you can't form a splicing lariat. Or if it affects things called ISE (intronic splicing enhancers), you won't splice as effectively. Or it can create new 5'SS splice sites depending on the mutation  b) It could affect ability to be transcribed. Many gene regulatory elements are in the first intron so if its in an enhancer and the transcription factor can't bind or creates a de-novo repressor sequence, less RNA is created.  c) It could alter RNA stability. For example: it could cause early termination if it creates a new polyA site or recruits RNA degradation factors/exosomes/integrator to it.	1642873398.0	htrn456	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htrn456/

16qgmh0f	It's been quite a few years since I looked into this in even a little depth, so I really shouldn't say more than I have with any authority. So take this with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that it's technically the 'almost current location', but the difference is arguably negligible in practice and for reasons that aren't super important when trying to understand the "basic" physics of orbiting bodies in the OP's scenario.  The effect also only really holds for constant velocity and acceleration of the two bodies - if there are higher-order changes in position, like jolt/jerk/snap, then I believe there will start to be differences between the 'predicted' and 'actual' locations as well. Although I don't know if there are caveats or conditions to that.	1642874569.0	htrq46j	t3_s8yph3	t1_htq4hkd	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htrq46j/
ag1zy307	There's a very large portion of the genome that is not evolutionarily conserved. If it had a fitness benefit, then it would be conserved. So either it has no benefit, or it is conserved in some way we don't yet understand.   The existence of functional elements in non-coding regions does not imply that all our most of these non- coding regions are functional.	1642874738.0	htrqkmz	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htqygjo	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htrqkmz/

4cwe831	> that gravity and the centrifugal force from rotating around the planet/star/etc. cancelled out  Yes, but only in the reference frame corotating with the orbiting body. There's an idea called [effective potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_potential) which makes this formal.  A rotating reference frame is not "natural" in the sense that it's non-inertial. In an inertial reference frame there is no centrifugal force. If there was some force which cancelled out the gravitational force, the net force would be zero, and the object would be static or move at constant velocity -- that's Newton's first law.  In the rotating reference frame, the fictive centrifugal force provides that cancelling force and so the orbiting body doesn't move (exactly as you'd expect since the reference frame is by definition corotating with it).	1642876106.0	htru2u7	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htru2u7/

2km0r2l6	There are many we know of and almost certainly many we still don’t. It’s fascinating the things our body does in space. Don’t recall which astronaut said it in an interview but the very first time you pee in space your body “sheds” significant amounts of calcium. So essentially with no prior “knowledge” of microgravity your body decides to pretty much turn you into a fish/bird as soon as you escape Earth’s immediate gravity. Your hips shed the most calcium, followed by your spine (as far as I remember). Your calluses will fall off (and even start growing on the upper part of your foot because you use your feet to change direction and “grab” rails).  Blood circulation is a mess with no gravity, sometimes going as far as starting to circulate the other way (or stagnating). Blood pools in your head and chest, causing congestion. Your sense of taste is almost gone, which is why hot sauce is as far as I’m aware the most popular condiment on the ISS (and odd, strong tasting food in general). Something similar happens to vision (presumably because of intracranial pressure?) with prolonged time in space - most astronauts report nearsightedness in the immediate months after return to Earth. There are many more things I forgot and likely even more stuff I never knew.	1642876940.0	htrw8ru	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htrw8ru/
hlyltbqi	99% similarity in primary sequence seems like a lot, but for genomes the size of those in chimpanzees and humans that still means tens of millions of differences. Since TADs correlate with specific DNA binding proteins that are targeted toward specific sequence motifs, that 1% difference in primary sequence could result in very large differences in the locations of these motifs which in turn would affect global TAD organization in the nucleus. So TAD maps may be loosely correlated with genome similarity especially at regions with greater than average sequence conservation between species. However, small differences in primary sequence likely result in much larger overall differences in structures as complex as TADs.	1642877064.0	htrwk56	t3_s9xpdb	t3_s9xpdb	/r/askscience/comments/s9xpdb/does_topologically_associating_domain/htrwk56/

r4hcf	Any social animal will have a greater sense of kinship than solitary ones. Canine packs' internal hierarchies are predicated upon kin relationship with the eldest breeding female being the head of the pack. Mothers and fathers who play an active role in rearing young will definitely have a sense of "these are my babies" and young reared together will have a sense of "these are my brothers and sisters".  That sense of kinship becomes more nebulous as generations widen. Normally, as pups grow up, they move on and start their own families. In households where a litter is kept together, this sense of kinship will probably continue beyond its natural longevity. But when a grown pup has pups of its own, the grandparent might delight in the novelty of being around puppies again, they probably do not have the same strong sense of kinship with the young.  Keep in mind, it's hard to say what is "natural" with domestic canines since by domesticating them and rearing them in an artificial environment, dogs are kind of reinventing their nature from scratch all the time. For all we know, there might be a grandmother dog who knows for a fact that a puppy is her grandpuppy based on her personal experience and ability to connect the dots.	1642879976.0	hts3z8q	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/hts3z8q/
e0bci	Bioavailability and degree of reinforcement. As a rule, injecting anything intravenously means rapid rise in blood levels and no loss of the drug in question (all IV drugs have 100% bioavailability by definition.) Something like half of the heroin used in smoking/inhaling is lost in the process compared to IV use. For severe users who are spending all their money on obtaining the drug, getting a more intense high with half the amount of drug becomes a compelling advantage. (There's a long list of massive disadvantages, but then by definition, if you were still able to stop because of negative consequences, you wouldn't have a substance use disorder.)  In general, drugs of abuse with very rapid onset of action are also going to be more addictive. The neuroscience of addiction isn't just about a rise in dopamine in certain brain structures, but intense and rapid bursts. Compare chewing coca leaves, which gives a low-dose trickle of cocaine and is part of the culture in parts of South America, to the sudden high of smoking pure cocaine. IV heroin is the perfect example of rapid-onset intoxication.  Other drugs are sometimes used intravenously, but the advantage isn't quite as strong over other routes. Methamphetamine still has rapid onset of action with smoking, and better nasal bioavailability. We do see a decent bit of IV methamphetamine use, though.  Cocaine is a particularly bad choice for IV injection, because it's a powerful vasoconstrictor with a short-lived high. If you shoot up in one arm, you're going to have a hard time doing it again for a while because the blood vessels have all shrunken down.	1642880031.0	hts446b	t3_sa5bj1	t3_sa5bj1	/r/askscience/comments/sa5bj1/why_is_heroine_injected_more_commonly_than_other/hts446b/

Being in low gravity reduces the amount of fluid required in your blood vessels which in turn increases the destruction rate of red blood cells by roughly 50% to maintain the right concentration. This increased destruction rate continues on earth after the volume of fluid is restored causing anemia.	1642880139.0	hts4duo	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/hts4duo/

273bw7e	Don't think dogs have a concept of fatherhood.  They understand mom (of course) and sex.    When a female dog is in heat-- she roams around for a few days and acquires a menagerie of male dog suitors.  Eventually she will "stand", i.e. allow mounting and penetration.  Every male dog will attempt to get in on the action.    If/when he does, a part of his penis will swell up, such that it cannot exit the vagina.  It's stuck.  This can last like 30 minutes or an hour.  The two dogs will turn around and appear "butt to butt".     This is to attempt to prevent other males for mating her and inserting their sperm-- it's sperm competition.  He's giving his swimmers a head start.	1642880598.0	hts5ivw	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrooaa	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/hts5ivw/

Each layers of skin cells gradually moves up towards the surface as the top layer sheds.

Bone cells need mechanical stress as stimulus to deposit the calcium minerals in the area experiencing mechanical stress so that the bone can support the excess weight/forces.

78foeoy	> Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes  This is a question about blackbody radiation. Look up a blackbody graph to see what I'm talking about (I'm on mobile sorry)  Star emit light at all frequencies to varying degrees. Warmer stars emit more infrared, but we can't see infrared at all - it has nothing to do with any characteristics of the star. We can't see the infrared radiation of a cooler star either.  > Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red  In terms of visible light, yes that's exactly correct. Blackbody radiation is represented by a curve, and the peak of that curve determines the color of the star. If the peak is at lower (IR) frequency, most of the star's visible light is red. If the peak is at higher (UV) frequency, most of the star's visible light is blue. If the star's peak is somewhere in the visible range, the star appears white to us. Why not green? The peak is not extremely steep - it is shallow enough and the visible light spectrum is so narrow that there is *roughly* equal amounts of every color of visible light.	1642883091.0	htsbmei	t3_sa9uvg	t3_sa9uvg	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htsbmei/

sd07u	You're talking about the idea of [kin recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_recognition), which is very important in social and evolutionary biology.  Generally speaking, animals recognise each other via cues such as smell, visually, or by the fact they live in close proximity. Whether they actually "know" that an individual is a particular relative (brother vs uncle, for example) is unknown and quite possibly unknowable.  With dogs specifically, they use olfaction and experiential mechanisms i.e. who you live with. But if they are separated from siblings when young, they do not seem to recognise them when older (Hepper and Cleland, 1998). Interestingly, mother-offspring offspring still persists in such circumstances.  Finally, recognising grandparents would be unusual, since most animals do not have overlapping generations i.e. three generations living together, with   &#x200B;  Hepper, P. G., & Cleland, J.

duly6	What I know for certain is this, which I learned from Robert Sapolsky's Stanford lecture series: animals in general are extraordinarily good at judging their own relatedness to other members of the same species, at least under certain circumstances—to the extent that, in his words, it's literally as if they're doing calculations to determine their behavior.  And obviously, the animals aren't literally doing calculations, so there must be a variety of powerful intuitive mechanisms at play that enable that kind of sensitivity.

i70mwwkr	Yup. The equivalent period for wolf cubs is a lot shorter. In that time they basically learn what not to be scared of (normal wolfy life stuff), and then when that period ends and they're old enough to start exploring further, they need to start being wary of new things as new things are likely to be dangerous. It's very much a survival thing.  With dog puppies, basically whatever they meet in their first 12-16 weeks, their brains are wired to assume it's safe.

5tvdt	The bladder has 'stretch' sensing nerves for when your bladder gets heavy/full enough while you are standing upright.  The reason why people often have to pee as soon as the get up from sleeping is because all the weight in your bladder will shift down as you get up and 'stretch' your bladder down.  In space there is no down so your bladder keeps filling and filling until it gets so full that it pushes your urethra closed and you can't pee. By the time you feel enough pressure to pee while in space you can't. At that point you would be forced to catheter yourself to relieve your bladder.  Medical intervention is required if you do not urinate regularly in space.	1642886171.0	htsj632	t3_sa535n	t1_htrys4g	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htsj632/

1b4st9cp	I believe that if the filter is just mechanical, then eventually it will clog at some level, requiring more pressure to make the air flow and increasing the chances of some leakage through the borders. Some of these masks may have a charcoal filter layer, which would be the absorbent element. In this cases, seems reasonable to assume that they'll also saturate at some point.  As u/kester76a said, after a heavy use one can even smell the environmental gases around. I've used FFP3 masks in dusty environments, and the experience is very similar.	1642886479.0	htsjxti	t3_sa9201	t3_sa9201	/r/askscience/comments/sa9201/do_n95_filters_have_a_breakthrough_level_or_do/htsjxti/
f6cr3	Normally, your bladder would push down on whatever is below your bladder, and the feeling of that force is what we would call "weightiness".  When in the water, the water is pushing up from below and supporting your body. The force your body feels between the water and the contents of your bladder is no longer the weight of your bladder, but the difference in pressure between the two (i.e. stretchiness and not weightiness)	1642886718.0	htskigz	t3_sa535n	t1_htsigli	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htskigz/

The rotational flow is converted to an axial acceleration which is converted into pressure by the narrowing effect of the stator. That's if I understand your question. It is the same property that creates lift in an airplane wing.

j5n7t	This is an interesting question: one I have spent close to a lifetime pondering.  I am a retired compressor research engineer.  This is a corollary question to the age old “why do pumps pump?”.   That is, why doesn’t the fluid stop and reverse course and go back out the front of the pump?   The aerodynamics of compressors are uber complicated and it is easier to outline the challenges/difficulties rather than the mechanism of compression.  That is, your question is well put.    The goal, of course, is (usually) to gain static (thermodynamic) pressure (in both blade rows).  Basically a ram/inertia effect comes into play (especially) in the first rotor (of course, it continues to play a roll in every blade row). To try to simplify things I focus on the key flow physics:   So the rotors impart KE to the fluid while also (and in concert with) diffusing the flow (to gain static pressure Ps).  The stator diffuses the flow (in a prescribed manner) in order to convert the KE into Ps.  It is a balancing act in order to gain Ps while also maintaining uniform flow that is fit to flow into the following rotor.  Flow separation in the stator decreases the flow area and so defeats the diffusion process, that is the flow speed increases (with reduced area) rather than decreases in that case.  I’ve uber simplified in order to describe the basic flow mechanics.	1642889006.0	htsq4eg	t3_saa1mb	t3_saa1mb	/r/askscience/comments/saa1mb/how_does_an_axial_compressor_create_more_pressure/htsq4eg/

The study comes to a most likely conclusion, given that there is currently no evidence of a increase in cognitive issues amongst the vaccinated, over the population in general before the pandemic.   The study does show an increased chance of cognitive issues for people that have had severe infection. Many other studies have shown a significant reduction in severe disease amongst the vaccinated.

11nzr2	Not a biologist, but I don't see any answers so I might as well see if I can invoke Cunningham's Law.  When you're talking species conservation, you're talking about trying to maintain biodiversity.  Mixing the breeds together would end up losing that diversity to a single mix.  So you're basically losing what you were trying to conserve.  The loss is through homogenization rather than straight up loss, but the diversity is still technically loss.  The scenario you're talking about, the gene mixing, would be something you would try as a last resort.  It would only be attempted if you were expecting to lose all populations, period.  And the mixing of genes would be the only thing that would allow you to save at least some of the population from extinction.

It would seem counter-productive to kill one's own offspring, and counter to theories like sociobiology. But it is possible that some animals can recognize kin and others cannot...and also interesting that in some species, females can recognize offspring while males cannot-presumably because of closer bonds.

The submarine still experiences the buoyancy forces of being submerged in water, but anything inside it is not affected by buoyancy and still feels gravity like normal.  Unless the water pressure is enough that it presses into the body and somehow presses against the bladder (through whatever tissue is between the skin and the bladder) and somehow supports it, I don't think this would have an effect on the bladder feeling gravity.	1642892715.0	htszbpp	t3_sa535n	t1_htskigz	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htszbpp/

But it doesn't matter what is supporting your body; there is still a force from gravity pushing the contents of your bladder down and a counter force from your body holding it up. It is this point between bladder contents and your body cavity where the forces interact that cause the bladder to stretch down; it doesn't matter how those forces are transmitted to there.	1642893005.0	htt00s4	t3_sa535n	t1_htskigz	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htt00s4/
ieudp	Shout-out to Osteoblasts, one of the coolest cells in the body, that require gravitational force to make bone. In essence, this is why walking on a treadmill or even centripetal acceleration induced "gravity" like in 2001: A Space Odyssey is helpful to prevent bone loss.  ScienceDirect link for more info: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/osteoblast](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/osteoblast)  Nice article: [https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2012.0286](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2012.0286) (doesn't appear to have a paywall on my view....)  Osteoblasts are the cells that grow new bone, and they hang out on little "beams" of bone called spicules. The coolest part? They have proteins that attach to the spicule of bone, and sense when the spicule stretches and strains when a load is applied.  These little proteins cross the cell membrane, so that when the spicule of bone stretches and compresses outside of the cell, that change is "sensed" within the cell and the cell reads this as a signal to make more bone.  Simply put, osteoblasts have a naturally-occurring strain-gauge that "reads" when a bone is loaded by gravity, stimulating the creation of new bone. Pretty wild.  &#x200B;  Strain gauge: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain\_gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_gauge)  Bone Structure: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone)	1642893255.0	htt0mgk	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htt0mgk/

157xv3	Someone else might be able to answer a little better than me, but one thing that seems to be very important in gene transcription is chromatin looping. DNA doesn't exist as a simple strand in the nucleus, and the way it's packaged around histones, how tightly the DNA is wrapped around histones, and even the physical location of the gene in 3D space in the nucleus can all impact gene expression (look up LMNA mutations in progeria).  At a more local level, DNA looping, at least at the promoter region of a gene, is required for efficient transcription of most protein-coding genes (maybe lncRNA genes, but I'm really not sure because I haven't read up on these as much). Regions important for looping for transcription can be upstream of the promotor or downstream, and these regions could be close by or thousands of base pairs away.  Some computer predictions here could point to whether this region could be important for that or not, but it'd have to be confirmed by wet lab work. I've tried those experiments, too. They suck for me. I fail at them. A lot. So, I researched other stuff lol.	1642895030.0	htt4wnl	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htt1wyy	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htt4wnl/

They’re still parasites but there exists a symbiotic relationship that some scientists feel have helped humans for millennia	1642895165.0	htt5870	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt5870/
tejio	I think as soon as it becomes beneficial, it becomes a symbiotic lifeform instead of a parasite. But any kind of labelling these things will always have huge grey areas. So I cannot see how it could not be both at the same time, like the situation you describe.  But symbiotic lifeforms are EVERYWHERE in nature. The mitochondria is believed to have been a completely different organism that somehow only got half eaten, and started making our cells their home instead. Our gut bacteria is another example of something we probably ate at some time, but stuck around. Our DNA is also riddled with fragments from viruses.	1642895175.0	htt593q	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt593q/

q6wni	You can be a little loose in your definition. Some parasites are far more detrimental than others. Also, many organisms evolve resistance to parasites. However, having resistance to an affliction has some sort of drawback (shortened lifespan, reduced fertility, etc). It sounds like you’re on the right track if you want to be biologically accurate.  If you want to give some sort of realistic natural history in your novel research Wolbachia, co-evolution of mutalism, or parasite-mutualist continuum.	1642895770.0	htt6rx6	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt6rx6/
ob2rk	I’m still really amazed that nearly none of our space station projects involve artificial gravity by means of rotation. The ideas have been around for 100 years now—even before we went to space and the closest we’ve gotten is depictions in sci-fi like The Martian, Halo, Elysium, Interstellar, 2001, Passengers, and (the iconic Disney Channel Original) Zenon.  I know it’s not exactly and easy task, especially with how large even a smaller station would have to be, but we constructed the ISS and that is just enormous. If we do go back to the moon this decade (which is seeming more and more unlikely lately), I really hope they redesign the lunar orbit station to have some artificial, rotational “gravity”.	1642895934.0	htt76gh	t3_sa535n	t1_htsse18	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htt76gh/

12oa4v	You could maybe create a parasite like a very aggressive tapeworm, that eats not only the food but also it's host from the inside out.  Hence why humans die before they even get malnourished.   But maybe some hosts have a dna-mutation, where they are uneatable or otherwise protected from said parasite (like some humans are immune to hiv/aids).  Hence why they don't die, but do get malnourished because of the parasite rating the food.  Side effect from this mutation is being prone to addiction. Or, said parasite gives off some chemical that induces this vulnerability. But here the malnourishement and addiction only come into effect because the host lives longer.	1642896293.0	htt81ls	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt81ls/

4bzsf	Yeah, that's basically the route I'm going. The vast majority of the afflicted die because the parasite eats them from inside out. A very small percentage of humans are just naturally resistant, and some of these survivors are also capable of taking advantage of the parasite, but it's not as if the parasite isn't still trying to kill them, they're just lucky that they're slightly different than other people and they can fight off the consumption better.

Out of hospital arrest is something like 10-12% to hospital discharge.  % are little higher for younger patients and abysmal for older patients.  My numbers are a little old and might be better now. It has been a while I have not checked the numbers, but the AHA (american heart association) publishes a lot on the subject if you are curious. Nonetheless, % of survival AND no deficits after cardiac arrest remains quite low.  Sadly, for the majority of cases, expected outcome after cardiac arrest, even in optimal conditions, is death or becoming functionally diminished in some way.	1642897058.0	htt9wa8	t3_s87303	t3_s87303	/r/askscience/comments/s87303/what_percentage_of_patients_who_survive_due_to/htt9wa8/

ar1ws1wp	On a somewhat simplified level, many of the symptoms attributed to covid infection is actually due to the immune system reacting to the virus. Fever, chills, inflammation, cough, etc are all due to the immune response, not necessarily the virus itself. Because of that, I think it would be reasonable to assume a person continually exposed to the virus might continue to have symptoms throughout the exposure even if they do not continue to have a high viral load on testing. Continual exposure could prevent the immune response from winding down, but that being said, it should still effectively fight off the virus just like someone who had an exposure and is then immune for a period of time.	1642900002.0	httgyvw	t3_sacd7q	t3_sacd7q	/r/askscience/comments/sacd7q/after_the_human_immune_system_is_already/httgyvw/

akladb6g	I’m sorry, but my understanding of gravity might be all wrong, but I thought that the moon is traveling in a straight line—observing newton’s first law that an object in motion will remain in motion unless a force acts on it.  Then, Einstein showed that space-time is curved.  This means the moon is following a straight line path through a warped space-time.  Please correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t centripetal force require acceleration?

And also, the post states that such an experiment was done and that the dog siblings didn't seem to recognize each other.  Either way, the thing that's impossible to tell is if dogs understand family relations. We can tell if a dog recognizes another dog, but we cannot know if a dog smells his brother and thinks "that is my brother" or if they think "that is that one member of the family."	1642901791.0	httl2th	t3_sa5r2f	t1_httixfe	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httl2th/
91287k5f	I watched a video about this a while ago, and it made the point that while it would be possible to design a space station to spin for rotational gravity, one of the main things we actually use space stations for at this stage of our development is to do experiments in zero gravity. That's the primary function of many / most of the ISS modules. So imposing artifical gravity would just make a space station less funtionally useful, at the present time.	1642902138.0	httlwou	t3_sa535n	t1_htt76gh	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/httlwou/
62mtr	I think the bigger issue is the logistics of it all.  For one there is having to dock with something that is rotating. Basically you need part of the station to not rotate but then how do you get between the two? Another is that rotation produces acceleration with a gradient and coreolis forces which is not ideal unless the thing is very large.   None of that is impossible but just more complex than it is worth for any current stations.	1642902283.0	httm9gb	t3_sa535n	t1_httcgjm	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/httm9gb/

27g3rg69	There are a potential variety of reasons, especially when talking groups as diverse as Siberian vs Sumatran tigers. However, an important consideration with distant subspecies is the less well known [outbreeding depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreeding_depression).  Folks generally know the negatives of inbreeding, but it comes down to reduced fitness on offspring. The same can happen with very unrelated groups that can biologically breed, but their intermediate (the offspring) is less successful than either “extreme” (the original subspecies). Think of it as if you have related subspecies that are pretty close, but have specific traits to fit different niches. Let’s go with bird beaks as a nice visual example.  Say you have two close subspecies of birds, but they’ve adapted to catching bugs and eating seeds respectively. Bug-eater has a more pointer, narrowed beak. Seed-eater adapted a stronger, hooked beak to break the shells. Crossing them gets you an intermediate beak design that’s narrow, a little hooked, and reasonably strong. Unfortunately, this is a kinda crappy design for either food source. Like using a wonky spear for getting bugs, and less capable at breaking open seed shells. Suddenly, crossing subspecies has resulted in adding numbers that are WORSE at surviving in either location. An extreme example, but hopefully the point makes sense.  For this reason, crossing subspecies populations from different places has to be considered very carefully, in case mixing populations could exacerbate the problems even further.	1642904254.0	httqtp6	t3_saa5nh	t3_saa5nh	/r/askscience/comments/saa5nh/why_is_it_important_to_conserve_independent/httqtp6/

8t0pzwe	Depends on how high this continuous amount of virus is. Generally, the exposure amount you see in daily life is very small compared to the viral load in the body after the infection takes hold. Continual exposure to such levels of virus wouldn’t change much - once the immune system is activated and doing a good enough job that it can clear the viral in your body, it can easily deal with typical low-level exposure. You wouldn’t even see a big increase in symptoms, if at all.  But if you’re pumping in huge swathes of virus, filling the air with more virus than ever before seen, then you can overwhelm the immune system and kill the person, or keep them constantly infected/reinfected. The amount required for this would be pretty much impossible to see in normal environments.	1642905531.0	htttsla	t3_sacd7q	t3_sacd7q	/r/askscience/comments/sacd7q/after_the_human_immune_system_is_already/htttsla/
gekpw	A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that when the maximal Coriolis force on a Boeing 747 is on the order of [10 kiloNewtons](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*%28600+mph%29*%282*pi%2Fday%29*%28333400+kg%29). That's less than [1% of its weight](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*%28600+mph%29*%282*pi%2Fday%29%2F%289.8+m%2Fs%5E2%29), and on the order of [1% of its total thrust](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*%28600+mph%29*%282*pi%2Fday%29*%28333400+kg%29%2F%281000+kN%29).  So it's a very small effect, and easy to correct for if necessary.  >If the earth is in the rotating frame and an airplane is experiencing Coriolis effect doesn't that mean the plane is in the inertial reference frame as depicted in thisanimation  The plane isn't "in" one frame or the other. A reference frame is just a choice of coordinates in which to describe your system. You can study the motion of the plane in whatever frame you want. However since your take-off and landing are both happening at points fixed to the surface of the Earth, a frame fixed with respect to the surface of the Earth is a very convenient one. Unfortunately, since the Earth is rotating, that frame is non-inertial. And so in this frame there is generally a Coriolis force acting on the plane, and it needs to be taken into account to get the motion right. But as shown above, it's a small effect compared to the other forces in the system.	1642905963.0	httus7y	t3_sadtha	t3_sadtha	/r/askscience/comments/sadtha/how_does_coriolis_effect_change_the_trajectory_of/httus7y/
dq21w	Just an aside, but even if a dog truly did grasp the concept of kinship, that doesn’t mean it’s behaviour would change at all. A male dog will recognise his mother by scent but still try to mate with her. He no doubt remembers the role she played in his life, but the idea that he shouldn’t mate with her isn’t hardwired into his head, and I think that that is one of the key factors in how humans interact with their relatives.   Whether it be evolutionary or socially learned, we are (mostly) repulsed by the idea of mating with our close relatives. That completely changes the social dynamic between, say, two siblings. But if that repulsion wasn’t there, a sister would be a potential mate for a brother, and would be treated much like any other female. As dogs lack that repulsion to any significant degree, kinship is irrelevant.  Basically, it is our aversion to mating with relatives that defines kinship in humans.	1642906390.0	httvr0t	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httvr0t/

clz9x6pv	All depends on the pathogen. Each pathogen has special characteristics that allow it to infect certain cells in particular areas of the body. For example, EBV requires a receptor called CD21 to get into the cell and this receptor is only on B cells so it can only infect those cells. As for the treatments (antibiotics, antivirals for example) these are designed to harm things crucial to the pathogen but not (side effects not included) to the human. So the medicines may be circulating throughout the body but only impact where there is pathogen.

dq21w	I’d imagine, given wolves’ life cycles, that there isn’t a particularly strong evolved avoidance of incest.   Wolves live in family groups of a father, mother, and juveniles. Offspring leave the pack around when they reach sexual maturity, meaning that there isn’t a huge amount of opportunity for incest to occur. They’ve already separated by the time they would be able to breed.

I wonder what the minimum size/diameter would be to make it not so horrible to change “altitude” within the station. I’m sure there’s been some studies on this, but I’m still willing to bet it’s within the bounds of size that we’re able to build (ie it probably doesn’t have to be a kilometer wide thing.

dq21w	Not animals as a whole. It’s very rare that you can claim a behaviour is shared by all animals. Human incest aversion might go deeper than culture, that doesn’t mean that other animals share the same aversions.   Smell being a factor in human incest aversion is only a hypothesis, anyway, and studies into it have concluded that no innate aversion to the smell of people you have been raised with is strong enough to prevent mating alone.

q81tq	Infrared, visible light and UV tend to get absorbed easily by materials because that's the range where atoms and molecules have many available transitions, or where the light has enough energy to kick out individual electrons (towards the high energy range of UV). Outside of that range absorption tends to be weaker.  At typical temperatures on Earth blackbody radiation is almost exclusively infrared, that's the reason it is often associated with heat.	1642910889.0	htu5w6a	t3_sa9uvg	t1_httey4s	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htu5w6a/

ob2rk	You don’t have to have it rotating at first. Something more stationary like the ISS could exist beforehand while construction is ongoing. That isn’t the logistical problem like you and u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt seem to think. The biggest problems would still be the sheer weight and volume of parts need to put up there before it could be fully functional, including solar energy that would be needed for the whole thing.  We’ve seen how long it took to create the ongoing ISS project, so I believe that would be the biggest logistical part (not the spinning itself). But with enough international cooperation, or even just investment from the individual US NASA, EU ESA, Japanese JAXA, Russian Roscosmos, or Chinese CNSA, a space station like this could easily be constructed within a decade.  The technology exists and wouldn’t be that hard. We’ve done more difficult projects during the early days of space travel, and even with modern advancements (eg SpaceX’s landing launch vehicles). It’s really just a matter of investment into making it happen.	1642914736.0	htue8w9	t3_sa535n	t1_httm9gb	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htue8w9/

675cyubt	> Basically you need part of the station to not rotate but then how do you get between the two?  Simple.  Think about a lint brush.  The handle is an interface area. One end, the area furthest from the sticky part, is completely stationary - this is the docking area. The other end of the handle, connected to the space station, is rotating.  The rotating part has a platform that comes around once per rotation. From the stationary part, you can step out into the area and just wait for the platform to arrive. Or, you could push a cart into the space and wait for the platform to come around to meet it.  All of this is possible because the platform isn't moving very fast at all. You have plenty of time to step into the area, and you engage with the platform with a gentle *thump*. The gravity simulation of the rotating platform is very mild.  Once you're on the rotating platform, you are rotating with the entire rest of the station. You can then pass through an airlock and ascend, radially, into the body of the station that surrounds the tube - basically the sticky-tape part of the lint brush. The entire space station is a thick tube that surrounds the lint brush. And as you ascend into the space station, your radial velocity increases linearly, as does the gravity effect. By the time you reach the space station proper on the outer ring, the radial velocity approximates Earth.  The downside is: no windows. Looking out radially, you'd see space continuously circling past you while you feel stationary. Looking out laterally (parallel to the lint brush), you'd see space constantly spinning. Either way, vertigo is rough.	1642914881.0	htuek9t	t3_sa535n	t1_httm9gb	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htuek9t/

gekpw	The forces involved are weight (W), buoyancy (B), and drag (D).  Applying Newton’s second law, we find that W + D = B, or D = B - W.  The buoyant force is ρ*_f_*gV, where ρ*_f_* is the density of the fluid. The weight is ρgV, where ρ is the density of the object. And the drag is some function of the velocity; we can assume linear drag for low Reynolds number flows, so D = bv.  So the terminal velocity is calculated at steady state, when these forces are all balanced, and the result is v*_t_* = (ρ*_f_* - ρ)gV/b.  So it increases with the density difference, and decreases with the linear drag coefficient of the object.	1642925241.0	htuvapv	t3_samslf	t3_samslf	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htuvapv/

popg1	I clearly remember the first time I really noticed a dog calculating. She was in the other side of a wire fence that had square holes in it. She wanted back in but instead of jumping over or going back to the gate,  she just stopped, looked at the hole for a few seconds, then perfectly jumped through it. I'm positive she was deciding if she would fit and getting the jump just right.  Then her great grandson just tried to jump on my bed today, hit it with his chest and bounced into a wall. So clearly not all dogs do that much thinking.	1642929197.0	htv0h35	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htss93i	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htv0h35/
65gfe8uh	I think you might be the one cracking the egg so to speak.  I understand what you're writing. I think your answer is exactly where I am standing right now knowledge-wise. The question is: How does the reduction in flow area not sabotage the diffusors (rotor blades and vanes)? There can either a diffusion OR a constriction, but seeing schematics, it's always a constant flow area reduction if you look at the whole compressor and a diffusion on the blade- or vane level. It fells like I almost got it.	1642929950.0	htv1fcw	t3_saa1mb	t1_htsq4eg	/r/askscience/comments/saa1mb/how_does_an_axial_compressor_create_more_pressure/htv1fcw/

sd07u	Yes, I quite agree. Several evolutionary theorists argue that "kin recognition" is a misnomer, because animals (and plants) presumably recognise familiarity, or a nice smell, or an unsexy smell, but not the actual kin relationship.	1642931342.0	htv36ln	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htuauc2	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htv36ln/

I recognise that I only referred to anecdotal experience in my post, but there are studies that corroborate my impressions. Riad et al. (2021) in "Prevalence of COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects among Healthcare Workers in the Czech Republic" write that 37.1% of participants experienced muscle pain and 33.9% got chills.

Unlike gravity that just depends on the object's mass and position, the Coriolis force also depends on the object's velocity.

16x40v	well, we were taught in the first year of med, that fluoride and hydroxide ions have to be in balance in an apatite crystal for the tooth to be functional. The actual crystal that the tooth is formed from isn't a pure hydroxyapatite, it's a mix of fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite isn't very hard, it's somewhat softer, but it's not brittle, on the other hand fluorapatite is very hard but also very brittle, so the mix of them could be compared to steel - best qualities of both. So which one you need depends on what your body gets exposed to more - if you live in an area where water has a lot of fluoride salts in it - extra fluoride isn't gonna do you any good, you need hydroxyapatite; if however you live in an area where water has very little fluoride in it, you're gonna need some fluoride in your dental products to keep the balance.  But i learnt this quite a long time ago, so i'd recommend reading something from a better source than me 😅	1642940342.0	htveylh	t3_sa9e7b	t3_sa9e7b	/r/askscience/comments/sa9e7b/does_hydroxyapatite_toothpaste_offer_any_sort_of/htveylh/

16x40v	well to be very specific, it's because it doesn't just trigger the cone and rod cells, but also a whole different subset of light sensitive cells in the eyes called the i trinsically photosensitive retinal ganglionic cells. They have a different pigment than other cells, that is called melanopsin, and it mainly reacts to blue light. From there imthe information about illumination goes via the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where via multiple different connections and pathways it increases the cortisol levels and decreases melatonin levels. I won't go in more, since the reasons as to why have been explained by the other commenters, but the chemical reason is this	1642941305.0	htvgc60	t3_s8bnij	t3_s8bnij	/r/askscience/comments/s8bnij/why_does_blue_light_mess_up_your_sleep/htvgc60/
f49bc9a8	A slightly more detailed explanation...We feel the urge to urinate because of the increase in pressure in the urinary bladder. Due to gravity the pressure in more at the bottom, triggering the urge much before the bladder is completely full. In micro-gravity the same amount of pressure at the bottom of the bladder is felt much later. So astronauts consciously make trips to the toilet after every few hours, without feeling the urge.  Maintaining their health is a primary task they have when in space, so they can’t ignore it for other tasks. More importantly, when the bladder is completely full, you lose control over urinating and may not be able to reach the toilet. It happened with Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut in space. His flight was short but he had to wait for 5 hours after wearing his spacesuit and had to urinate in the space suit. The urine in the spacesuit short-circuited some equipment.	1642941442.0	htvgj66	t3_sa535n	t1_htusxtb	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htvgj66/

However another extremely important factor here is that the gills need some water for the oxygen to dissolve into the blood. The same is true for our lungs, a worm's skin and such, in order for the oxygen to be actually able to pass through the membranes, it needs to be dissolved, that's why worms also die when they dry out, and the same would happen to us if we somehow removed all the water from our surfactant	1642941711.0	htvgx5v	t3_s78u06	t1_htdlcis	/r/askscience/comments/s78u06/why_are_fish_unable_to_breathe_oxygen_from_air/htvgx5v/

Call it 2m per second² it'd take 140 seconds to reach the surface and give you a speed around 750km/h.  Now, if you assumed 9.9ms² over the same distance you could reach 1675km/h.

Different researchers will define TADs in different ways, and there is a credible argument that most of what is being looked at is simply a coorelation of expression.  The way we measure TADs is with a technique called [Hi-C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149993/). We had other techniques too look at interactions before, but HiC gave us enough data to actually start looking for trends. Hi-C is just gluing all the DNA together, fragmenting it with enzymes, and then reattaching all the ends of DNA back together again. Then we sequence the library we just made and graph where the two halves are on the chromosome. The vast majority of the reads we get out are just next to each other in a linear sense, but there are some regions that show up ligated together that are far apart, and this has to happen more than you would expect randomly. So you are looking at a somewhat fuzzy probabilistic model of 3D genome architecture.  A lot of what we see are densely packed heterochromatin, or permanently inactive DNA. These show up next to each other, but there isnt really a clear specific distal interaction. Instead it is just all clumped together, so things that are far apart show up, but there is no real specificity to it. This is often things like telomeres, centromeres, and long regions of transposable elements. These evolve very quick (there is no real selective pressure on TEs, and centromere evolution is a it of a mystery), so they will be different between humans and pretty much anything. Do these count as TADs? Some people say no, some people say yes.  There are more well studied interactions like with [CTCF](https://www.nature.com/articles/emm201533#:~:text=CCCTC%2Dbinding%20factor%20(CTCF),communication%20between%20enhancers%20and%20promoters.), which binds to a known sequence in two locations and creates a loop. This has an impact on gene expression and is a pretty specific interaction between just two sets of DNA. Are we limiting TADs to just stuff like this?  [Phase seperation](https://www.nature.com/collections/adgjaibdae/) occurs when you have groups of proteins that end up in the same location and change the physical properties of the nucleus in a very local area. This is more of a clump like with heterochromatin, but a little more specific in the regions of DNA that end up inside of it. Do these count or are they too nonspecific and wishy washy?  We can spot specific interactions of transcription factors interacting with gene promoters. This is sort of a TAD, but it is also something we have known about for ages and is just specific (sometimes transient) protein protein interactions. Do we set some sort of cutoff when we see it enough statistically to call it a TAD? What if the statistics are just reflective of the cell types it is happening in instead of the actual strength of the relationship.  My point is that if you ask two different people you will get two different answers. You actually have to look at the methodology of the original paper, which is difficult if you are outside of the field. Cis-regulatory elements evolve and change faster than protein-coding genes (most of the time), and their physical location relative to a gene can change even faster then that. How this all ties into 3D genome architecture, and the extent to which it has an impact on expression, is still a mystery.	1642943003.0	htvivky	t3_s9xpdb	t3_s9xpdb	/r/askscience/comments/s9xpdb/does_topologically_associating_domain/htvivky/

u2et838	You've gotten good answers to some of the others, but I don't think anyone addressed this one so I'll add an answer to it:  > * Infrared cameras see "heat" at a distance obviously, is that different from how our skin detects heat/IR?  There are different types of infrared cameras that use different types of sensor elements.  Some, like skin, respond to the fact that the infrared warms an element of the detector, and others use semiconductors to detect infrared photons more directly.    But the more important difference affecting what you can do with it and how you can figure out what's going on at a distance is that there is a lens that focuses an image of the infrared emissions of different objects onto the detector, which is really an array of detector elements.  This means that you can tell specifically where the infrared is coming from, whereas if your skin feels warm from some infrared you don't know much detail about where that is coming from other than the crude difference between say the front of your hand feeling warm in the back of your hand feeling cold.	1642945039.0	htvmb9w	t3_sa9uvg	t3_sa9uvg	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htvmb9w/

The black and green night vision cameras with good resolution work on the same principle as modern digital cameras I guess? My understanding is that glass is not necessarily good at focusing infrared, is some other material used for a lens?	1642945313.0	htvmt1y	t3_sa9uvg	t1_htvmb9w	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htvmt1y/

u2et838	I've never seen the movie Predator so I can't help there, but I can answer about lens materials.  For thermal imaging, the wavelengths of IR involved are typically  near 10-14 microns.  That is in the range of about 3 microns to 20 microns, often called far infrared, or FIR.  Glass cuts off around 3 microns—it passes near infrared just fine, but almost no far infrared.  So for thermal imaging cameras, you do need special lens materials.  They are typically germanium, and that's one of the reasons that they are expensive.  But the infrared that is part of the solar spectrum is almost entirely in the near infrared range, from the edge of the visible spectrum at about 0.75 microns to about 3 microns.  That range goes through glass just fine, which is part of how a room can be warmed the sun through a window on a sunny day.	1642946059.0	htvo6qm	t3_sa9uvg	t1_htvmt1y	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htvo6qm/

sd07u	I'm confident they would all become part of the pack, especially if this was done young. After all, many pet owners have unrelated dogs who are well bonded.   Farmers often exploit "olfactory imprinting" to foster lambs to unrelated mothers. Once the mothers have licked the new lambs clean, they treat them just like their own young. I predict the dogs would be similar. The one difference might be less inbreeding aversion to the foster sibling if that is based on MHC olfactory cues.	1642947938.0	htvrt09	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htvp8vo	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvrt09/

Also, the type of material or object would matter because of the reduction in pressure. It would expand and that could non-negligibly impact drag.  You also make a good point with the Reynolds comment on whether it would shift from laminar to turbulent flow around the object during ascent. That could shift things as well and would be object roughness/shape dependent.	1642947984.0	htvrw8p	t3_samslf	t1_htuvapv	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htvrw8p/

ee0f4	I'll start by clarifying that my answer is focused on mountain ranges built primarily of [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust), i.e., collisional mountain rainges, or orogenies, that form from the collision of the continental portions of two plates, like the Himalaya formed from the collision of India and Eurasia OR what we would call Cordilleran (or Andean) orogenies that form on the continental portion of a plate, but are related to [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) of [oceanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust) crust and lithosphere beneath that continental edge, typified by the modern Andes. This is sort of important to clarify as things that could be classified as mountain ranges in the topographic sense (e.g., the [mid-ocean ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge)), or thickened plateaus (e.g., [oceanic plateaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_plateau)) that are primarily or exclusively constructed of oceanic crust/lithosphere will have different dynamics because of the fundamental density constrast between continental and oceanic crust (i.e., continental crust does not subduct easily, whereas oceanic crust does).  With that clarification out the way, the most basic answer is that certainly orogenic systems and their topographic expressions (i.e., mountain ranges) do not last forever. There are plenty of examples of ancient mountain ranges in various stages of decay. Classic examples are the [Appalachians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains) in eastern North America or the [Caledonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Caledonides) in Scandinavia and the British Isles (though of note, the Appalachians have experienced a "topographic rejuvenation", i.e., additional processes after orogeny have increased the relief of the range, e.g., [Pazzaglia & Brandon, 1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2117.1996.00274.x)). Both of these represent the remnants of formerly much larger and higher mountain ranges. At extreme examples, we can consider things like the [Grenville Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenville_orogeny), which do not really exist as any real topographic feature (at least outside of portions that are involved in later orogenies), but we know existed from the various fingerprints left in the geologic record that define the existence of an extremely large mountain range ~1 billion years ago.  In terms of the direct influence of plate tectonics on "destroying" mountain ranges, the primary role are the variety of processes that lead to the eventual cessation of the convergence, which is the ultimate primary driver and maintainer or orogenic topography. The driver for this convergence within (and by proxy, the growth of) most mountain ranges, at least initially, is the negative buoyancy of the subducted slab of oceanic lithosphere. This can be visualized simply with a diagram of the [Wilson Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Cycle), which highlights that collisional mountain ranges represent the closure of a former ocean basin, and it is this force of the still attached, subducted "tongue" of oceanic lithosphere, i.e., the [slab pull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_pull) force, which drives the continued convergence and crustal thickening that builds a mountain range, and thus processes like slab detachment, whereby the subducted slab rips off and sinks into the mantle (e.g., [Davies & von Blanckenburg, 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0012821X9400237S)), which reduces this slab pull force can lead to the slowing and eventual cessation of convergence and orogenic growth (e.g., [Capitanio & Replumaz, 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ggge.20171)). Though, it is worth noting, there are a variety of mechanisms that may contribute to the slowing and eventual cessation of convergence besides reduction of the slab pull force, e.g., increased buoyancy from portions of continental crust entering the subduction zone/channel (e.g., [Capitanio et al., 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo725)), increased graviational potential from the mountain range itself (e.g., [Molnar & Lyon-Caen, 1988](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/356/chapter/3796610/Some-simple-physical-aspects-of-the-support), [Austermann & Iaffaldano, 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tect.20027)), or increased viscous resistance from the mantle (e.g., [Clark, 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10848)).  Once the forces driving convergence and continued "accretionary flux" (in the sense of [Willet et al., 1993](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/21/4/371/205893/Mechanical-model-for-the-tectonics-of-doubly) or [Willett et al., 2001](http://geology.yale.edu/~ajs/2001/Apr_May/qn10t100455.pdf)) into the orogen ceases, the primary mechanism "destroying" mountain ranges is erosion, not plate tectonics, and thus the controls of the "post-orogenic" phase become more a question of the details of the erosional mechanisms at play (e.g., [Baldwin et al., 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001JB000550), [Jansen, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X06001243), [Tucker & van der Beek, 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2117.2012.00559.x), [Robl et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825216304421)). As described in many of those papers, the timescales for orogenic decay is relatively long. This represents the contribution of a few different things. One important one is [isostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy). When a mountain range is being built through crustal thickening, it forms both a large topographic expression, but also essentially a "mountain in the mantle", i.e., a thick crustal root which "compensates" for the topography of the range. As the topography is reduced by erosion and mass flux (i.e., transport by rivers away from the orogen), this induces an isostatic response whereby some of that elevation that is lost, is recovered by rebound. A way to visualize this would be having a block floating in water. If you started stacking some coins on that block, the block would sink a bit so the height of the stack of coins above the water level would be a little less than if the block did not sink. If you start to remove coins one by one, the block (and the remaining stack of coins on top) will gain a little height back because of the reduction in mass, so even though you've reduced the height of the stack of the coins by 1 coins thickness, the elevation is reduced by less than that because of this isostatic response. The same happens during erosion of a decaying orogen, each increment of erosion generates additional rock uplift (at least until the crustal root is removed by this, or other processes). Also related is that generally the erosion rate is proportional to slope. High slopes equals high erosion rate. High slopes can be maintained when you have equally fast rates of rock uplift (during the orogenic phase), but as this slows, the fast erosion rate reduces the slope, which in turn reduces the erosion rate. This means that the rate at which each next increment of slightly less steep topography is eroded is slower than the last increment, whereby you expect this gradually slowing rate of erosion and the persistence of some modest topography for a while. The linked papers above go into a lot more nuance on the details of the river erosion mechanism and how these might also be quite important, but for our purposes, isostasy and declining erosion rates coupled to declining slopes can get us most of the way to a satisfying explanation.  **In short,** mountain ranges go through a sort of life cycle of birth, growth, steady-state, and eventual decay. Plate tectonic processes are important for the growth and the transition into the decay processes, basically various tectonic or geodynamic processes will eventually stop the convergence that drives the growth/maintenance of the mountain range, but the final "death blow" for mountain ranges in terms of their removal comes at the hands of erosion, not plate tectonics.	1642949507.0	htvv34c	t3_saqg8g	t3_saqg8g	/r/askscience/comments/saqg8g/throughout_earths_history_has_the_movement_of/htvv34c/

I still never understood the chairs and liquid they used for high g stuff, or how it was injected (presumably) into humans body/bloodstream. I only guessed it somehow kept blood from draining from vitals while also not circulating itself. I would assume a gravity/a pressure suit on steroids like a jet fighter pilot wears would make more sense.	1642952042.0	htw0vgm	t3_sa535n	t1_htu9q5a	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htw0vgm/

uljg3	3 thoughts:  1. The additional weight of the pressure vessel would counter all the advantage of the minor density difference between water and hydrogen.  Minor in that water is only 1gm/cc heavier than a vacuum, but steel is like 7.8gm/cc.  And then you'd have to shed all that extra momentum, once you were out of the water by dumping the dead steel mass that was no longer buoyant.  2. Didn't Polaris missiles used to release a flood of bubbles to reduce drag on missile launch, just because water was too slow?  3. If you could get the pressure vessel that strong, why not fill the volume with propellant gases and light them off?  A thought experiment... Take the lowest conceivable drag shape( a bullet, a missile, or a bullet train, or a Prius.). Fill a balloon with that shape with hydrogen/ helium, and release it from the bottom of your swimming pool.  It probably can't even gather enough energy to get it's whole mass above water.  Think of the amazing classic videos of the Los Angeles class subs doing an emergency blow, from hundreds of feet of depth, , maybe 70% of the ship is above water.   Think of the drag on a bullet that hits water.  It goes from Mach speed and  stops in feet, but goes miles in air.   Another terrible experiment that no one should run.  Get a helium tank from party city for blowing up balloons.  Tie it to an engine block. With thin wire which will break at maybe a few hundred lbs of force.  Throw it over board. When the buoyancy of the helium tank exceeds the breaking strain of the copper wire, it will surface quickly without the engine block.   Move boat to safe distance and see if helium tank even clears the surface.   Sorry, not a very constructive response, my math brain is lazy today.	1642953612.0	htw4rq9	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htw4rq9/
u2yyo	Exactly. You could still get some version of this if you had to quickly move heavy things (still takes force to accelerate any mass), but it's a question of gravity acting *on objects* that then act on your body, rather than gravity affecting your body more directly like it does for the circulatory issues and bone density issues that arise	1642953936.0	htw5l0n	t3_sa535n	t1_htw3ri7	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htw5l0n/

5u65jiar	The destruction of mountain ranges is unusually caused by erosion, after the mountain building event has stopped, as described by u/CrustalTrudger.  Most subduction zones involve an oceanic plate going under a continental plate, because oceanic plates are thinner and denser. Occasionally, a continental plate will subduct under another continental plate. In this case, you could have the subduction of a mountain range.  India is currently subducting under the Eurasian plate. The ghats (the mountains in southern India) will most likely subduct beneath Tibet sometime in the next 50-100 million years.	1642954495.0	htw6yrd	t3_saqg8g	t3_saqg8g	/r/askscience/comments/saqg8g/throughout_earths_history_has_the_movement_of/htw6yrd/

ee0f4	>In this case, you could have the subduction of a mountain range.  >India is currently subducting under the Eurasian plate. The ghats (the mountains in southern India) will most likely subduct beneath Tibet sometime in the next 50-100 million years.  This expectation is not really born out in any literature. At the most basic level, thickened sections of continental crust would almost certainly not be completely underthrust or subducted, but rather would more likely be [accreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_%28geology%29) in some form (as this fundamentally is what needs to happen to allow for terrane accretion, of which there is abundance geologic evidence). More specifically, the expectation of what happens when elevated and thickened continental crust enters into the frontal part of an orogenic system is not well defined (e.g., [Forte et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014TC003651)). The most direct example is the ongoing collision of the Pamir and Tien Shan (e.g., [Burtmann, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195100000226), [Sobel et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X12006954), [Zubovich et al., 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015TC004055)), but suffice to say, the exact dynamics are complicated, but complete subduction of a mountain range is not an outcome described in any source of which I'm aware.	1642955405.0	htw99hq	t3_saqg8g	t1_htw6yrd	/r/askscience/comments/saqg8g/throughout_earths_history_has_the_movement_of/htw99hq/

67304jgk	Muscles actually do the opposite with age as they’re less able to recover from minor injuries and the neurons that control them die. Paralyzing the facial muscles only prevents the muscles from contracting and folding the skin. When you’re younger, the skin doesn’t “crease” this way due to its elasticity. With age that is lost.	1642957271.0	htwe3d0	t3_sawt39	t3_sawt39	/r/askscience/comments/sawt39/why_do_muscles_become_hyperactive_with_age/htwe3d0/

3a146	From Wikipedia:  Technical grade V2O5 is produced as a black powder used for the production of vanadium metal and ferrovanadium.[8] A vanadium ore or vanadium-rich residue is treated with sodium carbonate and an ammonium salt to produce sodium metavanadate, NaVO3. This material is then acidified to pH 2–3 using H2SO4 to yield a precipitate of "red cake" (see above). The red cake is then melted at 690 °C to produce the crude V2O5.	1642958076.0	htwg6rh	t3_savi06	t3_savi06	/r/askscience/comments/savi06/how_is_vanadium_pentoxide_produced/htwg6rh/

oq1e	Great answer.  I have a follow-up question - imagine that you are exposed to the virus and the antibodies bond and you have sterilizing immunity.     Would this exposure result in an *increase* in the production of antibodies in your body compared to before, even if the rest of the immune system doesn't have to get involved?  In other words, could a non-infectious, sterilizing exposure still stimulate the volume of antibodies circulating compared before being exposed, thereby increasing protection through increased antibody volume?	1642956083.0	htwb09y	t3_pcnjor	t1_hal606c	/r/askscience/comments/pcnjor/does_exposure_to_covid19_after_vaccination_extend/htwb09y/
dl74xa6t	That's amazing. I worked in the field for awhile and pretty much any doctor I've worked with claimed that this was due to "hyperactive muscles". I always had a hunch that many plastic surgeons largely had no idea what they were on about, or else weren't being straight about it, but this is a new level. So essentially, say, the 11s are the product of skin not bouncing back from an earlier frown?   Then there's an interesting follow-up: why does botox make them disappear \_instantly\_ if they are due to skin that is still creased from an earlier movement, as opposed to skin that is being creased from muscle activity taking place at the time of injection?	1642959385.0	htwjlx9	t3_sawt39	t1_htwgozi	/r/askscience/comments/sawt39/why_do_muscles_become_hyperactive_with_age/htwjlx9/
6qtf6	It means that after traveling a very short distance in that dimension, you arrive back where you started. Remember that dimensions are just any independent parameters we can use to describe something; they don't have to look like XYZ euclidean space.  It's analogous to rotation; you can be at 3 locations in space, plus some degrees of rotation around an axis. Once you rotate around 360 deg, you wind up back at the same state you started in. That parameter of how far you've rotated is a dimension. (The extra dimensions in string theory aren't actually rotations, I think, but they work similarly.)	1642959748.0	htwkkyx	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwkkyx/
jg2xa	The usual analogy is describing an ant on a string. From our perspective, it's a one dimensional system - the ant can go left or right. But to the ant, that string is a great cable and it can go around and around in either direction as well as left and right. Or another way is to think of videogames like asteroids or star control (dating myself) where when you go out the left you come in on the right and vice versa. No imagine your monitor getting more and more narrow - as you shrink the width, eventually "left side" and "right side" become effectively one. It's only when you get down to the one pixel level does left/right position become meaningful.

As you get closer, you see that the rope actually has thickness, and something small enough, like an ant, is not only in a position *along* the rope's length, but also in a position *around* the rope's circumference.  Up close, the rope has an additional dimension that is "curled up" around it, one that is not apparent from further away.	1642960071.0	htwlfhr	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwlfhr/

n27na	Take a paper, place it on a table, the paper is now representing a bounded 2D space. You can consider the extension of the directions of the paper if you wan to imagine the open infinite 2D space. Take the paper and roll it into a cylinder, one dimension is now "curled up", it is finite and does not have an edge.  This is the first step in making an analogue to e.g. string theory extra dimensions. The first problem is that you can still see two dimensions, one is infinite (along the length of the cylinder), and once is finite going around the cylinder. In physics if we are considering extra dimensions they must also be small. So what does that mean? For the paper that would mean you keep on rolling it tighter and tighter together, shrinking the circle of the cylinder -- beyond what is physically possible with a paper -- until it just looks like a line. At this point it is also "small".	1642960373.0	htwm7y7	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwm7y7/

htfb8	Not orbit, the best you could do is reach escape velocity but thats not quite the same. The thing about orbits is all the points repeat and they don't change until something acts on one of the objects.   So if we look at the points on the theoretical orbit we are trying to achieve we notice a problem right away. Some of our points are the ones starting at the sea bed and leading out of it. No matter what the rest of the orbit looks like, eventually part of it would need to cycle back to those undersea points, which can't happen without it crashing through the earth.	1642960517.0	htwmli7	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htwmli7/

You simply lose your ability to digest it once your body stops producing the enzyme lactase, and it ends up in your large intestine where your gut bacteria digest and ferment it. It’s the bacterial activity byproducts that causes discomfort.  You will not die from it, just feel uncomfortable. You can either buy lactose-free dairy products (Lactase milk is available), stick with naturally low-lactose dairy (yogurt and hard cheeses), or simply take lactase supplement pills whenever you eat dairy.	1642960770.0	htwn9ae	t3_saoemg	t3_saoemg	/r/askscience/comments/saoemg/what_are_the_long_term_effects_of_a_lactose/htwn9ae/

gekpw	Take a circuit that's just an AC power source connected to a resistive load.  The power source provides a voltage V(t) = V*_0_*cos(ωt), which is entirely dropped across an equivalent resistor of resistance R.  The current through the resistor is then I(t) = V(t)/R = V*_0_*cos(ωt)/R.  The instantaneous power dissipated in the resistor is P(t) = V(t)I(t) = V*_0_*^(2)cos^(2)(ωt)/R.  So the current is a cosine function, which has both positive and negative swings as a function of time. But the power is a cosine-**squared** function, which is never negative.  And while the current through the resistor switches direction, the power dissipation doesn't care whether the current is moving "forward" or "backward". When there is current flowing through the resistor in either direction, there is a positive power dissipated.  And if you average the current over an integer number of periods, you get zero, but if you average the power over an integer number of periods, you get something positive.	1642961679.0	htwpmst	t3_saldgr	t3_saldgr	/r/askscience/comments/saldgr/in_alternating_current_how_is_electricity_carried/htwpmst/

o9bp1	Yes. Basically what you are describing is viscous heating. Say you have a fluid in an infinite domain with some initial state of imposed turbulence. The system is then left to proceed in time. The turbulence would decay due to a lack of energy injection, through turbulent and viscous dissipation, until the kinetic energy was converted into heat. This heat would then diffuse until the medium had a homogeneous temperature. This is the basic mechanism and other physics can change the details (such as considerations of the boundaries, solid walls, etc).  This turns up in the modelling of compressible fluids where you find a viscous heating term in the temperature equation.	1642962195.0	htwr03e	t3_salqbo	t3_salqbo	/r/askscience/comments/salqbo/if_two_streams_of_gas_intersect_does_friction/htwr03e/

In diabetes, strict A1C control (<7.0) is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia contributing to increased overall mortality.

39pradfe	Good discussion here, I'm very glad people are being so nuanced about this. Clear-cut determinism has been questioned only relatively recently in psychiatry, all the while more and more information has been available to the public about neurotransmitters and their proposed effect on mental states and behaviour. As a result, there used to be a strong incentive in popular science to communicate some (if not all) so-far known neurotransmitters in the narrow spectrum "good" vs "bad" and then communicating how certain medicines help the good guys and maim the bad. Results of this kind of communication can be observed when people self medicate, applying mechanistic logic on their own cognition and largely negating their surroundings or effects of suggestion, conditioning and other often blurry psychosomatic effects that may play a huge part in one's mental states.  While wildly misleading and unfortunate, this is also very understandable once you realize how science is made and how it clashes with popular science journalism and everyday logic. Science relies heavily on reproducibility, and to get there you take the reductionist approach: Minimize speculation, negate noise and look what happens when you change variables. But things get complicated once you apply reductionism in emergent, biological systems such as human beings.	1642962839.0	htwsohd	t3_sawfex	t1_htwmhqc	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwsohd/

5g4hw	In addition to the "direct-neurotransmitter" theory of depression which others in the thread have discussed, there is also a growing field of thought that in addition to (or even instead of) directly mediating depression, the neurotransmitter deficiency/imbalance contributes to structural/trophic changes in areas of the brain. These changes include atrophy (decrease in size) as well as diminished neuroplasticity. (https://www.nature.com/articles/1300371)  To answer your question more directly, depression can impact executive function and other areas of cognition indirectly (i.e. by impacting our emotions/motivations which in turn change how we think and act) and directly (by damaging the regions of the brain most responsible for executive function and memory, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) - good review article on some of the pathophys here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950973/  There's also no real "unified theory" of depression AFAIK - in clinical practice, for example, many patients will have to try a wide variety of medications with different mechanisms before they find one that works for their depression.	1642963184.0	htwtkah	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwtkah/

By far the most time between discovery of the disease and rollout of the vaccine was spent on clinical trials: Proving that the vaccine is safe and effective. What further slowed down the full rollout is that the vaccine uses new technology, for which there wasn't a large amount of production capacity ready to go. Highly complex production chains had to be scaled up from zero to producing billions of doses.  Finally, a Delta-specific vaccine was never rolled out because the conclusion was that the protection offered by the existing vaccines against Delta was good enough and that it was more beneficial to keep up the high rate of deliveries than it would've been to switch to a new formulation.	1642963503.0	htwudfe	t3_sax5el	t3_sax5el	/r/askscience/comments/sax5el/why_is_it_new_flu_vaccines_are_developed_so/htwudfe/

HbA1c levels are checked in the general population as a way of screening for diabetes, though it is known that other things (i.e. liver function and RBC turnover) can effect the results.	1642963931.0	htwvh05	t3_saxb1r	t1_htwlq4s	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htwvh05/

9gphx	You're question is honestly too broad to have many studies populate because they're so new, on both the "social" piece, and "good for health" piece.   Couldn't find a ton of stuff that isn't feasability/proposals/proof of concepts but I know they're being developed all over the place. Here's a [conference symposium abstract](https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/chatbots-for-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention-is-this-even-et) about the ethics of a chatbot for suicidality.  Here's a feasibility [paper](https://academic.oup.com/tbm/article/9/3/440/5489496?casa_token=Bx0ycLMDbK0AAAAA:kNe3yrwqspEBjjWaqd0_bA2RaCkVnbifIWsl1_W01jG5QNIbvl0wGt3UIgFtVPA8Mj4KVIBL1xr2ZA) looking at a support/coach chatbot for prediabetes/eating, for example.  Are you just generally curious about the tech? or have a more specific question or population, like does it help with coaching or motivation for treatment seeking, does it help people feel less lonely, does it help improve utilization of treatment resources, does it help patients stay in treatment, or does help patients reduce symptoms, etc.?	1642964097.0	htwvw6w	t3_savrvw	t3_savrvw	/r/askscience/comments/savrvw/are_social_chatbot_good_for_human_health/htwvw6w/
jg2xa	Well, "dimension" is just a degree of freedom of movement. Ie, how many numbers do you need to say where something is? In normal space, you need three plus time. But once you get small enough, it looks like you may need several more numbers.   As to "leaving the string"... I doubt matter can do that. So far, the only thing we've found that might be able to so would be gravity.	1642964108.0	htwvx89	t3_sar7af	t1_htwot9x	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwvx89/
kzzng	There are as many different types of people in that bucket as there are different people.  Depression (MDD etc.) is a loose categorisation for commonly co-occurring symptoms, irrespective of cause. That goes for all the common psychiatric definitions. That's different from ordinary illnesses, say, tuberculosis which is caused by a certain bacteria or COVID-19 that's caused by a certain virus, and that's their definition.  Which is of course obvious to say, but it's the whole reason "holistic" or integrative approaches exist and ultimately seem to show the best results, rather than handing a million people the same type of medication to fix their serotonin. Isn't that definitively closer to just keeping people afloat? But that's unfortunately usually more of a question of time, money and resources.	1642964238.0	htww9an	t3_sawfex	t1_htwnm1u	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htww9an/
8yd3yin6	No. The main reason for the loss of eggs is not the menstrual cycle but atresia (a kind of apoptosis = programmed cell death).  This is illustrated by the fact that a girl has the most eggs (around 6 million) by the time she is six months old (still in the womb) but by the time she starts menstruating 'only' 40.000 are left.  And when the menopausal transition begins (around 35 years old), it's because the follicles will start to produce less inhibin and oestrogens and menopause hits (around 51 years old) when the levels of these hormones are too low. So assuming that you would have a few eggs more (that didn't die already due to pure luck) because you were pregnant, then these wouldn't have a big enough impact to significantly delay your menopause.	1642964415.0	htwwpm1	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htwwpm1/
yqfik	In theory, could a patient with chronic depression have their brain chemistry and structure so much that they develop ADHD since a large part of ADHD is delayed/underdeveloped executive functioning and the brain regions associated with that? Could that also mean that a potential treatment for chronic depression that’s been treatment resistant could be stimulants?

11544l	I have a different interpretation of why integrative approaches have come to be favored. You can solve the problem for more people if you simultaneously throw multiple solutions at them. For some, therapy alone works, and will continue to work even if you prescribe medication. For others, medication is necessary, and therapy may additionally be helpful, or for people who've been in therapy for years, it's only when you add medication that their condition will resolve Others can get by with a change in diet or exercise. But if you tell people to get therapy, take medication, fix their diet, and exercise, the entire group will benefit and show improvement. So that approach will become the favored approach. Only recently have people begin to investigate why each is necessary and isolation for different subpopulations. Your original statement that depression is due to events in life is what I was objecting to, and the implied statement that all remedies must begin there.	1642964776.0	htwxn15	t3_sawfex	t1_htww9an	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwxn15/

t1nou	The issue with the neuropsychological approach to the human experience is that we end up with the conclusion that we are nothing but biological machines, which by itself is not a horribly misguided statement - everything from physics to medicine seems to largely indicate that being the case. But I feel like reducing complex phenomena like schizophrenia or depression to atrophy in brain regions or neurotransmitter deficiency nips any kind of progress that can be made through other means in the bud. It's akin to explaining Shakespear's work in terms of the paper on which it was written or the shape of the letters, or trying to deduce why a painting is aesthetically pleasing only in terms of the medium and paint and tools that were used. In my opinion that only sets us back and alienates the intimate experience of consciousness and the human condition, something with which we are all naturally familiar with.   I don't think anatomy and neurons play no role in conditions like depression or anxiety but it seems unfair to delegate our free will and the malleability of our organism to pharmacological solutions we seldom grasp or understand.   Unfortunately these simplistic pharmacological solutions will remain more attractive to pharmaceutical and insurance companies as well as to us in general in this age where everyone wants everyhing to be quick and done with at the lowest possible cost.	1642965255.0	htwyuw3	t3_sawfex	t1_htwsohd	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwyuw3/

htfb8	I omitted a small but important part because I don't know that I can succinctly describe it all in words. The key bit is that the orbit is fixed and repeating once you stop applying forces. A rocket is continuously burning fuel as it shapes its orbit so it is effectively creating a bunch of new potential orbital paths as it does so.   If you go back to any particular time, say point C, and cut all thrust at that moment, the orbit you would see should either not loop at all, which is what escape velocity is, or it would come back to that particular point, point C. It would not in fact have to visit point A & B because it didn't make it from point B to C on gravity alone so it won't be able to make the exact same trip on gravity alone.  Despite that though, and especially if the forces involved are small, it will still trace a path back to point C and before that to points similar to points A & B. A rocket spends so much time and so much force thrusting out of the atmosphere that the differences before the point where it cuts thrust on its new orbit and the path it travelled to get there are enough to keep it in orbit.   In the case of our ocean vessel, the point where it leaves the atmosphere is where its orbit becomes fixed. At that point it is flying upwards away from the planet. That means on the next loop it needs to be flying upwards away from the planet at that same time. But if we then step backwards and look at what the bit of time before that looked like, because nothing but gravity is acting on it we know that a couple of seconds prior it must have been a little lower and travelling in the roughly the same direction. You keep iterating backwards and each time, since the vessel is traveling vertically, you find yourself a little lower until eventually you hit a point where it must have been in the ground or the sea.	1642966162.0	htx15kn	t3_samslf	t1_htwtpzo	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htx15kn/

People are diagnosed in adulthood because either their independence, a new environment (work), or a change in their lifestyle makes it difficult for them to manage ADHD symptoms, not because it has developed.  Presentation of similar neurological symptoms doesn't mean the same underlying mechanism. Comorbidity of ADHD with depression is stress related to ADHD management or impacts on lifestyle/work/relationships, not a shared mechanism, as far as I am aware anyway.	1642966423.0	htx1tei	t3_sawfex	t1_htwwy0y	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx1tei/

Glycation means having a glucose molecule permanently bonded to the HbA molecule - the glucose attaches at a characteristic spot on the HbA molecule at a consistent slow rate but the rate is dependent upon the amount of glucose around about (inside a red blood cell \[RBC\] though this is strongly correlated with the concentration of glucose in the blood.)   RBCs work hard and wear out very quickly. Their half life (the duration at which half of them will have died, and them and their contents  have been broken up  and recycled) is about three months. Any particular HbA molecule has a limited time in which it may become glycated. Over the course of three months the chance is about 5% if there is a normal amount of glucose around its cell. If a large selection of cells are sampled - a typical blood test sample contains tens of billions of cells - then the average age of the HbA molecules in the sample from a healthy person is three months and around 5% of it is glycated HbA, a.k.a HbA1c.  **Diagnostic usage**  Glucose concentration in blood is actively controlled by your body, dynamically storing and releasing glucose to maintain the level at 3 to 8 mmol/L so that HbA1c level of 5% is consistently found unless the system of control breaks down - this is what happens to a person with diabetes. It is possible find a healthy person with a glucose well above 8 mmol/L if they have just swallowed a load of sugary food, but it will get stored away rapidly and the blood glucose level should be back to normal in an hour. This short blip of high glucose concentration will barely affect the HbA1c percentage\*\*. However, a diabetic whose body fails to control blood glucose levels automatically will have a highly variable and usually a higher average glucose concentration continuously. Thus Hb gets glycated a little more quickly on average throughout its lifetime and the percentage of HbA1c in any sample  goes up.   HbA1c is a one trick pony in diagnostics. Its unique trick is to estimate the average amount of glucose in a persons bloodstream over the past three months (or so.) Its useful because a diabetic can tolerate fairly high quantities of of glucose transiently but maintaining a higher glucose level causes the long-term damage. Thus, the momentary blood glucose concentration is not that useful for managing the disease compared to a measurement of the accumulated average glucose.  In practice HbA1c is not the definitive diagnostic criterion for diabetes (though it was recommended for a while by W.H.O. Currently they recommend a most uncomfortable and time-consumng Glucose Tolerance Test to be definitive) but it is of greatest utility in helping a person manage their diabetes over the (life)long term and for predicting whether the nastier side-effects of diabetes are likely to appear. (Most of the diabetic problems - retinopathy, nerve damage, kidney failure etc. are caused by glycation of other proteins around the body some of which, unlike Hb, are damaged or disabled by these stuck-on glucoses.) In addition it overcomes a problem with diabetics visiting a clinic for a regular check-up (usually every three months until the diabetic is 'trained' to monitor and deal with their condition by moderating their glucose/sugar intake.) The patient knows that their appointment is due and that they will have their glucose level checked in clinic and will be scolded by the clinician if they have been eating too much so their glucose level is high. It is common for patients to change their diet for the day of the visit. This means the clinician does not get an accurate picture of their state of health and risk factors, but also meant it was quite common for a patient, knowing they had recently over-indulged, to starve themselves on clinic appointment day and to collapse from hypoglycaemia (too little glucose to power their body) often in the clinic waiting room!  **Finally, to answer the question**  In diagnostic practice, low levels of HbA1c are not very useful. Any person with a normal rate of RBC turnover, typical HbA and a livable level of blood glucose should always have at least 3.5% of their Hb glycated in any random sample, so a lower level does indicate a problem with the red blood cells, but there are other, better ways to investigate these various problem.   There are a variety of root causes for high RBC turnover that can be diagnosed directly and they will typically associate with anaemia\*\*\* and other clinical symptoms so evidence of low HbA1c is usually redundant. Gross trauma or blood transfusions can also mess up HbA1c interpretation but are clear contra-indications for the test. Atypical variants of haemoglobin can cause the rate of glycation to change and give unrepresentative HbA1c results. HbA1c assays most commonly separate the Hb using chromatography so confounding variants can be detected and either accounted for or invalidate the test - though there are some very rare variants that may be missed (this is more of a concern for incorrectly identifying - or failing to identify -  high levels of HbA1c and mis-diagnosing diabetes.)   It is possible that occasionally one of these oddities may be noticed due to an anomalous HbA1c in an apparently asymptomatic person but there is not enough consistency, or enough occasions where this is likely to make for a deliberate diagnostic inquiry. However, if whole population HbA1c screening for diabetes were to be attempted (there is believed to be an epidemic of undiagnosed sub-clinical and pre-diabetic people who may only be discovered when they present with an associated condition or collapse into a coma) then mining this free data for indications that might signal, for example atypical Hb variants or chronic low level exposure to carbon monoxide might become worthwhile.  \~ \~ \~ \~ \~  \~ \~ \~ \~ \~  \*There are lots of other variants of haemoglobin - many associated with a pathology; for example sickle cell disease is associated which having the HbS variant of haemoglobin in place of the usual HbA. The different variants have differences in how well they glycate so the HbA1c analysis cannot be reliably done for a person without any HbA type haemoglobin.  \*\*HbA1c used to be reported as a straight percentage in several countries but by international agreement the measurement has been standardised as the concentration , in mmol/L of glycated Hb as a ratio of the molar concentration of all Hb \[ie. "mmol/mol Hb"\]. This provides a 'nicer' scaling, apparently (5% roughly equals 40mmol/mol) This is a UK biochemists equivalent of Pluto.  \*\*\*NB HbA1c measurements are not themselves affected by anaemia, so long as there are enough RBCs to get a good sample (you'd be dead before that number got so low) since only the ratio of glycated to total Hb is quantified.	1642967871.0	htx5hl6	t3_saxb1r	t3_saxb1r	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htx5hl6/

y9ybd	I just wanted to add that I recently learned (and translated) from a video that 50% of people with ADHD also develop Depression. This is significant because it doesn’t work the other way around, and so only 2.7% of people with Depression “have” ADHD. I say have because ADHD is with you since you are born. It’s a genetical “adaptation” rather than an illness. https://youtu.be/xkXpcs_an80 (Around 11-15 minutes I think). Anyways, you can probably guess why growing up with ADHD causes Depression so often…  On the other hand there is also evidence that ADHD could develop in adulthood. There was a study done in New Zealand that studied people for over 40 years. 90% of the people who had ADHD at the end of the study did not have it at the beginning.  https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/late-onset-adhd-may-emerge-young-adults Many people (including me) have some issues with this theory. Maybe the evaluation they performed 40 years ago was not good. Afterall, ADHD diagnosing improved tremendously over the past decades. But most importantly, supporting parents and teachers, and the most significantly a HIGH IQ can all mask ADHD symptoms.	1642968062.0	htx5z5b	t3_sawfex	t1_htwwy0y	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx5z5b/

There's not really any sort of "adult onset ADHD equivalent."   In fact quite often when you bring up adhd to a doctor as an adult they'll want to check other things first. Get blood work done, treat depression, etc. There's actually quite a few things that can look similar, I'd have been able to list a lot of them before I got diagnosed but I've since forgotten them.	1642968659.0	htx7i09	t3_sawfex	t1_htx679z	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx7i09/

28305w9e	You’re correct, it definitely is a chicken and egg situation.  But the problem with the human element is that either one can come first depending on how you look at it.  Here’s my take on it  People may argue that genetic predisposition can easily set people up for problems with brain chemistry.  From a surface perspective this gives people the impression that the root of an individuals problems with depression come internally.  And therefore it serves to justify approaching the problem of depression from a pharmaceutical angle, and medicating against those imbalances.    Now there’s nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but the problem with arguing it over genetic predisposition is that such a setup is, in and of itself, the result of an external influence, on the part of the parents.  It is not to say that the parents are to *blame*, because the genetic makeup of an individual is so complicated and chronological that it may not be either direct parent who may have left that predisposition in a persons genealogical makeup.    But most of the time people are much quicker to denounce the idea of external influences. What this results in is the pharmaceutical approach also justifies the existence of other external influences upon someone which could be negative, and ultimately harmful.  Let’s say your a student in a school.  You may have depression, anxiety, tendencies, or anger issues, or whatever as a result of GP.  Medication may be beneficial to help with enduring neurotransmitters.  But let’s say you are bullied by a bigger and meaner student, or renegged/hostily engaged by a teacher.  You might be negatively affected by that in a way that contributes to your risk of depression.  **Nothing is ultimately wrong with medication, except that it justifies the continuance of external negative influences to your internal brain chemistry which is also subject to the laws of thermodynamics in its own way**.  If you use GP as the excuse for how you would feel as a victim of bullying, or any other event that contributes to your depression, it is basically saying that those events do not have any factor on your brain chemistry as an external influence which acts upon it.  When we lose a loved one and go to the funeral, our brain chemistry is altered to make us sad.  When a girlfriend is kind to us, it is altered to make us feel happy and at ease.  Who are we to arbitrarily declare that such external events do not play a part in the integrity of our neural transmitters? And therefore who are we to say that such external forces and influences on our brain chemistry cannot exist or be valid? And from there who are we to say that our practice of mitigating problems such as depression cannot consist of a combination of both medication, and vindication, at the same time?	1642970386.0	htxbz17	t3_sawfex	t1_htwupe5	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxbz17/

39pradfe	Gladly some points you bring up are topical in certain scientific circles today. So just in case you or others (u/Brrdock) want to look further I want to share some sources:  One who would definitely share your criticism of the mechanical metaphor is Daniel J. Nicholson. Much of what he communicates is intense molecular and cellular biology, but he's very committed to working with scientists by highlighting the problems and offering work-arounds. This approach suggests better science communication and even better science since researchers are able to appreciate, identify and classify complexity in different metaphors.  More on the depression/neurology side I think Robert Sapolsky is worth checking out. He's authored several books that are incredibly concise yet acknowledging the absolute complexity of these issues and problems. There's a whole stanford lecture series on youtube, of which what perhaps touches my earlier point is his lecture titled "Chaos and Reductionism".   Nicholson has also a book out with John Dupre called "Everything Flows" that at least used to be free somewhere online. Nicholson has also a lecture somewhere on youtube about Schrödinger's influence on the history of molecular biology (and it's mechanistic underpinnings). I have found absolutely no answers or solutions but in this case I actually find it super assuring for some reason.	1642970839.0	htxd68l	t3_sawfex	t1_htwyuw3	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxd68l/
59i4p0yc	I bet you are right, and the reason why SOME people have very low Hb1C is because they have high RBC turnover due to a dangerous condition.   I know that you can have low HbA1c from minimizing carbs in your diet (which I believe is great for you if you get there slowly) but also from blood loss.   I also read that some people have much smaller sized red blood cells than the rest of us, and their readings are unreliable. I have no idea if that is linked to mortality risk, tho.	1642970868.0	htxd946	t3_saxb1r	t3_saxb1r	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxd946/

il4mt7pa	I am skeptical.  I believe consciousness is an *unintended* side effect of a larger brain.  Obviously it is unintended, being were not designed by an intelligent agent but shaped by inorganic forces over many millions of years to succeed at getting genes into the next generation.    But awareness itself is a sort of fluke that popped out of these blind forces.  Just like a starling does not see the murmuration, humans don't see the intentionality of awareness -- we are told by our own faculties that we understand cognition when the truth is that we have no idea how or why we are aware.  We see cognition as a standalone phenomena when all the evidence tells us that it is deeply concerned with pursuit of an objective, that consciousness is deeply tangled with intention, direction, purpose.  This may well be why depression is so pervasive through biological systems -- when one loses a sense of purpose the entire being becomes ill-adaptive.  We have no framework for directionless awareness -- it must manifest as dis-ease.	1642971264.0	htxebkk	t3_sawfex	t1_htx4ykd	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxebkk/

v8hlw	Theoretically, one key (set of) mechanism(s) which may tie together various theories of depression relates to neuroplasticity. This refers to alteration to the brain's physical structure and functional connectivity in response to the environment. In depression, this ability appears to be suboptimal, particularly in the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus. Growing pre-clinical evidence points to these altered plastic mechanisms as a potential common pathway in the pathophysiology of depression, which may bridge the gaps between evidence for other theories (such as those implicating individual neurotransmitters). For example, it is known that the monoamines functionally interact with mechanisms of what's called glutamate-dependant plasticity, giving a theoretical link between monoamine dysfunction (as described in serotonin and dopamine-based theories of depression), glutamate dysfunction and synaptic plasticity. Similarly, pre-clinical evidence suggests that enhancing plastic mechanisms in the pre-frontal cortex may be a [final common pathway](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26247862/) for the effects of various anti-depressants.  Neuroplasticity is a key function for basically everything the brain does (changing to respond to it's internal and external environment). In terms of human behaviour, cognition and emotion, deficits in plasticity specifically found in the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus (areas known to suffer atrophy and reduced plasticity in depression, as discussed by u/dragonblaz9) have a clear conceptual link to the symptoms of depression, due to their roles in cognitive processes, learning and memory, executive function and the top-down regulation of circuits involved in emotional processing. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7047599/) is a paper discussing the conceptual link between pre-clinical findings on plasticity and the human outcomes of depression.	1642972194.0	htxgsjv	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxgsjv/
il4mt7pa	You make an excellent point -- antidepressants, with all their benefit, can't teach a person to be more resilient in the face of significant obstacles.  But medications are cheap and fast, real therapy takes time and money.  And, incidentally, all people will encounter significant obstacles -- we're not at all sure why one person overcomes the kind of difficulty that flattens another.

9tpbm	Look up "black star" for some relevant information.  Short version, in the early universe where hydrogen was the only abundant element, massive nearly pure hydrogen stars formed.  They were super low temperature because very little fusion relatively speaking was occurring.  Since they were low temperature, they produced very little visible light with most of their emission in the infrared spectrum.  Eventually enough carbon formed to initiate carbon catalyzed fusion resulting in the bright visible light stars we see today.  This is greatly simplified so don't toss it at your physics professor without expecting a lecture.	1642972464.0	htxhhja	t3_s8195s	t3_s8195s	/r/askscience/comments/s8195s/is_it_possible_for_a_star_to_only_output_light/htxhhja/
v8hlw	It's important to remember that the lines we use to delineate different mental disorders are fairly roughly drawn, and our knowledge about the biology of individual disorders is poor (and is often derived from looking at what the mechanism of a successful treatment is). Similarity of symptoms *could* imply overlap between mechanisms - diminished executive function of the pre-frontal cortex being a candidate here, even if the direct pathophysiology isn't the same. That doesn't suggest that chronic depression would lead to ADHD, just that one symptom of chronic depression may resemble one symptom of ADHD due to a similar effect on the efficient function of the pre-frontal cortex.	1642972788.0	htxibsc	t3_sawfex	t1_htwwy0y	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxibsc/

When it decays to nickel-60, with almost 100% probability it populates a specific excited state in nickel-60, which then decays with almost 100% branching fraction through a cascade of two ~ 1 MeV gamma decays.  That's what provides the characteristic gamma rays from a cobalt-60 source, and that happens for many years.	1642973020.0	htxiy3i	t3_sb2l21	t3_sb2l21	/r/askscience/comments/sb2l21/if_the_metastable_state_of_cobalt_has_a_half_life/htxiy3i/

3c26m	Very basic answer:Anemia causes tissues to become mildly hypoxic. The kidney can sense this and releases erythropoietin, a protein that goes and tells your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Why? Because red blood cells are what carry oxygen to tissues.   There are tons of different types of anemia though.   There's sickle cell anemia, where you might have normal hemoglobin but your red blood cells are sickle shaped so they don't have the ability to bind oxygen. There are other anemias caused by deformities of the red blood cells as well.   There are anemias of chronic disease, like if you had poor kidney function you wouldn't make enough erythropoietin to maintain a constant level needed to maintain rbc production homeostasis, leading to decreases hemoglobin in the long run.   There are anemias caused by iron, folate, and B12 deficiencies. These are anemias where you are missing certain vital factors in the RBC building, or hemoglobin building, process. Eventually your body stores run out of these things and you fail to make sufficient RBCs, again leading to hypoxia of the tissues.   There are other types as well, but these are very, very basic overviews of some of the most common types.	1642975662.0	htxptsa	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5y5z	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxptsa/

ilows	Increased production of RBCs would be a response to losing cells. The higher turnover is an attempt to counteract whatever it is which is causing the anaemia - it does not really ramp up RBC production until there is enough of a physiological deficit - you are already becoming anaemic - and  the increased production may not be able keep up with the loss of cells.  There are also some specific pathologies which directly overproduce RBCs or make defective RBCs so the physiological signal of insufficient oxygen transport triggers and RBCs are overproduced in response - but this is outside my knowledge base; Red Cell Haematology goes deep.	1642976201.0	htxr7dz	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5y5z	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxr7dz/
f2xb4	While my response is not going to be anywhere near the above, high RBC turnover will contribute to anaemia.   With anaemia being a low level of haemoglobin [Hb] (the protein responsible for oxygen transport in RBCs). This can be because there are a normal amount of RBCs but low Hb in each, or a low amount of RBCs with normal amounts of Hb, both effect O2 carrying capacity of blood.  If your RBCs are structurally defective in one way (sickle cell for example) they are less pliable and unable to squeeze through capillaries and the thin vessels in your spleen. This causes increased breakdown of RBCs, the body will try to compensate by increasing haematopoesis (making red blood cells), but eventually the balance tips as it can't keep up and is unable to keep recycling the building blocks of RBCs.  This type of anaemia is called haemolytic, and also includes thalassaemia (which is a genetic defect in the coding of Hb proteins that cause it to fold funny and clump in RBCs) and a heap more.  There are other types of anaemia which are due to deficiencies (Iron deficiencies, B12 or Folate) and they come under microcytic or macrocytic anaemia due to the sizes of the RBCs when they are made. Iron is important in the making of Hb, and folate and b12 are needed for DNA synthesis.  PS.

qoopp	The most obvious difference between telescopes and microscopes is the size of the objective lens (the lens oppose the ocular lens, where the eye is positioned)  The purpose of the objective lens is to gather and focus the light coming in. Telescopes have a large objective lens because they need to gather as much light as possible to get a clear image of distant objects. A lack of available light isn't a problem for microscopes, so their objective lens tend to be small and focused.	1642976851.0	htxsw32	t3_sb4jbb	t3_sb4jbb	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/htxsw32/

ilows	Pathology occassionally suffers from 'mission creep'; an equivalent of off-label prescribing of pharmaceuticals.   HbA1c is a great example of a functional assay deployed to answer a specific question; Does the testee have a long-term damaging level of glucose in their body. But now the test has become very widely requested to screen relatively healthy patients, curious clinicians are looking at the mass of data and wondering what else it might show.   The paper referenced by u/silentlyscreaming01 above seems to conclude little more than that there is something to see here but the defects they associate with low HbA1c are fairly generic indicators of haematological diseases, anaemia, liver and kidney dysfunction - pathologies affecting RBCs more than glucose metabolism - which amounts to low HbAc being a rather woolly, insensitive and non-specific indicator of indifferent health. If there are clinical symptoms to trace then there are better tests and without, a low HbA1c is not selective enough to be the basis of a course of action.  I believe that there could be a benefit - possible a world altering benefit - in expanding on this as a data-mining exercise. Pathological testing is increasing at a near exponential rate and there is a LOT of data, all stored digitally, these days. If the privacy ethics would allow it, sending all known pathology test data and associated clinical notes on diagnoses and outcomes, to an enormous machine learning application to find multivariate links between a dozen, apparently random test results and, say, a particular cause of death could show new methods for early diagnosis, successful treatments and useful targets for population-wide well-person screening programmes.

98vkc	How far we can zoom in with light microscopy used to be limited mostly on the hardware when we first started using them. Requiring multiple high quality lenses and not having everything optimized limited what we could and couldn't see.  With modern technology our optical microscopes are mostly limited by the physical nature of light. The wavelength of visible light is 400-700 nm. Your resolution limitation due to diffraction is therefore closely related to that wavelength and is approximately half that. With the best microscopes we can't discern individual objects smaller than approximately 250 nm. An atom is 0.03-0.3 nm and we therefore can't see an atom with microscopes. I don't know much about telescopes, but as long as a machine uses the visible light spectrum to image something it will run into the same problems with the laws of physics.  That is optical with visible light though! There are other microscope techniques that will be able to show you a lot more in detail on small scales. Scanning/Transmission electron microscopy as examples. They use electron sources and the sample will either backscatter the electron, give secondary electrons or the electrons can be transmitted which we can detect and form an image with. Modern top of the art scanning electron microscopes (SEM) under optimal conditions can have a resolution slightly above 1nm, just not enough to show us individual atoms. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is able to show us atoms.	1642978674.0	htxxq2h	t3_sb4jbb	t3_sb4jbb	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/htxxq2h/

Speaking of absurd strawmen:  > Does Michael Jordan have a PhD in Physics because of his perfectly tuned fadeaway jumper?   Computers can do calculus, but they aren't conscious and don't hold PhDs in physics. It doesn't matter if the computer was programmed by humans, or trained itself iteratively with machine learning, or if the brain arrived it its solution through millions of years of evolution. It doesn't matter if it's computing consciously or instinctively or if it can show its work. It's still doing calculus or a functional approximation thereof.

zobel	I am a physician and this is a somewhat misinformed comment.  People have been using continuous insulin infusion pumps for decades and there have been studies on this for just as long, particularly with diabetic retinopathy.    The pathophysiology isn't well understood but the data shows it showing up mostly in patients with long standing severe hypoglycemia over decades so there is some thought on osmotic gradients.  This is not my field of study so I can't confidently elaborate more.  Now to the practical application.  Despite small but significant paradoxical increases in some complications, overall mortality and morbidity decrease on a greater scale. From a weighed risk perspective prioritizing decreasing the A1c is the target to help prevent microvascular effects of diabetes.   Secondly, "rapid" is a shifting target with studies showing some of these effects with a decrease of only 1.5 over as long as 2 years(literally what I see with type 2 patients started on a single oral agent and compliant with diet and exercise over 6 months on average).  There is no evidence that any decrease over any period of time is "safe".  Lastly, as I alluded to earlier, CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) and CSII are not the same.  CGM when paired with a CSII pump have been shown to decrease glucose variability that more recent studies have shown to be a larger culprit in diabetic retinopathy and also implicated blood pressure as a modifying factor.  All in all, CGMs at least according to the data we have now attenuate the risks of glucose variability and hypoglycemia that CSII with finger glucose checks was often plagued with.    Its all evolving science but the information that we have now does not point to or justify any "slow" improvement of A1c.	1642980895.0	hty3o8m	t3_saxb1r	t1_htwyi8u	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hty3o8m/

Phones hardly break when you drop them anymore, and that's a more violent reaction than spinning the phone up slowly to a few thousand rpm for example. That's the reason they spin it up slowly. They could do it within 5 minutes, but that acceleration would be closer to slamming the phone on the ground than a slow spin.	1642983216.0	hty9bqp	t3_samslf	t1_htw5u16	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/hty9bqp/

t279e	It's a common misconception that menopause happens when the woman "runs out of eggs." Ovarian cycles are controlled with hormones from the brain. Specifically, LH and FSH from the hypothalamus. FSH is what tells the ovaries to make estrogen, but it's not even the egg cells that make estrogen. The whole system is quite complex.	1642985792.0	htyfkhz	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htyfkhz/
dt4de	Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is commonly used for symptoms of menopause, but everything in medicine comes with risks. For example, extended use of depo increases bone loss (even leading to osteoporosis) and estrogen containing products increase risk of breast cancer. It is a shared decision between patient and physician if treatment is worth the risks.   There are also non hormonal medications that alleviate symptoms of menopause which are great for women who can’t or don’t want to take HRT.	1642985915.0	htyfuue	t3_sas6ch	t1_htyc05s	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htyfuue/

i5zr9	"A point reduces the force and the velocity." The point doesn't reduce the force. As you said, it reduces the velocity. Or as zeraul98 said, it reduces the torque.  For example, lets say you had a "top" that weighed 3 N (I put "top" in quotes because this is going to make a very poor top). Now instead of a single point, say it has 3 points (or feet if you prefer) arranged symmetrically about the center of the top. With this arrangement, each point will have 1 N of force on it. If the sliding coefficient of friction is 0.5, then each point will have a 1/2 N frictional force.\* It doesn't matter how far from the center of the top the points are -- 1 mm, 10 mm or 100 mm -- the frictional force will be the same.   The torque will be different, and the velocity will be different (for the same RPM), and the distance traveled per revolution will be different. But these are basically 3 different ways of describing the same physical situation.  \* Note: For simplicity, I'm ignoring the fact that at any significant rotation speed, a top with 3 contact points will likely wobble a lot with only one point touching a lot of the time. That's a different topic.	1642988996.0	htyn81s	t3_sa97gz	t1_htxkhcx	/r/askscience/comments/sa97gz/if_surface_area_doesnt_affect_friction_why_do/htyn81s/

11i323	Yeah menopause isn’t caused by a running out of eggs, menopausal women still have eggs. You are born with 1-3 million eggs, and you don’t live anywhere close to 1-3 million months. It’s caused by the aging of the ovaries that result in them basically malfunctioning. You can also go through menopause from a lack of access to nutrition. That isn’t going to affect the number of eggs you have, just how many resources your body has to upkeep your ovaries.	1642990744.0	htyre0e	t3_sas6ch	t1_htwqqxp	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htyre0e/

kxz8j	I would like to point out some problems with using A1C as a metric for blood sugar stability.  Some people have longer living red blood cells and can measure on an A1C test at over 7.0 but not have any blood sugar issues.  We would tell a type 1 diabetic that anyone see a 5.5 is perfect and it correlates to an average blood sugar of 100.  However if the person spent 40% of the time with a blood sugar of 50 and 40% of the time with a blood sugar of 160 and 20% of the time at 100, A1C would still be 5.5, but they would have spent 1,700 hours out of a healthy blood sugar range and permanently damaging their organs.  A person who is chronically hovering around 120 blood sugar would end up with an A1C of 6.6 but be healthier than the first person because they are maintaining stability in a decent range even if that range is a little higher than optimal.  I have personal experience seeing the first one happen on multiple occasions.  While A1C can certainly be a tool for trends it's like BMI, and especially for type 1 diabetes not a very useful metric anymore.  I find this important as type 1s get the shaft in the world where whenever we use the word diabetes we automatically mean type 2 and they are two completely different things that just end up with the same results if ignored.	1642993039.0	htyx6uy	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5hl6	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htyx6uy/

That's why their test model is in at least a partial vaccuum chamber, and it really needs to be full vacuum if they ever tried it at the actual speeds.  Even if it could be outdoors, a launch failure would be like if you took the main gun on a battleship and spun it around in a circle at 20 revs per second and then fired a shot off in a random direction. Not only could this easily obliterate the command center they put so conveniently next door, but could also pose a danger to anything in a 20 mile radius.  As a engineer, all I see immediately are the myriad of failure points, especially with repeated use, for an unimpressive design.

It is common for patients to change their diet for the day of the visit.  Diabetes is a difficult disease to manage and good control depends on a lot factors, many of which are difficult for patients to control such as insulin resistance, consistent access to medication, slow adjustments to blood sugar from insulin, life-style restrictions... some are certainly at least partially within the control of patients but no doctor should be scolding patients for "eating too much" if the patient's blood sugar is high.	1643001239.0	htzevpf	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5hl6	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htzevpf/
2rrgnwlb	Core rot is caused by a number of fungi, including species from Alternaria, Stemphylium, Cladosporium, Uloctadium, Epicoccum, Coniothyrium, and Pleospora, with Alternaria spp. molds being the most common. Fungal spores will land on the senescing blossom, and during fruit growth and maturation, will begin to take root. Core rot appears to be more prevalent during intensive anti-fungal fumigation. High relative moisture, mild temperatures, and tissue susceptibility are factors that increase core rot incidence. Once inside the fruit, the fungi are protected from fungicides.

For this reason, anti-inflammatories can offer short term depressive relief, while things that promote systemic inflammation can also induce depression-like symptoms in the brain (some auto-immune conditions, or poor diet, lack of exercise).	1643001864.0	htzfznt	t3_sawfex	t1_htwtkah	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htzfznt/

8qq9axh9	> The thing is,  dinosaurs were already on the way out.  Diversity had plummeted by the late cretacious.   There is no cut and dry stance on this issue, and for every paper you can find on declining dinosaur populations, there is one on a lack of decline or about how communities were thriving right up until the K-Pg boundary, eg. [Lloyd et al, 2008](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.0715); [Chiarenza et al, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08997-2?fbclid=IwAR1imfAOP8_7xjIVGAf7z_X1MvvRfx0TSyHS4uP_FnPFFzw_tg0z_GgVpf0); or [Bonsor et al, 2020](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.201195). There does seem to be evidence out there for a decline in **some** populations, but certainly not all, and it’s difficult to say whether apparent declines are real or the side effects of the particular way we are counting things — whether that be via faulty statistical analyses, sampling biases, or the paucity of the fossil record.   > The dekkan traps had been going off for like a million years causing major ocean acidification and climate change.  Again, the jury is still out on how the Deccan Traps eruptions affected the Earth system and to what extent. A million years prior to the K-Pg boundary is a bit off though; those in favour of the Deccan Traps being a major contributor to the extinction put eruptions in the initial pulse tens of thousands of years prior to the boundary, maybe half a million years at absolute most. Then there are those who say that the most significant pulses took place *after* the K-Pg boundary. The main sticking point here persists because the two best geochronology studies on the exact timing of the eruptions use different approaches — one U-Pb and one Ar-Ar — and they have different interpretations, which are nicely summarised [here.](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/823313)	1643003159.0	htzi9b7	t3_s8cd4m	t1_htjtx2c	/r/askscience/comments/s8cd4m/after_the_kt_extinction_how_did_the_survivors/htzi9b7/

So aside from finding specific studies that say X or Y, there's not a lot of concrete and confirmed findings.   Some studies isolate specific chemicals like THC rather than utilize the whole flower/bud.   There's a lot more chemicals in marijuana than just THC. Again, not enough studies or research.    Some studies only focus on younger people and have shown results that it impacts development.   Other studies focus on adults and show positive effects.

a4fbm	The temperature referred to is the air temperature. There are a number of complications in properly measuring it. If you measure in direct sunlight, you'll get higher values than in the shade and certain materials and objects tend to heat up more easily than others, which means that a thermometer may show different values depending on where it is close to. For example, concrete retains heat better than soil, which means that cities are often hotter than fields.  To deal with all these factors, temperature measurements for weather reporting and forecasting have to follow a set of rules. For one, the thermometer should be at some distance from any buildings or other man-made objects. In addition, the thermometer should be shielded against direct sunlight. This is achieved by placing the thermometer in a white box with slits for air circulation, which is called a Stevenson screen.  The Stevenson screen allows air to flow through it, while keeping the influence of sunlight to a minimum. The white coat of paint helps reflect any sunlight. This box is then placed at a small height (1-2 meter) above the ground in an open area, away from buildings. And doing this gives meteorologists the best temperature reading to use in weather reports and forecasts.  The forecasts themselves start by gathering as much weather data as possible: temperature, air pressure, humidity, etc... Ideally from as many weather stations and things like weather balloons as possible. All this data is fed into computer models that apply the laws of physics to how air and heat move around to come up with a prediction of how things develop over time. From the outcome of such models, weather forecasts can take key information such as temperature, cloud cover, wind, etc...	1643009662.0	htzs3q8	t3_sb9wxd	t3_sb9wxd	/r/askscience/comments/sb9wxd/when_we_hear_about_the_temperature_in_weather/htzs3q8/

n27na	> Does the theory rely on those extra dimensions being curled up, or is it agnostic to their shape and we just say that if they exist they must be curled up because we can't perceive them? > > Also, what are their predicted circumferences? All the same?  There are several perspectives you can make your calculations from in string theory, two of these perspectives we can call "world-sheet" and "spacetime" perspectives. The "world-sheet" perspective in one where we consider the physics *on* the string, as it is (what is called) embedded in a spacetime, it is also known as an "intrinsic" point of view from the string perspective. In the calculation that gives rise to `D=10` (spacetime dimension (1 time + 9 space)) in string theory is done from this point of view. Meaning string theory tells you, if you want the physics *on* the string to make sense, the spacetime it is embedded into has to be 10 dimensions.  What shape/size are they? The "intrinsic" picture is one where you are very local in spacetime, meaning you only see the immediate surroundings, sort of similar to how you on earth has a hard time seeing the curvature on the earth from the small local part of the earth you can observe. For the string, this picture does not reveal much information about the shape/size of the surrounding space at all (not nothing, but also not too much).  What is common to do, is to then switch picture: OK, world-sheet physics says `D=10`, then at least the spacetime picture must have `D=10`. Then you ask: what shapes and sizes makes sense (~gives some physics like the one we perceive), and why? What you start to notice in such research is that some shapes (+ "ingredients", such as fluxes and branes, that the world-sheet picture also tells us about), are unstable (meaning if you freeze time, construct this shape, and again let time go on, the shape will change), has bad singularities and so on. Doing this one have built up a large set of rules, "this goes with that, under these circumstances, to produce such-and-such shapes and sizes".  These rules have varying amounts of evidence, and extrapolating these rules may often fail. In the community today there are people who both claim that these rules are extremely predictive, when it comes to size/shape, and others that say they do not predict much at all (again, when it comes to size/shape, which leads to other types of predictions, like a "landscape" of possible universes).	1643013021.0	htzwicl	t3_sar7af	t1_htx4c10	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htzwicl/
u63ch	Going low is still dangerous - 40 is certainly way too low. My record low was recorded at 28 about 10 minutes after I consumed everything I could find with sugar in it. It was the first time I had a low that felt like I was going to die. DKA came much closer to killing me and I felt dine. As you get used to your t1 you'll learn how your body reacts and how much to trust it. Some people can't feel lows at all, for example.

rk1og	Not on a wide scale, no.   There are a few types of tests:  Antigen and PCR tests used to specifically look for the presence of covid proteins or RNA, respectively.   Covid PCR based sequencing test used to specifically amplify up the covid genome, and sequence it to determine which variant it is.  Respiratory viral infection panel sequencing tests, used to sequence multiple viruses including covid. This can find presence/absence of a number of viruses, and determine variants. It is however not widely used compared to the ones above.  So there’s some data on other viruses coming from covid tests, but overall not much because the diagnostic tests are primarily the ones specifically looking at covid, not the panel.	1643017449.0	hu01weg	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu01weg/

r4b7r	Unfortunately, in many countries psilocybin is illegal, regardless of possession, use, cultivation, etc… I do not condone, or advocate, any activity that could land you in jail.  However, if you live in the U.S. it is technically legal (minus a couple states) to purchase magic mushroom *spores*. Emphasis on spores, since studying them as an amateur mycologist is totally fine but growing the mushrooms (cultivation) is illegal. Not that it doesn’t stop people from doing so anyway.  /r/sporetraders and /r/shrooms have fairly dedicated communities if “studying spores” is for you. There are other ways of procuring magic mushrooms for recreational use, all of which are illegal in most parts of the world.	1643019996.0	hu04y1b	t3_sawfex	t1_hu02s8q	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu04y1b/

gypkr	A wire is more like a perfectly flexible drive shaft that connects the power source to the power sink. Imagine you hold a saw at the end of a long metal pole. If you wiggle the other end back and forth you can cut through something. There's no net movement in the pole, but your arm is doing work, this energy is being transmitted by the pole and being spent cutting the wood. The harder the wood is to saw, the harder you have to push at your end.   This would also be the case if rather than a pole, you had a hydrolic plunger (dunno the right name!) and a hydrolic piston.	1643020844.0	hu0609f	t3_saldgr	t3_saldgr	/r/askscience/comments/saldgr/in_alternating_current_how_is_electricity_carried/hu0609f/

g1e6b	One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is that depression is known to play absolute havoc with the body's sleep cycle, disrupting how long one spends in the different stages of sleep and in what order one experiences them. One major issue is that people with depression arrive at the REM sleep phase earlier than those without, and remain in that phase for much longer. REM sleep is believed to be involved in emotional memory processing, problem solving etc so it makes sense that people with depression would get 'stuck' in that phase for longer than people without - but the problem is, it means that they spend less time in all the other stages of sleep, and those stages are responsible for a whole host of vital "housekeeping" of both brain and body.  So essentially, even though people with depression tend to sleep more than others, they are also missing out on some important stages of sleep for general mind and body 'upkeep', because their brains are spending huge proportions of sleep-time in one particular phase and letting other phases go by the wayside as a result.	1643021893.0	hu07bpl	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu07bpl/

snpmb7k	It's both, but any one telescope is only designed to capture one part of the spectrum.   A classic optical telescope is a long tube with lenses in it, because light is bent and focused by those lenses.  A radio telescope has no glass lenses in it, because radio waves go right through them. Instead, a radio telescope looks like a big radar dish, or more commonly a big field of radio dishes.   X-ray telescopes do have glass lenses, but their geometry is very different than optical telescopes. X-rays are so high energy they don't bend and focus the way light beams do, so instead x-ray optics tend to use shallow angles to nudge the x-rays onto a detector.

Now that you've said it out loud I realize its not, and thats a goddamn shame.  The data available and resulting research would be worth whatever was required to anonymize the data and publish it. It absolutely could be done in a way that preserves privacy - and the value would _easily_ pay for any oversight and management required. The only (huge) stumbling block would be public opinion, and since that apparently can't be reasoned with or swayed with facts, I feel like this probably will never happen. Or if it does it'll be some end run around patient data and HIPPA that will be more invasive and less useful than an explicit law.	1643032361.0	hu0o4z8	t3_saxb1r	t1_htxwvlr	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0o4z8/

As others have pointed out there are better standard CBC/LFT tests for RBC turnover (Hb, MCV, Bilirubin). If these are normal, then your low HbA1c could be a normal anomaly.  Some people have mutations in their RBC proteins that render these proteins less likely to be glycalalated, for example.  However, if you *are* experiencing symptoms of hypoglycaemia in your day to day life, then I recommend further investigations, like checking glucagon levels and screening for an insulinoma.	1643034465.0	hu0slc6	t3_saxb1r	t1_htxw8tu	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0slc6/

a4fbm	Proper sunlight shielding doesn't need to be expensive. All you need is a surface that reflects as much sunlight as possible (white paint does the job) that covers the sensor and as much airflow past the sensor as possible to ensure that the sensor is measuring outside air and not air that's been sitting in the enclosure.  From a quick glance at a picture of that device, it seems to have something in place around the temperature sensor. So it should work quite well.  From my personal experience, I've found that leaving the temperature sensor in direct sunlight completely negates its usefulness. Except perhaps as a makeshift light sensor. The measured temperature spikes will beyond the actual air temperature once sunlight hits the sensor directly.  What can also play a role is any heat produced by electronics near the sensor. I've had an experiment with a temperature sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi (a low cost, low power small computer board) and while the Pi has a power consumption low enough to not require any cooling on the chip, it was able to affect the temperature measurements of the sensor connected to it unless I moved the sensor further away.  Doing proper temperature measurements of the air is quite difficult. Fortunately, for most people, the purpose of the measurement is typically along the lines of "Is it nice enough weather to go outside?" and they don't need scientific accuracy.	1643035506.0	hu0uxfe	t3_sb9wxd	t1_hu0pa5q	/r/askscience/comments/sb9wxd/when_we_hear_about_the_temperature_in_weather/hu0uxfe/
gekpw	We’ll never be able to achieve the pressures in the core of the sun in a terrestrial reactor. And such high pressures aren’t necessary anyway.  The thermonuclear reaction rate has a much stronger dependence on temperature than on pressure. It’s linear in the density, which is proportional to the pressure, with fixed temperature. But it’s generally some power law in the temperature, so ~ T^(p), where p is some fairly large positive power.  So your plasma can be at a much smaller pressure, but a moderately larger temperature, and still get the same reaction rate per particle as you’d have with a stellar temperature and pressure.	1643035555.0	hu0v1km	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu0v1km/

5lzlc	Just a mild correction, sickle cell disorder is actually due to a genetic mutation of the hemoglobin protein (HgbS). You have to inherit two HgbS genes from your parents, though it is possible to get just one bad copy and be a carrier with no symptoms. There are other HgB proteins as well, like fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)  produced when you are a baby with I believe a higher oxygen affinity. There are interesting new stem cell therapies to "remove the block" allowing sickle cell pts to produce HgbF again thereby reducing how much sickle hemoglobin they produce and improving their oxygen carrying capacity, basically turning them from sickle cell disease to more of a carrier phenotype.	1643036512.0	hu0x9o3	t3_saxb1r	t1_htxptsa	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0x9o3/
a6u8sfyd	What do you need to do planning?  First, you have to believe there's a point to it.  second, you need the mental energy to work out the details, puzzle out the problems.  You need to have a sense that there's a point to distinguishing between good choices and bad choices.  You need a sense that there are better possibilities.  A person in depression may lack motivation, lack energy, lack a sense that their actions are meaningful.  So, what would we be looking at?  Dopamine system for one, as it's centered on seeking behavior.  Limbic system, as it affects our moods.  Memory systems, as the depressive response, both traumatic and chronic, can be centered on memories and traumatic situations that are dwelled upon in excess.  We could also look at the prefrontal cortex, particularly the medial portions, which are involved in planning, in emotional responses.  Take this as an amateur neuroscience nerd's speculation.	1643036553.0	hu0xd4a	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu0xd4a/

ig34j	> I was just wondering what the Hubble would see if we inverted it as a microscope instead of a telescope.   It can't. Most telescopes we use are not lens-based but mirror-based. So you don't focus light using lens, but rather you have a bunch of mirrors which focus the light. The advantage is that lens has to be supported from the "edge" and this is very impractical for big and heavy lenses because they would "sag" and bend. Mirror can be easily supported from behind, which allows for construction of gigantic mirrors (there are some 30-40m mirror telescopes in construction right now).  So in case of such telescopes there is no way to "flip" it.	1643037446.0	hu0zhk3	t3_sb4jbb	t3_sb4jbb	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/hu0zhk3/

8ds2uzku	No. When a vacuum forms like that it’s called cavitation which requires a truly sudden impulse to overcome the stickiness of the fluid to the object at their boundary.   But the idea isn’t without precedent. Interestingly for those studying Aristotle’s book physics (antiquity, renaissance) they thought that an object can only be moved by a contact force, meaning the cause of any velocity was attributed to sustained contact. The vacuum behind a thrown object and the fact that nature abhors a vacuum were invoked as the cause of of a thrown object’s continued movement. They went to such a length describing it because they hadn’t yet scientifically grasped inertia	1643038352.0	hu11qlh	t3_sbehp5	t3_sbehp5	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu11qlh/
4p7299hp	A turbulent low-pressure region may arise if the flow detaches from the surface of the object at the back. This results in something called form or pressure drag. This is also why golf balls have dimples. They cause turbulent flow over the surface which is less prone to flow separation and with that reduces the form drag a golf ball experiences.	1643038379.0	hu11syv	t3_sbehp5	t3_sbehp5	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu11syv/

yue6s	That's not how fruit storage is accomplished. Nobody freezes fruit intended to be sold fresh. They are kept at relatively low temperatures, but they're in an atmosphere-controlled storage chamber (I believe the air is mostly nitrogen). Those conditions greatly extend shelf life since there is little in the atmosphere to which the fruit can react and degrade. I believe ethylene offgassings are also removed from the atmosphere for the same reason.	1643038497.0	hu123l9	t3_sba8bm	t1_hu119bo	/r/askscience/comments/sba8bm/why_do_apples_start_to_go_bad_around_their_cores/hu123l9/
em4rp	Okay, to clarify: The term 'birthday apple' implies that they are specifically advertising '1 year old apples' for the very quality of being (exactly? approximately?) '1 year old'. That sounded like there was some supposed benefit.  Also if they are specifically selling 1-year-old apples, that would mean they would be selling last years season fruit *in the next season*... so any 'freeze to preserve for off-season' shouldn't work here (unless it's a '1 year (+-6 months)' thing).	1643038866.0	hu130y1	t3_sba8bm	t1_hu119bo	/r/askscience/comments/sba8bm/why_do_apples_start_to_go_bad_around_their_cores/hu130y1/

I'm aware of the differentiation between HgBS and HgB, as well as the fact that a common treatment for sickle cell disease is hydroxyurea which increases HgBF production allowing for normal shaped RBCs to be produced.	1643039146.0	hu13qhn	t3_saxb1r	t1_hu0x9o3	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu13qhn/

They didn't manage to sell all their inventory before the next harvest season, so they tried to spin the birthday as a marketing gimmick? They also should have kept the temperature just above freezing the entire time, but it might have experienced that damage at any time, probably before harvest, and the event went undetected?	1643039238.0	hu13yw1	t3_sba8bm	t1_hu130y1	/r/askscience/comments/sba8bm/why_do_apples_start_to_go_bad_around_their_cores/hu13yw1/
fhodm	It should also be noted the fusion rate in the sun is rather low. The power output is a few hundred watts per cubic metre in the solar core; the sun owes its enormous total power to its enormous volume.  The main factor in our fusion reactors (and bombs) achieving much higher power density is that we use deuterium and tritium fusion while the sun is powered by hydrogen-1 fusion. Hydrogen-1 fusion is much much slower.	1643039291.0	hu143t5	t3_sbic0f	t1_hu0v1km	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu143t5/

o9bp1	> No. When a vacuum forms like that it’s called cavitation which requires a truly sudden impulse to overcome the stickiness of the fluid to the object at their boundary.  This is a serious problem for propellers as it can cause significant damage see the [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation) which also includes some talk on the crazy [pistol shrimps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpheidae) that use to stun fish or other things that come close....	1643039814.0	hu15gr7	t3_sbehp5	t1_hu11qlh	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu15gr7/

b1qa0x96	>No. When a vacuum forms like that it’s called cavitation   So ... yes then, right? Given enough speed the pressure behind the object will drop so much that the liquid will start boiling, producing bubbles. It would seem a natural extension of this fact that by further increasing the speed you can produce arbitrarily low pressure behind the object.	1643040094.0	hu166wd	t3_sbehp5	t1_hu11qlh	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu166wd/
q81tq	The plasma needs to be millions of degrees hot to get fusion (~100 million C or F for practical applications). No container stays intact at that temperature. The Sun doesn't need a container, its material stays together from the gravitational attraction of all the material. We can't use that on Earth. We use magnetic fields to contain the plasma, with a vacuum between the plasma and the reactor wall. The pressure in the plasma is pretty moderate so the density of the plasma itself is very low (it's still a pretty good vacuum compared to the atmosphere), but Earth's fusion reactors are hotter than the core of the Sun and use fuels that fuse easier. It's a different environment in almost every aspect.	1643040188.0	hu16fja	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu16fja/

si3mq	Definitely! I’m sure both factors have contributed. I’m guessing we will see more research on this soon since the 1st pandemic babies are now toddlers. In the particular study I was referring to, maternal stress was suspected because the babies born at the end of 2020 seemed to be more impacted than those babies born mid 2020. Both were born during the pandemic but the biggest difference was what stage of pregnancy the mother was in when the pandemic hit. Those past the 1st trimester when the pandemic started seemed to be a bit better off.	1643040474.0	hu1760l	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu0yp2e	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1760l/
5dm61war	In fact, researchers have found that having a higher body mass index (BMI) predicts a later menopause. One large British study found that eating oily fish and fresh legumes delayed menopause by several years.-  How much the new procedure will delay the menopause depends on the age when the tissue is taken and when it is put back. Tissue taken from a 25-year-old might postpone the menopause for 20 years, while that taken from a 40-year-old might only delay its onset for five years.  INTERNET  So   healthy diet and  habits may help in delaying menopause.	1643040631.0	hu17klo	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/hu17klo/

5dm61war	Both pregnancy and breastfeeding might delay menopause by temporarily halting monthly ovulation cycles to release eggs, Langton said by email. Women are born with a set number of eggs, and depletion of this egg supply contributes to the end of menstruation and the start of menopause.  Compared to women who had never been pregnant or who had been pregnant for less than six months, women who had one full-term pregnancy had an 8% lower risk of early menopause. Those who had two pregnancies had a 16% lower risk, and those who had three pregnancies had a 22% lower risk.	1643040772.0	hu17xuh	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/hu17xuh/

xerioos	Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) interconverts in the body to a radical form that produces hydrogen peroxide. This peroxide goes around oxidizing stuff in red blood cells, and G6PD-deficient people can't produce enough antioxidants (namely, glutathione) to keep up with it. So in these cases, the red blood cells burst and die. This happens rarely, but only at very high doses of vitamin C. But the paper below says that if you give someone vitamin C and they start having problems, it might be worth it to consider if they have G6PD deficiency.

If you come from certain directions, you'll gravitate to the ridge of the saddle, but if you're not aligned perfectly, you'll keep rolling off the side.  For satellites that are parked at those points, they have to actively adjust their orbits to keep them there for extended durations.  By analogy, you can stand on top of a hill, but it helps if you're awake if you want to stay there.	1643042518.0	hu1chhe	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1chhe/

4nrp2	L2 is a gravitational saddle point. The saddle is set along the orbit, and so objects eventually fall towards the sun or away from the sun. JWST is at this saddle point and without boosters, it would eventually fall off (it's in the order of months for things to begin to fall). It is positioned so that it would fall towards the sun (so, on the near side of the saddle). This is so that it can use its rocked - which is on the side facing the sun - to keep it in place. If it were to go too far and fall on the *far* side, then it wouldn't be able to make the correcting burn because it would need to turn around to do the burn, putting the telescope in sunlight which would damage the instruments.	1643042697.0	hu1cyq1	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1cyq1/

fhodm	L1 2 and 3 are saddle points, while L4 and 5 are 'hills'. But either way the gravitational 'contours' do not tell the whole story. In the rotating reference frame there is a Coriolis force. This means that an object drifting away from a Lagrange point will not 'fall' straight but will have its trajectory curved by the Coriolis effect. This is what creates stable orbits around L4 and L5 and must also be considered for the (unstable) orbits around L1/2/3.	1643042829.0	hu1dbca	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1dbca/

xerioos	Menopause doesnt happen because you run out of eggs. Menopause is when your body decides to stop maintaining your ovaries. There will be lots of eggs left over, but hormonal changes will cause cell death and follicular atrophy. Eventually your ovary just becomes a mass of tissue that doesn't really do anything, i.e. produce estrogen.  Repeated pregnancies might increase overall estrogen levels and some complex feedback loops might contribute to ovary maintenance, but at the end of the day, estrogen production eventually ceases causing menopause.	1643042845.0	hu1dcxq	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/hu1dcxq/

8ds2uzku	Exactly, it’s a “no” in the sense of not a direct causal relationship. Any relative movement between a fluid and object doesn’t necessarily qualify as causing vacuum. More generally  for most applications, at the boundary we tend to assume 0 fluid speed relative to the moving surface. There’s a layer if molecules of both that are “glued” together when there’s not slipping or shearing. I’ve read that this boundary condition was observed by da vinci when he studied streams and vortices but I’m not sure if he was the first to observe it. E.g. in a pipe of flowing water the flow speed on the metal is 0 while in the middle of the pipe the flow is maximum and there’s a gradient between 0 and max decreasing with increasing radius.	1643043046.0	hu1dwmz	t3_sbehp5	t1_hu19hpv	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu1dwmz/

arvol	L2 is like a ridge. You have to work to climb up one side, but if you're not careful you'll fall right off the other side once you reach the top.   Since JWST only has a thruster on one side, they just keep using that to gently shove it up the slope, careful to never actually reach the top or it'll fall off down the other side. So it will periodically start falling back down toward us, and we will use the thruster to push it back up again, like batting a ball up a hill when it starts to roll back down.	1643043275.0	hu1ej0j	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1ej0j/

They planned a roughly 10 year lifespan, with the caveat that depending on how much fuel needed to be expended to correct its orbit after launch, that lifespan could be cut down to 5 years.

629tsjo1	There are debris accumulated there, but there's not more because it doesn't just require debris show up there, the debris has to show up and "stop". This is in the grand scheme of things very unlikely as the object would have had to already have an orbit similar to Earth's or form from a lucky crash: I'm guessing the majority of it accumulated around the same time the moon was formed, just out of more energetic ejecta, as well as dust from Earth's early accretion disk that was in just the right place at the right time. I can also imagine some of it getting there by photon pressure acting in just the right way.	1643043787.0	hu1fwxc	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1fwxc/

fwj3x	[Because it kills their red blood cells.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5727655/)  At high doses, vitamin C seems to promote the production of hydrogen peroxide, a very reactive molecule that can cause a lot of damage to cells. Our cells have a variety of ways of dealing with excess hydrogen peroxide...but red blood cells, specifically, aren't "normal" cells. They don't have mitochondria, they don't have a nucleus, they don't have DNA or ribosomes to make new proteins *from* DNA—when they enter the bloodstream, they eject their nucleus and their organelles so they can carry more oxygen!  So without DNA or ribosomes or mitochondria, red blood cells are dependent on a series of chemical reactions—something called the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose_phosphate_pathway)—to protect them from peroxides. The Pentose phosphate pathway helps produce glutathione peroxidase, which in turn neutralizes excess peroxides and protects the red blood cell from reactive oxygen damage.  A catalyst for the very first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, however, is G6PD. Without enough G6PD on hand to make enough glutahione peroxidase, the red blood cells in a person with G6PD deficiency rapidly take on damage, which deteriorates their ability to transport oxygen. In the case study linked above, a man who received a single high-dose of vitamin C was short of breath within an hour.	1643043938.0	hu1gbgp	t3_sbjffp	t3_sbjffp	/r/askscience/comments/sbjffp/why_a_high_dose_of_vitamin_c_pose_risk_for_people/hu1gbgp/
gsx16	Another aspect to all this besides what's already been said is that on a cosmic time scale, a (tiny) third body in any realistic system other than nested near-circular orbits is only fleetingly stable.   On paper you can make it work out fine, but in practice the perturbations from very distant objects or the small object being a hair away from the idealized Lagrange point (or an orbit around it) will add up. Whether that goes haywire after a hundred days or a hundred millennia depends on the ratios of mass and distance between the three bodies involved. Jupiter is great for this. Earth only has a few dinky rocks that might last ~10,000 years. The limiting factor there is how incredibly precise their trajectory had to be to end up in those spots. Like hitting a 9-iron shot at a par 3 and having it land on *top* of the flagpole.	1643043973.0	hu1geuf	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1geuf/

d53772v0	Any light can damage your eyes. But UV has 2 special problems. First, it's higher energy than visible light, and the kind of energy level that organic compounds just love to absorb and subsequently disintegrate or denaturize. Of course, the compounds in your eyes love to absorb visible light as well, that's somewhat important for the whole seeing thing, but for this there are mechanisms in place to get the energy out of the system without damaging anything, to reverse all changes that resulted from the absorption of photons.   The second problem with UV is, we can't see it. If a flash of yellow light comes your way, you might blink and your iris will contract to limit the amount of light that can enter your eye. That doesn't happen with UV, it can just enter your eye unimpeded. You might also just consciously look away from a blinding visible light since you perceive it as uncomfortable, that doesn't happen with UV.  And there is a third, somewhat paradoxical thing that is relevant for all eye damage, e.g. visible laser light as well. Your brain is amazingly powerful when it comes to filling in missing information. That means if you suffer a bit of eye damage, you burn a little blind spot into your retina, you won't realize. Your brain will just do a bit more work in the image processing department and you won't even notice a thing. Only once you have accumulated so much eye damage that your brain can no longer fix your vision "software-side", you'll notice, and then it's far too late. That's why you should take warnings seriously about not looking directly into the sun or a laser. You might do it and find that you notice no difference. You might think "I've looked into the sun/a laser 20 times and never did anything happen, guess it's safe or I'm immune", just to find out at your 21st try that you've ruined your vision forever.	1643044257.0	hu1h6e1	t3_sbjj0a	t3_sbjj0a	/r/askscience/comments/sbjj0a/is_visible_light_damaging_to_your_eyes_and_vision/hu1h6e1/

t1ux6	Short answer is L1,2,3 aren’t stable so whatever is there needs constant orbital maintenance or it will wander away eventually.  L4,5 are stable and stuff does accumulate there. Look up the Greek and Trojan asteroids.

gkq714gr	Well, I'm just going to point out to bacteria in the intestine. Specifically large intestine (colon). Plenty of bacterial flora lives there and is essential for human well-being. Killing them off (oral antibiotics for example) gives room for more harmful bacteria. Not going to specifics, but a balanced flora is required.  Some of these bacteria are beneficial for digestion as well. At least few studies have linked the balance of flora to diseases such as Parkinson's (there isn't exactly solid proof or consensus, more of a correlation). If the bacteria end up in a wrong place, they can quite well kill the person though. Ruptured bowel causes peritonitis (infection of the peritoneal cavity).  Now, the intestinal bacteria aren't exactly called parasitic. Parasitic is used mostly to describe something that harms the host while benefiting itself (like said in another reply, there are grey areas, it isn't a definition). But for fantasy literature purposes, you can just say that parasites become symbiotic at some point.	1643044406.0	hu1hkpv	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/hu1hkpv/

nwo8b	This is kind of the raison de etre of core chemistry curricula of organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Organic or inorganic help you understand the key building blocks of doing things to molecules. If organic, is there precedence for moving functional groups or cutting this sort of molecule in half etc. If inorganic, are you dealing with purely ionic chemistry, is there an expected starting and ending crystal geometry etc. Physical chemistry helps you understand how to get things to the physical behavior that will best benefit the sort of thing you want to do. Can I melt this? Vaporize it? Get it in solution? How do I do it? How do I contain it or not?  This gives you the language for the next steps, which is first a literature search to find out what's the nearest thing someone has done to what you want to do. There will be several, and you need to start synthesizing your method based on how they can or can't be conceptually combined. Beside literature there is also physical simulation if you're lucky enough to have credit for mainframe time. Depending how well the thing you want to do is previously studied and how accurate the models are in your specific circumstance, you will have 1 to 100s of candidate synthesis methods. All that's left to do is try them out, dialing in the final conditions based on your experiments.  Chemistry research is sometimes (controversially) bucketed into the realms of theoretical, synthesis, and industrial chemistry. No one person is doing all the steps of theorizing a physical chemical phenomena, seeing how it works to affect chemicals in a lab, then figuring out how to scale it to useful industrial scales. The steps above are largely in that synthesis domain where the entire point of your research is to take some idea like "take AB and C and make AC" and see how many different ways you can make it happen. This builds up that core of chemical synthesis that is then available in college courses and literature searches for someone doing the next steps of "take AC and D and make AD" or "make AC profitably in a manufacturing facility." It's all iterative.	1643044601.0	hu1i3rs	t3_sbplyd	t3_sbplyd	/r/askscience/comments/sbplyd/how_would_you_find_out_what_conditions_are_needed/hu1i3rs/
qph6p	Partially, yes.  The green objects in that gif are in the lagrange points, but the red objects are hildra astroids ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid ), who also "shepherded" along, and in a 2/3 resonance with jupiter.   Jupiter and the Sun together influence most of the region around jupiters orbit. "extreme" points on this region are called the Lagrange points (where the forces cancel eachother out), however any other point in the orbit still gets influenced by both the sun and jupiter. Close to the sun and far beyond jupiter's orbit it is mainly the sun that influences things, but in orbits closer to jupiter, the massive influence of jupiter decides how things go.  Some objects get pulled into the L4, L5 points, but other objects still get influenced by jupiter.	1643044711.0	hu1ieip	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1dqaf	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1ieip/
n1ciu	Of you balance a stick on your hand with a tennis ball on top, that's like L1 L2 and L3. It'll stay there as long as you make small adjustments as needed. Once you stop adjusting the ball will eventually fall off.  L4 and L5 are like a tennis ball hanging from a string. No outside control needed to keep it there.  There is of course a lot more to it, but this should give you an idea.	1643044714.0	hu1ierr	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu19cl6	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1ierr/
y2qs8	As some have alluded to, L4/L5 are more stable than the other Lagrange points, but technically on long time scales they are also unstable. There really can’t be a truly stable gravitational fixed point in a real universe with chaotic interaction of many gravitational bodies. This would be the case even if only the sun, earth, and moon existed, but is further exacerbated by Jupiter and other planets/asteroids/moons/stars/galaxies.  However, practically speaking we can call these 2 points stable, and there is accumulated material.	1643044733.0	hu1igpr	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1igpr/

f5wdh	Hubble is in low Earth orbit and received a few maintenance visits while the space shuttle was active.  It's in easy enough reach that if we get to it before its orbit decays and it falls back to Earth in the next 8-18 years, we can do so.  (there was a proposal in 2017 for a private company to have a shot at that.)	1643045160.0	hu1jmlj	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1foby	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1jmlj/
4y3e1	That said, it does take effort. The JWST has small rocket boosters for course correction. This is why the perfect launch was such a big deal. The onboard fuel would have been needed to correct any launch anomalies, but since it went so well, it preserved fuel that will be used to keep JWST in position, this extending the mission length.	1643045232.0	hu1jtne	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bz2v	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1jtne/
xwpqi	L1, L2, L3 are more like mountain passes or "saddle points", though this description isn't entirely accurate.  They're unstable to motion in one direction but not the other.

6cviuf6	What you describe would be unethical, yes, but that's not the only way to get non-covid related info. For example, you could look at demographic information and whether or not the person was showing symptoms to determine what groups are more likely to get tested and under what conditions. If one group tends to get tested without symptoms, while another mainly gets tested when they *do* have symptoms, there are certain conclusions you could draw from that without violating patient privacy	1643045692.0	hu1l33p	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu0nxxe	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1l33p/

12z7mc	It depends and the value of such data used correctly is immense, most use of modern data science is done without peoples knowledge or consent, and most marketing manipulation is done without peoples knowledge or consent, Russian use of bots in social media to gain the election results in Eastern Europe, UK and USA shows that by identifying and targeting concerns among groups then associating them negatively with more.extreme actions you can easily mass manipulate entire groups of people. In the UK it was queues of immigrants from Syria and Iraq waiting behind EU borders, UK far right groups used these images alongside images of war and terror to link these together, same with the caravan of people walking from Ecuador and Panama to the Us, Trump used that and images of Mexican drug gangs to sell anti immigration messages. Sadly the Internet makes it easy to control weak minded people - think qanon and pizzagate recently.   So yes if people are aware they are being manipulated they will be alienated, the trick is to not let them be aware. Indirect marketing can be used to loosen the areas of concern without directly tackling the issue. You would never stick up a billboard saying jab yourself.against covid, you might breakdown a less scarey more traditional disease like flu jabs, or you might promote healthier diets and exercise to raise body awareness etc.	1643047427.0	hu1pucz	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu1dnuz	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1pucz/

5qr6c	There are, but only at L4 and L5.  The other points aren't passively stable and any small perturbation will kick anything sitting at the point off of it and away.  So, the only way to stay at L1, L2, and L3 is with active station keeping, which means nothings going to be there unless we keep it there.  L4 and L5 are more stable and objects at those points will tend to passively return when they are slightly nudged off.    The thing to remember is that the Lagrange points are really points in a 2-body gravitational system, i.e. they work and exist when only 2 major gravitational objects are considered.  But the Solar System isn't a 2-body system and even though the Earth-Moon system is, it exists as part of the wider solar system.  That means that there are always going to be perturbations tending to nudge the object at the Lagrange point.	1643047590.0	hu1qa0n	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1qa0n/

2hhmrodl	There are 2 aspects of light that matter for damaging something with light  1. Wavelength (energy of the photons) [see EM spectrum](https://cdn.britannica.com/75/95275-050-5FC96002/Radio-waves-rays-light-gamma-ultraviolet-electromagnetic.jpg) 2. Intensity (number of photos)  UV light has a short wavelength, and so it has higher energy photons than visible light. UV photons have enough energy to break bonds in DNA, which is why UV can damage tissue and cause cancer. Meanwhile visible light (as well as IR, microwave, radio etc.)  can't break those bonds. If you increase the intensity/brightness, i.e. number of photons visible light will still not break those bonds directly because each photon lacks the energy required to do so. However higher intensities of visible light will begin to heat or even burn whatever is absorbing the light so it can still cause damage. Interestingly this explanation, or at least one very similar to it, was first made by Albert Einstein and he eventually won the nobel prize in physics for it ([photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect)).   TLDR: Any type of light can burn/damage your eyes if it's intensity is high enough, UV light (and higher) can also cause additional damage to the DNA directly (making it particularly bad).	1643048008.0	hu1reo5	t3_sbjj0a	t3_sbjj0a	/r/askscience/comments/sbjj0a/is_visible_light_damaging_to_your_eyes_and_vision/hu1reo5/

The suffering because others could be as innocuous from our perspective as not getting them a job when they apply for it, or most bullying during childhood and adolescence, the effects of which most people attempt to separate and split into other types of crime in order to explain the psychological effect.  And ultimately when we divert back to the argument of neurotransmitters, we do so with the intent to separate the effect of their lack of integrity, from the cause which created that lack of integrity in the first place; external factors which come in the form of the suffering we cause others, both in extreme and less extreme ways	1643048917.0	hu1tv2r	t3_sawfex	t1_hty8eho	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu1tv2r/

Spoiler: The healthier you eat, the better off you are.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219480/  Also, there are plenty of studies that show that if you have a BMI of 30+, that you have about somewhere like a 33% increased chance of dying as per a study of risk back in July 2021.   And about just being obese even earlier. Like this article here points out.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/08/covid-cdc-study-finds-roughly-78percent-of-people-hospitalized-were-overweight-or-obese.html  I remember seeing a study where they never were able to register anyone dying with a BMI of ≥23, IF they were healthy and under 50. Problem is that there is an obesity epidemic in many Western countries. Albeit governments could have pushed far more broad awareness of this. Instead of well, next to nothing at all in this regard.	1643049669.0	hu1vvy6	t3_sb1b9v	t3_sb1b9v	/r/askscience/comments/sb1b9v/has_there_been_a_comparison_study_for_nutrition/hu1vvy6/

It will actively keep itself in orbit at L2 expending fuel the entire time.  Fortunately, things have gone off without a hitch, and the telescope will have enough fuel for more like 20 years now.	1643050108.0	hu1x2ju	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1x2ju/
cdmeu	I've seen animations of James's orbit around the LaGrange point. I know there's no mass in the centre, and it's obviously not a standard orbit like one around a massive object, but what actually is causing this "orbit"? Is it just rolling around in this pringle shape and boosting back up every time, twice per complete orbit, or do the boosts not occur that frequently?	1643050139.0	hu1x5il	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1chhe	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1x5il/

72wgbmcl	Everyone has mostly answered the question, but being a lab tech, thought I'd weigh in. It's true, after collecting your sample all day, we keep about 20mL and flush the rest down the toilet. Most tests we don't have any additive, since bacterial growth won't affect them. Some tests have 25mL of hydrochloric acid. We don't instruct patients to keep it in the fridge, just a cool dark place, like beside the toilet. Your output changes throughout the day, so this will give us an average daily output. We also calculate creatinine clearance using the total volume of sample, which can tell the doctors how effectively your kidney are filtering everything out.	1643050916.0	hu1z90v	t3_sboq6i	t3_sboq6i	/r/askscience/comments/sboq6i/how_do_hospitals_use_1day_urine_to_determine/hu1z90v/

kug4o	Imagine you place a ball on the very very top of a hill. If it's perfectly balanced at the top, it won't roll in any direction. But if a slight breeze comes along, it gets pushed just a little bit off the top, and then it starts to roll downhill. If you act right when it happens, it doesn't take much effort to push the ball back up the hill and place it at the top. You might be able to just kick it a little bit without moving yourself even. But if you wait too long, the ball will roll faster and farther down the hill, and you'll have to run after it. It might even get so fast you can't keep up, and you have no hope of putting the ball back on the hill.  L1, L2, and L3 work kinda the same way. If the telescope starts to "roll" a little bit from the top of the "hill", it only takes a very small thrust to put it back. The JWST has enough fuel on board to keep it in place at the top of our hill for 20 years or so.	1643051188.0	hu1zz83	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1zz83/

gbrj0	In the direction of the orbit, L2 is stable; that's the high parts of the saddle. Without any station keeping burns, James Webb would continue to orbit L2, but it would slowly fall towards earth.  An object perfectly at L2 is unstable in the line pointing to the central object but stable perpendicular to that line.  James Webb will push almost far enough from Earth to L2 but will be careful to not go too far. It will naturally orbit around L2 due to the combined gravity of the Earth and Sun, but every several weeks they will burn a little bit of fuel to push away from the Sun to keep from falling towards the sun, but not quite enough to go too far and start falling away from the sun, which it couldn't recover from.	1643051709.0	hu21d2c	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu21d2c/

gbrj0	The heat shield will act like a solar sail. It isn't nearly string enough to overcome the mass of the spacecraft and push it into deep space, but unequal solar pressure will try to make it rotate, which the telescope will have to counteract using its momentum wheels and eventually fuel in its maneuvering thrusters.  They added a sun flap to make it cancel out as much as possible, but that will just reduce how often they have to use the thrusters to cancel out the build up of momentum in the momentum wheels.	1643051956.0	hu220j4	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1hgi8	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu220j4/

79bbv7x9	To add to the previous answers: UV, visble light, and infrared is dangerous for your eyes, depending of course on the intensity. But they are dangerous at slightly different positions, see for example this sketch: http://photobiology.info/Rozanowska_files/Fig1.png UV is absorbed before it can even reach the retina and rather damage for example the iris (and your skin of course). Visible light is obviously reaching the retina as it should, and so does infrared light. Infrared light is also very well focused by the lens, and thus will be concentrated on a small area on the retina. As you don't see it, it can cause damage there until it is too late and the respective area is irreversible damaged.	1643052727.0	hu24276	t3_sbjj0a	t3_sbjj0a	/r/askscience/comments/sbjj0a/is_visible_light_damaging_to_your_eyes_and_vision/hu24276/

16mujs	L4 and L5 are actually more like plateaus, though. They're hilltops - every way is down, and there is a gradient. When the orbiting body is of a comparable mass to the larger (roughly bigger than 1/25th the mass), then the gradient is too steep and L4 and L5 are unstable.  But when the orbiting body is significantly smaller, there's a more gentle gradient. Things still start rolling off - but this is a rotating reference frame, so you get a Coriolis force, which keeps them rolling around the plateau.	1643052899.0	hu24ibd	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu19cl6	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu24ibd/
fiuvu	I don't know why everyone is replying that it is one-shot. The JWST was explicitly designed to accept a refueling mission. There's no money allocated for one, and there's not even a design for what that mission might look like, but the telescope is designed to be refueled.  The telescope itself can't be serviced (replace instruments) in the same way that Hubble was. But it was designed to be refueled.	1643052974.0	hu24pgt	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1dcp4	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu24pgt/

They all are moving, but they're all generally going the same direction and speed, so they don't run into each other, and if you change your reference point from 'earth' to one of the balls, the balls would all generally seem to stay in about the same spot, while everything else would be moving.	1643053234.0	hu25dyb	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu22xdt	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu25dyb/
2lkl08o2	Aside from it being unethical, someone would have to be paying these testing folks to isolate and test the samples for anything else, and to store them and their isolates for a prolonged period of time. And that's not happening. Freezer space is very expensive when you take into account the cost of the freezer, the maintenance, the service contract, the very limited space within, and the electricity they take to run.  Then, there's the costs of testing the samples for literally anything else, like, idk, ancestry? genetic diseases? metabolites?  Can't get blood chemistry from oral/nasal swabs so the testing is limited, and massively expensive. With the huge demand for testing, most places only can afford to even hold on to your sample for a few extra days after testing, just in case you need a re-test for some reason.  They are definitely disposing of the samples as soon as they legally can, and only testing them for covid (or covid plus flu if they are licensed for that).	1643053271.0	hu25het	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu25het/

fwp4z	What you haven't mentioned is how fast those dust particles are coming. Even if (hypothetically) they perfectly matched Earth's velocity around the Sun, just the fall into Earth would accelerate them to 11.2 km/s, so they inevitably burn up when they reach the top of the atmosphere. Some lifeforms have been observed to survive the harsh environment in space (in a dormant state), but they cannot survive the extreme temperatures of atmospheric entry.  This is actually the weak link in the panspermia theory. Their best chance to survive would be deep in a crack in a meteor, so that they are not exposed to the extremely hot gases outside during entry.

c8h22	The "saddle" is a 4d one: gravitational strength in 3d space (pretty sure).  It doesn't rotate relative to the sun because the 'up' and 'down' bits of the saddle are relative concentrations of gravitational pull, instead of a literal curve in space.	1643054065.0	hu27kon	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1uvfy	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu27kon/

g8l7r	Because practically, it *is* a one-shot mission.  Yes, JWST was designed to accept a potential refueling mission. However, currently no technology exists for a refueling-mission at L2 and none is planned. NASA is certain that no manned mission to L2 can be achieved within the next decade. To design a robotic refueling mission from scratch would take many years and billions of dollars. There is a very big chance this is not going to happen in the next few years and after that it would be too late anyways.   So while, theoretically, JWST could be refueled all parties accept this is probably not going to happen.	1643054162.0	hu27tm3	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu24pgt	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu27tm3/

63yca	It rotates in a sense but it's simpler to think about the Lagrange points in a rotating reference frame, where the earth and sun are "stationary."  In that frame, it doesn't rotate at all.  This is also why people are talking about the forces being towards/away from the sun, or perpendicular.	1643054297.0	hu286br	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1uvfy	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu286br/

1778iy	I am far from the most qualified person to answer this question but from what I understand there are only boosters on the hot side, facing away from the optics. This is also part of the reason the orbit is designed like it is, because if it starts sliding down the hill away from us it won’t be able to correct back.  Would appreciate corrections if I’m wrong though, just how I understood it.	1643054600.0	hu28yrb	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu205g7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu28yrb/

h4ez5	Even if we could do a repair mission on Hubble, that money would probably be better spent on a replacement. Hubble is near the end of its life in many ways and its technology is decades out of date.   NASA has [two more Hubble style](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasa-gets-military-spy-telescopes-for-astronomy/2012/06/04/gJQAsT6UDV_story.html) telescopes in storage with better optics.

pnh7tv	Vacuum chambers let us remove all the unwanted material from the reactor/experiment. Once the fuel is added, it's not a vacuum anymore.  Also, there are many different approaches to fusion. Inertial confinement fusion experiments actually reach remarkable pressures, they are just short lived, but all the fusion reactions occur within a nanosecond or so.  Magnetic confinement uses significantly lower pressures, but much longer confinement times.	1643055176.0	hu2ag79	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu2ag79/

16qcpz	They can't really move around within the L point, because sooner or later they would exit the zone of gravitational stability and fall away.  L4 and L5 are like flat parking lots on top of hills.  If you skate up there and brake to a halt, you just sit there.  But, if you give your skateboard a push and it starts to roll, it will roll slowly past all the other parked cars and everything, and eventually get to the edge of the parking lot, where the hill starts to slope down.  And then it will start to roll faster, and faster... and unless you make an effort to go back, you're never getting back to the L point again.  L1, L2, and L3 are more like a convex-bottomed half-pipe on top of a hill.  In one direction, you are actually very stable -- you can accelerate up the sides of the half pipe and it will actually bring you back down again until you come to a stop....except you won't stop, quite, you will start to drift sideways out of the half pipe altogether and down the hill.  Unless you exert yourself to stay in.  Which is why James Webb needs to spend fuel to stay in the L2.	1643055322.0	hu2atua	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu22xdt	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2atua/

77men	I think it's more along the lines of: they already have the momentum flap. Instead of it being a fixed structure, have it be a movable structure that can add or reduce the amount of photon pressure that is applied (possibly with more flaps to get more degrees of control). OFC you can't be perfectly still on an unstable point, but you don't have to generate all your dV to stay near the point from propellant.	1643055428.0	hu2b3t1	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1nfnb	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2b3t1/
h33l934d	I'm glad to see this answer, as it's the orbit *around* the L2 point that makes stationkeeping feasible.  If it tried to pin itself exactly on that point it would quickly run out of fuel.  But thanks to its bullseye launch it has enough maneuvering fuel to maintain that orbit-within-an-orbit for twenty years.	1643055642.0	hu2bo6x	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1chm1	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2bo6x/
tgcet	I thought it was really a hill. And at the top of the hill the slope is zero so as long as you keep up with micro adjustments you can easily stay on top of the hill.  Whereas once you are on the slope of the hill, you are battling a slope.	1643055700.0	hu2btk3	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1chhe	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2btk3/
g4fkh	This took me a bit to understand as well.  All the animations seem to just gloss over something that seems quite magical at first.  What helped my understand is to imagine a satellite just ahead of the L2 point.  The Earth's gravity will act to drag it back toward L2.  The same thing happens if it's just behind L2: gravity will act to drag it back.  This means L2 is stable in the orbital direction.  And the motion oscillates: as it's dragged back, momentum will cause it to overshoot past L2 in the other direction, and gravity drags it back once more.  Similarly, look at a point above or below the orbital plane.  The same as before, Earth's gravity will pull it back toward the plane.  This also oscillates as above.  Combine the two motions together and you get an "orbit" around L2.  It's not a real orbit, it only looks that way if you use a rotating frame of reference at L2.  It's really orbiting the sun, but bobbing up and down and speeding up and down as it mildly interacts with Earth's gravity.	1643055867.0	hu2c957	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2c957/
i1if5	It isn't really in an orbit around th L point since as you said, there is no mass there to orbit. But in the rotating reference frame that places the L point stationary, the JWST appears to orbit around it.   Imagine a satellite in geosynchronous orbit so it stays over a single point. Now imagine that satellite has a slightly elliptical orbit so the on average it maintains the geosync orbit, but sometimes it is a little closer and faster and sometimes further and slower. From the point of view of someone below it it would appear to circle the geosync point, but there is nothing there to orbit.	1643055907.0	hu2cd1k	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2cd1k/
112l9j	Short version, almost all the burn is on the hot side of the craft.    The equipment on JWST needs to be on the cold side, and as said better by the scientists in this thread, the main use of fuel is to fight the slight falling-towards-the-Sun (which also happens to be towards Earth).   So all the propellant and hot gas is mostly in the vector away from the equipment.	1643055968.0	hu2cisw	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2an6b	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2cisw/
4uof9	So if humans were to put a satellite and the most stable Lagrange point in the solar system how long could it reasonably stay in that location?	1643055996.0	hu2clfg	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1geuf	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2clfg/
6il0q	Because Lagrange points don't suck. Any moving object from outside the point will pass through the point just as if it were a point gravity. Only if two objects happen to arrive at exactly the same time from opposite directions and collide there can they stay at the point. That's incredibly unlikely, and even when it does happen, another passing object can just as easily knock it back out again. The exception is very small objects, basically dust, which is light enough to be perturbed by even solar wind.	1643056409.0	hu2dnx3	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2dnx3/

osv4opn	Not being a rocket scientist, I'd assume it's because the propellant is being shot off pretty quickly. So wouldn't hang around long enough to meaningfully impact picture quality. Might just need to wait a day. Or maybe it would impact it, but the quality is still better than the faint atmospheric whisps the Hubble is in.	1643056941.0	hu2f27t	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2an6b	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2f27t/
3pp7o	Nah. Thrusters throw out matter, but that matter is going in the opposite direction from the telescope, and it's more of 'tiny particles' that separate from each other and are essentially completely transparent because of the rapidly diffusing matter after after a tiny amount of time, than any sort of 'cloud'.   So, even if the telescope suddenlyturned in the direction of where it previously thrusted, it wouldn't be any sort of issue after a few seconds.	1643056958.0	hu2f3u4	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2an6b	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2f3u4/

gzspz	> In theory, they could just permanently keep it on the far side of the saddle point, right?  No.  On the far side of the Lagrange point its velocity (equal to the Moon's orbital velocity) would overwhelm the gravitational pull of the Earth.  It would drift away.  In order to keep on-station, it would have to thrust Earthward.   However, that means thrusting near the mirror and around all that science gear that they've worked so hard to keep cold.  In other words, if they have to thrust that way, they screw up the instruments.  So it is far better to keep the Webb on this side of the  Lagrange point and only use thrusters on the far side of the heat shield from the telescope itself.	1643057493.0	hu2giqe	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu27l3y	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2giqe/
dc6t4	>Is it just rolling around in this pringle shape and boosting back up every time, twice per complete orbit, or do the boosts not occur that frequently?  Okay, so the pringle shape works when considering two dimensions (with the third dimension of the pringle being the gravitational potential energy). Usually this is used with the two dimensions being the distance from Earth and the orbital direction. But there is a third dimension to consider: the height above the orbital plane. It turns out L2 is stable in the orbital direction and in displacement from the orbital plane, but unstable in distance from Earth. So the orbit of the JWST is in the two stable dimensions. So it doesn't need to go back "up" the pringle, because it is orbiting in such a way that it never goes "down" the pringle.	1643057640.0	hu2gwuc	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2gwuc/

It's surprising to me that the combination of two gravitational fields ends up with Langrange points on the orbit of the smaller body. Am I missing something?

4nh76	1. There is...  2. You need to think of them more like the tops of a gravitational saddle than the bottom of a gravitational bucket.

They're zones of stability, but not gravity wells.	1643059110.0	hu2ktsl	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2ktsl/
68e5u1yf	In many cases, you can't predict that. It's done through experimentation (for reactions that are done in academic labs as part of research experiments). If you run a reaction and get a ton of oxidation products, then you might hypothesize that you have to do it under an inert atmosphere.

68e5u1yf	In your specific example, you're not really comparing apples to apples. Table salt is Na-Cl, which is individually Na+ and Cl-. That is, they are both stable ions because they have each already given up and received an electron, respectively, to create a stable shell. Elemental Na is dangerous because it wants to give up an electron to form the more stable Na+.

12b6qt	Maybe someday, but moving parts in space is super duper hard. The transformer like deployment of the sails, the mirrors, the secondary mirror... Everyone was gulping and cringing at the number of things that had to move and click into place.   Things in space vacuum weld together. Two pieces of metal touching each other on earth have tiny contaminants and gasses keeping them apart. In space two pieces of metal touching can be indistinguishable from one piece of metal... and then it literally are one.   Everything is also going to change size and shape as it comes to a new, insane equilibrium temperature where the solar side is crazy hot and the shade side is mega cold. You need all of your joints to move and continue to function despite the temperture fluctuations.   Make sure to bring plenty of self applicating space lube!  I could imagine maintaining a continuous shape and just rotating it to change the amout of solar pressure and steer the craft, but that would mess up the instruments which need the shade to keep them cold.   The other thing is that the solar shade was already perhaps the hardest and riskiest part of the deployment. Making it into an even larger sail would mean fitting an even more ridiculous object into the nose cone of a rocket.	1643061753.0	hu2ru9w	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2b3t1	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2ru9w/

3j9zpa9d	Some good answers here, but another consideration is heat.  The management of unwanted heat gain is paramount in the design of the JWST. They have gone to extreme lengths to keep the cool side of the telescope as cold as possible, so adding a bank of solar panels on the hot side which is big enough to power an ion engine would have been counterproductive. IIRC, The telescope has less than 1000 W to operate everything on board, including the refrigeration compressor, which is one of its major power draws  The bipropellant thrusters that the telescope uses for station keeping are less fuel efficient than an ion engine, but they take almost no electricity to operate, just the actuation of valves with solenoids. In fact, the design of the telescope uses an abnormally large number of mechanical relays and solenoids for this reason as well,  unlike semi conductors they take no power at all in the resting state.	1643062714.0	hu2ubvl	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2k8b4	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2ubvl/

gbrj0	Yes, exactly. The thrusters are on the hot side, and if it turned around to thrust towards the sun, then the sensitive optics and scientific instruments would be damaged.  Even at launch in the folded configuration, JWST rocked/rotated to limit how long any one part of the mirror structure assembly was exposed to the sun.  The orbit around L2 happens naturally from gravity alone, it needs the thrusters for two reasons: to occasionally push away from the sun and to occasionally cancel out rotation caused by differences in solar radiation.  The JWST uses momentum wheels (reaction wheels) to rotate itself using electricity. However, asymmetry in the sunlight hitting JWST can apply a small torque that can add up over time, and the reaction wheels would eventually hit their maximum speed and couldn't absorb more momentum in that direction. To avoid this, JWST must occasionally use its thrusters to torque JWST in the opposite direction to allow it to slow down the momentum wheels.  Thrusters aiming at the sun but placed off center could allow JWST to apply torque to unload the reaction wheels and thrust away from the sun at the same time, getting double duty from the fuel it burns.	1643063280.0	hu2vsir	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2ng79	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2vsir/

8nlux	You can't just turn it around because the cold side needs to remain cold. Pointing it at the Sun would at worst destroy the sensors and other instruments, and at best would heat it up to the point it would take weeks to get back down to operating temperature.  In the rotating reference frame of the Sun and Earth, there are three forces acting on the JWST: The gravity of the Earth, the gravity of the Sun, and the centrifugal pseudoforce. The centrifugal pseudoforce always points directly away from the Sun (technically, the barycenter of the Earth/Sun system, but that's close enough), but the Earth isn't along the JWST-Sun line. There is a small component of the Earth's gravity towards L2 that isn't balanced by either the Sun or centrifugal pseudoforce.  That unbalanced component of Earth's gravity is what makes it orbit L2 in the rotating frame.	1643063480.0	hu2wb2t	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2ng79	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2wb2t/

5jsecumz	You're basically right, but it's worth noting the Kordylewski cloud is present at the L4/L5 points of the Earth-Moon system, not the Earth-Sun system.  The combined gravitational forces of the Earth and Moon are not really massive enough to accumulate large objects around their stable Lagrange points.

3m6d8	It does, but the exhaust from an ion engine has a much higher velocity, so it has a better specific impulse than a conventional rocket, where 'specific impulse' is basically the amount of push you get from a kilogram of fuel.  Although, strictly speaking, xenon isn't fuel, because you're not burning it or reacting it with anything, it's just mass to throw out of the back of the engine so that you can go forwards. A more general term is "reaction mass". In a rocket engine, the fuel + oxidiser, e.g. liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen is your reaction mass.  Anyway, with a better specific impulse, you don't have to carry as much reaction mass with you to get the same impulse.	1643064845.0	hu2zrq2	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2ny96	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2zrq2/

In that orbit, called a [halo orbit, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit)there is an attractive force within its orbital plane, but if it drifts either  outward or inward towards the earth, it will keep drifting.

kb1jo	This is also a concept I'm trying to better understand. But here's my current level of understanding: when JWST is displaced out of the Earth-Sun orbital plane at L2, there will be a net force (gravity plus centrifugal) that points back toward L2. When Webb is given a velocity component perpendicular to this net force, it will orbit the L2 point. In other words, gravity pulls the spacecraft "in" towards the sun and "down" towards the Earth-Sun orbital plane, while the centrifugal force pulls it "out" away from the sun. These forces sum to point "down" to L2, which can then be orbited, just like any simple circular orbit around a body.  Disclaimer: this is probably a gross simplification, or even altogether incorrect.
