gekpw	>Sometimes it's important to explain thing in terms that actually mean things to people  Just blindly stapling words together in some kind of random walk through thought-space isn't "explaining things".

5wevy	It is a vibration in your ear, caused by the changing pressure wave, but the vibration is on a much larger scale than individual molecules.  When we say 'molecules are vibrating', it typically means 'the bonds between atoms in the molecule are vibrating', which is the point monkey is making here. Temperature is a measure of kinetic translational energy in a gas.  If molecules are vibrating (and rotating), they are storing additional energy in the gas on top of the kinetic translational motion that causes pressure, and is measured by temperature.  That's why two gases of different molecules produce the same pressure for a given temperature, but take different amounts of heat energy to change their temperature.	1642693585.0	htgxvkf	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgvd4r	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgxvkf/

axrw5	what they measure in these studies is gray matter volume as seen in an MRI scan. they aren't counting cells, but measuring how much space is taken up by gray matter.  so, you can imagine that the volume might change for many reasons. cell death is one, but more likely causes of reduced volume are changes in cell *size*, essentially atrophy. and those kinds of changes would be reversible - death is not (i.e. you can't really grow new nerve cells in the cortex).	1642693845.0	htgyk3x	t3_s78e8q	t3_s78e8q	/r/askscience/comments/s78e8q/does_abstinence_from_addiction_regrow_grey_matter/htgyk3x/
hgk5l	Sound does travel better over water in many cases -- if the water is colder than the air -- but it's not because it travels *faster*. It's actually because it travels more slowly.  Like other waves, sound waves will refract towards a medium where they travel more slowly. Usually, the atmosphere gets colder the higher you go, so sound gets bent upwards and disappears into the upper atmosphere. But if there happens to be a layer of colder air near the earth (an "inversion"), sound will get bent downward instead of upward, so it's possible to hear things from a greater distance.  The same effect happens with light, where it's called a superior mirage. On hot summer days you can sometimes see islands or ships that are quite far "over the horizon," if you are looking across a cold body of water.	1642694051.0	htgz40d	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgv581	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgz40d/

d9g6t	That's a great question! If you ever take a chemistry or thermodynamics class, you will learn this. An ideal gas is a theoretical model of a gas assuming that all the particles interact only by colliding with one another, not by any other forces (e.g. electro-magnetic forces) and that the average speed of a gas particle is related to its temperature. Virtually all the predictions about ideal gasses are based on these assumptions. Real gasses don't follow the rules of ideal gasses, especially at low temperatures and high pressures. However, as temperatures get higher (to a point, once they become plasmas this breaks down) or pressures get lower, they behave more and more like an ideal gas.   Ideal gasses have very predictable properties that let you determine things like what the density of a gas will be at a given temperature and pressure. The most important rule is the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where P=pressure, V= volume (in an enclosed container), n = the number of particles, T= absolute temperature, degrees above absolute zero, and R is the ideal gas constant (8.31 Joule/mole-Kelvin).  The ideal gas law lets you predict any of those variables as long as you know the other 3 (not counting R, since that's always the same).   I know that's all a lot to take in all at once, but if you ever take a chemistry class, or do some of your own reading, it will become clearer.	1642694130.0	htgzbj9	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgwwlr	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgzbj9/

gekpw	We're talking about a gas, which is a collection of *many* individual particles (think Avogadro's number). The physics of this gas is going to depend on how those individual particles interact with each other.  The simplest case is that they just don't interact with each other at all. And that turns out to be a great description of gases for many applications.	1642694244.0	htgzmh2	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgy0rk	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htgzmh2/
d76le	I study sound. In my experience, by far the biggest misconception that people have about sound is that sound speed increases with density. In all materials, the speed of sound is equal to sqrt(incompressibility / density). Incompressibility is the ratio of pressure change over volume change for small compressions/rarefactions. Note that, with a little bit of math, this agrees exactly with the answer by /u/RobusEtCeleritas for the specific case of ideal gases.  So, density is in the *denominator.* Why do denser materials tend to have higher sound speeds then? Turns out that incompressibility actually increases faster than density as you go from, say, air to water to rock, so air has the lowest sound speed of those examples.  On the other hand, consider a foam of water and air. Water is hard to compress, air is easy. Water is dense, air is light. The incompressibility of the mixture is closer to the air, and the density of the mixture is closer to the water (at least on a log scale). As a result, the foam has an extremely low sound speed due to having a low incompressibility and a high density.	1642694416.0	hth02zq	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth02zq/
ajweh	Thanks for taking the time to explain mate. Let me take a stab at this, excuse any ignorance. So an ideal gas, is gas that's speed and direction is just affected by temperature? And if we know 3 of the 4 variables it would dictate the fourth?  This is just me trying to make sense. Also, what and why is R? I think I understand what constant means. I think this means the interaction between gasses and temperature is always the same for all gasses?	1642695461.0	hth2u1w	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgzbj9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth2u1w/

6y75e	A UV light could still work actually, it would just need to be so powerful that the light coming back from the toy is brighter than everything else.  At night, the toy and UV light interact to emit light in the visible spectrum (fluorescence). Because there is very little other light reaching your eye from other objects, it's easy to detect this source that stands out. During the daytime, the toy is still emitting light when you shine the UV light on it, it's just that that light + the light that is reflecting from the sun is not much brighter than the light being reflected from everything else, so it doesn't stand out. If the UV light was (ridiculously) powerful enough, the toy could be as bright as a lightbulb and that might be easier to spot.	1642696470.0	hth5kft	t3_s8m6cp	t3_s8m6cp	/r/askscience/comments/s8m6cp/is_there_something_similar_to_uv_light_that_would/hth5kft/

gekpw	If the density is low enough, the mean free path (the average distance traveled before interacting with something) can be much larger than the average distance between particles in the gas. So that means that on average, each molecule will simply pass by many other molecules before ever interacting with one. And in such a case, it can be appropriate to neglect their interactions entirely.  You can modify the ideal gas equation of state to account for interactions, but that generally makes it harder to calculate things with little improvements in precision, since the ideal gas model performs so well.	1642696558.0	hth5t48	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth3g1l	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5t48/
d9g6t	Don't be ashamed for wanting to learn. No one is born knowing this stuff, we gotta learn somehow!   So, not direction, just speed. You just assume the particles are moving randomly at an average speed related to temperature, because that's really what temperature IS, it's just the average vibrational energy of particles in a substance.   I kind of glossed over R because it's a little harder to explain. For an ideal gas, it doesn't matter how heavy the particles are. Basically, you can always determine how many atoms are in a liter of gas from the temperature and pressure because of the ideal gas constant, as long as that gas behaves like an ideal gas.  As for WHY it is what it is, that's mostly beyond my own comprehension. But what I do know is that it took scientists many years and many experiments to settle on the value. It is made up of two components, Avogadro's number and Boltzmann's constant. Avogadro's number is 6.02 x 10^23 , and it is defined as the number of atoms or molecules in a mole. A mole is roughly 1 gram of protons or hydrogen atoms (it was defined using carbon so it's a little off for hydrogen, but very very close). Boltzmann's constant is a relation between the kinetic energy of a single particle in a gas and its temperature.	1642696601.0	hth5x9d	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth2u1w	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5x9d/

The way they do that is by measuring 2 different antibodies: against spike protein, and against a different COVID-19 protein (I forget which one). The non-spike antibodies would only result from actual infection.   As a minor wrinkle, if you have non-spike antibodies, your spike antibodies will be from both vaccination and infection; at that point the relative contribution of each can't be teased apart.	1642696695.0	hth66gx	t3_s8mbjb	t3_s8mbjb	/r/askscience/comments/s8mbjb/what_do_common_antibody_tests_reveal_can_they/hth66gx/

btm1a6we	Cause the nerve isn't dead but is not salvageable either.  There is a big hole in our immune system; the nerve endings. They are so delicate that immune system is basically told to stay away from there. Otherwise the immune system could do too much damage.  So, when the nerves in the root canal gets inflamed you can't just clean it, cover it up and wait the body to heal it. The infection can travel inside the nerve bundles and destroy more of the nerve endings. Due to the proximity to your brain we are looking at grave injury or possibly death from untreated infection. So, the best choice is to kill the nerve. Which is the pain you feel, they will deliberately destroy the nerve and insert medication in the canal that will take care of the infection.     This is why cavities that exposes the nerve are so dangerous, there is a "hole" in out defense hidden inside our teeth.	1642697805.0	hth97rs	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hth97rs/

Then Boltzmann's constant tells us how the particles will behave when a force is applied? And using both measurements is considered the constant for ideal gas?

7p334elw	Can I just clarify this is nonsense.  Complications of cavities traveling up the softer tissues inside your teeth has more to do with communication to open spaces in the head.  bottom teeth communicate with the submandibular, submental, lingual, and buccal spaces.  Infections in this area can trigger an infection the can comprise your airway, and/or lead to sepsis.  Infections in particularly your maxillary canines (top pointy teeth in front of your face) can lead to space infections around your eyes leading to loss of vision or brain abscess.

106abc	Another way to think of it is an ideal gas is a real gas but with the equations simplified enough that you can actually solve them.     A similar thing happens with packing problems. If we assume an infinite sized box (an "ideal container") we don't have to worry about having the box and the balls it holds being in the same place at the same time. (I included this because it seems simpler than gases to me. If it's not for you, then just ignore it.) But when you try to put oranges in a crate for shipping? You absolutely have to take the size of the crate into consideration.	1642698683.0	hthbn7b	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgzbj9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthbn7b/

d6t1oytl	> Pressure waves are propagated by molecule interactions through collisions.  For a gas this doesn't give the whole picture.   Imagine a box with a diaphragm which we can move into the box very fast - faster than the speed of sound. Outside the box is gas at atmospheric pressure. Now we withdraw the diaphragm into the box so quickly that no molecules of the gas have moved. The new volume available to the gas, through which we have moved the diaphragm, contains no molecules. Consider the place where the diaphragm was - the volume on one side has an atmospheric pressure of molecules, and the volume on the other has no molecules. Without any collisions between molecules some of the molecules which were already travelling towards the diaphragm will continue in a straight line. But there are no molecules travelling the other way. The atmospheric pressure gas in front of the original position of the diaphragm will decrease in pressure, and the volume without molecules will increase in pressure. The same will happen outwards for subsequent volumes of gas with less extreme differences in the number of molecules. Therefore a pressure wave can move through a gas without collisions.	1642699514.0	hthdz1k	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgv31c	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthdz1k/

As far as i know there are some "hyper-responder", where the cholesterol from food can influence the bloodcholesterol. But there are also some "none-responder" where the food cholesterol has no influence. And because You don't know if you  are the one or the other, its ok to Limit the foodcholesterol. Either way, for both groups, there are still many different factors that can increase blood cholesterol, such as: genetics, sugarintake, low activity, stress, tabac, alcohol etc. And these seem to have a much higher influence.	1642699701.0	hthei8n	t3_s8gy96	t3_s8gy96	/r/askscience/comments/s8gy96/does_dietary_cholesterol_raise_serum_serum/hthei8n/

d9g6t	Well it's not exactly the mass of protons, it's equal to 8 grams of carbon, and it was chosen for historical reasons. If scientists had waited until today to define a mole, it would probably be equal to a gram of protons or something less arbitrary. The exact specifics aren't super important for basic measurements, just that everyone agrees on them.   Boltzmann's constant is the basis for relating the entropy of a system on a macro, measurable scale to its statistical components. Even after taking multiple classes in thermodynamics I have a hard time understanding it, but for practical purposes you can just accept it as a constant and not worry too much about what it means. Just that it comes up a lot in chemistry and thermodynamics and you often need to use these constants when designing chemical processes or machines like engines. The actual derivations are pretty advanced physics and math and beyond my understanding.	1642700844.0	hthhomc	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hthatwf	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthhomc/

It would definitely be faster than an airliner would descend under pretty much any other controlled circumstance, but it's still 'only' going to be something like 6,000 to 8,000 feet per minute; if I (and Google) did the math correctly, 8000 fpm is just shy of 80 knots of vertical velocity. Vmo varies but is generally in excess of 300 kts for jet airliners.

The top of it talks about how IF PRESSURE IS CONSTANT this occurs. Yes ADDING heat to air causes it to expand and generally be less dense and rise etc. HOWEVER, if you added heat to air in a fixed size container it would heat up but the DENSITY would remain the same. Instead the PRESSURE would rise. There are many situations where you could have air at different DENSITY but the same TEMPERATURE. DENSITY does not equal PRESSURE.  As to why it’s faster in hotter air I will leave that up to people with more knowledge than myself.	1642705373.0	hthu5dn	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthu5dn/

4gpe3ud6	There are so many other variables involved in atmospheric density and pressure, let alone flight, that a general answer is impossible. There are a lot of interrelated factors like the amount of atmosphere, gravity, composition, temperature, etc. The relationships are not even absolute--for example lower gravity does not necessarily imply a lower pressure or density. Atmospheres depend on a lot more than gravity and magnetic fields, and we have a lot more to learn. For fictional or hypothetical purposes there are a lot of possibilities. Even the limited sample size of our solar system has different examples to consider.  For level, constant-air-speed flight, the sum of the lift, weight, drag, and thrust vectors must be zero. In the simplest scenario of level flight, lift cancels weight and thrust cancels drag. Weight is linearly proportional to gravity, and lift and drag (at a given velocity) are linearly proportional to air density. Thrust comes from the aircraft engine.  It is indeed possible for flight to be much easier in a low gravity environment. The air pressure at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan (with surface gravity less than 1/7 of Earth's) is \~1.5 atmospheres. Titan's atmosphere is about 20 percent more massive than Earth's, despite having only 40 percent of the radius and 16 percent of its surface area. The surface air is four to five times denser than Earth's because it it is so cold (around -180 C). Generally it is easier to fly on Titan because of the low gravity (lower weight) and denser air (higher lift). (But the higher drag means more thrust is needed.) NASA will be sending a rotorcraft drone to fly around Titan, one much bigger than the Ingenuity demonstrator sent to Mars. Supposedly--all other difficulties like cold unbreathable air aside--a person could even strap on wings and fly on Titan. The cold temperatures cause other problems, though. For example, due to the cold temperature the speed of sound on Titan is \~190 m/s, much lower than the speed of sound on Earth (\~340 m/s at room temperature, \~300 m/s in the cold stratosphere). As an aircraft, or parts of it (i.e. propeller or rotor blades), approaches the speed of sound the aerodynamics become more complicated and difficult to deal with (sound barrier).  Take Venus as another example. At its surface, the air pressure is over 90 atmospheres. The density is over 50 times that of Earth air at sea level (and 1/15 that of liquid water). It is less than 90 because gas density decreases with temperature. The gravity is slightly lower than Earth. Practically speaking, though, flight near the surface of Venus would be much harder than for Earth. The high temperature weakens, in some cases even melts, most materials, especially common electronics. The high pressure necessitates heavier construction more like a submarine than an aircraft. And furthermore, the "air" at the surface of Venus is not even really a gas. Because of the temperature and pressure the CO2 is a [supercritical fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid) with properties of both liquids and gases. At high altitudes, the density and temperature drop, becoming almost Earthlike (though not both temperature and density/pressure at the same altitude, and there is the little matter of sulfuric acid clouds). Flight there would be more or less as difficult as on Earth--though so far the only aircraft on Venus were a couple Soviet balloons.  Another factor is that most powered flight on Earth uses combustion engines, which only work in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. You need to rely on electric power from batteries (for prolonged flight charged by solar or nuclear) to power a propeller or rotor, which (with today's technology at least) increases weight. Or you could bring your own oxidizer and use a rocket, but that would be even less efficient.  Flight is indeed much more difficult on Mars because of the low air density (\~2 percent that at Earth's surface), despite the low gravity (38 percent of Earth's surface). The thin air also can't carry heat away as rapidly, so overheating of motors is a major concern. Again, the cold decreases the speed of sound, decreasing the maximum speed the rotors can be allowed to rotate.  Note, though, that Titan is much less massive than Mars, and both Mars and Venus lack an internally generated magnetic field. There is a lot more to having and retaining a significant atmosphere than surface gravity and magnetic fields.	1642706707.0	hthxpcc	t3_s83qe8	t3_s83qe8	/r/askscience/comments/s83qe8/how_is_our_atmospheric_pressure_connected_to_the/hthxpcc/

fhodm	When root canal treatment is necessary, the nerve is often not fully dead, and is sending the pain signals giving you a severe toothache.  But a properly done root canal is painless because of anaesthesia. If pain is experienced that means the anaesthetic was not adequate. This can be because of unusual anatomy that some people have, or genetic resistance to anaesthetic. Anaesthetic resistance is well known to be associated is red hair. A good dentist will use alternative injection sites or sometimes a different anaesthetic to overcome this. (There's one anaesthetic, I don't remember the name, that dentists usually don't use because it takes many hours to wear off, but they can order it in specially if it's needed for an anaesthetic-resistant patient.)  There may be rare exceptions, but that is by far the normal situation.  The other reason people think root canal treatments are painful is they are remembering the pain of the toothache that the root canal was performed to treat.	1642707324.0	hthzc68	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthzc68/

15v3y2	I've had a couple of root canals but they were recommended by my dentist before there was any pain or inflammation.

gekpw	If the density is low enough, the mean free path (the average distance traveled before interacting with something) can be much larger than the average distance between particles in the gas. So that means that on average, each molecule will simply pass by many other molecules before ever interacting with one. And in such a case, it can be appropriate to neglect their interactions entirely.  You can modify the ideal gas equation of state to account for interactions, but that generally makes it harder to calculate things with little improvements in precision, since the ideal gas model performs so well.	1642696558.0	hth5t48	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth3g1l	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5t48/
d9g6t	Don't be ashamed for wanting to learn. No one is born knowing this stuff, we gotta learn somehow!   So, not direction, just speed. You just assume the particles are moving randomly at an average speed related to temperature, because that's really what temperature IS, it's just the average vibrational energy of particles in a substance.   I kind of glossed over R because it's a little harder to explain. For an ideal gas, it doesn't matter how heavy the particles are. Basically, you can always determine how many atoms are in a liter of gas from the temperature and pressure because of the ideal gas constant, as long as that gas behaves like an ideal gas.  As for WHY it is what it is, that's mostly beyond my own comprehension. But what I do know is that it took scientists many years and many experiments to settle on the value. It is made up of two components, Avogadro's number and Boltzmann's constant. Avogadro's number is 6.02 x 10^23 , and it is defined as the number of atoms or molecules in a mole. A mole is roughly 1 gram of protons or hydrogen atoms (it was defined using carbon so it's a little off for hydrogen, but very very close). Boltzmann's constant is a relation between the kinetic energy of a single particle in a gas and its temperature.	1642696601.0	hth5x9d	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth2u1w	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hth5x9d/

jfvca	Yes, they can get actual antibody concentrations, and yes, they can differentiate between vaccine-induced and infection-induced antibodies.   The way they do that is by measuring 2 different antibodies: against spike protein, and against a different COVID-19 protein (I forget which one). The non-spike antibodies would only result from actual infection.   As a minor wrinkle, if you have non-spike antibodies, your spike antibodies will be from both vaccination and infection; at that point the relative contribution of each can't be teased apart.	1642696695.0	hth66gx	t3_s8mbjb	t3_s8mbjb	/r/askscience/comments/s8mbjb/what_do_common_antibody_tests_reveal_can_they/hth66gx/

ajweh	So similar to the standard for a gram being 1cuibc cm, a mole is a gram worth of single protons? I'm assuming hydrogen isn't important but works because it only has 1 proton? And this mole is a way to measure volume so if we know the volume we could calculate exactly how much gas is inside? Then Boltzmann's constant tells us how the particles will behave when a force is applied? And using both measurements is considered the constant for ideal gas?   So like time and distance can determine the speed, these two factors can determine the speed of gas?  Really do appreciate the time btw.	1642698386.0	hthatwf	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth5x9d	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthatwf/
7p334elw	Can I just clarify this is nonsense.  Complications of cavities traveling up the softer tissues inside your teeth has more to do with communication to open spaces in the head.  bottom teeth communicate with the submandibular, submental, lingual, and buccal spaces.  Infections in this area can trigger an infection the can comprise your airway, and/or lead to sepsis.  Infections in particularly your maxillary canines (top pointy teeth in front of your face) can lead to space infections around your eyes leading to loss of vision or brain abscess.    It doesn’t really have anything to do with the nerves necessarily.  I guess the nerves travel through those spaces along with vessels.  But again, what you said is not correct.	1642698649.0	hthbjvm	t3_s8mble	t1_hth97rs	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthbjvm/
106abc	Another way to think of it is an ideal gas is a real gas but with the equations simplified enough that you can actually solve them.     A similar thing happens with packing problems. If we assume an infinite sized box (an "ideal container") we don't have to worry about having the box and the balls it holds being in the same place at the same time. (I included this because it seems simpler than gases to me. If it's not for you, then just ignore it.) But when you try to put oranges in a crate for shipping? You absolutely have to take the size of the crate into consideration.	1642698683.0	hthbn7b	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgzbj9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthbn7b/

d6t1oytl	> Pressure waves are propagated by molecule interactions through collisions.  For a gas this doesn't give the whole picture.   Imagine a box with a diaphragm which we can move into the box very fast - faster than the speed of sound. Outside the box is gas at atmospheric pressure. Now we withdraw the diaphragm into the box so quickly that no molecules of the gas have moved. The new volume available to the gas, through which we have moved the diaphragm, contains no molecules. Consider the place where the diaphragm was - the volume on one side has an atmospheric pressure of molecules, and the volume on the other has no molecules. Without any collisions between molecules some of the molecules which were already travelling towards the diaphragm will continue in a straight line. But there are no molecules travelling the other way. The atmospheric pressure gas in front of the original position of the diaphragm will decrease in pressure, and the volume without molecules will increase in pressure. The same will happen outwards for subsequent volumes of gas with less extreme differences in the number of molecules. Therefore a pressure wave can move through a gas without collisions.	1642699514.0	hthdz1k	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htgv31c	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthdz1k/

As far as i know there are some "hyper-responder", where the cholesterol from food can influence the bloodcholesterol. But there are also some "none-responder" where the food cholesterol has no influence. And because You don't know if you  are the one or the other, its ok to Limit the foodcholesterol. Either way, for both groups, there are still many different factors that can increase blood cholesterol, such as: genetics, sugarintake, low activity, stress, tabac, alcohol etc. And these seem to have a much higher influence.	1642699701.0	hthei8n	t3_s8gy96	t3_s8gy96	/r/askscience/comments/s8gy96/does_dietary_cholesterol_raise_serum_serum/hthei8n/

d9g6t	Well it's not exactly the mass of protons, it's equal to 8 grams of carbon, and it was chosen for historical reasons. If scientists had waited until today to define a mole, it would probably be equal to a gram of protons or something less arbitrary. The exact specifics aren't super important for basic measurements, just that everyone agrees on them.   Boltzmann's constant is the basis for relating the entropy of a system on a macro, measurable scale to its statistical components. Even after taking multiple classes in thermodynamics I have a hard time understanding it, but for practical purposes you can just accept it as a constant and not worry too much about what it means. Just that it comes up a lot in chemistry and thermodynamics and you often need to use these constants when designing chemical processes or machines like engines. The actual derivations are pretty advanced physics and math and beyond my understanding.	1642700844.0	hthhomc	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hthatwf	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hthhomc/

1xrgwd	>Descent at or near maximum speed (Vmo) with thrust at idle and flight spoilers or speed brakes extended would be almost straight down.  That's something of an exaggeration.  It would definitely be faster than an airliner would descend under pretty much any other controlled circumstance, but it's still 'only' going to be something like 6,000 to 8,000 feet per minute; if I (and Google) did the math correctly, 8000 fpm is just shy of 80 knots of vertical velocity. Vmo varies but is generally in excess of 300 kts for jet airliners.

4gpe3ud6	There are so many other variables involved in atmospheric density and pressure, let alone flight, that a general answer is impossible. There are a lot of interrelated factors like the amount of atmosphere, gravity, composition, temperature, etc. The relationships are not even absolute--for example lower gravity does not necessarily imply a lower pressure or density. Atmospheres depend on a lot more than gravity and magnetic fields, and we have a lot more to learn. For fictional or hypothetical purposes there are a lot of possibilities. Even the limited sample size of our solar system has different examples to consider.  For level, constant-air-speed flight, the sum of the lift, weight, drag, and thrust vectors must be zero. In the simplest scenario of level flight, lift cancels weight and thrust cancels drag. Weight is linearly proportional to gravity, and lift and drag (at a given velocity) are linearly proportional to air density. Thrust comes from the aircraft engine.  [https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/forces.jpg)  It is indeed possible for flight to be much easier in a low gravity environment. The air pressure at the surface of Saturn's moon Titan (with surface gravity less than 1/7 of Earth's) is \~1.5 atmospheres. Titan's atmosphere is about 20 percent more massive than Earth's, despite having only 40 percent of the radius and 16 percent of its surface area. The surface air is four to five times denser than Earth's because it it is so cold (around -180 C). Generally it is easier to fly on Titan because of the low gravity (lower weight) and denser air (higher lift). (But the higher drag means more thrust is needed.) NASA will be sending a rotorcraft drone to fly around Titan, one much bigger than the Ingenuity demonstrator sent to Mars. Supposedly--all other difficulties like cold unbreathable air aside--a person could even strap on wings and fly on Titan. The cold temperatures cause other problems, though. For example, due to the cold temperature the speed of sound on Titan is \~190 m/s, much lower than the speed of sound on Earth (\~340 m/s at room temperature, \~300 m/s in the cold stratosphere). As an aircraft, or parts of it (i.e. propeller or rotor blades), approaches the speed of sound the aerodynamics become more complicated and difficult to deal with (sound barrier).  Take Venus as another example. At its surface, the air pressure is over 90 atmospheres. The density is over 50 times that of Earth air at sea level (and 1/15 that of liquid water). It is less than 90 because gas density decreases with temperature. The gravity is slightly lower than Earth. Practically speaking, though, flight near the surface of Venus would be much harder than for Earth. The high temperature weakens, in some cases even melts, most materials, especially common electronics. The high pressure necessitates heavier construction more like a submarine than an aircraft. And furthermore, the "air" at the surface of Venus is not even really a gas. Because of the temperature and pressure the CO2 is a [supercritical fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid) with properties of both liquids and gases. At high altitudes, the density and temperature drop, becoming almost Earthlike (though not both temperature and density/pressure at the same altitude, and there is the little matter of sulfuric acid clouds). Flight there would be more or less as difficult as on Earth--though so far the only aircraft on Venus were a couple Soviet balloons.  Another factor is that most powered flight on Earth uses combustion engines, which only work in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. You need to rely on electric power from batteries (for prolonged flight charged by solar or nuclear) to power a propeller or rotor, which (with today's technology at least) increases weight. Or you could bring your own oxidizer and use a rocket, but that would be even less efficient.  Flight is indeed much more difficult on Mars because of the low air density (\~1.6 percent that at Earth's surface), despite the low gravity (38 percent of Earth's surface). The thin air also can't carry heat away as rapidly, so overheating of motors is a major concern. Again, the cold decreases the speed of sound, decreasing the maximum speed the rotors can be allowed to rotate.  Note, though, that Titan is much less massive than Mars, and both Mars and Venus lack an internally generated magnetic field. There is a lot more to having and retaining a significant atmosphere than surface gravity and magnetic fields.

fhodm	When root canal treatment is necessary, the nerve is often not fully dead, and is sending the pain signals giving you a severe toothache.  But a properly done root canal is painless because of anaesthesia. If pain is experienced that means the anaesthetic was not adequate. This can be because of unusual anatomy that some people have, or genetic resistance to anaesthetic. Anaesthetic resistance is well known to be associated is red hair. A good dentist will use alternative injection sites or sometimes a different anaesthetic to overcome this. (There's one anaesthetic, I don't remember the name, that dentists usually don't use because it takes many hours to wear off, but they can order it in specially if it's needed for an anaesthetic-resistant patient.)  There may be rare exceptions, but that is by far the normal situation.  The other reason people think root canal treatments are painful is they are remembering the pain of the toothache that the root canal was performed to treat.	1642707324.0	hthzc68	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/hthzc68/

61sm0	>Water cannot be compressed at all. It is the universal solid for that very reason.  Every passive material can be compressed. The bulk modulus of water, which indicates how hard it is to compress, is about 2 GPa (e.g., 2 MPa pressure required to obtain a 0.1% reduction in volume). This is very high compared to gases but not infinite. Water at the ocean bottom is compressed by about 1/100 (~1%).	1642707668.0	hti0a5w	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hthxzwf	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hti0a5w/

14iaj1	This doesn't hold true for all solids either. Eg steel vs lead.  Hence, the above comment you are replying to holds correct and is an overall excellent reply. But this misconception comes from imprecise education.  Sound speed scaling with density is broadly true when looking at a very "zoomed" out pictures of materials (eg comparing air, to water, to steel). But this is because the atomic/molecular features that make a material less compressible also tend to make it denser (with exceptions). And they tend to drop compressibility much faster (by order of magnitude) than they increase density. As the above comment says.  Teaching the true definition c = sqrt (dP/dRho)|s, however is extremely educationally expensive because it requires the student to have an education grounded in thermodynamics, with the ability to plot and work with an isentrope/hugoniot or equation of state (even if its just ideal gas law).  So it is much easier to simply teach the short-hand version of: denser materials have higher sound speeds. This is good enough for most people.	1642707793.0	hti0mbk	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth3mti	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/hti0mbk/

Similar to how CosmoSounder explains that matter is created with a net-zero charge, we also expect there to be a net-zero matter/antimatter balance. As CosmoSounder mentioned, the process that creates an electron also creates a positron. A positron is an antimatter particle with positive charge. It's creation maintains the balance of both net-zero charge and net-zero matter/anti-matter.  For some reason, the universe has net-zero charge overall but is almost entirely made up of matter with negligible amounts of anti-matter.

h4kepu69	Using other mechanisms than thermal radiation is the point of energy saving light sources such as discharge/luminescent light bulbs and LEDs. Here electrons are excited to a higher energy band in some way and emit a photon as they change back to the lower band.  In general, photons are just the wave-particles of the electromagnetic field so wherever there's an electromagnetic wave, it consists of photons. So every radio antenna emits photons.	1642712615.0	hticii7	t3_s7jken	t3_s7jken	/r/askscience/comments/s7jken/is_every_photon_created_by_black_body_radiation/hticii7/

You won't see any melting below the actual melting point (unless you're getting some unexpected reaction creating a lower melting point mixture). If you take it as the peak of your endotherm you're going to be greatly conflating it with your heating rate. Just imagine an infinitely slow ramp rate's curve versus an infinitely fast...the first will be a delta function while the second will stretch out forever.  For nicely behaved materials you can probably do something like looking for some level of deviation from your baseline. Honestly it's been almost a decade since I've done DSC, otherwise I'd pull up the software and tell you how the instrument software did it.  Thinking about back when I last did a procurement, I remember one of the big DSC companies actually made their software free. You could probably import a csv or something in and play with their analysis tools. I forget if it was Perkin Elmer, TA, or someone else.

We usually do a 1st and 2nd beat on same sample as thst will review the initial state of what was locked in during processing on the 1st heat and more underlying base material behavior on 2nd heat. The rest of your analysis to OP is pretru good, there are so many ways to look at Tg, Tm etc. Thst to OP i would say often times onset is most critical as in where the slope first changes a certain %, midpoint Tm or Tg is often the inflection point of the transition. Of course these are all induced by a purely thermal process in a DSC, if you have a DMA and the material is suitable you can also measure a mechanical induced Tg with the tan delta and decide which one is more accurate for the application.	1642713190.0	htie3r2	t3_s84eo5	t1_htfhfma	/r/askscience/comments/s84eo5/is_dsc_analysis_of_melting_solids_any_different/htie3r2/

t5bcq	Since you obviously know your stuff, I'd like to ask an additional question.  I live in western Canada, where -30C to -40C temperatures are a a given for at least a few weeks each year.  These low temps are usually associated with high barometric pressure, sunny weather, and still air.  As soon as one steps outside in these conditions, one notices that sounds carry much further and much more clearly.  You can immediately notice a strange delay factor in judging distances.  The person shovelling their sidewalk a block away sounds like they're right next door, yet you can hear the delay caused by the finite speed of sound as their body movements don't match, visually.  I gather that the colder, denser air transmits sound with greater range and fidelity, but at a somewhat lesser speed?	1642714476.0	htihpu9	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth02zq	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htihpu9/

15ss4k	Coloration is a trait that can have multiple functions. From an evolutionary perspective, traits that are beneficial tend to stick around. Since humans don't have skin coloration that would be used as camouflage, it's likely that our ancestors either A) never produced the mutation to allow that trait to occur, or B) that trait never was beneficial enough to stick around in the population.  However, while we may not have camouflage, we do have skin pigment, which is beneficial from a non-predatory survival standpoint. We don't use our skin to "blend in" like a polar bear, but our skin pigments are useful in blocking out UV radiation from the sun. It's not surprising that humans residing closer to the equator, where the sun's rays hit more directly, evolved darker skin than populations residing further away from the equator.   In short, humans did in fact evolve a form of coloration! Just not necessarily to help with hunting.	1642715293.0	htijzl4	t3_s7rzkk	t1_hteqj4v	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htijzl4/

15ss4k	To my knowledge, there's no benefit to having different hair textures from a survival standpoint. My understanding is that hair textures are likely "linked traits," which are traits with a high probability of being passed on together. For example, if you have the red hair trait, it's super likely you also have the trait for freckles. These two traits are controlled by different genes, but since they're linked, you have a high probability of having both.  I think it's likely that hair texture is linked to other beneficial genes like skin color or eye color, and when those skin/eye traits got passed down, the hair texture traits were just along for the ride.	1642715850.0	htili1a	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htezf1g	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htili1a/

I would be inclined to say fast generation time gives species the ABILITY to evolve more quickly, but that doesn't necessarily mean they WILL evolve quickly.

i5zr9	Given your *all other things being equal*, the ease of flying would be about equal. Note that on earth the pressure at 16,000 ft (5000 m) is about 1/2 of what it is at sea level. Many of our airplanes can operate easily at this altitude. Gas turbine powered airplanes (jet and turboprop) cruise most efficiently at altitudes above this.  On your theoretical planet, our current technology -- piston engine or turbine engine -- would be able to propel an airplane with no problem. Further, an airplane that looks much like it does here on earth should work fine. That's not to say an earth airplane would be a good solution. A lot of tweaks to the design would be made to fit the environment. But, I can't see that any major breakthroughs in technology would be necessary.  One more note, if the aircraft were being piloted by earth people, then a pressurized cabin would probably be mandatory (assuming all other things being equal, 20% oxygen, etc).	1642716809.0	htio20f	t3_s83qe8	t3_s83qe8	/r/askscience/comments/s83qe8/how_is_our_atmospheric_pressure_connected_to_the/htio20f/

4imu6	A slight well actually: it's not really correct to say these antibody tests give concentrations. They are at best "quasi-quantitative". That is, they can report a titer value, which is a relative rather than absolute measure of concentration. Your natural immune response is a polyclonal melange of antibodies with differing affinities to a given antigen. Two antibody clones at the same concentration may both bind an antigen but will result in different assay readouts. Because of this, it's not possible to ascribe a concentration to a given readout. That said, titer values still measure the relative intensity of an immune response and still have clincal relevance.

The important element is that one has to use a process that dissolves most of the caffeine without stripping the material of its flavors.	1642722539.0	htj0a2e	t3_s8r5h7	t3_s8r5h7	/r/askscience/comments/s8r5h7/how_do_they_make_caffeinated_drinks_not/htj0a2e/

8l55imjp	According to the USGS: "Squeeze hard enough and water will compress—shrink in size and become more dense ... but not by very much. Envision the water a mile deep in the ocean. At that depth, the weight of the water above, pushing downwards, is about 150 times normal atmospheric pressure (Source: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Ask the Van). Even with this much pressure, water only compresses less than one percent." So, I was wrong it is a tiny bit compressible, but almost impossible to achieve without heavy industrial equipment or galactic gravitational forces.	1642722639.0	htj0iv9	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hti0a5w	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj0iv9/

b6jlug8t	Dang this thread!  I have no teeth now.  The dentist was the most painful thing in my entire life for almost 40 years.  Sometimes I would pass out.  I never got anything but lidocaine,  and the dentist telling me I should only feel pressure used to make me so angry.  I explained this to the new dentist I went to for false teeth, and when I went to get my teeth pulled she gave me something different and she had pulled a few of my teeth before I realized she started.  I never felt any pain, only pressure.  I was loopy for about 4 hours afterwards though.	1642722825.0	htj0z8t	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htj0z8t/

First one was hilariously painless......and also left the bottom half of my face on that side numb for 2 months as they actually hit the nerve dead on in my jaw, apparently.   The second one was the most excruciating pain I've ever had, and I literally walked three blocks to my car and drove home an hour and a half after tearing my ACL. That was far less pain than the 2nd root canal.	1642723331.0	htj273a	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htj273a/

Look at going at 40 K/min, 20 K/min, 10 K/min, 5 K/min in a single long run on a single sample. If you see the onset shifting, you'll know there's some kinetic component. You can also do repeatability studies of melt/remelt/remelt at the same settings in a single long run to understand if there's any oxygen up take or some other sort of reaction happening during your experiment.	1642725104.0	htj6ej6	t3_s84eo5	t1_htj3c2l	/r/askscience/comments/s84eo5/is_dsc_analysis_of_melting_solids_any_different/htj6ej6/

50onv	Gasses decrease in viscosity as their temperature decreases. Hotter air is more viscous, and absorbs more of the sound energy through internal viscous frictional forces. Cooler air absorbs less of this energy and allows sounds to travel further.   The relative stillness of the air also minimizes energy losses I imagine, but the viscous properties likely have a lot more to do with it.	1642725527.0	htj7eck	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htihpu9	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj7eck/

o1w3t	I think it would supercavitate first, which would form a wall of water vapour at extremely low pressures around the moving object. This is because water can transform state at low pressures, unlike air. This could happen in water at a few hundred metres per second - not slow, but within the range of high velocity torpedoes and high speed propellors. Given it supercavitates, we now seek the speed of sound in the gas rather than the liquid water.  This may be rusty, it's memories of a long past fluid mechanics course.	1642726277.0	htj95u1	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hti9hxn	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htj95u1/
9h2hic0v	A DMA measures the storage and loss modulus simultaneously while applying a set amount of strain rapidly back and forth in the sample of a known shape, usually a rectangular prism.  It does this through a temperature sweep and you'll get a large tan delta peak as the transition occurs from glassy state through the plateau.  This is commonly regarded as the Tg in this analysis but again the onset is of upmost importance as you now have a temperature at which you know the ratio of your moduli are going to begin transitioning. This could be important for building things and engineering specs compared to just the DSC measured value.	1642726317.0	htj99ad	t3_s84eo5	t1_htj3n1a	/r/askscience/comments/s84eo5/is_dsc_analysis_of_melting_solids_any_different/htj99ad/
nt7w2	Here is what an NIH paper concluded:  "The current literature does not support the notion that dietary cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease in a healthy individuals. However, there is an ample evidence that saturated fatty acids and trans-fats increase cardiovascular disease risk. The fact that dietary cholesterol is common in foods that are high in saturated fatty acids might have contributed to the hypothesis that dietary cholesterol is atherogenic"  source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024687/  So the science is tricky since saturated fat and cholesterol usually occur together and the studies are not conclusive.   For me personally, I choose to remain on the safer side by going with a diet low in both saturated fat and cholesterol. Excluding the "French paradox" most heart-healthy diets around the world tend to be heavily plant based.	1642726318.0	htj99c1	t3_s8gy96	t3_s8gy96	/r/askscience/comments/s8gy96/does_dietary_cholesterol_raise_serum_serum/htj99c1/

14iaj1	Your explanation, with careful use of "tends", is certainly sufficient and quite elegant for a K12 treatment.  The problem is that you will find many K12 references do not carefully use qualifiers like tends.

mzc4g	The locus (genetic address) of a gene is predictable from person to person. If we look at a specific chromosome at a specific locus, we should find a specific gene. If not, that is called a translocation and that could be really bad.   As for inherited chromosomes, they will have the same genes at the same loci. There are some ways to determine which genes came from the mother vs. the father the gene amplification techniques. Obviously the Y chromosome comes from the father, so that’s easy and mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother.	1642727532.0	htjc29w	t3_s8d461	t3_s8d461	/r/askscience/comments/s8d461/are_genes_arranged_basically_the_same_in_most/htjc29w/
82t1bcky	When I worked in the hospital, probably a decade ago, I jumped in on six different codes. As I was not licensed to do injections (atropine and lidocaine), I was typically the one doing compressions.   What they don’t teach you in CPR certification courses is that the ribs will break. It’s not a question of if, it’s a matter of how many are left after the first minute. That will definitely hamper recovery if they survive, due to the struggle to breathe or do any kind of straining. CPR in the hospital often means intubation, as well, so you end up with a really sore throat…if you survive.   Out of those six, all died. Granted, these were more critical patients so it wasn’t all that surprising. Those who do survive should be able to recover fully if they put the effort in. Ribs heal, sore throat goes away, but it’s up to the individual to take the steps to fix their health.	1642727616.0	htjc95x	t3_s87303	t3_s87303	/r/askscience/comments/s87303/what_percentage_of_patients_who_survive_due_to/htjc95x/

mzc4g	Yes. An arteriogram can be done to identify if there is atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries which could lead to to a heart attack, stroke or  Peripheral Vascular Disease.

cd9a3	Many people (maybe most), such as myself, find out they have blockage(s) after a non-fatal heart attack (myocardial infarction).  I had zero symptoms that I was aware of.  The morning of my MI I wasn't even sure I'd had a heart attack but felt odd and luckily due to my experience with my family's history I went to the hospital.  I'm sure my blood pressure was elevated before but I was unaware.  Then the blockages are treated - I had a couple of stents placed as a result and have since been on medication to control blood pressure and watching my diet to control cholesterol and such.	1642727871.0	htjcudp	t3_s88jeh	t3_s88jeh	/r/askscience/comments/s88jeh/do_arterial_blockages_get_diagnosed_regularly/htjcudp/
1c0oil2l	It can go either way. My MiL's symptoms were so gradual, that on an exam for another reason. !!Surprise!! carotid artery was 96%blocked.  I also had a patient who felt oddly tired one day. !!Surprise!! 5 of his heart's arteries were 70%-85% blocked.  Sometimes, a person can have a massive heart attack and drop dead.  At a regular healthcare appointment, your provider may notice a change in your blood pressure, unexpected swelling in your feet/ankles, or other seemingly minor issues. Likely, they'll monitor you, and possible do some labwork, an EKG, a stress-test (or a non-stress-test), or any number of other assessments. From this data, you'll get advice on staying well.	1642728172.0	htjdjof	t3_s88jeh	t3_s88jeh	/r/askscience/comments/s88jeh/do_arterial_blockages_get_diagnosed_regularly/htjdjof/

There is also a thing called sway, which describes the offset from your phone or computer (endpoint) and the NTP server. Some will allow a sway as much as 5 minutes before issuing a reset to NTP time. Some also only reset that time at certain times (like at reboot) so they don’t set a time during event logging. Imagine a process that logs a start time of 5:03 PM and finishes at 4:49 PM because the NTP protocol reset the clock.	1642731473.0	htjl4zm	t3_s7ev0q	t1_htbfa2n	/r/askscience/comments/s7ev0q/how_accurate_are_the_clocks_on_our_phones/htjl4zm/

Assign that number as a distance, like cm or mm or in. Then draw a circle with that radius, you know the point you are looking for is on that circle. Repeat with a second point and now your location can only be one of two places on the paper, where those circles intersect. With a third point there is only one place on the paper your location can be (hence *tri*angulation).

Here's the issue:  Both Pinker and Chomsky don't have a shred of empirical evidence to back up their nativist claims on language; but nativism (the view that you obviously agree with) doesn't have much of a leg to stand on, and we've known this in Behavioral science for decades.  Your example, along with the idea of maternal imprinting behaviors in birds (popularized by Konrad Lorenz), has only demonstrative evidence, and no known mechanism. Gilbert Gottlieb, however, did have many empirical articles that back a non-nativist approach to development he called Developmental dynamics, which I describe in my previous post: [sauce](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dev.20269)  Pro tip: if you call someone's perspective false, at least cite your sources so that your readers can make up their own mind as to the validity of your claim.	1642737291.0	htjyaub	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htjhp1x	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htjyaub/

68e5u1yf	No. There are different types of arterial blockages but I'll talk about 3 common ones: coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease.  For coronary artery disease, this is when there is atherosclerotic blockage in your coronary arteries, or the arteries that directly supply your heart muscle. Your heart is a very active muscle/pump and therefore needs a constant blood supply. Without adequate blood, the muscle starts to die = myocardial infarction = heart attack. This happens when your arteries are very clogged. To diagnose it, we do coronary catheterization, which can also be therapeutic. In milder cases, deploying a stent will relieve the obstruction. In more severe cases (there are defined criteria), the patient will require a CABG to bypass the obstruction. Since coronary catheterizations are invasive, we generally don't do it for asymptomatic people. Now, there is newer technology using CT scans to image the coronaries but to my knowledge, that is also not used on a large scale to diagnose asymptomatic people.   For carotid artery disease, we typically don't catch those until they become symptomatic, at which point the obstruction is causing problems. In other words, we don't screen for this. Once it's symptomatic, treatment depends on the degree of obstruction and patient-specific risk factors but can include endarterectomy.   For peripheral arterial disease, this is one that gets diagnosed when patients develop claudication symptoms in the lower extremities. Usually an ABI is done at that point where the systolic BP is measured at the ankle and at the arm and the ratio between the two is determined. That is diagnostic of PAD. We don't routinely do this for asymptomatic people because it would likely be normal until the obstruction is pretty advanced.	1642737712.0	htjz759	t3_s88jeh	t3_s88jeh	/r/askscience/comments/s88jeh/do_arterial_blockages_get_diagnosed_regularly/htjz759/

d468q	For your specific examples: Germany was a "region" of many small kingdoms, duchies, counties, principalities, etc. long before it became a single country in the 1860s. The word "Germany" was based on what the Romans called part of the area *(Germania)*. Germany has different names in different languages, partly because different outside groups ended up referring to it using the names of different former constituent places or tribes, e.g. *Allemagne* in French after the Germanic tribe known as the *Alemanni*. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names\_of\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_Germany).   This is an example of a country getting its name from specific real or historical places or groups within them. The informal English name "Holland" is also kind of an example of this. Another example is how English and many other languages use the name "China" (based on an ancient dynasty that controlled much of the modern country) while Russian uses the name *Kitai* ("Cathay") (based on a different not-as-ancient group that also controlled much of the modern country).  "Austria" comes from an attempt to render *Oesterreich* into Latin. Lots of country names come from this kind of process, trying to make the name easier to pronounce in the destination language -- think *Espana >>* "Spain".  "Japan" seems to come from a combination of Portuguese explorers hearing Malay traders call it *Japun* and Venetian explorers hearing Chinese people calling it *Chipangu*. It seems that these were how the kanji characters, which are read as *Nippon* in Japanese, were vocalized in some Chinese dialect. Same characters, different pronunciation.  A somewhat related example to this might be how we pronounce "Mexico" based on how the letter "x" is pronounced in English, even though the "x" represents a different sound in modern Spanish, and the whole thing is an approximation of the original Nahuatl name which sounds like *MeSHIH'ko*	1642738073.0	htjzz0i	t3_s8rbw0	t3_s8rbw0	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htjzz0i/

b42gnjuj	I'll add some more info for clarification.  *Channels* are based on number of satellites, this determines the accuracy of your geolocation information. You actually need 4 satellites to get an accurate GPS location, not 3. Most commercial receivers like your cell phone have 12+ channels nowadays, military receivers almost always have at least 24.  *Signals* are just the frequency that the information is sent at. Dozens of satellites broadcast over the same signals. Currently only the military can use L2 and L5 signals, though they are in the pre-operational stages of adding L2 support to the commercial sector.  One thing about having a receiver that can read multiple *signals* is that you can compare the two frequencies and correct for ionosphere distortion, which is the largest source of error for modern receivers. Once they go live with the commercial L2 signal in the next couple years, you'll be impressed at how much your phone's accuracy improved.	1642738380.0	htk0m9u	t3_s8qpe8	t3_s8qpe8	/r/askscience/comments/s8qpe8/why_are_there_only_two_signals_used_in_gps/htk0m9u/

zqjvy	Not a lot of people know, but there are nerve crossovers from your left and right jaw that cross in the front of the roots, so no matter how much they numb it, it can still be very sensitive. This can also be caused by high adrenaline causing blood to flow faster than usual, and medicine to have a lesser effect.  Speaking from a voice of experience, I got 5 shots of different numbing agent, and I still felt the whole process.	1642738752.0	htk1e4o	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htk1e4o/
rwbls	I've had lots of root canals due to my poor dental hygiene as a kid, I also drink lots of soda, and smoke cigarettes and marijuana so that doesn't help either. I consider myself a pretty good patient though, I don't complain much, try to stay completely still, raise my hand and wait for the dentist to be away from my mouth when I need a second. I also have a pretty high pain tolerance, mostly because of a tooth I got removed when I was kid and the dentist gave me a shot in the root/nerve or something. I don't know what she did but it's left me with this sense of "as long as the pain doesn't reach that level I'm fine"  The last two root canals I had were absolutely dreadful. I came in to get some teeth carved up to get crowns. Too much decay, so they said I needed root canals, which I kinda knew. They send the money lady in, I pay some more, they get back to work. He starts doing something and I'm immediately in some of the worse pain in my life. Nearly in tears, fluddering like a mad man, I'm trying to tell him to stop. He gets me some more anesthetics, and the rest went smooth.  I asked him what that was, and said he was just flushing my nerve out, but since I wasn't originally getting root canals, he forgot he didn't use as much anesthesia as he would normally use. It literally felt like I was have something pulled out of my tooth, like a string of my brain through the root of my tooth.	1642738965.0	htk1u7x	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htk1u7x/
441dt1hr	Would it be more correct to say that sound speed is dependent on temperature rather than density in this case of warm air vs cold air?  For example if I had two boxes at same T, one with air at 2atm and one at 1 atm, wouldn't sound speed be equal even though their densities are different?  If I were comparing sound speed in two altitudes with the same temperature, would sound speed be the same?	1642738966.0	htk1uao	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth02zq	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htk1uao/

ytxkpj6	Assuming we don’t have to worry about the mass of the parachute itself, there is no reason it shouldn’t work. You just need to pick values that make terminal velocity survivable.   The formula is Vt = sqrt(2mg/(rho•A•Cd))   Weight on Mars is about a third, density on Mars is about a hundredth. You end up with something like Vt =sqrt(2•23/A). So to get back to the equivalent of an Earth parachute you have to have ~23 times the parachute area than you would on Earth.   A parachute for a 200 lb mass on Earth has about 200 sq ft of cross sectional area. The equivalent Martian parachute needs to have 4500 sq ft, which is an 80 foot diameter. That’s for a person. For something like a 2000 pound rover? You’re looking at a parachute the size of a Walmart.	1642739746.0	htk3gb0	t3_s8oqq7	t1_htjti09	/r/askscience/comments/s8oqq7/would_terminal_velocity_on_mars_be_the_same_as_on/htk3gb0/
7cj1qe	You're really extrapolating here. You said "no behaviors, be it human or animal (or plant for that matter) are hard-wired into our biological systems" My claim is that you are wrong, there exist behaviors that are biologically hard-wired. I never generalized to nativism. As the original post did not include a source, I didn't think it was necessary to include. If you Google "fixed action patterns", you will also find that inate behaviors, reflex actions, and kinesis are also hard-wired behaviors.  You are debating philosophy. I am citing biology.  The currently hotly debated theory, as you have clearly expressed an example of, is that behavior is effected by multiple mechanisms.  None of that answered the op about monogamy, which still could come from either mechanism(behavior, biology), both, or something completely different.	1642739902.0	htk3ro7	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htjyaub	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htk3ro7/

gekpw	The gravitational potential energy of some mass m in a gravitational field g is mgh, if we consider an approximately uniform gravitational field.  So the situation where the heavier material is above the lighter material has a higher potential energy than the situation where the heavier material is lower than the lighter material.  So when you say "There's no input of energy", there *is* a difference in potential energy. If the heavier material is higher, it would prefer to switch places with the lighter material in order to reduce the overall gravitational potential energy of the system.	1642741158.0	htk685x	t3_s90t6g	t3_s90t6g	/r/askscience/comments/s90t6g/how_do_less_dense_material_rise_in_a_denser/htk685x/

b42gnjuj	Yes you are right. Two signals almost entirely corrects for it, three signals would correct even better. Check out [this link](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog862/node/1715) for more details.   The reason they don't is that dual signal correction already provides accuracy down to tens of centimeters. Most GPS applications don't require sub-millimeter accuracy. And to utilize three signals, you would need bigger hardware, more complex electronics and much more power.

For example in the artic there is what's called hard ice that has been there for many years and survived many thaws, this ice is extremely hard, won't shift or break away. While the ice that is formed that year has a tendency to move a lot with the current of water underneath.

8drz0	There are no "true" ideal gases because while it wasn't mentioned, ideal gases are point particles aka the atom/molecule has no volume which obviously doesn't describe any real gas.  Being in the molecular flow regime (where the mean free path is greater than the volume of the container you're considering) is also not really important for ideal gases. Really, really high pressures can make it break down, but a few atmospheres   More importantly, in realistic situations ideal gases get you a notably wrong quantitative answer, but it's pretty likely to be qualitatively dead on. For example, sound is really different gas molecules translating in phase with other nearby gas molecules. Considering a more exact equation of state for the gas molecule doesn't change that, so you're still going to come to the same conclusion.	1642743197.0	htka1vc	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth80fg	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htka1vc/

c0j9uiav	I don't think that is true.  The gravitational force a body sees is delayed by the time it takes for the gravity wave to travel from the source to the target.  So two bodies in orbit each have a delayed response to the others influence on gravity based on their separation distance and the speed of light (gravity).  The delay between the sun and the earth is about 8 minutes.  The target is always being pulled towards where the body was at the time of the emission of the gravity wave.	1642746139.0	htkf6dx	t3_s8yph3	t1_htk6xo9	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htkf6dx/

16qgmh0f	This is incorrect. The panelist, and the sourced paper they conveniently included in their reply to OP, are correct. Yes, the speed of gravity = the speed of light, but it is also true that rotating objects are gravitationally pulled toward the "current" location of the other, not the time-delayed location.   As RobusEtCeleritas mentions, it is a nontrivial problem, and doesn't have an intuitive answer (unless you are familiar with enough of the right sort of physics, then it is expected - electromagnetic fields have the same behavior, which is also mentioned in the linked paper).	1642747426.0	htkh6ya	t3_s8yph3	t1_htkf6dx	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htkh6ya/
fep5k	Can confirm. Had root canal treatment a year ago. Went to a doc who specialized in it. 3 hours in the chair, no pain at all. I had to watch out to now fall asleep (seriously). All filmed with cam so I could watch every step. Was just there few days ago to check if everything is good on xray and it's perfectly fine.  There are a couple of things you can watch out for to know if your doc is qualified for root canal treatment:  - does he use a microscope for the treatment? If not: don't go there - how does he measure the exact length of the root canal? A professional will have a electronic device for that (not sure about the english name but basically it does use low voltage to make sure doc doesn't accidentally drill out of your tooth but also doesn't forget a tiny part of the root canal, which would result in the infection getting back (eventually after years)) - what materials does your doc use to fill the root canal and what methods? Afaik guttapercha is still considered the best since it's reasonably stable (what you want) but still a natural product used for decades now (so we know it's not toxic even after years). But there are different ways how to lay guttapercha. Most just insert sticks, which obviously don't seal tight, causing bacteria to get back in again over time from the bottom of your tooth. So my doc heated it somehow and then pushed the resulting  paste in there really tight. Maybe there are superior methods to this by now but from my research they all come with the issue that they use materials we don't know for long enough to be sure how they perform over time - how does your doc make sure all bacteria in your canal is killed and no new get in during the process of the treatment? A good doc will use a rubber cloth in your mouth around the tooth so only the tooth he's working on is visible and no spit cat get in. He'll take the time to clean the canal using some sort of bacteria killing liquid (can't recall what was used in my case) at least twice before closing it. - and also of course, a good doc will take the time when doing the anesthesia asking you for feedback and eventually doing more if needed. Mine explained very carefully what nerves he needs to tread for that specific tooth and how they run in my mouth. From that point i knew that he knew what he's doing. I never had less pain at a treatment even for minor treatments.   To be fair thought my root canal was still vital as opposed to dead which normally results is better anesthesia. Afaik once your root canal is dead the anesthetics can't get there. It will still hurt (obviously, that's why you're there) but there not much a doc can do about it in that case. You still have to treat it or the infection will get worse. So all you can do in that case is hope for the best. A good dentist knows that and will inform you about it before the treatment.	1642748415.0	htkioif	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkioif/
5qad2	As you say, *Austria* is a Latinization of Old High German *Ostarrichi*, but that itself is likely a translation of Latin *Marchia orientalis*!  In regards to Germany being a region of many small principalities (the *Kleinstaaterei*), there was no real question from the emergence of the Ottonians-on that "Germany" was a "thing". There has been no point in recent history where some state or organization representing "Germany" has not existed - the Kingdom of the East Franks (colloquially *Germany*) within the Empire, Napoleon's Rhine Confederation, the German Confederation (briefly the *German Empire*, the North German Confederation, and finally the German Empire.  Most of the foreign names are *older* than the ethnogenesis of Germany in the Early Middle Ages. So, I would say that the *Kleinstaaterei* doesn't have much impact in this case - when most foreign names were adopted was well before that situation, back when *Germania* was still largely tribal.	1642748648.0	htkj0v3	t3_s8rbw0	t1_htjzz0i	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htkj0v3/

orj14	We also never had the same scientific abilities. The current number of active researches and scientists (in general) is assumed to be bigger than the \*overall total of scientists ever\*. Again, not sure what the source for that information, but considering how high level education and production have entwined in the last century, it sure at least hits close to reality.  The spanish flue wasn’t that different from Covid-19, but we had in no way the understanding or the technological abilities to achieve such a deep inside into the illness, or it’s progress through human society, to the point that nobody can prove how it somehow stopped after a few years (most of the “develops into less aggressive strain” theories are just that, theories; we have a good idea why it might happen, but no data to really underly that).  So from a perspective of history theory of science, this is all very interesting; how to we build an understanding of the world compared to before, and how does it influence society, good and bad?  Because what has enabled us to this deeper insight is, at the same time, what partly made Covid harder on the world; due to the much higher mobility and world-wide entanglement, things spread faster and deeper - which is true both for information and contagious diseases.	1642752368.0	htko85k	t3_s7ny5j	t1_htgiekr	/r/askscience/comments/s7ny5j/are_there_any_studies_suggesting_whether/htko85k/
66f7e	Marcaine is the long lasting anesthetic you are thinking of.  The other alternatives of the anesthetic not working is: A) an active infection. An infection is acidic in nature. Anesthetics are basic in nature. The acid in the infection will neutralize the anesthetic, reducing its effectiveness. (Which is why many dentists will drain an abscess, or give antibiotics to reduce the infection prior to treatment.) B) too much swelling/infection around the area preventing the anesthetic from getting where it needs to be to work.  There is also often pressure associated with root canal treatments as well as micromovements of the ligaments and tendons surrounding the tooth, causing some irritation post-procedure which can cause discomfort and pain afterwards. (Think of soreness after you go to the gym.) This pressure can be quite uncomfortable depending on intensity and the location. If it is on a top tooth, this pressure can be against your sinus cavity as well. Anesthesics will not get rid of any pressure.  In regards to post-treatment discomfort and pain: each person and each tooth reacts differently to root canal treatments. (I know I've had five done.) How active and recent the infection is, how intense the pain is day of procedure and the technique done on the tooth, may dictate the body's reaction to the procedure.  (Some dentists use the two-appointment technique as it was popular as it provided a higher success rate as opposed to the one appointment technique. But with more recent equipment, materials, and more accurate x-rays the two step method is slowly being phased out.)  Root canal treatments are also lengthy, and requires the patient to be open wide for long periods of time, which can create jaw pain post treatment.  And last, but not least: the only good story is a bad one. Nobody wants to hear about how you had the most wonderful root canal and how you fell asleep in the chair. But everybody wants to hear how you writhed and screamed in the chair getting this horrifying procedure that is pulling the nerves out of your tooth.	1642752932.0	htkozqa	t3_s8mble	t1_hthzc68	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkozqa/

oaj84	I have gotten into the habit of asking for articaine even for relatively minor stuff. It has a faster onset than lidocaine, is way more effective, so I feel safe and comfy through the entire procedure, and from what I understand, it decays exponentially so it takes much faster to wear off. For me, lidocaine sometimes takes 6 hours to be fully gone, and even then there is some residual tinglyness, with articaine, I can eat as soon as I get home.	1642753997.0	htkqevi	t3_s8mble	t1_htjta4p	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkqevi/
qbughz6	There is energy input and exchange.  Think of the two mediums as different objects.  The more dense one is also more massive (for the same volume), and that's the key.  The heavier mass sinks, spending it's gravitational energy (lets say 100 J).  The less massive (less dense) matter rises.  Sure, it gains gravitational energy (90 J), but it doesn't gain as much as the heavy mass loses.	1642754010.0	htkqfjb	t3_s90t6g	t3_s90t6g	/r/askscience/comments/s90t6g/how_do_less_dense_material_rise_in_a_denser/htkqfjb/

34d5o	It does, but counter-intuitively. If you liken a solid to a stiff spring, and air to a softer spring it's maybe good enough for the population at large.

14iaj1	This is true. However you have to remember that at the K12 level liquids and solids are generally presented as incompressible.  So your analogy works for air vs water, or air vs steel, but if you use it to compare water vs steel you essentially need to teach compressibility in general.  I personally don't think it is a stretch, but curricula are really strained these days.	1642755170.0	htkry2r	t3_s8i3v8	t1_htkrpo0	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htkry2r/

14qy8i	1. The nerve might not yet be fully dead. If there's bacteria or more precisely their toxins in the tooth substance near the dental pulp or already in the pulp itself, the pulp tissue reacts with an inflammation. Due to the fact that the pulp is entirely encased by dentine which is very hard, the edema that follows basically stranglulates the nerve, leading to excruciating pain. It is often strongest upon outside stimuluses like warm or cold drinks.  This is called an irreversible pulpitis   2. The nerve is dead and bacteria have migrated all the way down to the root tip. The pulp isn't perfused anymore, thus immune cells can't fight the infection in the tooth. However, they can do so in the bone right outside the root tip and oh boy they do, rendering the periapical bone into the Somme of 1916. The immune response locally dissolves the bone and the infiltrate, granuloma or abscess that develop are especially painful upon biting down on the tooth. There might also be swelling under the gumline and general discomfort.  This is called periapical periodontitis, granuloma or abscess.	1642758967.0	htkwr01	t3_s8mble	t3_s8mble	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htkwr01/

In short: there was some loss of diversity in certain groups in the very late Cretaceous that may have made the ecosystem more fragile, but no long-term decline, and no particular reason to think dinosaurs couldn't have recovered diversity as they had before; any large group will regularly experience disruptions and recoveries like this. And while the Deccan traps couldn't have been particularly healthy, the timing and pace of the extinction still seems best explained by the impact.	1642761258.0	htkzk5t	t3_s8cd4m	t1_htjtx2c	/r/askscience/comments/s8cd4m/after_the_kt_extinction_how_did_the_survivors/htkzk5t/

abuva	Sperm cells do divide, but they have a different method of division that occurs in 2 rounds, so you end up with 4 cells instead of 2. The cells themselves come from stem cells. Another factor is that Eggs/Sperm have to have half the number of chromosomes in order to get the correct number when combining, so they don't have a back up set of genes, so DNA errors are likely more lethal.	1642763643.0	htl2njn	t3_s43r3g	t1_hsp77lk	/r/askscience/comments/s43r3g/if_dna_decays_over_time_like_how_older_people_get/htl2njn/

q81tq	General relativity doesn't allow the sudden disappearance of mass, so it's moot to ask what general relativity would predict.  If you somehow manage to convert all the Sun's energy to light (which immediately escapes) then we would notice the change after 8 minutes - at the same time that light passes us.	1642764224.0	htl3fu9	t3_s8yph3	t1_htkm8b8	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htl3fu9/
b1eq5	Speed of sound measures how fast a vibration on one side of an object can reach the other object.  For example, picture a tube 1m in length filled with some substance. If you push the substance inside at one end, how fast will the other side of the tube feel that movement? If you divide 1m by the time it took the movement to reach the other side you get that substance's speed of sound.  If the substance inside is, for example, solid steel, it's easy to figure that the other side moves almost instantaneously, and that speed of sound is incredibly high (approximately 3000 m/s, which might as well be infinite). This is true when we talk about an incompressible substance, and it also holds pretty well for water, for example. In fact, the speed of sound in water is approximately 1500 m/s, just about half of steel.  If the substance inside is air, instead, we don't expect the movement to be instantaneous. This is because air is compressible, so what happens when you push on one side is that some molecules of air just get closer to each other and form a wave (an acoustic wave, to be precise) which travels through the tube until it reaches the other side.  The speed of sound in air and in other gases is proportional to (the square root of) temperature. Why is that?  Temperature is a measurement of how fast, on average, the molecules of air are bouncing around and mixing with one another. This means that if you insert some floating color at one side of the tube, since air is moving so fast and is mixing with nearby particles, the color will spread much faster than if temperature was lower (and thus with lower mixing).  This is very similar in the case of an acoustic wave: if an acoustic wave forms, it can move much faster through the air if it is hotter because fast-moving particles are much better at transfering properties through the fluid.	1642764405.0	htl3ov3	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htl3ov3/

q81tq	That theory is General Relativity.  The gravitational field is not just dependent on where the object is, but it's also dependent on its velocity and (to some extent) its acceleration. For orbiting objects (but not always) the net result looks very close to the scenario of instantaneous propagation. The small difference to that scenario is linked to the emission of gravitational waves.	1642764471.0	htl3s34	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl2e7a	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htl3s34/

fgurmgz1	So would I be correct in assuming because density is a measurement of mass per unit volume, the more particles in a given volume the faster sound waves can travel through the substance?  I imagine it is akin to explosives where a shockwave in a fluid or solid is much stronger than in air due to the availablity of particles to transfer energy between?	1642764596.0	htl3yb3	t3_s8i3v8	t1_hth02zq	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htl3yb3/
q81tq	For some cases - two orbiting objects are such a case - the current location of the source can be predicted based on velocity and acceleration in the past, these influence the propagating gravitational field.	1642764601.0	htl3yir	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl2cqm	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htl3yir/

15rzik	Let's take the Germanic people and the names they gave to the various countries as an example.  In the Proto-Germanic language, the word "theudo" meant "the people", and came to mean the German people (as we would think of them today).  Within the Germanic group, there were many tribes, each with thier own names for themselves, in different regions.  In the core of Germany, as proto-Germanic evolved into modern German, the pronunciation of that word evolved into "Deutsch", meaning "German", and hence "Deutschland" for the country.  Some of the germanic people ended up in low-lying land bordering the North Sea.  They still called themselves by the same name, but as their language evolved, that word ended up being "Dutch". They called the place they live "the low land", which in their language is "Nederland". In modern German that is "Niederland", and in English "Netherlands" (nether meaning low, as in ones "nether regions").  One of the tribes living to the north lived in a borderland country, and the word for that kind of country is "Mark" or "March" (the borderlands between England and Wales are sometimes called the "Welsh Marches").  That group called themselves "Danes", so their country is "Danemark", or in English, Denmark.  Another group of people left mainland Europe and settled on an offshore island. While several germanic tribes migrated, the dominant tribe were the "Angles", and they called their new country, "Angleland", or England.  The French people, just across the channel, also called this place the land of the Angles, but in French, so it became "Angleterre".  One group of Germanic people, who settled in the Black Forrest and upper Rhine were the Allemani.  The French speakers nearby used their name for all German people, so the name of the country to them was "Allemagne". Likewise, on the Baltic Coast, the Germanic people living there were the Saxons, so the Finns and Estonians used that name for all of Germany.  In the Southeast, some Germanic people lived in an eastern border region, which they called the Eastern March (there's that march word again), but when it became established as a country became the "Eastern Realm", which in German is Österreich.  In the Alps further west, a bunch of cities and their surrounding countryside decided they didn't like paying taxes to their duke, so formed a confederation to kick him out.  This confederation was formed near the city of Schwyz, and the people who belonged to this confederation came to be called "the Swiss".  An older English name for someone from Schwyz was a "Switzer", so their land is Switzerland.  As the confederation grew, it came to encompass other alpine groups, who spoke French, Italian and Romansch.  In each language they referred to themselves also as "the Swiss", so we have "Die Schweiz", "la Suisse", "La Svizzera" and "La Svizra".  Not wanting the trouble of having four names for the country, the Swiss decided the sensible solution was to pick a neutral language for the official name, and turned to Latin.  When the Romans went into the Alps, some people called the Helvetii lived there, so the Swiss decided to name their confederation the "Confederatio Helvetica".  This use of Latin is a common source of names.  Because Latin was important in Europe for so long, many countries used a Latin name for their country, and other countries also used that Latin name.  In cases where the Romans actually went there, the Romans had a name for the place, generally based on the people who lived there.  The greeks encountered some weird people wearing face paint on a damp island, who called themselves, Pretani, and the Romans called their island Britania.  Some people living north of France were the Belgae, while people living east of the Rhine and north of the Alps when the Romans were around were the Germani.  Not all places had been visited by the Romans, though, so they had to come up with a latin form of their name, in order to work with the European system of doing things in the Middle Ages.  One such place was Österreich.  There seems to be some confusion about how exactly these people arrived at "Austria" as a suitable name, but they did, and it stuck.  When a name enters another language, it generally gets adapted to the spelling, grammar and pronunciation standards of that language, so minor variations, like "Belgium", "Belgien", "Belgique" etc or more major ones like "Tyskland" from "Deutschland" happen.  Where names have very specific and clear meanings, the whole name can get translated.  The name "United Kingdom", for example, becomes "Royaume-Uni" in French and "Vereinegtes Königreich" in German, as literal translations.  In the case of further away countries, several methods can produce different names.  One process is that people hear about a far off country from some group of people in between, and adopt their name for it, which may different from the domestic name for the sorts of reasons above.  Another is that the people arrive and just make up a name (Australia, for example, comes from Terra Australis, or southern land).  Then there is the comical misunderstanding.  The Iroquois word "Kanada" means village or settlement.  When Europeans arrived in the St Lawrence area and asked locals, "what do you call this place", they assumed that word was the whole country, hence "Canada" (no, it wasn't named by drawing letters from a hat and announcing them as, "first letter is a C, eh.  Next is an N, eh, now a D, eh").	1642765386.0	htl530e	t3_s8rbw0	t3_s8rbw0	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htl530e/

As for the synthesis: i can only speak from a molbio view, but in order to label cellular compounds, you basically starve the Celle and then grow them in/on a medium with only C13 atoms.   I can only guess, but i suppose you use labelled precursor molecules to synthesize labelled compounds. The starting point of synthesis would be any readily available, centrifugable compound.	1642765510.0	htl59bt	t3_s93g0c	t3_s93g0c	/r/askscience/comments/s93g0c/how_does_one_create_a_mass_labelled_standard/htl59bt/

I don't exactly work in the clinical field but close to it and encounter many colleagues spreading misinformation to our participants or other colleagues in presentations that can be quickly debunked via a quick google search. Things like there being little to no emprical evidence for claims or knowledge being outfashioned. I feel like there is a strong bias from those who never had contact with any other non-legal substances before (I also acknowledge that there is a similar bias in the opposite direction playing down risks and dangers of substances one has had experiences with).	1642769358.0	htlbfkg	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlbfkg/

upyx8	Like it is written. :)  Seriously though, basically in Finnish we always pronounce every letter the same every time, no matter the context, with only very few exceptions. I don't know how to write those phonectic markings (or read them very well), but I'll try in another way.  The 'au' in "sauna" is pronounced like 'ow' (like what you say when you get hurt). 'A' is basically 'aah' and 'U' is 'ooh'. Since there is only one of each letter, they are pronounced shorter than that, tho. The whole word would be something like 's-ow-nah'. There's probably a youtube video with the proper pronounciation somewhere. My English is not good enough to explain grammar and pronounciation, I'm afraid, but I hope this helped.	1642769965.0	htlciyy	t3_s8rbw0	t1_htl966d	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htlciyy/

15m6dw	The easiest way is to synthesize it from a pure C-13 version of a starting material. Something like methane is MW 17 vs 16 so is *relatively* easy to separate using eg gaseous diffusion. Then you can work up to the molecule you want. It also depends whether you want a molecule with all carbons as the isotope or just a specific one labelled.   There are a few other simple  molecules with just one carbon atom that you could use as a basis for synthesis but when you have more than one carbon you get molecules with multiple different combinations of C-12 and C-13 which would make separation more difficult.  A  post-synthesis separation approach for a molecule with multiple atoms would be  nightmare.	1642770710.0	htldwno	t3_s93g0c	t3_s93g0c	/r/askscience/comments/s93g0c/how_does_one_create_a_mass_labelled_standard/htldwno/

Two satellites intersects two spheres, giving you a planar circle that you could be anywhere on.  Adding a third satellite intersects another sphere with that circle, leaving two possible positions that you could be at, and a fourth satellite narrows down your location to which of those two positions is correct.

i680ptxo	I use cannabis before breathing meditations, which is part of my evening routine before sleeping, the mixture of being high via thc proceeded by the high of controlled hyperventilating puts me in a very relaxed state mentally and physically. The mind muscle connection when high from thc makes the breathing meditations a lot more of a present experience, I always feel I have had a better meditation after a smoke than without one.  I understand there are many variables in this question but I would like to know does the thc in the body and mind benefit the meditation as like a cheat code to be more present through the meditation therefore allowing greater benefits if the meditation to take place?	1642773385.0	htljfeu	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htljfeu/

How do the majority(?) use it to relax, while people like me are having the total opposite effect.   I start going in too deep in my thoughts, then knock out either from cbd effects or because I am overwhelmed. idk.   At one point, used it to go deep into my psyche to uncover subconscious stuff.

4fzvw	Redshift is a uniform effect. Every single photon gets redshifted by the same amount. The shape of the spectrum - how much light there is at each wavelength - is the same, just uniformly shifted.  If a star was a perfect blackbody, then the difference between a blue star and a red star would look the same - the smooth spectrum is just shifted towards the red or blue. However, stars are far from perfect blackbodies. In particular, they contain absorption and emission lines at very specific wavelengths.  When an atom or ion absorbs or emits a photon, it kicks an electron up or down between energy levels. The energy gained or lost by the electron is given to or absorbed from the photon. This means a particular atom or ion can only produce or absorb photons of certain specific energies that correspond to difference between electron energy levels. The energy of a photon tells you its wavelength.  So what you get is very sharp spikes or dips in a spectrum, corresponding to very specific transitions between electron energy levels for specific atoms or ions. If you can identify these "spectral lines", you know from lab experiments what the wavelength of these lines "should be", and you can figure out the shift in wavelength for these lines, and therefore the redshift of the object.  Now, this works great if you do have a spectrum of the object - but sometimes all you have is broad-band imagery, sort of like an RGB filter, rather than getting every wavelength separately. Then you really need  to do tricks like looking at populations of stars to really tell what's redshift and what is intrinsic colour. Even more important is dust "reddening" - dust will absorb blue light and emit red light, making stars look redder. So you need a good model of the dust along your line of sight to disentangle redshift too, if you don't have a spectrum.	1642775079.0	htln7vi	t3_s8l47a	t3_s8l47a	/r/askscience/comments/s8l47a/when_using_telescopes_to_map_out_the_universe/htln7vi/

71e52	 >Both can be difficult to anesthesise because the pH value in an inflamed tissue is acidic which keeps the anesthetic from entering the nerve. If it can't enter the nerve, it has little to no effect.  Isn't regional block type anesthesia "normal" for deep procedures / in presence of inflammation, for exactly this reason?  I.e. anesthetizing at some distance along the nerve leading to the painful tooth.  I remember having this and the more common infiltration type anesthesia for dental work, and while I found the application of the regional block somewhat more uncomfortable, I found it much more effective - pain is not only reduced but "switched off", and the mouth feels much less weird without a huge area that's superficially numbed like the infiltration results in.	1642775363.0	htlnvuf	t3_s8mble	t1_htkwr01	/r/askscience/comments/s8mble/why_root_canal_hurts_soo_much_if_the_nerve_is_dead/htlnvuf/
3a8wqyma	> with GPS, one satellite will give you a sphere that you could be anywhere on the surface of.  That's only true if the receiver has an accurate atomic clock. Without knowing the exact local time, one satellite gives no information about your location. The fourth satellite is used to determine the local time. Two satellites give two spheres whose intersection is a circle. A third satellite gives a two point intersection with the other spheres. Only one of those points will be relatively stable with respect to the Earth's surface. The other will change wildly with each successive measurement.   >[An atomic clock synchronized to GPS is required in order to compute ranges from these three signals.

uphm	Not your'e area so I thought I'd throw 2 curveballs at you then one personal one in your area. :)  1. Is the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine, physically, addictive and if so why? 2. Although modafinil is roundly considered non-abuseable and non-addictive. Do you think the fact it has been shown to have an elevating effect on dopamine levels will eventually prove this annoyingly illusive\* chemical is addictive in large doses or maybe over extended periods? 3. I'm currently on 0.4mg bupe per day. I'm 2 steps away from sobriety and clarity. So tell me - why in gods name does it feel like my world is falling apart when I take the next step  0.4 -> 0.2mg? Do you think self-medicating with Pregabalin short term could help with symptoms?   \*  I say this because even 10 years ago they were completely baffled as to how it worked. I was surprised how the drug got put on market with so little pharmacological info! Even now they are still confused on how certain things work with it and found it shocking it increased orexin levels which opened up whole new areas of research - it frightens me how little doctors and scientists know about the brain!	1642775494.0	htlo6x6	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlo6x6/

lvrkz	Is there any scientific evidence to my anecdotal observations that cannabis can affect people very differently, specifically motivation, focus, and intellectual creativity/curiosity/learning?  I have known some people to use cannabis daily from a teenager on and have high intellectual and scholastic attainments and high ranking jobs. Their use seems to keep them focused and high energy. These people you would most likely never suspect of drug use. I have also known others that use cannabis daily from a teenager and on and have failed out of school and always seem to been unmotivated and generally underperforming in all aspects of their life.   Would this happen no matter of their drug use or do you think cannabis use can have such different effects on people.	1642776983.0	htlrt9n	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlrt9n/
hljxc6c	As far as I understand, no, at least jot with opioids bc of the way that they change our brain chemistry. As I understand if we have specific opioid receptors in our brains (mu or something i believe?) And our brain actually creates more receptors to take in more opioids, which is why tolerance goes up so fast but doesnt come back down at the same rate, these receptors never go away. So while uou might be able to replace one addiction with another with any other substance i dont think the same rules apply to opioids. I am am addict and have known many other addicts over my time who have picked up a new addiction when trying to beat opioid addiction and just ended up with 2 addictions. Except maybe for weed. I know thar weed helps immensely with opioid withdrawal and detox, and pain management that leads many users to addiction in the first place. I personally have had a lot of luck using cannabis instead of opiates for my physical and mental issues.  I don't know if I understand or explained the concept correctly,  please correct me if I am wrong.	1642776988.0	htlrtqc	t3_s997hz	t1_htlcu7s	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlrtqc/
4we1a	If I understand correctly it works like this (in General Relativity):  The gravitational waves warp the fabric of space based on the projected trajectory of mass?  I've made a very crude illustration of some gravitational waves emitted from a planet orbiting a star:  https://i.imgur.com/3P3NJgS.png  There are three snapshots in time showing which direction gravity "slopes" space towards. (Ignore the star in this example)  What's interesting to me then is that the projected trajectory would take the orbit into account (which is also caused by gravitational forces).	1642777054.0	htlrzn5	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl3s34	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htlrzn5/

1kaot5hy	In the addict community I see a general consensus of people including me, using cannabis as the drug of choice after a large experimental period.

1z28h	Have you done any research into how full CB2 agonists can attenuate the development of opiate tolerance, dependency, and lessen withdrawal symptoms?  I remember reading a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29192123/) done by Eli Lilly on a osteoarthritis drug they developed called LY2828360, which is a CB2 full agonist, and in mice (rats?) they found that the development of tolerance to morphine took significantly longer to develop.    But I didn't hear a lot about this discovery after that, until 2020 when I saw a similar [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32896549/) posted where they showed that it also attenuates physical dependence (amongst other things) as well.  If nothing else, I think these 2 studies need to be promoted publicly because of how groundbreaking this discovery can be. A lot of people fall into addiction because in the past they had to continually increase their dosage, either in higher quantity per dose, or higher quantity of doses per time period, making it more difficult to stop using it in the end.  Imagine you could start someone on a CB2 therapy, for a few days before opiate treatment starts, they could stay on the same opiate dose for years before having to change dosage, and then when they wanted to stop using it, the withdrawal symptoms were significantly diminished.  So to tie this into what you do, there are some compounds in Cannabis that are seemingly full CB2 agonists, like Cannabigerol (CBG), to which it could possibly become therapy that people use alongside opiates.	1642777350.0	htlsq24	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlsq24/

yue6s	Barring the bizarre comment from the person who chews cannabis flowers, in general the "regular/chronic use" described in research is once per month or greater. That frequency, and greater frequency, is associated with memory impairment and all the other stuff hardcore stoners are in denial about. :)   If you want to look into it more, type the following into Google:  >site:ncbi.nlm.nih.gov chronic marijuana use systematic review  You'll find a number of review articles synthesized from credible, peer-reviewed literature. From those, you can follow the references to get more detail of each individual study's methodology and results/conclusions. I say regular use is generally defined as 1+/mo, but each study sets its own criteria. As these groups are often studying different aspects of marijuana use, it's best to look at each one individually to really get into the finer details.  Best of luck! Don't be afraid to try other treatments (assuming your use is for medical reasons) if you're put off by the potential harm marijuana can do to your ability to function agreeably in society (at work, with friends, etc.; that being said, it helps some people with those things). One of the more shocking side-effects associated with regular use is a predisposition to depression, so in that case especially it may be worthwhile to cut back and seek alternative means of treating whatever ails you.

46u4gfyz	Hello! I have often heard among cannabis users the mantra that opiates, nicotine, and other drugs are “biologically addictive” while cannabis is “psychologically addictive.” The explanation I have been able to find for this is that many drugs can change the body such that it does harm to itself in the absence of that substance, whereas cannabis addiction (or other addictions like playing video games or gambling). Is there truth in this? If so, what are the physical and psychological mechanisms behind each type?

77c9s	Could a system exist where all drugs are legal and sold by the government, but the availability would depend on how harmful and how addictive they are? For exemple, you could buy cocaine at a dispensary, but the daily/weekly threshold is linked to your social security number, and you have to submit a request if you wish to increase occasionally this amount. Request could trigger an appointment to a psychiatrist to assess your addiction profile.  Some molecules require a simple statement form, others require a government authorization, and so on?	1642777865.0	htlu0sj	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htlu0sj/

cmht5eup	To some extent it does help, but the most important thing is number of satellites. The process used by GPS receivers to calculate their position is trilateration (or more precisely multilateration) which takes a number of distances to known points (satellites) and uses those to solve for position. The process is slightly complicated in GPS as the true range to the satellites is unknown, only the pseudo ranges are known (differences in range between pairs of satellites).  The pseudo ranges are determined by measuring the differences between in a time signal  eoadcast by  one satellite and a second time signal broadcast by another. Yiu need a minimum of 4 satellites to give enough pseudo ranges that an unambiguous solution is obtained. More pseudo ranges give you capability to detect erroneous signals or average out noise (for example if you have 6 signals, that gives you 6 combinations of 4 satellites, so you can solve each group and get 6 position solutions, then average them - although better techniques are used in practice).  Multiple frequencies can help in some other ways. The different signals transmit the time code in different ways. The transmission on L2 is higher resolution (but it is more difficult to track and acquire - you generally need to use L1 to calculate your position and precise time to give you enough information to tune in the L2 signal). The L2 is encrypted, but survey grade receivers can still extract some useful information from the signal.  Hiwever, the main advantage of multiple frequencies is that the ionosphere distorts the speed of the radio waves. This results in distortion of the pseudo ranges measured by the receiver leading to position errors. Different frequencies give different distortions and by measuring the disagreement between multiple frequency measures of the same pseudo range, it is possible to get a good estimate of the total distortion and subtract it out.  There is a modernisation of the GPS signals underway, with a new high resolution civilian signal being deployed on L5. This is partially operational and some phones and commercial GPS receivers are able to use it. However, few satellites have it active, so it doesn't work very well at present.  The European Galileo system has L1 and L5 signals active on its satellites, but the satellite constellation is not complete so performance is not optimal although it does work and commercial dual frequency civilian recierves work fine with it giving noticeably better resolution.  In principle triple frequency could give better ionosphere correction but it's considered less important, as there are already ways of getting millimeter precision without it by comparing measurements between two receivers (one at a precisely known position and one mobile) which can be done in real time by connecting the two receivers together over a cellular data link	1642778419.0	htlvg1m	t3_s8qpe8	t3_s8qpe8	/r/askscience/comments/s8qpe8/why_are_there_only_two_signals_used_in_gps/htlvg1m/

6xj6pn0t	Stars are made up of gases. Gases are composed of atoms.  As light travels through a gas, electrons in the atoms "absorb" the energy of the light. Looking at the light with a spectrograph shows dark "absorption" lines called [Fraunhofer lines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines). Each gas has a different pattern of Fraunhofer lines. We know from shining light through gases in laboratories at what wavelengths Fraunhofer lines appear when gases are not moving toward or away from us.   When stars or galaxies are moving away from us the pattern of Fraunhofer lines for each gas is not at the wavelength we see in the laboratory, but [shifted toward the red end of the visible spectrum.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)  When stars or galaxies are not moving away from us the pattern of Fraunhofer lines for each gas is at the wavelength we see in the laboratory. A red star not moving away from us just looks red, but its  Fraunhofer lines are not redshifted.	1642778653.0	htlw1rq	t3_s8l47a	t3_s8l47a	/r/askscience/comments/s8l47a/when_using_telescopes_to_map_out_the_universe/htlw1rq/

If a person wants  to have a [DNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate) form on file, that's their choice.  If a person didn't go that far,  but they still feel like *"Shit, I'm feeling bad enough these days  without all this rehab crap. Everybody goes sometime.  Looks like this is my time, and I'd just as  soon go peacefully without Doogie Howser here hassling me"*  - then it seems like that's their right.

I see people enjoying good moments with loved ones or friends being sober, and just imagining that is hard for me. Im a bit sad when i dont smoke, cannabis cause some kind of chemical disbalance dopamine related? Do you have some advice or guidance to take some distance from the substance?

hn3xv	I understand that what you're doing is scientific research but placing cannabis and dangerous opioids like heroin under the same umbrella of harm without insight into the net risks and benefits is socially irresponsible considering its cultural implications and especially considering the current state of the US pharmaceutical industry. If you look hard enough you can find risks with the consumption of any substance given the dose and the given effect on an individual.

whgrg	A rough analogy is that of the wake of a boat. It always points to where the boat *is*, not where it *was* when that part of the wave was emitted - assuming it hasn't changed course or speed since then.  General relativity also - somehow - allows for some acceleration and jerk (change of acceleration) to be "encoded" in the gravitational field, so objects are still attracted to where an object is (or should be) even if it is undergoing predictable acceleration.	1642784239.0	htmax57	t3_s8yph3	t1_htl2e7a	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htmax57/

3ms1b	To add to the other posters' great answers, I'd like to make a simplified analogy:   Think of all the different proteins in your body as tiny machines, each doing a different task. Like, if your body was a country, each cell would be a city, and each protein like an automobile or a soda fountain or lawn sprinkler or whatever.   When different small molecules bind different sites on proteins, they can alter its function, in ways that are dependent on (1) what the small molecule is, (2) what the protein's function is, and (3) where on the protein the small molecule binds. Some of these small molecules are naturally occuring in the cell and are "supposed" to interact with it, while others can be from outside (diet, drugs, etc) and can have effects that are different than what "normally" happens.  > So and how do different molecules lead to different expressions. Two molecules bind to the same receptors but they can still cause different effects?  Let's think if a hypothetical protein that is like an automobile in our city-analogy. If I take a handful of powerful glue (our "drug") and stick it onto one of the tires, it will make it so the car can't move. But if I take that glue and instead stick it onto the steering wheel, the car can move but it can't turn. Or, if I stick it inside the radiator the car can move and turn, but it will eventually overheat. Or if I use it to cover the car stereo speakers, the music won't work. etc.etc. The effects of our "drug" depends on the characteristics of the drug (in this case, powerful stickiness), and where exactly on our  protein "machine" the drug is bound.	1642784642.0	htmc0q2	t3_s77bg3	t1_htbh9cj	/r/askscience/comments/s77bg3/why_do_different_molecules_bind_to_different/htmc0q2/

zbd59	Optimal dose response curves are titrated during clinical trials. Finding a effective and safe dose is part of the vaccine approval process. Any approval is tied to the previously determined dose.  If you were to give an arbitrary (smaller) dose would likely result in a reduced statistical vaccine efficacy.  Individually, you might find that some people (e.g. younger, female) would mount an effective immune response at lower dose already (most older people, people with high body mass, etc probably not)	1642787078.0	htmio03	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmio03/

8w1jk	Within your cannabis research, how do you operationalize individual versions of the drug? The concentration of particular cannabinoids is obviously important, but it's rare to see researchers acknowledge and address that cannabis isn't a homogeneous product. Opioids don't really have the same issue as there is considerably less variance.   Also, is the mechanism of addiction to cannabis also related to activation in the ventral tegmental area of the PFC?

snpmb7k	The goal of any vaccine is to elicit a strong immune response, so that next time your body is exposed to a live virus you get that strong immune response right away. If you don't get a full dose, then your body might not develop that response, and you will have reduced or no protection from the virus. Even if you do get a full dose, some people don't develop a strong immune response for various reasons, which is why herd immunity is an important concept for modern public health.   The appropriate dose level is somewhat of an unknown for any given vaccine. There are models and historical data that we can use to estimate what an appropriate dose will be, but this is one of the primary reasons for conducting clinical trials. The vaccine developers come up with a number they think will be effective, and then the clinical trials in the population will tell you whether or not it's actually effective. Then (in the USA) the FDA approves that specific dose as the authorized "full dose" because it's been clinically shown to be effective.	1642791909.0	htmvp4i	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmvp4i/

gekpw	Basically, the gravitational field that Object A produces depends on where it is, but also on how it's moving. So a time d/c later, when Object B sees the gravitational field of A as it was, the *direction* of the field is sort of "extrapolated" in the direction where A is moving. So by the time that B experiences that field, it's pointing in the direction of A now, and not in the direction where A was d/c time units ago, assuming A continues to move in the way that it was d/c ago.  Can you use it to send information FTL? No. Because that "extrapolation" to the future position of A depends on how it's moving at that moment d/c ago. If you were to suddenly change its trajectory in some way (where this can be defined rigorously in terms of which time-derivatives of the position are nonzero), the "extrapolation" to its future position would simply be wrong.	1642792812.0	htmy5pj	t3_s8yph3	t1_htmr6ym	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htmy5pj/
g9awn	>because apparently diphtongs are very hard to pronounce for many people, as is evident in how most foreign people pronounce 'sauna' as 'soona'  If by "many people" you mean "English speakers", then the basis for the English pronunciation is not a difficulty with diphthongs, since that diphthong exists in most varieties of English. Rather, *sauna* is pronounced with the COT vowel because of the spelling. In English, probably through the influence of French <au> usually represents a low back (monophthonic) vowel, such as in *authorize*.  For contrast, in German, where <au> represents the same diphthong as in Finnish, *Sauna* is pronounced with the original vowel. However, the <s> is rendered as /z/ for similar reasons.	1642792926.0	htmyh4z	t3_s8rbw0	t1_htkqwi1	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htmyh4z/

If you don't get a full dose of the COVID vaccine is like not taking all of your prescribed antibiotics for something like strep throat. If you do follow as instructed for the antibiotic, the bacteria can mutate, reproduce, and let enough bacteria exist with the mutation of being resist or immune to the antibiotic used to treat it originally which would mean higher power antibiotics would be needed. Same applies to COVID vaccine but its your immune cells instead of the antibiotics.	1642793307.0	htmzild	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htmzild/

Which largely involves wanting to have larger size cholesterol molecules (I.e. HDL).  Also most cholesterol tests only roughly approximate the actually dangerous sized cholesterol molecules at less than 25 nanometers, called LDL type B's.

gekpw	[Previous thread about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fhnt7z/in_nuclear_reactors_why_is_it_that_light_water/).  Every material is a moderator, and every material except the fuel is an absorber. But some materials are much better at moderating or absorbing than others.  Light water is a good moderator, a good coolant, and a moderate absorber, all at the same time.  >Is the water defined as a coolant because it absorbs neutrons from fission, or simply because of its thermal properties?  It's a coolant because of its thermal properties; the neutronics of it are not relevant for that purpose.  >And if it can absorb neutrons, thereby slowing the chain-reaction of fission how can it also be a moderator in LWRs?  Because it does both of those things. It downscatters neutrons to lower energies, and then some of those neutrons will induce fission in the fuel, some of the will be absorbed, some of them will simply escape the core. You can't use light water for its scattering cross section (moderation), but "turn off" its absorption cross section (absorption). If the rate at which neutrons are absorbed by light water is too high for your particular design, you consider a different material instead. For example, CANDU reactors in Canada, which use heavy water. Heavy water is still fairly good at moderating neutrons, but has much lower absorption than light water. And that reduced absorption allows for fuel of lower enrichment to be used.	1642793736.0	htn0pc2	t3_s9gm3p	t3_s9gm3p	/r/askscience/comments/s9gm3p/how_can_water_act_as_a_moderator_in_lwrs_if_it/htn0pc2/
fxyckcfp	Its a matter of pressure, concentration, temperature and the components. Its a matter that as temperature goes up, pressure goes down which causes concentration to go down which means it has less to bounce against. Like u/cuicocha mentioned it is also a matter of the Ideal Gas Law, or PV=nRT, or Pressure times Volume equals moles times R(or 0.08206 liters times atmspheric pressure divided by mole times K or Kelvin) times Kelvin. Basically Pressure(atmospheric pressure) times Volume(Liters) equals moles times 0.08206 times Kelvin to determine the amount of gas in accordance to ideal gas law, which is rarely applicable because ideal gases rarely exist naturally, but it would be best to use here since you will likely be assuming its ideal gases.	1642794131.0	htn1sv3	t3_s8i3v8	t3_s8i3v8	/r/askscience/comments/s8i3v8/why_is_the_speed_of_sound_higher_in_warmer_air/htn1sv3/

For example, DC could simply be a constant (zero frequency), or it could be a time-varying waveform that doesn't change sign (like a rectified sine wave, or a sine with a large enough DC offset). And AC could be a pure sine wave, or any arbitrary time-varying waveform.  But terminology aside, you can have whatever kinds of waveforms you want.

After a few years it just wasn’t working so I stopped putting it on. My doctor was flabbergasted when I brought my unused patches to my next appointment. You have to bring all of your pain meds and do a urinalysis at each appointment to show you are the one taking the meds and you have the appropriate amount of meds remaining. I had zero withdrawals or anything. That was 6 years ago.   Now here’s what’s strange. I have a new dr and I told her I’ve really been struggling with pain again. We discussed different options and she suggested medical marijuana. She said she’d much prefer me to be on that. Marijuana just became legal in my state, so I gave it a try for the first time. I have been experimenting with it for the past month. There is no way I’m getting that card. I can easily see myself getting addicted to it.

If so, then is it also true that because a person's body on contemporary synthetic opioids is more involved, the withdrawals can last way, way longer than in heroin or morphine withdrawal?

Your statement, "behavior emerges from the interactive effect of a biological system and an environmental system[because one cannot exist without the other]" is impossible to refute because it is not possible to seperate a biological system from all environments. I can manipulate the environment and observe the behavior across many varying environments(and we have), but no matter what experiment manipulation I do, you will always be able to argue that environment was involved.   Can't prove you true and can't prove you false. That means you can't conclusively be correct nor incorrect.   I, and my Cognitive Scientist professors, conclude that we can't reject that there can exist some biological behaviors.   You are free to think what you like, but what I was correcting is that nothing is conclusive and purely biological behaviors can exist.	1642796336.0	htn7v36	t3_s7rzkk	t1_htk52z9	/r/askscience/comments/s7rzkk/ask_anything_wednesday_biology_chemistry/htn7v36/

15uz6k	Overall, we need to change the focus from penalizing addiction (substance use disorders) to treatment. We need to reduce stigma which will enable more people to seek treatment and the money that is used in the criminal justice system for drug use should instead be moved to developing much needed research and evidence-based treatment programs around the country. But drugs are not addiction. Crimes conducted while taking drugs would still be crimes and treated as such, but individuals in accounting for their crimes would get treatment while in prison and afterwards. With that said, it is also clear that more education programs are essential to develop in a knowledge-based manner to prevent initiation of drug use which can indeed lead to psychiatric and addiction problems.	1642796408.0	htn82c2	t3_s997hz	t1_htl8tgz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htn82c2/

14p9xc	Has there been any research into using marijuana to treat opioid addiction, and if so, are the results looking promising?   This is completely anecdotal, but I've seen several people have to quit smoking marijuana, and then develop an addiction to their prescribed pain meds when they've had no issues before. Likewise, I have seen friends start smoking marijuana, and either take less, or stop taking their pain meds altogether, whether prescribed or if they were purchasing off the street.   This wasn't 100%, I've seen some people both smoke heavily, and also abuse opioids, but it has definitely been enough people I've noticed a pattern. I wonder if there's any scientific merit to this, or of its just coincidence, or me giving false causation because of correlation.	1642796898.0	htn9fcq	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htn9fcq/

We normally operationalize cannabis use in regard to frequency such as multiple times a day, daily, weekly, monthly or as cannabis use disorder in regard to mild, moderate and severe use depending on the negative symptoms it presents for that person. Daily smokers generally can experience change in mood, short-term memory impairment, altered sense of time, and even hallucination in those using high THC potency	1642797125.0	htna2fz	t3_s997hz	t1_htl976o	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htna2fz/

Cable and phone wired transmission uses varying frequency and pattern.  All involve current at various energy levels.

15uz6k	That is an interesting question and unfortunately getting addicted to another drug does not necessarily weaken the addiction to the first drug. Sadly, the bandwidth is broad so people can become addicted to multiple drugs. Yes, individuals may ‘like’ a particular drug more than another type of drug yet still have a similar degree of addiction (i.e., classification of their substance use disorder) for each of the drugs. Although drugs do share common neurobiological systems underlying their addiction, the drugs do have a different pharmacological mechanisms of action	1642797512.0	htnb5c0	t3_s997hz	t1_htlcu7s	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htnb5c0/

I have a small community of women who frequently debate on if it is ‘safe’ to use for anxiety, depression, chronic pain etc.   >   >Have you seen significant difference in the mechanisms between the sexes/hormonal difference in the body?  For individuals in recovery, ‘safe’ use is indeed debated since there are significant individual differences so it is difficult to make a blanket statement. As such, it is critical for people to work with their physicians to find the appropriate medications to address their anxiety, depression, pain, etc. There are medication management strategies suitable for individuals with a prior substance use disorder.        Alcohol and other drugs of abuse do change hormonal levels and there are noted sex differences in the brain response to drugs even though the pharmacological target by which the drugs work is the same irrespective of sex.	1642797857.0	htnc3vz	t3_s997hz	t1_htlcv4q	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htnc3vz/
15uz6k	I am very optimistic about the field of addiction medicine in the future. For me,  the goal is to provide addiction medicine physicians with more clinical tools since we have really been using the same medications for decades with no truly new treatment strategies. I think that current research will provide not only new non-addictive pharmacological treatment strategies, but will also develop neurobiological devices where can target specific brain networks even strengthening, for example, prefrontal cortical function that will also be helpful. In regard to psilocybin the jury has not even been convened as yet since it is still so early. There is still a lot of fundamental research that is needed to be done. It is definitely though not a drug that can just be given to a patient to take at home on their own, but one that requires intense behavioral integration.	1642798349.0	htndhgp	t3_s997hz	t1_htlelz8	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htndhgp/

bqg56lkz	To make electricity flow, we need to create an electrical *imbalance*. As long as there's an imbalance, electricity will flow through every available path.         One tactic is to create that imbalance, and then just let it equalise slowly as the electricity flows until the imbalance is gone.  Or you could keep on topping up the imbalance.  Either way, the electricity is only going to flow in one direction through the circuit.  This is DC, direct current.  A plainer name would have been The Electricity Only Ever Flows In One Direction Current.          DC is easy to use but it's a little hard to generate. Let's think back to the time of the Industrial Revolution.  They were really  *really* good at building machines which were driven by a turning wheel. They also figured out that moving a wire near a magnet would create an imbalance and cause electricity to flow in the wire.   Combine these two ideas and you have an easy way to generate electricity. Put a coil of wire on a wheel, put magnets next to the wheel, and *voila!*  Electricity.         BUT, something attached to a turning wheel is going to move away from you, then towards you, then away from you, then towards you. And the same happens with the electrical imbalance.  It goes one way, then the other way  then one way, then the other way.        So these are the two grand tactics of making electricity: (1) create an imbalance which might run down but which will never change direction, or (2) harness a spinny thing to create an imbalance which changes direction over and over again.	1642798751.0	htnelxp	t3_s9g9rr	t3_s9g9rr	/r/askscience/comments/s9g9rr/what_are_ac_and_dc_currents_and_are_there_other/htnelxp/

g1t74	If you only get a small amount of the vaccine, you would still produce a bit of immune response, but not enough to prevent infections to a meaningful extent.   When vaccine researchers design the study, they would first test the virus and see how much antibodies are required to kill it, and then they would test several different doses in human volunteers, and see how the body responds. They would then choose a dosage that produces a nice level of antibodies that also does not produce too many side effects. Pfizer went with a smaller dose that still produced the desirable amount of antibodies, while Moderna went with a bigger dose, which generally speaking had more side effects, but later proved to be a bit better at preventing infections and hospitalizations than Pfizer.   Sometimes scientists don't get it quite right, for example, the Pfizer pediatric trial found out half way through their trial that the dose they went with was too small for an ideal antibody response. https://khn.org/morning-breakout/pfizer-to-test-third-vaccine-dose-for-young-kids-after-trials-miss-immunity-marks/	1642800406.0	htnj832	t3_s9f960	t3_s9f960	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htnj832/

cf5q6h0e	Why are opioids not used more in psychiatry?  As a patient with both chronic pain and depression, I noticed that a low opioid dose completely eliminates pretty severe depression - for a short time. (After 1 - 4 months, the anti-depressing effect fades, even though it still works as a painkiller.)  Usage suggestion, just as a patient: Use for max. 4 weeks, while starting treatment with an anti-depressant. Then, the anti-depressant needs to "take over".  Obviously, this method has the same addiction potential as when used as a painkiller. So it would only be viable when closely monitored, no contraindication for opioids exists (e. g. addiction in the past), and only when the patient really, really can't make it through the next few weeks otherwise.  I did pretty much exactly that "by accident"; however made the mistake to keep taking the opioid long after the anti-depressant was effective, thus making withdrawal from the opioid unnecessarily unpleasant.	1642803510.0	htnrqui	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htnrqui/

And a highly lucrative one at that, because the incarcerated are put to work for pennies on the dollar.  One article reference: [Nixon Adviser Admits War on Drugs Was Designed to Criminalize Black People](https://eji.org/news/nixon-war-on-drugs-designed-to-criminalize-black-people/)  >Between 1980 and 2011, arrests of African Americans for violent and property crimes fell, but rose dramatically for drug offenses. As the Washington Post reported, African Americans are far more likely to be arrested for selling or possessing drugs than whites, even though whites use drugs at the same rate and are more likely to sell drugs.  Book reference: [The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](https://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness-ebook/dp/B086CFB2NT)  > Since it was first published in 2010, it has been cited in judicial decisions and has been adopted in campus-wide and community-wide reads; it helped inspire the creation of the Marshall Project and the new $100 million Art for Justice Fund; it has been the winner of numerous prizes, including the prestigious NAACP Image Award; and it has spent nearly 250 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.  >Most important of all, it has spawned a whole generation of criminal justice reform activists and organizations motivated by Michelle Alexander's unforgettable argument that "we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it." As the Birmingham News proclaimed, it is "undoubtedly the most important book published in this century about the U.S."	1642804248.0	htntpkr	t3_s997hz	t1_htn82c2	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htntpkr/

t7kb9jh	The latest research shows that COVID-19 is mainly an arterial disease, possibly changing a number of characteristics of the arterial walls and affecting interactions with platelets and clotting. The lungs have some of the most complex and smallest arterial structures, and therefore are greatly affected by the infection. There is damage done to the organs during the infection because of blood flow and oxygenation issues, and there is evidence of long term arterial changes/damage to the entire body after infection but it varies greatly person to person.  The brain is incredibly complex and medicine has known for some time that cognitive damage can occur even when oxygenation seems to have been kept appropriately high (see postperfusion syndrome or "pump head".) These symptoms can be temporary or can actually get worse over time.  The sooner the virus is cleared, the better off the outcome. The vaccine helps to prime your immune system to recognize the virus faster, and therefore clear it faster reducing the damage it can do.  Because of the way COVID-19 works, a person can have a pretty serious infection going but only feel minor symptoms until the organ systems are really in bad shape.  So the answer is absolutely yes. The evidence from multiple studies shows a reduction in post-recovery cognitive issues for those were vaccinated and still had a positive COVID-19 test result.

15uz6k	>Hello! I have often heard among cannabis users the mantra that opiates, nicotine, and other drugs are “biologically addictive” while cannabis is “psychologically addictive.” The explanation I have been able to find for this is that many drugs can change the body such that it does harm to itself in the absence of that substance, whereas cannabis addiction (or other addictions like playing video games or gambling). Is there truth in this? If so, what are the physical and psychological mechanisms behind each type?  Cannabis is like other drugs in that it too is biologically addictive. Meaning that when it is not present, it does lead to physiological changes, not just craving/anxiety which many consider as “psychological” addiction. The effects of cannabis are mediated by cannabinoid receptors that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain that underlie craving, anxiety and mood. However, cannabinoid receptors are also expressed throughout the body.	1642807932.0	hto3b0p	t3_s997hz	t1_htltsko	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto3b0p/

Depression and anxiety are highly co-morbid with cannabis use disorder. There is also evidence that individuals with ADHD have higher cannabis use. It is often believed that cannabis is used to “self-medicate” these underlying conditions, but unfortunately the use of cannabis, especially high potency THC, will exacerbate them.	1642808771.0	hto5f3o	t3_s997hz	t1_htlal59	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto5f3o/

I genuinely thought I would be fine with a few days of pain meds, but because of the osteomyelitis, I was on and off Vicodin for months. After I was healed, I still relapsed a few times, and finally have stayed clean since the end of December again. My psychiatrist put me on naltrexone which combined with therapy and sober buddies has made a huge difference. I went from constant cravings to only wanting to use when I’m in the midst of a panic attack. I’m 29 now- how long do you think someone can safely stay on naltrexone without adverse long term effects?	1642808858.0	hto5mv3	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto5mv3/

15uz6k	It is clear that neurobiological changes induced by cannabis and THC persist long beyond acute intake, but different systems can 'normalize' at different time periods. Nevertheless, it appears even for some neural systems that might appear "normal" that they may still show long-term sensitivity during challenging situations later in life. Onset, frequency and duration of cannabis use all contribute to persistent long-term effects. Importantly though, research has shown that these long-term effects are mediated by 'epigenetic' mechanisms which is basically how the environment puts tags on the DNA to turn on and off genes. Since epigenetic mechanisms are reversible it means that cannabis-related alterations should also be reversible.	1642809333.0	hto6tll	t3_s997hz	t1_htlakn3	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/hto6tll/

This means that if you have two starts that look similar you might get a false positive.  Further more it is possible for the free amino acids used to fill in the rest of the gene when copying it in the PCR to bind to either the start reader or end reader strand of the gene, their by tricking the test into thinking that you have the gene present in the test.	1642810662.0	htoa38y	t3_s9kcvi	t3_s9kcvi	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htoa38y/

15uz6k	Medical marijuana has different meanings with some thinking that it is CBD, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid, and for others cannabis with THC.  Our preclinical animal research had shown that CBD could reduce cue-induced heroin-seeking behavior. We then followed that with clinical pilot studies that showed indeed that CBD could reduce cue-induced craving and anxiety in individuals with heroin use disorder. We are now in the process of conducting larger clinical trials first taking a look at different CBD formulations. Other researchers are also trying to replicate those findings.   CBD is non-intoxicating so some investigators are also looking at cannabis itself to treat opioid use disorder as a more harm-reduction reward substitution strategy using a drug like marijuana that does not have the high mortality risk as opioids. Research is though still just starting.	1642811746.0	htocrf1	t3_s997hz	t1_htlh1z6	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htocrf1/

15uz6k	No, I have never had experiences with the various substances that I have studied. I do agree that experience can bias in either direction.  It is also clear that bias also relates to the context with which you are familiar with the drug. Since I work in a hospital research setting we mainly interact with individuals who suffer tremendously from their addiction. Of course though there are many people who will use the same drug and not develop a problem. Our goal is to understand the aspect of risk and resiliency which for substance use disorder is quite complex with multiply factors.  The endocannabinoid system on which THC works plays a critical role during neurodevelopment in hardwiring the brain. as such, it is not surprising that exposure to cannabis during development can impact  various neuronal pathways. This is demonstrated mainly in animal studies. In our human fetal studies, we also observed significant changes in the expression of genes in brain areas that will eventually mediate, for example, emotions, goal-directed behavior and cognition. These changes were more affected though in those with mothers who had more daily frequent use of cannabis.	1642812762.0	htof89h	t3_s997hz	t1_htlbfkg	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htof89h/
x890a7s	Is there research being done on isolating some positive benefits of cannabis into a medication on it's own?  For example, I am struggling with self-medicating my sleep and stomach issues with edibles. I have lifelong insomnia (circadian rhythm disorder related to autism) and a chronic illness that causes a lot of gut inflammation and discomfort (IBS + others).   My stomach is uncomfortable or in pain all the time and food makes me extremely nauseous, except if I take an edible. I was taking a gummy at night for sleep, or at least relaxation if I can't sleep, but my stomach issues are so bad I keep not eating until I take my gummy at night.   (Not ideal as eating right before bed is bad for you.)  I would love to see a medication isolate just the stomach improvements from cannabis use, as the current stomach medications don't work for me.	1642812781.0	htofa12	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htofa12/

13sdyu	I look around at some of the research, sales and health outcome statistics, and I see no evidence at all that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada and some US states is contributing to reduce pot use and abuse among the population. In fact, it has been found that cannabis-related hospitalizations of adolescents have been increasing disproportionately in the US states where the recreational use was legalized, even though the minimum legal age is set at 21.  [Trends in Adolescent Cannabis-Related Hospitalizations by State Legalization Laws, 2008–2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X21003852)  Furthermore, it's impossible to ignore the painfully obvious conflict of interest among many of those who make a point to highlight the "economic" benefits of legalizing recreational marijuana? Cannabis-related stocks have been pooping up in tandem with the growing pro-legal noise and it's impossible to dissociate the pro-legal propaganda/agenda from an ulterior financial motive that doesn't properly value or flat out disregards public health consequences.  1. Do you not think that the legalization of recreational use is a reckless mistake? Shouldn't it had be simply decriminalized instead?  2. Do you think that a responsible drug legislation should also restrict the economic freedom of recreational drug-related economic activities with heavier regulation? Are you willing to opine or discuss the possibility of legally forbidding the listing of businesses that profit from recreational drug sales in the stock market, for example? Wouldn't strategies like this be useful to discourage not only misleading propaganda, but also ultimately sales and use of recreational drugs to some extent?	1642814513.0	htojgqb	t3_s997hz	t1_htn82c2	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htojgqb/

I feel like we need to be switching gears towards a more supplement and natural remedy approach for managing pain and chronic conditions, as I have personally experienced in my time.

gxotx	The treatment for opiate abuse is generally.more opiates but under controlled stigma. Suboxone is a very powerful opiate and while they say it doesnt cause the same effects, thats the marketing shit the companies made ip. Three years ago the FDA sactioned the sales of large quantities of loperdamide, which is even more powerful and sold otc. Loperdamide is said to not pass the BBB, but it's not a wall, and large amounts can push through, especially wheen they used to sell 400pills for $5 at Costco. Opiate and weed addiction are not the same, but from what I have seen, weed addiction seems to create worse people in the end. The opiate addicts just wanna stop having to take opiates, but the weed people don't give a shit and just want to smoke.	1642822945.0	htp3ad9	t3_s997hz	t1_htn82c2	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htp3ad9/

ifqoplk4	Tl:dr..pcr data interpretation is..complicated.  I've noticed an interesting issue I've been had with a PCR test..maybe 1 reaction out of every 100. Instead of the usual logarithmic increase in fluorescence, I see a small increase that creeps up and above the threshold I've set (essentially resulting in what could be considered a 'false positive') However, after noting something was "off" I looked at the raw data and noticed something interesting. These increases in fluorescence are no more notable than that in any of the negative samples overall..and something is causing the software to select an early baseline. This means that any increase at all in fluorescence is determined by the software to be more drastic than it actual is. So, my conclusion is that there is an odd random increase in fluorescence that happens sometimes with this assay, which tricks the software into thinking it's a meaningful increase. It then essentially "hits record" and starts blowing subsequent increases in fluorescence out of proportion and giving you a "false positive." Now imagine this happening on a test that just spits out a "positive" or "negative" result with no human intervention meticulously going over the data and saying "hmm, this one isnt actually positive.."  It's not easy to design software that can account for every random thing that may be observed in real-time PCR data.  This whole post is only accounting for software issues though. There are equally as lengthy posts that could be made about the other potential false positive causes	1642824169.0	htp61rt	t3_s9kcvi	t3_s9kcvi	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htp61rt/

Helped quite immensely with manic depression, and seemed to bring pain levels down. So much so that I barely had any. I currently take Suboxone, initially to kick opiates, and now to treat chronic pain caused by a nerve disorder that presents with the symptoms of parsonage turner syndrome. Though as I've gotten older, some of those symptoms are no longer congruent. It was not a decision made lightly. I also have to take gabapentin, and antiinflammatories. The Suboxone has and still does work better for my pain, combined with the other meds, than normal opiates ever did. The normal line of pain killers eventually did barely anything but get me high, and very little for actual pain. The nerve disorder is still an unknown	1642825426.0	htp8pkq	t3_s997hz	t3_s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htp8pkq/

7tbpq	Imagine a sealed balloon of air in a vacuum, with a heat lamp heating the balloon up.  As the air inside the balloon heats up, the molecules inside have more kinetic energy; they move faster and hit the sides of the balloon harder, which puts more force on the walls of the balloon, causing it to expand.  No air is entering or leaving the balloon, so if heating up the balloon causes it to expand, then the same mass of air takes up a larger volume when hot, so its density goes down as it heats up.  A smaller density at higher temperature means that a volume of hot air is lighter than an equal volume of cold air.	1642827813.0	htpdhfe	t3_s79sx8	t3_s79sx8	/r/askscience/comments/s79sx8/why_is_warm_air_lighter_than_cold_air/htpdhfe/

6h26t	So outcompeting requires that infection with one variant produces antibodies that block the other.  Even with Omicron, that seems to be the case (at least for infections close in time, as one would expect with "competing").    In general, viruses evolve towards whatever helps them reproduce the most.  (As do all organisms, although a virus is not technically an organism...)  Most of the time, that's a trend towards increased infectivity.  Sometimes it's also a trend towards less virulence within the host, because if the virus kills the host too quickly, then it doesn't have time to jump to new hosts and propagate.  To be clear, no viruses "want" anything -- they don't "want" to kill.  It just turns out that using a large portion of your organs to reproduce results in the virus killing you.	1642829245.0	htpg8qs	t3_s8pwmg	t3_s8pwmg	/r/askscience/comments/s8pwmg/are_we_tending_towards_more_infective_variants_of/htpg8qs/

I recently read about CHS, and I am taking a T break just in case this is what I am developing. From what I understand, the cyclical vommiting stage is the one you dont come back from, and it generally requires hospitalization and an IV drip. Given that I am nowhere near this bad, do you think I am taking a break in time to be able to enjoy cannabis later? How long of a break would you reccomend? Do you have any advice related to my situation in general? I was thinking about 30 days, doing cardio each day. Would I need to completly reset my tolerance to avoid progressing the CHS, assuming this is what I have? Im 6'2, 175lbs, and was vaping about 250-750mg of 94% delta-8 distilate per day.

But then it can just as easily send you to the emergency room.  This makes it very difficult to know for certain what it might do.  As for vaccines, they will reduce your chances of contracting the disease, and they are even more effective at preventing serious symptoms.  But nothing there is 100% either.  So, my educated guess would be that the vaccines will almost certainly reduce your chances of any serious side effect.  Brain damage included.

The great vowel shift had finished, so it would be somewhat similar outside of a few words and terms. Think talking to a real rural speaker of some obscure dialect in north wales or smth. You'd call it a thick accent with a couple made-up words  But reading?

Tesla coils for example can cause electricity to flow through the air (and air is usually a very good insulator).  A conductor is just a material that has high conductivity and a low resistivity. Pure (deionized) water has low conductivity and high resistivity, so it's not a conductor.	1642842018.0	htq0mhn	t3_s52po9	t1_htohnta	/r/askscience/comments/s52po9/jupiters_surface_how_we_know_what_its_like/htq0mhn/

2miwna93	For original, internal names (endonyms) mostly descriptions. They can often be VERY boring/blunt/descriptive. Exonyms typically come about because of odd bits of history.  For example:  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "Nippon(koku)" = "The Sun's Origin", in Japanese. Some might say "The Land of the Rising Sun". It's also pronounced as "Nihon". It is written 日本, 日 = Sun, 本 = Start, because the Japanese learned to write from China (This is why reading Japanese is difficult, and why the Koreans agreed to throw that system out).   "Japan" on the other hand is the result of what amounts to a game of multi-lingual telephone. Japan's European name(s) was/were taken from China, as they had heard of it second-hand.   In Cantonese, 日本 is pronounced like "yat bun", which is where the Dutch got their word "Japan" (Yapan). The Portuguese on the other hand heard it from another group of southern speakers. In Min Chinese, 日本 was, and still is read as something like "Ji̍t pún".   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "Deutschland" on the other hand came from "Diutisciu Land", or "Land of the People" ("Diot" meaning "People")   "Germany" came from latin "Germania", or "Land of the Germani". The Germani were a Germanic tribe that likely inhabited the rough area of Germany (Technically the Rhineland) when the romans were around. They moved, or were otherwise displaced by another people.  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "France" came from Latin "Francia", meaning "Land of the Franks", because it was was home to a people called "The Franks" or Frankish.   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  "Russia" is Latin as well, came from "Land of the Rus".   The name "Rus" itself is thought to be a loanword from Proto-Finnic, and it was the name for the Swedish (\*Ruotsi), which meant "the men who row" (rods-).   In some Finnic Languages, like Veps, their version of the word "Ros" still means "Swedish".   = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  *Estados Unidos Mexicanos*, or Mexico, came from "Mexihco", the name of for the heartland of the Aztec Empire, aka The Valley of Mexico.   As to where "Mexihco" came from, we don't know.   Some think it came from "Mēxxīcco", which would mean "Place at the Moon's Navel", but that would require some odd simplifications, and isn't widely accepted... We don't know a lot about the Nahuatl language's history, because the Spanish burnt a lot of it some 500 years ago. ***Thanks, Hernan Cortés >:\[***	1642843100.0	htq245c	t3_s8rbw0	t3_s8rbw0	/r/askscience/comments/s8rbw0/how_are_countries_named_in_their_nonnative/htq245c/
yvq1g	You are referring to a gravitational field. A gravitational wave is a ripple caused by a sudden change of a field - just like you have the electromagnetic field of a radio emitter and electromagnetic waves (that can carry information) that are caused by rapid changes of this field and can propagate much further than the field itself.  There is a very popular visualization of a gravitational field as a 2D curving of a 2D planar surface ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg)). This has its limits - gravity happens in 3D and curves a 4D spacetime - so you cannot really visualize the slope. Just like any field, it has both force and direction in every point. Two identical fields with opposite directions in one point are reduced to zero.	1642843489.0	htq2mz9	t3_s8yph3	t1_htokiyh	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htq2mz9/

g1t74	It mostly does, it's just not linear or consistent. Moderna's Phase 1, for example, found that antibody levels correlate to dosage. "After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-μg group, 109,209 in the 100-μg group, and 213,526 in the 250-μg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). " https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2022483   Pfizer also found that "RBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose." They tried 10μg, 30μg and 100μg.  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2639-4 if you look at the graph in Figure 4, you will see that bigger doses had higher antibody levels. The lower levels at 100μg past 21 days was due to the fact this group did not get a second dose - Pfizer decided the difference was too modest to justify the increased side effects.	1642848969.0	htqa3d5	t3_s9f960	t1_htq64yd	/r/askscience/comments/s9f960/is_the_full_dose_of_the_covid_vaccine_necessary/htqa3d5/

quthw	Well thats not really true I guess, if you are addicted to cannabis  (smoking on a regular basis for an extended period) you probably will have some withdrawal symptoms that can be both psychologically and physically.  People tend to report symptoms like headaches, restlessness, anxiety, apetite changes/stomach problems and insomnia as withdrawal occurs.	1642851892.0	htqe8ar	t3_s997hz	t1_hto6p8o	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqe8ar/

The only type of vaccine that can cause the illness it tries to prevent is live attenuated virus vaccines which use a live but weakened virus. This vaccine type include the MMR vaccine, chickenpox, and smallpox and a couple less common ones (in the US).  This pretty much only happens in people with weakened immune systems and such people may be advised to avoid these vaccines.	1642852004.0	htqee3n	t3_s9b9ja	t3_s9b9ja	/r/askscience/comments/s9b9ja/is_there_any_small_possiblility_that_humans_get/htqee3n/

z4z1h	Primer selection is the key problem in designing a highly selective PCR.  Primers are short synthesized nucleotide sequences that bind to the viral nucleic acid and allow sequence replication via reverse transcriptase elongation.  The primers are selected based on viral sequencing to identify unique sequences within the viral genome so that one primer replicates one strand in the up direction and the other primer initiates replication in the other direction so that the replicated strands are complimentary and can bind to one another.  The replicated strands are then heat denatured to separate them and the primers are then recycled to initiate additional rounds of priming and sequence elongation; repeat many times until the replicated sequence is present in great enough amounts to be detectable.    The problem comes in when the primer selection is not optimal and detects nucleotide sequences not unique to the intended target nucleotide sequence; for example, there are many strains of coronavirus which may share a large amount of sequence identity or similarity that could confound results of PCR and show up as a false positive if the target is intended to by Covid-19 specific and the primers have not been designed to exclude non-Covid coronavirus sequences.  This is a significant problem because in order to design completely specific primers it is necessary to identify unique viral regions specific for the virus in question, which requires whole genome sequence databases for every type of nucleic acid (viral, bacterial, host) likely to be present in the test sample.  This is just one of the possible reasons for false positives, but an important one.	1642854572.0	htqi67q	t3_s9kcvi	t3_s9kcvi	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htqi67q/

One in particular is the increase in phosphorylated Tau protein (a marker often seen in neurodegenerative disorders like dementia) in the brains of individuals with heroin abuse. This was replicated in our animal model (heroin self-administration) and related to specific epigenetic changes associated with the gene that regulates downstream Tau phosphorylation.

15uz6k	This 'chicken and egg' is still a major question in research. It is clear though that the arrow is in both directions. Mechanistically, individuals with risk for certain psychiatric disorders have underlying perturbation of neurobiological systems that are the pharmacological target of some drugs of abuse. Thus, using drugs can make some individuals feel  'normal' but eventually bring them down a path of addiction as they need more and more of the drug. And on the other hand, even in individuals without a psychiatric risk, the repeated exposure of potent drugs can change the neural signature to mimic that seen with psychiatric illnesses.	1642862740.0	htqx9gg	t3_s997hz	t1_htlk6wl	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqx9gg/

15uz6k	A number of longitudinal and epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown that early onset of cannabis use is associated with worse outcomes than those who started later in life. Animal models also verify such findings.  There are no laws that can really prevent young people from experimenting with drugs.  Open, non-judgmental evidence-based education is critical.  Improved treatment and access would improve if laws are changed, for example, in the restricted manner in which opioid treatments are provided to individuals suffering from opioid use disorder.	1642863193.0	htqy9qj	t3_s997hz	t1_htlo5y7	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqy9qj/
157xv3	There are a couple of ways this can happen, and this list is by no means exhaustive. The authors in this paper also don't seem to claim any one of these mechanisms as the culprit; at this point, it looks like they've just identified the SNP. The actual mechanism could be one of these or none of these:  1) The SNP could affect intron splicing. Some mutations in introns can actually impair intron removal, leaving the intron in the mature mRNA. As you can imagine, this would have profound impacts on protein translation.  2) The SNP could be a mutation in an miRNA that has yet to be identified. miRNA genes sometimes (certainly not always) reside in the introns of other genes, and those miRNAs could be involved in the regulation of any number of processes in the cell in which the gene is typically expressed.  3) The SNP in the intron could interfere with how well the gene is transcribed. Introns sometimes boost gene transcription even if they don't directly promote transcription factor binding.  One thing is clear, however.

15uz6k	Thank you. It has been a challenging road when many initially thought that the focus of our research was not important to support.  We have identified interesting epigenetic effects (e.g., acetylation, histone methylation) associated with cannabis and heroin use that are unfortunately beyond this forum to detail. However, it is intriguing that the epigenetic changes can be targeted pharmacologically which gives hope for potentially developing novel non-addictive treatments.  We have had a number of unexpected findings. One in particular is the increase in phosphorylated Tau protein (a marker often seen in neurodegenerative disorders like dementia) in the brains of individuals with heroin abuse. This was replicated in our animal model (heroin self-administration) and related to specific epigenetic changes associated with the gene that regulates downstream Tau phosphorylation.   Other interesting findings include detecting cross-generational effects of THC.	1642863540.0	htqz0xl	t3_s997hz	t1_htlpn7z	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htqz0xl/

1fa1t	There are are regulatory and enhancing regions of gene expression (particularly at thee 5' end of the gene) as well.  It's also possible that there's an unrecognized transcript isoform of the gene where a portion of the intron (from one isoform) is actually an alternate or optional exon of another.	1642864185.0	htr0gbu	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htqygjo	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr0gbu/
157xv3	Most of the time, mutations don't really do much of anything. Less than 3% of the human genome actually contains protein-coding genes, and even variations in those genes are commonly found in the population.  One thing I learned during my research (I've been in research since 2005) is that it's pretty incredible how resilient life can be. It's pretty rare for people to find a seemingly random mutation that has such a big effect, which is why this paper for published in such a big-name journal.  The cool thing is when you find a mutation like this. At first glance, it shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it is. That means we don't understand something, that there's a gap in our knowledge. That's when we can learn something new and weird!	1642864193.0	htr0gw2	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htqz211	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr0gw2/
15uz6k	The glutamatergic system which ketamine targets is critical to the underlying neurobiology of addiction including the transition to compulsive, drug-seeking behavior.  The brain is the most complex organ so it is not surprising that there is still so little that we know. That is why it is so exciting to be a neuroscientist which really is being an "explorer" of a new world.   Unfortunately we are often in a catch-22 situation since everyone wants new potential medications for psychiatric and addiction disorders to work especially those that get initial hype so they can sometimes quickly end up on the market despite knowing relatively little about their mechanism of action. This even goes for some new drugs and nutraceuticals being promoted to help neurogenesis and neuroplasticity to fix the cognitive decline you noted.

15uz6k	Cannabis can cause harm as the legal drugs you noted.  A number of research groups have shown that cannabis can cause psychological changes even in individuals with no known susceptibility and animal studies verify those findings. Dose (i.e., THC potency), early onset of use, frequency of use all of course increases that risk, but indeed, it accelerates psychological issues in those who are already susceptible.	1642864628.0	htr1fp0	t3_s997hz	t1_htlgxr0	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr1fp0/

15uz6k	The questions you raise are very important for human studies since the environment under which a child develops is critical for increasing the risk that cannabis (or other drugs) can have on the developing brain. Indeed, impoverished and adverse environments alone can be more detrimental to brain than the drug use. In our developmental human studies, we do try to account for multiple coexisting conditions but we of course can't know everything so other factors could impact the results we say are linked to cannabis. that is why we also conduct animal studies in which we can control their environment to see does the drug itself lead to brain and behavioral consequences as seen in humans.	1642864906.0	htr22og	t3_s997hz	t1_htlagul	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr22og/

157xv3	Well, some mutations could be silent, i.e. they change the DNA sequence but not change the amino acids sequence of the protein because multiple codons can code for the same amino acid. Or, a protein could tolerate a different amino acid in a certain position even if it slightly changes the protein structure or skewers the protein function in a way that doesn't hurt cell function too much.  But instead of calling anything that's not a gene junk DNA, I prefer to say it's DNA that didn't have a known specific function yet. I say this mostly because of I call something junk, I'm almost sure I'll be proven wrong almost immediately.	1642865084.0	htr2h8w	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htr1n1g	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr2h8w/

is3s1a47	The ancient Egyptians used siphons at least as long ago as 1500 BC. The siphon principle was described around 240 BC by Greek mathematician and inventor Tesibus of Alexandria. Aristotle was a Greek teacher who lived from 384 BC 322 and he articulated the scientific fact that water seeks it's own level.  Water within a siphon conduit will seek it's own level and no matter the length when a running siphons outlet is raised to the level of the inlet water level the flow has achieved equilibrium and the flow will stop.  A siphon will continue to run if the outlet is sufficiently positioned below the source level and the crest  can be raised over 25 feet without  stopping  the flow.   Scientists believed it was a violation of the law of conservation of energy to receive water above the source with a siphon because the total energy related to siphons remains constant.  It wasn't until as recent as the 1990s that a cyclical way of dispensing liquids from an inline  canister above the source was invented.  A Siphon Pump Having a Metering Chamber accomplishes this seemingly  impossible task.	1642865291.0	htr2y54	t3_sa4353	t3_sa4353	/r/askscience/comments/sa4353/can_a_siphon_dispense_liquids_above_the_source/htr2y54/

Opioids, though of extremely beneficial for acute relief of intense pain, have a higher addictive potential and increased mortality than cannabis.  However, cannabis is not benign, especially for the developing brain. Different cannabinoids have different benefits and risks. THC especially at high doses found today has more harm whereas CBD is non-intoxicating and our research showed that it reduced heroin craving and anxiety. Yes, anything if you look hard enough can have a risk. We need to therefore look at what people are actually consuming and not being alarmists.	1642865985.0	htr4ksp	t3_s997hz	t1_htm3rxm	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr4ksp/

14vn06	Alright, so, if we pull back a bit from the abstraction that DNA is simple a 'code', it is also a physical thing.  Though the Intron is not directly used in gene expression, it is still part of the overall structure. Removing, adding, or changing a piece of the overall structure can result in a change in how the DNA folds, it can change the distribution of chemical charge across the structure, and it could even turn what was 'junk' DNA into something that would no longer be ignored. Any of those changes modifies how the RNA machines that interpret, trim, or replicate the DNA are able to interact with it.  Ultimately, though Introns aren't directly involved in the literal output of DNA transcription, they are still impactful on how Gene expression occurs.	1642866395.0	htr5jv8	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htr5jv8/

Mood is the reason a lot of people consume THC, but it also has effects that aren't usually considered. But I definitely see a lot of individual differences in how much it takes for one person to start having noticeable differences.     I've got some friends who smoke regularly, and they have no major changes, then another friend who smokes with the same frequency, who could smoke the same amount, and almost have a psychotic episode. I believe there can be a large spectrum of different factors that could go into that and I was curious if they had noticed anything in their research.	1642868089.0	htr9m16	t3_s997hz	t1_htqhd52	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/htr9m16/

9xxkf	I am confused as to whether, for whatever reason:  The earth's temperature will roughly remain constant at the same 'warm' temperatures we see today  The earth's temperature will continue to rise with time, slowly and linearly  The earth's temperature will continue to rise with time, fast and linearly  The earth's temperature will rise with time exponentially or some other way.   ------  In other words, if we stop emitting all GHGs into the atmosphere today, then plot earth temperature vs time from this moment, what would the graph look like, and why.  -------  I feel like I've seen it stated before that earth will continue to get warmer and warmer due to CO2, so we HAVE to remove CO2 in the air to stop the temperature from rising to above +2 degC from what it was before the industrial revolution. I have also heard general explanations saying that "Earth will remain 'warm' due to CO2 in the atmosphere" which is vague and implies that Earth can remain at about ~1.5 degC warmer than it was pre-industrial revolution, and never reach the +2 degC increase.

3yvxcpj4	As someone who has run PCR a lot, I can elaborate on non-specific reactions. If the reaction temperatures are off, you can have the primer bind to non-complementary DNA which will lead to amplification and a false positive. This leads to trade offs with reaction temperature between specificity (low false positives) and sensitivity (ability to detect small amounts of target DNA).  And as someone else mentioned incorrect temperatures can also lead to the primers sticking to each other (primer dimerization). That is why primer design is an important step, since this can minimize the chances of primer dimerization for a wider temperature range.  This is a lesser contributor to false positives though since negative controls are used. The same reaction mixture is run without the sample. If primer dimerization is happening, most likely the negative control will amplify too, telling you something is wrong.	1642868991.0	htrbtnf	t3_s9kcvi	t1_htocyry	/r/askscience/comments/s9kcvi/if_pcr_tests_look_for_specific_dna_sequences_how/htrbtnf/

6y75e	Color is not "essentially a wavelength". There are various color experiences we have that do not correspond to any single wavelength of light (non-spectral or extraspectral colors like pink, purple, and brown).  Our experience of color is the result of the interaction of light (combinations of wavelengths at various intensities) with our visual systems. Our visual systems are not simply "photon detectors". In fact, with a single kind of receptor (cone cell) it is impossible to distinguish between different wavelengths (because the response of the cell is modulated by both the wavelength and the intensity and changes in response can be dur to changes of one or the other or both).   The wiki page on the [color wheel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel) is actually pretty reasonable, but a more detailed response cannot be given without talking about biology, specifically the color-opponent organization in the retina.	1642869774.0	htrds5v	t3_s9ur6b	t3_s9ur6b	/r/askscience/comments/s9ur6b/why_is_a_colour_wheel_a_circle_and_not_a_straight/htrds5v/

If we reduce emissions to the point where our input equals the natural removal and concentrations stay constant, the Earth continues to warm by a degree or two over a century or two.  If we cut emissions to *zero*, the natural CO2 removal works against the delayed warming, and temperature stays more or less constant for a few centuries before starting to fall.   https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached	1642869926.0	htre5vm	t3_q6ht1t	t1_htr9x6a	/r/askscience/comments/q6ht1t/isnt_co2_emission_reduction_without_carbon/htre5vm/

Without gravity the contents of your stomach can’t settle into gases on top of liquids and solids, so if you try to burp you’ll vomit.   As a result of no burping, people are WAY more gassy in zero gravity.

br6js5	Centrifugal force is only an apparent force, but then again, gravity is more of an acceleration than a proper force, so it kind of adds up.   Another way of seeing it is through seeing gravity as a centripetal force, which every little fraction of a second will change the direction you're going just a little bit, making your trajectory become an orbit	1642870246.0	htreyp6	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htreyp6/

dj00u	For one, centrifugal force is a 'phantom' force - it's only our perception (i.e., when turning the corner in a car, what we feel as an outward 'force' is actually just our inertia trying to carry us in a straight line, opposed by the car pushing against us). The actual force is centripetal (pulling *toward* the rotational center). However, neither are applicable to an orbit as being distinct from gravity (which is acting as a centripetal force). Instead, an orbit is the object trying to move in a line, but also being pulled doen by gravity - it's constantly 'falling' toward the planet. If the object's inertia carries it away from the planet at exactly the same rate as it is falling, you get a circular orbit. This is why they say astronauts DO experience gravity, but they (and the space station) are in a perpetual state of freefall.	1642870591.0	htrfv73	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrfv73/
13t99v	So this question is same question as why are some medicines pills, and why are some injected, and why are some suppositories, why some are inhalers, etc.  With the exception of topical drugs (creams, patches) etc., drugs work by getting the active molecule in the bloodstream. The percentage of drug eventually found in the blood versus what was ingested through whichever means in known as the bioavailability of a drug.  Essentially, injecting a drug intravenously results in 100% bioavailability, with all the drug in your blood immediately. So why not inject all drugs, legal or not? Well, sometimes you want a slower, long-lasting absorption, like slow-release tylenol edible THC. Injected drugs also need to be very soluble in both whatever the dosing mixture is and blood, since you want to keep the injection volume low while not precipitating out the drug. Also people just don't like needles. But some drugs, like anitbody based drugs (like the covid one) won't survive in the acidic stomach and/or can't be absorbed through the cell membranes of the intestine, so IV is the only way. C'est la vie.  As for the smoking question - smoking, chemically speaking, is a very harsh way of getting a drug into a vapor form. The high heat of combustion isn't (ideally) burning the drug itself, but all the other stuff around it, and that heat vaporizes the drug molecule which is the inhaled and absorbed the the nose and lungs and such. So consider crack cocaine vs. freebase cocaine - cocaine is actually a salt form of crack. As a salt, compared to a neutral molecule, it's boiling point is much, much higher. So much higher in fact, that if you heat it up, it will just decompose instead of boiling. Therefore, cocaine is just snorted, while crack can be smoked and the vapor inhaled.   TL;DR: the properties of a molecule and the desired dosing profile affect how it can be administered.	1642870621.0	htrfy1b	t3_sa5bj1	t3_sa5bj1	/r/askscience/comments/sa5bj1/why_is_heroine_injected_more_commonly_than_other/htrfy1b/

moqxn	Orbits are defined by centripetal force. Gravity is the component pulling towards the main body, where the orbiting body is trying to escape perpendicularly (more accurately:tangential) to that force with its own velocity. The resultant path the orbiting body takes is a continuous arc “falling” toward the main body’s center of mass until/unless the orbiting body’s velocity is sufficient to create a full circle, which can continue to expand to an ellipse or escape trajectory if velocity is sufficient.   One more note: technically the orbiting body is equally pulling on the main body proportionally to the two’s masses. I simplified here assuming the orbiting body’s mass is negligible relative the main body.	1642870716.0	htrg70s	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrg70s/
gekpw	The orbiting object is still in free fall. But a non-inertial frame of reference fixed on the object is not just rotating with a constant frequency with respect to an inertial frame, there's also linear accelerations.  So the total fictitious force experienced in such a frame is not purely centrifugal. That makes the idea of considering the orbit from the rest frame of the orbiting object a little more complicated than just **F***_gravity_* = -**F***_centrifugal_*.	1642870861.0	htrgkj5	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrflnr	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrgkj5/

And that is not allowed. Therefore your Body would literally cease to function due to relativistic effects between parts of your body at near-light speed.  Like, for example, if you're facing the front of the ship, and your left hand is behind you, and your right hand is infront of you, an electrical impulse from your brain may arrive at your left hand in seconds, but the same impulse may take hours to arrive at your right hand since it has to travel with the direction of the ship, which is already near c.	1642871073.0	htrh434	t3_s4ve57	t1_hstpbhw	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htrh434/

gekpw	A box can't move at c, but let's take a box moving at c - (1 m/s), and have something inside the box move forward at 1 m/s in the rest frame of the box. From the point of view of an observer watching the box move by at c - (1 m/s), the object is not moving at [c - (1 m/s)] + (1 m/s) = c, because that's using non-relativistic velocity addition. If you use relativistic velocity addition, it'll actually be ~0.99999999666c.  But anyway, that's all irrelevant to the comment above, because moving at constant velocity with any speed is not harmful to your body, it's the acceleration that's relevant.  >Like, for example, if you're facing the front of the ship, and your left hand is behind you, and your right hand is infront of you, an electrical impulse from your brain may arrive at your left hand in seconds, but the same impulse may take hours to arrive at your right hand since it has to travel with the direction of the ship, which is already near c.  No, because in your rest frame, you're simply stationary. Your body parts are not moving at relativistic speeds relative to other parts of your body.	1642871662.0	htrimxw	t3_s4ve57	t1_htrh434	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htrimxw/
rjwag	Well, I think you would be able to reach, c, if you had infinite energy and time. The reason you can't go faster then c is because mass approaches infinity. But infinite energy means you are able to reach infinite mass, as accelerating infinite mass will require infinite energy. To keep going, you would need greater than infinite energy, or less than infinite mass. (Which is why the solution to basically all FTL travel equations is "have negative mass")  I think. Infinity is weird, and doesn't really make sense in the concept of real world physics as well understand it at least. As far as I know, the only infinities we observe in the real world are produced by Black Holes, and events like The Big Bang, which aren't well understood and don't really fit cleanly into the known laws of physics.	1642871696.0	htriq1l	t3_s4ve57	t1_hstwclr	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htriq1l/

One of the things he describes is that the raptor mom's sister meets up with her and the little raptors "understand" that this is pack (family) based on scent.

114i25	I work on RNA splicing so I think I can answer this. Introns contain a lot of regulatory elements essential for faithful splicing of coding genes. However, because of how large introns tend to be (average length is 800-1000bp), most SNPs are harmless because they fall in regions with no regulatory significance. In this paper, the author noticed that the primary hotspot SNP is C/T, with T being the risk allele. One possible explanation is that this is an activating mutation. The 5’ splice site is typically GT, so the T allele here could be activating a cryptic 5’SS. This typically leads to production of premature stop codons (PTC) or causes a frame shift. Either way, the gene becomes inactivated. Another explanation is that this activates am intronic splicing enhancer or silencer signals (ISE or ISS). This will also lead to gene expression disruption. To know for absolutely sure, the authors would have to zoom down to the nucleotide level to see where the SNP tend to occur. That’d give further clue regarding how it can loss of smell and taste.	1642872432.0	htrkmet	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htrkmet/

rjwag	But isn't c an absolute value? A photon outside of the box cannot move slower then a photon inside the box. This also applies to you.  Lets say the box is moving at c-1ms. And you have a photon in the box moving at c relative to the box. And is shot out the front of the box. Would it not be moving at 2c-1 relative to other photons once it leaves the box? Or would it suddenly stop moving at c relative to the box and move at 1m/s relative to the box once its outside the box. Or would the photon be limited to moving at 1m/s in that direction, even within the box. This would also apply to matter as well.  You could also apply this to another box in that box moving at c-1 being shot out of the front of the box at 2c-2 relative to a photon outside the box.	1642872722.0	htrldon	t3_s4ve57	t1_htrimxw	/r/askscience/comments/s4ve57/in_the_vacuum_of_space_is_there_a_maximum/htrldon/

hfdak0u0	Sorry for this, but I guess I'm too stupid to even understand the Wikipedia articles about reference frames properly.  I guess what I wanted to ask was if the combined instantaneous forces of gravity, centrifugal force and linear acceleration would still add up to an apparent weightlessness inside such an object, in every part of the orbit. Since you say "free fall" i assume that means yes?  (Maybe I'm just showing my stupidity again, but I don't really see how it could be any other way, as none of these forces would be such that they act on the satellite's outer but not its contents.)	1642872928.0	htrlwwc	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrgkj5	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrlwwc/

12dqku	Hi - studied splicing in detail before. Many ways a SNP in an intron could be deleterious but the two most big ones are:  a) It could affect ability to splice itself. For example, if it's in the branchpoint A, you can't form a splicing lariat. Or if it affects things called ISE (intronic splicing enhancers), you won't splice as effectively. Or it can create new 5'SS splice sites depending on the mutation  b) It could affect ability to be transcribed. Many gene regulatory elements are in the first intron so if its in an enhancer and the transcription factor can't bind or creates a de-novo repressor sequence, less RNA is created.  c) It could alter RNA stability. For example: it could cause early termination if it creates a new polyA site or recruits RNA degradation factors/exosomes/integrator to it.	1642873398.0	htrn456	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htrn456/
14bptt	It's would be better to say that the centrifugal force is the force of gravity. Centrifugal force isn't an actual force, it's a type of net force that results in circular motion. You still need to have an actual force acting perpendicular to the direction of travel to provide this centrifugal force. In a simple circular orbit, this force is provided by gravity. Objects in orbit absolutely experience acceleration as their velocity is constantly changing, not in magnitude but in direction. If there was truly a zero net force, then the object would travel in a straight line.	1642873434.0	htrn7gm	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrn7gm/

So take this with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that it's technically the 'almost current location', but the difference is arguably negligible in practice and for reasons that aren't super important when trying to understand the "basic" physics of orbiting bodies in the OP's scenario.  The effect also only really holds for constant velocity and acceleration of the two bodies - if there are higher-order changes in position, like jolt/jerk/snap, then I believe there will start to be differences between the 'predicted' and 'actual' locations as well. Although I don't know if there are caveats or conditions to that.	1642874569.0	htrq46j	t3_s8yph3	t1_htq4hkd	/r/askscience/comments/s8yph3/how_does_gravity_work_in_terms_of_which_direction/htrq46j/

There's an idea called [effective potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_potential) which makes this formal.  A rotating reference frame is not "natural" in the sense that it's non-inertial. In an inertial reference frame there is no centrifugal force. If there was some force which cancelled out the gravitational force, the net force would be zero, and the object would be static or move at constant velocity -- that's Newton's first law.  In the rotating reference frame, the fictive centrifugal force provides that cancelling force and so the orbiting body doesn't move (exactly as you'd expect since the reference frame is by definition corotating with it).	1642876106.0	htru2u7	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htru2u7/

Both of these are considered "fictitious forces" that only exist when observed in a non-inertial reference frame.

General relativity says that gravity is not actually a force, but is rather an effect of curved spacetime.	1642876178.0	htru9e6	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htru9e6/

Don’t recall which astronaut said it in an interview but the very first time you pee in space your body “sheds” significant amounts of calcium. So essentially with no prior “knowledge” of microgravity your body decides to pretty much turn you into a fish/bird as soon as you escape Earth’s immediate gravity. Your hips shed the most calcium, followed by your spine (as far as I remember). Your calluses will fall off (and even start growing on the upper part of your foot because you use your feet to change direction and “grab” rails).  Blood circulation is a mess with no gravity, sometimes going as far as starting to circulate the other way (or stagnating). Blood pools in your head and chest, causing congestion. Your sense of taste is almost gone, which is why hot sauce is as far as I’m aware the most popular condiment on the ISS (and odd, strong tasting food in general). Something similar happens to vision (presumably because of intracranial pressure?) with prolonged time in space - most astronauts report nearsightedness in the immediate months after return to Earth. There are many more things I forgot and likely even more stuff I never knew.	1642876940.0	htrw8ru	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htrw8ru/
hlyltbqi	99% similarity in primary sequence seems like a lot, but for genomes the size of those in chimpanzees and humans that still means tens of millions of differences. Since TADs correlate with specific DNA binding proteins that are targeted toward specific sequence motifs, that 1% difference in primary sequence could result in very large differences in the locations of these motifs which in turn would affect global TAD organization in the nucleus. So TAD maps may be loosely correlated with genome similarity especially at regions with greater than average sequence conservation between species. However, small differences in primary sequence likely result in much larger overall differences in structures as complex as TADs.	1642877064.0	htrwk56	t3_s9xpdb	t3_s9xpdb	/r/askscience/comments/s9xpdb/does_topologically_associating_domain/htrwk56/

169z5v	The energy stays the same in an ellipse or circle  Like a roller coaster exchanging speed for height  Around the orbit the gravitational potential (distance from the sun) is constantly being transferred for an increase or decrease in speed along the path of the orbit  An object does not feel this as a force, the object is in free fall  It's not centripetal acceleration because in an extremely elliptical orbit the direction of acceleration is sometimes almost entirely in line with the orbit path, and at others when close to sun almost perpendicular	1642877322.0	htrx81n	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrvbpn	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrx81n/

14bptt	>Centrifugal force is however a convenient simplification of the continuous change in direction.  This is not actually true because a continuous change in direction doesn't necessarily mean that you experience a centrifugal force. For example, you will experience a centrifugal force on a cyclotron at a fair because the centripetal force spinning the cyclotron isn't also affecting you so the centripetal force comes from the normal force of the outside edge pushing you inwards and we interpret this normal force as a centrifugal force since it feels like something is pushing us into the outer edge despite that not actually being the case. However the gravitational force keeping a space station in orbit equally effects the people inside and so there is no need for a normal force to keep the inhabitants moving in the same circular path as the space station and so they don't experience the same centrifugal force that the riders on the cyclotron do. But in both cases, there is a centripetal force that is maintaining the circular motion.  Also the centripetal force is only equal to the gravitational force because it's a net force and there is only one force acting on it so that one force must be equal to the net force. This isn't universally true though, if you spin an object on a rope in a vertical circle, you have two forces acting on it, tension from the rope and gravity. It's the sum of these two forces that will equal the centripetal force at any point, even these forces change depending on what part of the circle the object is at.	1642877484.0	htrxnb0	t3_sa4s88	t1_htrvbpn	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htrxnb0/

Let’s say the curvature of the Earth drops 9.81 meters vertically for every 9.81 meters you move horizontally. If you threw a rock horizontally at 9.81 m/s the rock would orbit this mini Earth (ignoring air resistance and stuff). The rock is traveling fast enough cover the drop in curvature with gravity (9.81 m/s^2) to never hit the ground.   Scaled up: Google says at 150 miles above Earth orbit velocity is about 27,000 kph.	1642877717.0	htry8xw	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htry8xw/

iutwx	Yep. It’s hard to conceptualize meaning, in general, for non human species. Concepts like parents, siblings etc are a way of describing a commonality among particulars. By describing Debbie as my sister, I am bringing her under a general discursive framework that abstracts away from any particular sister. Dogs (probably) aren’t using a discursive framework, so we run the risk of anthropomorphizing a dog’s behavior when we ascribe a thought process like “it recognizes that other dog as sister” or “here’s a dog I remember” to them.   “What is it like to be a bat” is the big paper that dives into this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F	1642878219.0	htrzj2p	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrxi4l	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htrzj2p/

r4hcf	Any social animal will have a greater sense of kinship than solitary ones. Canine packs' internal hierarchies are predicated upon kin relationship with the eldest breeding female being the head of the pack. Mothers and fathers who play an active role in rearing young will definitely have a sense of "these are my babies" and young reared together will have a sense of "these are my brothers and sisters".  That sense of kinship becomes more nebulous as generations widen. Normally, as pups grow up, they move on and start their own families. In households where a litter is kept together, this sense of kinship will probably continue beyond its natural longevity. But when a grown pup has pups of its own, the grandparent might delight in the novelty of being around puppies again, they probably do not have the same strong sense of kinship with the young.  Keep in mind, it's hard to say what is "natural" with domestic canines since by domesticating them and rearing them in an artificial environment, dogs are kind of reinventing their nature from scratch all the time. For all we know, there might be a grandmother dog who knows for a fact that a puppy is her grandpuppy based on her personal experience and ability to connect the dots.	1642879976.0	hts3z8q	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/hts3z8q/
e0bci	Bioavailability and degree of reinforcement. As a rule, injecting anything intravenously means rapid rise in blood levels and no loss of the drug in question (all IV drugs have 100% bioavailability by definition.) Something like half of the heroin used in smoking/inhaling is lost in the process compared to IV use. For severe users who are spending all their money on obtaining the drug, getting a more intense high with half the amount of drug becomes a compelling advantage. (There's a long list of massive disadvantages, but then by definition, if you were still able to stop because of negative consequences, you wouldn't have a substance use disorder.)  In general, drugs of abuse with very rapid onset of action are also going to be more addictive. The neuroscience of addiction isn't just about a rise in dopamine in certain brain structures, but intense and rapid bursts. Compare chewing coca leaves, which gives a low-dose trickle of cocaine and is part of the culture in parts of South America, to the sudden high of smoking pure cocaine. IV heroin is the perfect example of rapid-onset intoxication.  Other drugs are sometimes used intravenously, but the advantage isn't quite as strong over other routes. Methamphetamine still has rapid onset of action with smoking, and better nasal bioavailability. We do see a decent bit of IV methamphetamine use, though.  Cocaine is a particularly bad choice for IV injection, because it's a powerful vasoconstrictor with a short-lived high. If you shoot up in one arm, you're going to have a hard time doing it again for a while because the blood vessels have all shrunken down.	1642880031.0	hts446b	t3_sa5bj1	t3_sa5bj1	/r/askscience/comments/sa5bj1/why_is_heroine_injected_more_commonly_than_other/hts446b/

273bw7e	Don't think dogs have a concept of fatherhood.  They understand mom (of course) and sex.    When a female dog is in heat-- she roams around for a few days and acquires a menagerie of male dog suitors.  Eventually she will "stand", i.e. allow mounting and penetration.  Every male dog will attempt to get in on the action.    If/when he does, a part of his penis will swell up, such that it cannot exit the vagina.  It's stuck.  This can last like 30 minutes or an hour.  The two dogs will turn around and appear "butt to butt".     This is to attempt to prevent other males for mating her and inserting their sperm-- it's sperm competition.  He's giving his swimmers a head start.	1642880598.0	hts5ivw	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrooaa	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/hts5ivw/

Bone cells need mechanical stress as stimulus to deposit the calcium minerals in the area experiencing mechanical stress so that the bone can support the excess weight/forces.

78foeoy	> Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes  This is a question about blackbody radiation. Look up a blackbody graph to see what I'm talking about (I'm on mobile sorry)  Star emit light at all frequencies to varying degrees. Warmer stars emit more infrared, but we can't see infrared at all - it has nothing to do with any characteristics of the star. We can't see the infrared radiation of a cooler star either.  > Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red  In terms of visible light, yes that's exactly correct. Blackbody radiation is represented by a curve, and the peak of that curve determines the color of the star. If the peak is at lower (IR) frequency, most of the star's visible light is red. If the peak is at higher (UV) frequency, most of the star's visible light is blue. If the star's peak is somewhere in the visible range, the star appears white to us. Why not green? The peak is not extremely steep - it is shallow enough and the visible light spectrum is so narrow that there is *roughly* equal amounts of every color of visible light.	1642883091.0	htsbmei	t3_sa9uvg	t3_sa9uvg	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htsbmei/

t877m	Some mutations are like inserting/removing extra letters into a sentence that make it less readable or unreadable completely. *These can be mutations in exons*.  Other mutations are like changing whether a sentence gets read at all, or puts white-out over it so it can't be read even though it's still there. *These can be mutations in introns*.  Note that many mutations in both exons and introns don't have any deleterious effect, but when they do you can see the above happen.  Intronic and other non-coding mutations often affect the *regulation* of genes (when/how often are genes read and used). Perhaps the most famous non-coding mutation is in the promoter region of the TERT gene. TERT is active when we're developing but turns off when we're young. It helps extend the ends of our chromosomes and is tied to aging since, without it's activity, our chromosomes eventually wear out due to all the growing and cell replication we do in our lives. Mutations in the TERT promoter (non-coding) region essentially turn that back on and is associated with almost every cancer: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26941407/.	1642883720.0	htsd5zj	t3_sa2m2j	t3_sa2m2j	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htsd5zj/

sd07u	You're talking about the idea of [kin recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_recognition), which is very important in social and evolutionary biology.  Generally speaking, animals recognise each other via cues such as smell, visually, or by the fact they live in close proximity. Whether they actually "know" that an individual is a particular relative (brother vs uncle, for example) is unknown and quite possibly unknowable.  With dogs specifically, they use olfaction and experiential mechanisms i.e. who you live with. But if they are separated from siblings when young, they do not seem to recognise them when older (Hepper and Cleland, 1998). Interestingly, mother-offspring offspring still persists in such circumstances.  Finally, recognising grandparents would be unusual, since most animals do not have overlapping generations i.e. three generations living together, with   &#x200B;  Hepper, P. G., & Cleland, J. (1998). Developmental aspects of kin recognition.

duly6	What I know for certain is this, which I learned from Robert Sapolsky's Stanford lecture series: animals in general are extraordinarily good at judging their own relatedness to other members of the same species, at least under certain circumstances—to the extent that, in his words, it's literally as if they're doing calculations to determine their behavior.  And obviously, the animals aren't literally doing calculations, so there must be a variety of powerful intuitive mechanisms at play that enable that kind of sensitivity.

kyx8g	Yes, certainly. But the centrifugal force is actually a 'fictitious' force in that it is not a force at all but arises from an object's inertia.  IMO a better way is to think that the object in orbit is constantly falling toward its attractor/planet, but moving so fast that it overshoots the ground. The gravitational pull of the planet is constantly accelerating the body so as to pull it's direction of motion toward the ground, but the direction of the ground relative to the body is constantly changing.

i70mwwkr	Yup. The equivalent period for wolf cubs is a lot shorter. In that time they basically learn what not to be scared of (normal wolfy life stuff), and then when that period ends and they're old enough to start exploring further, they need to start being wary of new things as new things are likely to be dangerous. It's very much a survival thing.  With dog puppies, basically whatever they meet in their first 12-16 weeks, their brains are wired to assume it's safe. Then gradually over the next month or so, the puppies' brains start to treat new things with suspicion and wariness.	1642886087.0	htsiyk7	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrznhj	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htsiyk7/

5tvdt	The bladder has 'stretch' sensing nerves for when your bladder gets heavy/full enough while you are standing upright.  The reason why people often have to pee as soon as the get up from sleeping is because all the weight in your bladder will shift down as you get up and 'stretch' your bladder down.  In space there is no down so your bladder keeps filling and filling until it gets so full that it pushes your urethra closed and you can't pee. By the time you feel enough pressure to pee while in space you can't. At that point you would be forced to catheter yourself to relieve your bladder.  Medical intervention is required if you do not urinate regularly in space.	1642886171.0	htsj632	t3_sa535n	t1_htrys4g	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htsj632/

Some of these masks may have a charcoal filter layer, which would be the absorbent element. In this cases, seems reasonable to assume that they'll also saturate at some point.  As u/kester76a said, after a heavy use one can even smell the environmental gases around.

f6cr3	Normally, your bladder would push down on whatever is below your bladder, and the feeling of that force is what we would call "weightiness".  When in the water, the water is pushing up from below and supporting your body. The force your body feels between the water and the contents of your bladder is no longer the weight of your bladder, but the difference in pressure between the two (i.e. stretchiness and not weightiness)	1642886718.0	htskigz	t3_sa535n	t1_htsigli	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htskigz/
p6de8si	Stop thinking of centrifugal force as a real force! It’s a fictitious force and you have to be very careful about reference frames if you’re ever going to use the term.  First, let’s define velocity and acceleration. Velocity is a speed AND direction. Acceleration is the rate velocity is changing. You are accelerating if you’re changing the speed (gas pedal of a car) or the direction (steering wheel). Newton’s second law says F = ma, so if we know the forces we can calculate the acceleration (in 3 dimensions). Since acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, we can use this to calculate what the velocity will be a small time step in the future (integration to be more technical).  Now, picture someone holding a weight on the end of a string. They start to spin in circles and the weight moves in a circle with them. Ignore gravity for this thought experiment, it’s just a person and a weight rotating in a plane. You’re watching them spin, the weight is moving in an ‘orbit’ around them.  As you are watching this, you can measure the velocity (speed and direction of motion) at any time of the weight. If you measure a moment later, the speed is the same but the direction of motion has changed. The direction of motion is constantly changing because it is accelerating inwards (direction of motion is constantly changing, not speed) from the force the person is applying on the string (centripetal force). This checks out with F = ma, no need for centrifugal force.  Now picture that you place a camera on the wrist of the person holding the weight. The camera is focused on the weight, you can’t really see anything in the background. As the person is rotating, so is the camera and the weight. So there is no motion in this reference frame.   But the person is still applying force in the string being applied to the weight, and we know F = ma must be true, even in rotating reference frames. This appears to be the only force. So why doesn’t the weight come flying inward at the camera?   Because we are in a rotating reference frame (camera on the wrist), there appears to be a force that is acting exactly opposite of the centripetal force in the string. We call this centrifugal force. But it’s not a real force, it’s merely a byproduct of being in a rotating reference frame. Because of this, we call centrifugal force a ‘fictitious force.’   If you’re on a rotating reference frame, like earth, you have to account for it to predict the motion of objects you’re measuring. But that force is NOT what’s holding the object in orbit!  Imagine that you place yourself far away from the earth (a sun-earth Lagrange point would be a good spot to watch, like where JWST is headed). Now you watch a satellite in orbit around Earth. You see it traveling with a velocity (speed and direction), but as with the weight, it’s direction of travel is constantly being changed. It’s accelerating inwards towards Earth. Instead of the force in the string, the force is now gravity. F = ma still checks out, it is in fact constantly accelerating towards earth.   TLDR: no, centrifugal force is only a thing because of rotating reference frames. Objects can still be in orbit if you’re not on a rotating reference frame.	1642886772.0	htskn1b	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htskn1b/

t7kb9jh	If I understand your question correctly, you actually answered it in your question :>  At an energy level the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. The rotational flow is converted to an axial acceleration which is converted into pressure by the narrowing effect of the stator. That's if I understand your question.

p6de8si	No, this is wrong even for most circular orbits! They would only cancel out if you were rotating at the same rate as the orbiting body.   Since LEO orbits are ~90 minutes, if you sped up earths rotation so much that a day was only ~90 minutes you could say centrifugal force cancels out with gravity for LEO orbits. Days are clearly longer than 90 minutes, yet LEO satellites still orbit. So that’s clearly not all that’s happening.  The *only* time this is true is geostationary circular orbits. That’s just a very specific orbit that has a period of 24 hours. You can’t generally say that circular orbits are gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out from Earth.  I have a separate comment where I tried to dive deeper into explaining what centrifugal force is and how it works if you want to learn more.	1642888141.0	htso0ad	t3_sa4s88	t1_htr96sj	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htso0ad/

gekpw	>No, this is wrong even for most circular orbits!  No, it's correct for all circular orbits. In the (non-inertial) rest frame of the orbiting object, it's not accelerating at all. That means that the forces must exactly cancel, and the only two forces in the system are gravity and the centrifugal force.  >The only time this is true is geostationary circular orbits. That’s just a very specific orbit that has a period of 24 hours. You can’t generally say that circular orbits are gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out from Earth.  Absolutely wrong. You're mixing up the angular velocity of the orbit and the angular velocity of the rotation of the body that's being orbited. There's no requirement that a general circular orbit have a period synchronous with the rotation of the body being orbitted.  >I have a separate comment where I tried to dive deeper into explaining what centrifugal force is and how it works if you want to learn more.

ceijrrd	Yes. Smell. Many species, including other apes, can too.  My pet theory is it has to do with the veromonasal organ, which does exist in humans, but has been disconnected from the nervous system. Humans are so oversexed and promiscuous that if human fathers could tell they were cuckolded they would murder even more women than they already do, to say nothing of murdering children. Gorillas for instance are facing extinction and still the alpha males murder children unrelated to them. The human ape not doing that has really helped us overpopulate and become an invasive species.  For an example of how horny humans are, consider the discovery of the heritability of blood types. A study was done using blood from mothers, fathers, and neonates in hospital. It found at least 30% of the neonates could not be the biological children of the men listed as their fathers on their birth certificate. This was in the US in the 1950's, when women were far more modest than today, and the price for immodesty was far higher.  Note this figure is "at least" 30%. It could not attest to the infidelity of women who cheated with men who had the same blood type as their husbands. Being there's only 8 common blood types, that means approximately 42.5% of the babies born in the 1950's US weren't the biological children of their legal fathers.  Imagine if you will a human species where femicide was 42.5% higher, comparable with the other apes, and the birthrate was 42.5% lower, again comparable with our closest relatives. That would be a miserable species to be born into. You can see why there would be evolutionary pressure to lose the ability to determine by smell which child is yours.	1642888402.0	htsonl5	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htsonl5/

But you should add that our rotating reference frame (Earth) is not corotating with *most* orbits (because our day is a different length than the orbital period)  Geostationary orbit is the only orbit we corotate with, so the only one you can say centrifugal force and gravity cancel out from earths reference frame.	1642888502.0	htsow9e	t3_sa4s88	t1_htru2u7	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htsow9e/

j5n7t	This is an interesting question: one I have spent close to a lifetime pondering.  I am a retired compressor research engineer.  This is a corollary question to the age old “why do pumps pump?”.   That is, why doesn’t the fluid stop and reverse course and go back out the front of the pump?   The aerodynamics of compressors are uber complicated and it is easier to outline the challenges/difficulties rather than the mechanism of compression.  That is, your question is well put.    The goal, of course, is (usually) to gain static (thermodynamic) pressure (in both blade rows).  Basically a ram/inertia effect comes into play (especially) in the first rotor (of course, it continues to play a roll in every blade row). To try to simplify things I focus on the key flow physics:   So the rotors impart KE to the fluid while also (and in concert with) diffusing the flow (to gain static pressure Ps).  The stator diffuses the flow (in a prescribed manner) in order to convert the KE into Ps.  It is a balancing act in order to gain Ps while also maintaining uniform flow that is fit to flow into the following rotor.  Flow separation in the stator decreases the flow area and so defeats the diffusion process, that is the flow speed increases (with reduced area) rather than decreases in that case.  I’ve uber simplified in order to describe the basic flow mechanics.	1642889006.0	htsq4eg	t3_saa1mb	t3_saa1mb	/r/askscience/comments/saa1mb/how_does_an_axial_compressor_create_more_pressure/htsq4eg/

t7kb9jh	This is a logical fallacy. An imperfect study is not a flawed study, as it is nearly impossible to create a perfect study outside of controlled laboratory conditions.  The study comes to a most likely conclusion, given that there is currently no evidence of a increase in cognitive issues amongst the vaccinated, over the population in general before the pandemic.   The study does show an increased chance of cognitive issues for people that have had severe infection. Many other studies have shown a significant reduction in severe disease amongst the vaccinated.

11nzr2	Not a biologist, but I don't see any answers so I might as well see if I can invoke Cunningham's Law.  When you're talking species conservation, you're talking about trying to maintain biodiversity.  Mixing the breeds together would end up losing that diversity to a single mix.  So you're basically losing what you were trying to conserve.  The loss is through homogenization rather than straight up loss, but the diversity is still technically loss.  The scenario you're talking about, the gene mixing, would be something you would try as a last resort.  It would only be attempted if you were expecting to lose all populations, period.  And the mixing of genes would be the only thing that would allow you to save at least some of the population from extinction.  Kind of a "less than what I want is better than nothing" type of setup.	1642889767.0	htss1aw	t3_saa5nh	t3_saa5nh	/r/askscience/comments/saa5nh/why_is_it_important_to_conserve_independent/htss1aw/

13cc10	The most known and common problem with prolonged exposure to microgravity is atrophy and loss of bone density, that's why astronauts need to do a lot of exercise before going to space so that when they return they won't be too weak to stand up.

8ks7k76c	A LOT of feeling bad when you have any infection, esp a mild one, is from your immune system going ape to combat it. The longer you’re exposed, the longer your immune system will be actively causing fevers, etc to combat it. With that in mind, you’re doing yourself some level of disservice by staying in a known infected environment. It is DEFINITELY more complicated than that, but I BELIEVE that’s a fair statement.	1642891680.0	htswsni	t3_sacd7q	t3_sacd7q	/r/askscience/comments/sacd7q/after_the_human_immune_system_is_already/htswsni/
iwyha	Just a random response...There are species such as bears in which the males often kill cubs, sometimes to force females into ovulating so that they can breed. It would seem counter-productive to kill one's own offspring, and counter to theories like sociobiology. But it is possible that some animals can recognize kin and others cannot...and also interesting that in some species, females can recognize offspring while males cannot-presumably because of closer bonds. Once you get to the grandparent generation it would seem difficult unless they were together all of their lives.	1642891774.0	htsx16b	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htrooaa	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htsx16b/

e24ka	Kin relatedness calculations can actually get surprisingly tricky very fast! Just take a look at a detailed family tree and mentally calculate percentage of shared DNA across multiple relations, and keep in mind that some animals have many more generations simultaneously active in the genetic market, increasing their scope of calculation. Lots of tricky cases, especially when you remember to remove some of our human rules and norms from the picture.

s760g	If you're in a submarine (surrounded by and immersed in water), gravity doesn't cease to exist. The submarine still experiences the buoyancy forces of being submerged in water, but anything inside it is not affected by buoyancy and still feels gravity like normal.  Unless the water pressure is enough that it presses into the body and somehow presses against the bladder (through whatever tissue is between the skin and the bladder) and somehow supports it, I don't think this would have an effect on the bladder feeling gravity.	1642892715.0	htszbpp	t3_sa535n	t1_htskigz	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htszbpp/

But it doesn't matter what is supporting your body; there is still a force from gravity pushing the contents of your bladder down and a counter force from your body holding it up. It is this point between bladder contents and your body cavity where the forces interact that cause the bladder to stretch down; it doesn't matter how those forces are transmitted to there.	1642893005.0	htt00s4	t3_sa535n	t1_htskigz	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htt00s4/

ieudp	Shout-out to Osteoblasts, one of the coolest cells in the body, that require gravitational force to make bone. In essence, this is why walking on a treadmill or even centripetal acceleration induced "gravity" like in 2001: A Space Odyssey is helpful to prevent bone loss.  ScienceDirect link for more info: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/osteoblast](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/osteoblast)  Nice article: [https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2012.0286](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2012.0286) (doesn't appear to have a paywall on my view....)  Osteoblasts are the cells that grow new bone, and they hang out on little "beams" of bone called spicules. The coolest part? They have proteins that attach to the spicule of bone, and sense when the spicule stretches and strains when a load is applied.  These little proteins cross the cell membrane, so that when the spicule of bone stretches and compresses outside of the cell, that change is "sensed" within the cell and the cell reads this as a signal to make more bone.  Simply put, osteoblasts have a naturally-occurring strain-gauge that "reads" when a bone is loaded by gravity, stimulating the creation of new bone. Pretty wild.  &#x200B;  Strain gauge: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain\_gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_gauge)  Bone Structure: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone)	1642893255.0	htt0mgk	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htt0mgk/

157xv3	Someone else might be able to answer a little better than me, but one thing that seems to be very important in gene transcription is chromatin looping. DNA doesn't exist as a simple strand in the nucleus, and the way it's packaged around histones, how tightly the DNA is wrapped around histones, and even the physical location of the gene in 3D space in the nucleus can all impact gene expression (look up LMNA mutations in progeria).  At a more local level, DNA looping, at least at the promoter region of a gene, is required for efficient transcription of most protein-coding genes (maybe lncRNA genes, but I'm really not sure because I haven't read up on these as much). Regions important for looping for transcription can be upstream of the promotor or downstream, and these regions could be close by or thousands of base pairs away.  Some computer predictions here could point to whether this region could be important for that or not, but it'd have to be confirmed by wet lab work. I've tried those experiments, too. They suck for me. I fail at them. A lot. So, I researched other stuff lol.	1642895030.0	htt4wnl	t3_sa2m2j	t1_htt1wyy	/r/askscience/comments/sa2m2j/how_can_a_mutation_in_an_intron_affect_the_gene/htt4wnl/
fz0wo	Parasitic worms have been shown to boost fertility, ease allergies and ward off infection. They’re still parasites but there exists a symbiotic relationship that some scientists feel have helped humans for millennia	1642895165.0	htt5870	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt5870/
tejio	I think as soon as it becomes beneficial, it becomes a symbiotic lifeform instead of a parasite. But any kind of labelling these things will always have huge grey areas. So I cannot see how it could not be both at the same time, like the situation you describe.  But symbiotic lifeforms are EVERYWHERE in nature. The mitochondria is believed to have been a completely different organism that somehow only got half eaten, and started making our cells their home instead. Our gut bacteria is another example of something we probably ate at some time, but stuck around. Our DNA is also riddled with fragments from viruses.	1642895175.0	htt593q	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt593q/

q6wni	You can be a little loose in your definition. Some parasites are far more detrimental than others. Also, many organisms evolve resistance to parasites. However, having resistance to an affliction has some sort of drawback (shortened lifespan, reduced fertility, etc). It sounds like you’re on the right track if you want to be biologically accurate.  If you want to give some sort of realistic natural history in your novel research Wolbachia, co-evolution of mutalism, or parasite-mutualist continuum.	1642895770.0	htt6rx6	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt6rx6/
iie54	Your point about separation at birth made me think about how it would work in humans as well. If I was separated at birth from my family would I inherently be able to tell they were my family if I saw them say 20 years later? I don’t think I would, so is this just a dog thing or is it just a life thing? Can ANY species actually recognize their family like that?	1642895877.0	htt71fi	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htseawr	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htt71fi/

ob2rk	I’m still really amazed that nearly none of our space station projects involve artificial gravity by means of rotation. The ideas have been around for 100 years now—even before we went to space and the closest we’ve gotten is depictions in sci-fi like The Martian, Halo, Elysium, Interstellar, 2001, Passengers, and (the iconic Disney Channel Original) Zenon.  I know it’s not exactly and easy task, especially with how large even a smaller station would have to be, but we constructed the ISS and that is just enormous. If we do go back to the moon this decade (which is seeming more and more unlikely lately), I really hope they redesign the lunar orbit station to have some artificial, rotational “gravity”.	1642895934.0	htt76gh	t3_sa535n	t1_htsse18	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htt76gh/

fo4qm	I think it was a very round-about way of saying that the dogs wouldn't know which one even was the father (and thus eventually grandpa) since she has mulitple male dogs mating with her prior to getting pregnant.

12oa4v	You could maybe create a parasite like a very aggressive tapeworm, that eats not only the food but also it's host from the inside out.  Hence why humans die before they even get malnourished.   But maybe some hosts have a dna-mutation, where they are uneatable or otherwise protected from said parasite (like some humans are immune to hiv/aids).  Hence why they don't die, but do get malnourished because of the parasite rating the food.  Side effect from this mutation is being prone to addiction. Or, said parasite gives off some chemical that induces this vulnerability. But here the malnourishement and addiction only come into effect because the host lives longer.	1642896293.0	htt81ls	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htt81ls/

6ru7m	I think that would be a very difficult question to answer. Certainly we can observe that a dog may be more interactive with familiar dogs than with unfamiliar ones. But how would you test whether a dog recognizes kinship, or whether that concept even means anything to a dog?    I think you'd need to design an experiment in which large numbers of dogs were exposed to:  \- Dogs with whom they are not familiar but to whom they are related  \- Dogs with whom they are familiar and to whom they are related  \- Dogs with whom they are familiar but to whom they are not related  \- Dogs with whom they are not familiar and to whom they are not related.  You would have to carefully observe the behaviors in each of these interactions, define specific aspects of behavior that can be consistently identified and quantified by multiple human observers, and then perform a statistical analysis to see if there are significant differences in how dogs behave in each situation. Such a study would be very difficult to get right.  This is just off the top of my head. If anyone has other ideas on how to test this I'd be interested in hearing them.	1642897689.0	httbg54	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httbg54/
4bzsf	Yeah, that's basically the route I'm going. The vast majority of the afflicted die because the parasite eats them from inside out. A very small percentage of humans are just naturally resistant, and some of these survivors are also capable of taking advantage of the parasite, but it's not as if the parasite isn't still trying to kill them, they're just lucky that they're slightly different than other people and they can fight off the consumption better.

4e73n	Quite low.  Only 17% of patients having a cardiac arrest IN HOSPITAL survive to discharge.  The % surviving with no functional deficits is even lower...  Out of hospital arrest is something like 10-12% to hospital discharge.  % are little higher for younger patients and abysmal for older patients.  My numbers are a little old and might be better now. It has been a while I have not checked the numbers, but the AHA (american heart association) publishes a lot on the subject if you are curious. Nonetheless, % of survival AND no deficits after cardiac arrest remains quite low.  Sadly, for the majority of cases, expected outcome after cardiac arrest, even in optimal conditions, is death or becoming functionally diminished in some way.	1642897058.0	htt9wa8	t3_s87303	t3_s87303	/r/askscience/comments/s87303/what_percentage_of_patients_who_survive_due_to/htt9wa8/

ar1ws1wp	On a somewhat simplified level, many of the symptoms attributed to covid infection is actually due to the immune system reacting to the virus. Fever, chills, inflammation, cough, etc are all due to the immune response, not necessarily the virus itself. Because of that, I think it would be reasonable to assume a person continually exposed to the virus might continue to have symptoms throughout the exposure even if they do not continue to have a high viral load on testing. Continual exposure could prevent the immune response from winding down, but that being said, it should still effectively fight off the virus just like someone who had an exposure and is then immune for a period of time.	1642900002.0	httgyvw	t3_sacd7q	t3_sacd7q	/r/askscience/comments/sacd7q/after_the_human_immune_system_is_already/httgyvw/

Then, Einstein showed that space-time is curved.  This means the moon is following a straight line path through a warped space-time.

And also, the post states that such an experiment was done and that the dog siblings didn't seem to recognize each other.  Either way, the thing that's impossible to tell is if dogs understand family relations.

91287k5f	I watched a video about this a while ago, and it made the point that while it would be possible to design a space station to spin for rotational gravity, one of the main things we actually use space stations for at this stage of our development is to do experiments in zero gravity. That's the primary function of many / most of the ISS modules. So imposing artifical gravity would just make a space station less funtionally useful, at the present time.	1642902138.0	httlwou	t3_sa535n	t1_htt76gh	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/httlwou/
62mtr	I think the bigger issue is the logistics of it all.  For one there is having to dock with something that is rotating. Basically you need part of the station to not rotate but then how do you get between the two? Another is that rotation produces acceleration with a gradient and coreolis forces which is not ideal unless the thing is very large.   None of that is impossible but just more complex than it is worth for any current stations.	1642902283.0	httm9gb	t3_sa535n	t1_httcgjm	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/httm9gb/

27g3rg69	There are a potential variety of reasons, especially when talking groups as diverse as Siberian vs Sumatran tigers. However, an important consideration with distant subspecies is the less well known [outbreeding depression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreeding_depression).  Folks generally know the negatives of inbreeding, but it comes down to reduced fitness on offspring. The same can happen with very unrelated groups that can biologically breed, but their intermediate (the offspring) is less successful than either “extreme” (the original subspecies). Think of it as if you have related subspecies that are pretty close, but have specific traits to fit different niches. Let’s go with bird beaks as a nice visual example.  Say you have two close subspecies of birds, but they’ve adapted to catching bugs and eating seeds respectively. Bug-eater has a more pointer, narrowed beak. Seed-eater adapted a stronger, hooked beak to break the shells. Crossing them gets you an intermediate beak design that’s narrow, a little hooked, and reasonably strong. Unfortunately, this is a kinda crappy design for either food source. Like using a wonky spear for getting bugs, and less capable at breaking open seed shells. Suddenly, crossing subspecies has resulted in adding numbers that are WORSE at surviving in either location. An extreme example, but hopefully the point makes sense.  For this reason, crossing subspecies populations from different places has to be considered very carefully, in case mixing populations could exacerbate the problems even further.	1642904254.0	httqtp6	t3_saa5nh	t3_saa5nh	/r/askscience/comments/saa5nh/why_is_it_important_to_conserve_independent/httqtp6/

8t0pzwe	Depends on how high this continuous amount of virus is. Generally, the exposure amount you see in daily life is very small compared to the viral load in the body after the infection takes hold. Continual exposure to such levels of virus wouldn’t change much - once the immune system is activated and doing a good enough job that it can clear the viral in your body, it can easily deal with typical low-level exposure. You wouldn’t even see a big increase in symptoms, if at all.  But if you’re pumping in huge swathes of virus, filling the air with more virus than ever before seen, then you can overwhelm the immune system and kill the person, or keep them constantly infected/reinfected. The amount required for this would be pretty much impossible to see in normal environments.	1642905531.0	htttsla	t3_sacd7q	t3_sacd7q	/r/askscience/comments/sacd7q/after_the_human_immune_system_is_already/htttsla/
zfhag	Is it unknowable though?  Gorillas have been taught pretty intense sign language.   A trainer once told a gorilla that his kitten died and the gorilla knew what that meant.  He/she straight up mourned and grieved; wailed all night.  A trainer could simply ask their gorilla, "Hey which gorilla is your Mom.  Okay.  Is she the Mom of anyone else?"  Idk.  Or just straight up as, "Which one is your sister?"  *"With dogs specifically, they use olfaction and experiential mechanisms i.e. who you live with. But if they are separated from siblings when young, they do not seem to recognise them when older (Hepper and Cleland, 1998)."*    This imagine this would be the same for humans.  If two siblings aged 1-6 years old are separated, they won't recognize each other as adults.	1642905633.0	httu19d	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htseawr	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httu19d/
gekpw	A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that when the maximal Coriolis force on a Boeing 747 is on the order of [10 kiloNewtons](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*%28600+mph%29*%282*pi%2Fday%29*%28333400+kg%29). That's less than [1% of its weight](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*%28600+mph%29*%282*pi%2Fday%29%2F%289.8+m%2Fs%5E2%29), and on the order of [1% of its total thrust](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*%28600+mph%29*%282*pi%2Fday%29*%28333400+kg%29%2F%281000+kN%29).  So it's a very small effect, and easy to correct for if necessary.  >If the earth is in the rotating frame and an airplane is experiencing Coriolis effect doesn't that mean the plane is in the inertial reference frame as depicted in thisanimation  The plane isn't "in" one frame or the other. A reference frame is just a choice of coordinates in which to describe your system. You can study the motion of the plane in whatever frame you want. However since your take-off and landing are both happening at points fixed to the surface of the Earth, a frame fixed with respect to the surface of the Earth is a very convenient one. Unfortunately, since the Earth is rotating, that frame is non-inertial. And so in this frame there is generally a Coriolis force acting on the plane, and it needs to be taken into account to get the motion right. But as shown above, it's a small effect compared to the other forces in the system.	1642905963.0	httus7y	t3_sadtha	t3_sadtha	/r/askscience/comments/sadtha/how_does_coriolis_effect_change_the_trajectory_of/httus7y/
dq21w	Just an aside, but even if a dog truly did grasp the concept of kinship, that doesn’t mean it’s behaviour would change at all. A male dog will recognise his mother by scent but still try to mate with her. He no doubt remembers the role she played in his life, but the idea that he shouldn’t mate with her isn’t hardwired into his head, and I think that that is one of the key factors in how humans interact with their relatives.   Whether it be evolutionary or socially learned, we are (mostly) repulsed by the idea of mating with our close relatives. That completely changes the social dynamic between, say, two siblings. But if that repulsion wasn’t there, a sister would be a potential mate for a brother, and would be treated much like any other female. As dogs lack that repulsion to any significant degree, kinship is irrelevant.  Basically, it is our aversion to mating with relatives that defines kinship in humans.	1642906390.0	httvr0t	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/httvr0t/

clz9x6pv	All depends on the pathogen. Each pathogen has special characteristics that allow it to infect certain cells in particular areas of the body. For example, EBV requires a receptor called CD21 to get into the cell and this receptor is only on B cells so it can only infect those cells. As for the treatments (antibiotics, antivirals for example) these are designed to harm things crucial to the pathogen but not (side effects not included) to the human. So the medicines may be circulating throughout the body but only impact where there is pathogen. Hope this helps.	1642907971.0	httz9ej	t3_saanu9	t3_saanu9	/r/askscience/comments/saanu9/how_do_pathogen_reach_to_their_target_site_after/httz9ej/

ob2rk	Lots of things. LEO stations experience quite a lot of atmospheric friction still (there’s a reason they need boosters to keep from deorbiting among other things). And like the other commenter said: equipment moving around or attaching/detaching/moving also cause energy loses that can be considered “friction”, and there’s also energy loses due to angular momentum changing. Not even to mention the energy changes that general relatively cause. None of these are “huge” energy losses by any means, but they are still things that definitely need to be accounted for unless you want a space station to deorbit uncontrollably within a few months/years or its creation.	1642908803.0	htu13r1	t3_sa535n	t1_httyyhj	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu13r1/

dq21w	I’d imagine, given wolves’ life cycles, that there isn’t a particularly strong evolved avoidance of incest.   Wolves live in family groups of a father, mother, and juveniles. Offspring leave the pack around when they reach sexual maturity, meaning that there isn’t a huge amount of opportunity for incest to occur. They’ve already separated by the time they would be able to breed. Thus, they don’t need to have safeguards in place to stop incest.	1642909039.0	htu1mig	t3_sa5r2f	t1_httwiik	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htu1mig/

ob2rk	I guess that’s true too. We technically could build a 30m diameter station, but the astronauts would hate it and it might be worse than a smaller zero-g station. I wonder what the minimum size/diameter would be to make it not so horrible to change “altitude” within the station. I’m sure there’s been some studies on this, but I’m still willing to bet it’s within the bounds of size that we’re able to build (ie it probably doesn’t have to be a kilometer wide thing. Maybe a couple hundred meters at most).	1642909168.0	htu1wh0	t3_sa535n	t1_httyi8r	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu1wh0/

dq21w	Not animals as a whole. It’s very rare that you can claim a behaviour is shared by all animals. Human incest aversion might go deeper than culture, that doesn’t mean that other animals share the same aversions.   Smell being a factor in human incest aversion is only a hypothesis, anyway, and studies into it have concluded that no innate aversion to the smell of people you have been raised with is strong enough to prevent mating alone. There needs to be social pressure as well to stop it.	1642909452.0	htu2l08	t3_sa5r2f	t1_httzqot	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htu2l08/

376pwyla	Torsional movement like that is only related to gravity in that it is reliant on the inner ear’s information regarding head position, so it can be affected only so much as the inner ear’s information can be affected.

ob2rk	I think the ability to have longer-term LEO astronauts probably outweighs having to send them up and down as frequently as we do. So far the longest continuous time in space is 1.65yrs (a record set in 1995), and even that was unsafe. Compare that to Scott Kelly who set the American record of less than a year (340 days). Honestly I think keeping him up there that long specifically because he had an identical twin and to do some biological tests was at least a bit little unethical.  The research “energy” used to create such a system also wouldn’t really be all that much. The Saturn V and Space Shuttle were more intensive to create than any rotating space station could be. The most energy-intensive process of such a process would probably be the literally rocket energy required to launch and attach all the pieces together, not the engineering aspects themselves.	1642911320.0	htu71ho	t3_sa535n	t1_htu5jtm	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htu71ho/

You can discount it all you want, but the facts are clear and there’s clear evidence that zero-g environments are bad for people and that we have the tech to have better circumstances for humans in space.

ob2rk	Lol ok sure bb. Whatever you say. And the ideas have been around for over a century now. They’re not exactly that difficult to impliment. They would require a bit more energy to keep at continual spin with very little additional engineering. Like I’ve said: the biggest thing is additional rocket energy to ge them up there. Other than that, nothing much else. Why don’t you go ahead and give me your reasoning for why they aren’t good and their horribly impossible drawbacks since you probably read the word “aerospace” on Wikipedia one time several years ago?	1642914147.0	htud2sx	t3_sa535n	t1_htucq1v	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htud2sx/
hk43ytk0	Their smell receptors are far beyond our comprehension. I’m sure they can smell relation but probably aren’t thinking, “….grandpa?!”  For reference when our malamute passed we had a vet come over to our house to euthanize so he was comfortable at home. He passed on his favorite blanket. Our cat who was a kitten when he was an old man & grew up with him was downstairs for the whole day bc there was a stranger in the house. When she finally came upstairs, we let her smell the blanket and she looked up at us then immediately laid down on the blanket. It was very obvious to us that she knew that he had passed.	1642914193.0	htud5xn	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htud5xn/
ob2rk	You don’t have to have it rotating at first. Something more stationary like the ISS could exist beforehand while construction is ongoing. That isn’t the logistical problem like you and u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt seem to think. The biggest problems would still be the sheer weight and volume of parts need to put up there before it could be fully functional, including solar energy that would be needed for the whole thing.  We’ve seen how long it took to create the ongoing ISS project, so I believe that would be the biggest logistical part (not the spinning itself). But with enough international cooperation, or even just investment from the individual US NASA, EU ESA, Japanese JAXA, Russian Roscosmos, or Chinese CNSA, a space station like this could easily be constructed within a decade.  The technology exists and wouldn’t be that hard. We’ve done more difficult projects during the early days of space travel, and even with modern advancements (eg SpaceX’s landing launch vehicles). It’s really just a matter of investment into making it happen.	1642914736.0	htue8w9	t3_sa535n	t1_httm9gb	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htue8w9/
qx12b	So how do you get it spinning? How do you keep it spinning? How do you correct for the energy and motion it imparts on the craft as a whole? How often? Where and how does it attach for maximum efficiency and minimum wear? How do you maintain the mechanical parts involved? Turning it off? Gotta expend the energy to get it up to speed again. How do you enter and exit from the stationary portion of the craft? What happens in case of structural damage or integrity loss? What's the procedure for mechanical failure that stops the section from spinning? How much friction is imparted by the pieces that connect it to the stationary portion of the craft? If there's not a stationary portion how do you keep the craft in orbit?   For someone who supposedly has an easy solution you're not offering any. Burden of proof is on the one who makes the argument. You say it's easy yet give no actual solutions and instead deflect. And then you have the AUDACITY to say the hardest part about making and maintaining a spinning space craft is getting it into space? That's literally JUST one step and by and large the one we have figured out.   So give your designs that I'm sure you developed through your time engineering at NASA and put this all to rest.   Go on, it's easy after all.  Or are you just going to deflect again? Because that's the only answer you've actually given.	1642914820.0	htueff2	t3_sa535n	t1_htud2sx	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htueff2/

675cyubt	> Basically you need part of the station to not rotate but then how do you get between the two?  Simple.  Think about a lint brush.  The handle is an interface area. One end, the area furthest from the sticky part, is completely stationary - this is the docking area. The other end of the handle, connected to the space station, is rotating.  The rotating part has a platform that comes around once per rotation. From the stationary part, you can step out into the area and just wait for the platform to arrive. Or, you could push a cart into the space and wait for the platform to come around to meet it.  All of this is possible because the platform isn't moving very fast at all. You have plenty of time to step into the area, and you engage with the platform with a gentle *thump*. The gravity simulation of the rotating platform is very mild.  Once you're on the rotating platform, you are rotating with the entire rest of the station. You can then pass through an airlock and ascend, radially, into the body of the station that surrounds the tube - basically the sticky-tape part of the lint brush. The entire space station is a thick tube that surrounds the lint brush. And as you ascend into the space station, your radial velocity increases linearly, as does the gravity effect. By the time you reach the space station proper on the outer ring, the radial velocity approximates Earth.  The downside is: no windows. Looking out radially, you'd see space continuously circling past you while you feel stationary. Looking out laterally (parallel to the lint brush), you'd see space constantly spinning. Either way, vertigo is rough.	1642914881.0	htuek9t	t3_sa535n	t1_httm9gb	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htuek9t/

gekpw	The forces involved are weight (W), buoyancy (B), and drag (D).  Applying Newton’s second law, we find that W + D = B, or D = B - W.  The buoyant force is ρ*_f_*gV, where ρ*_f_* is the density of the fluid. The weight is ρgV, where ρ is the density of the object. And the drag is some function of the velocity; we can assume linear drag for low Reynolds number flows, so D = bv.  So the terminal velocity is calculated at steady state, when these forces are all balanced, and the result is v*_t_* = (ρ*_f_* - ρ)gV/b.  So it increases with the density difference, and decreases with the linear drag coefficient of the object.	1642925241.0	htuvapv	t3_samslf	t3_samslf	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htuvapv/

rjlscj	It would be better to say males sooner than females generally speaking all other things being equal. If everything else is equal women can deal with high Gs and lower gravity slightly better than men. It’s something about their body shape and blood in the legs pooling and not getting to the brain. It’s a complicated thing that many militaries have studied and there are ways to mitigate the differences but the rule of thumb is women can handle more Gs before experiencing negative effects than men.	1642929127.0	htv0duu	t3_sa535n	t1_htrtazi	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htv0duu/
popg1	I clearly remember the first time I really noticed a dog calculating. She was in the other side of a wire fence that had square holes in it. She wanted back in but instead of jumping over or going back to the gate,  she just stopped, looked at the hole for a few seconds, then perfectly jumped through it. I'm positive she was deciding if she would fit and getting the jump just right.  Then her great grandson just tried to jump on my bed today, hit it with his chest and bounced into a wall. So clearly not all dogs do that much thinking.	1642929197.0	htv0h35	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htss93i	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htv0h35/

The question is: How does the reduction in flow area not sabotage the diffusors (rotor blades and vanes)? There can either a diffusion OR a constriction, but seeing schematics, it's always a constant flow area reduction if you look at the whole compressor and a diffusion on the blade- or vane level. It fells like I almost got it.	1642929950.0	htv1fcw	t3_saa1mb	t1_htsq4eg	/r/askscience/comments/saa1mb/how_does_an_axial_compressor_create_more_pressure/htv1fcw/

sd07u	Yes, I quite agree. Several evolutionary theorists argue that "kin recognition" is a misnomer, because animals (and plants) presumably recognise familiarity, or a nice smell, or an unsexy smell, but not the actual kin relationship.	1642931342.0	htv36ln	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htuauc2	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htv36ln/

1livu8w1	No, because "centrifugal force" isn't even a factor here. Actually, gravity and inertia canceling each other out are, in a sense, producing a "centrifugal force", but that's not the point.  The easiest way to think about it is this: gravity is pulling on you exactly as hard as you are trying to fly away. Normally, you'd fly off in a straight line, but the gravity of Earth (or another large body) is trying to yank you back down. If your inertia and the gravity are essentially in equilibrium, you don't get closer to the Earth, but you also don't get further away.  If you are moving at a right angle to the Earth, you enter a circular orbit. Elliptical orbits work by the same principle but are a bit more complicated, involving acceleration and deceleration.	1642933313.0	htv5ph9	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htv5ph9/

16x40v	well, we were taught in the first year of med, that fluoride and hydroxide ions have to be in balance in an apatite crystal for the tooth to be functional. The actual crystal that the tooth is formed from isn't a pure hydroxyapatite, it's a mix of fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite. Hydroxyapatite isn't very hard, it's somewhat softer, but it's not brittle, on the other hand fluorapatite is very hard but also very brittle, so the mix of them could be compared to steel - best qualities of both. So which one you need depends on what your body gets exposed to more - if you live in an area where water has a lot of fluoride salts in it - extra fluoride isn't gonna do you any good, you need hydroxyapatite; if however you live in an area where water has very little fluoride in it, you're gonna need some fluoride in your dental products to keep the balance.  But i learnt this quite a long time ago, so i'd recommend reading something from a better source than me 😅	1642940342.0	htveylh	t3_sa9e7b	t3_sa9e7b	/r/askscience/comments/sa9e7b/does_hydroxyapatite_toothpaste_offer_any_sort_of/htveylh/

16x40v	well to be very specific, it's because it doesn't just trigger the cone and rod cells, but also a whole different subset of light sensitive cells in the eyes called the i trinsically photosensitive retinal ganglionic cells. They have a different pigment than other cells, that is called melanopsin, and it mainly reacts to blue light. From there imthe information about illumination goes via the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, where via multiple different connections and pathways it increases the cortisol levels and decreases melatonin levels. I won't go in more, since the reasons as to why have been explained by the other commenters, but the chemical reason is this	1642941305.0	htvgc60	t3_s8bnij	t3_s8bnij	/r/askscience/comments/s8bnij/why_does_blue_light_mess_up_your_sleep/htvgc60/
f49bc9a8	A slightly more detailed explanation...We feel the urge to urinate because of the increase in pressure in the urinary bladder. Due to gravity the pressure in more at the bottom, triggering the urge much before the bladder is completely full. In micro-gravity the same amount of pressure at the bottom of the bladder is felt much later. So astronauts consciously make trips to the toilet after every few hours, without feeling the urge.  Maintaining their health is a primary task they have when in space, so they can’t ignore it for other tasks. More importantly, when the bladder is completely full, you lose control over urinating and may not be able to reach the toilet. It happened with Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut in space. His flight was short but he had to wait for 5 hours after wearing his spacesuit and had to urinate in the space suit. The urine in the spacesuit short-circuited some equipment.	1642941442.0	htvgj66	t3_sa535n	t1_htusxtb	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htvgj66/

However another extremely important factor here is that the gills need some water for the oxygen to dissolve into the blood. The same is true for our lungs, a worm's skin and such, in order for the oxygen to be actually able to pass through the membranes, it needs to be dissolved, that's why worms also die when they dry out, and the same would happen to us if we somehow removed all the water from our surfactant	1642941711.0	htvgx5v	t3_s78u06	t1_htdlcis	/r/askscience/comments/s78u06/why_are_fish_unable_to_breathe_oxygen_from_air/htvgx5v/

Call it 2m per second² it'd take 140 seconds to reach the surface and give you a speed around 750km/h.  Now, if you assumed 9.9ms² over the same distance you could reach 1675km/h.  Theoretically it's possible. But then, so are a lot of things.

17234i	I have a mom, dad, son trio of dogs. While they are very close and definitely feel like a little family, it’s hard to say if they think about each other in this way.   I can tell you for sure that the son will follow his dad around and do whatever he does for as long as he lives. He absolutely loves his dad and is still his shadow after 3 years. In some ways he never left the late puppy stages. He definitely acts younger than his parents did at the same age.   On the other hand one of my older dogs met his parents in a park one day and I wasn’t there but apparently it was no different than meeting any other dogs.	1642942023.0	htvhdn8	t3_sa5r2f	t3_sa5r2f	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvhdn8/

You're working against an energy gradient to put a bouyant object at the bottom of the ocean, right? Essentially charging it up with potential energy before releasing and turning it into kinetic as it rises?

15i8iu	You have stumbled upon a very complex and divisive topic in the field right now, and there is not a clear answer. Different researchers will define TADs in different ways, and there is a credible argument that most of what is being looked at is simply a coorelation of expression.  The way we measure TADs is with a technique called [Hi-C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149993/). We had other techniques too look at interactions before, but HiC gave us enough data to actually start looking for trends. Hi-C is just gluing all the DNA together, fragmenting it with enzymes, and then reattaching all the ends of DNA back together again. Then we sequence the library we just made and graph where the two halves are on the chromosome. The vast majority of the reads we get out are just next to each other in a linear sense, but there are some regions that show up ligated together that are far apart, and this has to happen more than you would expect randomly. So you are looking at a somewhat fuzzy probabilistic model of 3D genome architecture.  A lot of what we see are densely packed heterochromatin, or permanently inactive DNA. These show up next to each other, but there isnt really a clear specific distal interaction. Instead it is just all clumped together, so things that are far apart show up, but there is no real specificity to it. This is often things like telomeres, centromeres, and long regions of transposable elements. These evolve very quick (there is no real selective pressure on TEs, and centromere evolution is a it of a mystery), so they will be different between humans and pretty much anything. Do these count as TADs? Some people say no, some people say yes.  There are more well studied interactions like with [CTCF](https://www.nature.com/articles/emm201533#:~:text=CCCTC%2Dbinding%20factor%20(CTCF),communication%20between%20enhancers%20and%20promoters.), which binds to a known sequence in two locations and creates a loop. This has an impact on gene expression and is a pretty specific interaction between just two sets of DNA. Are we limiting TADs to just stuff like this?  [Phase seperation](https://www.nature.com/collections/adgjaibdae/) occurs when you have groups of proteins that end up in the same location and change the physical properties of the nucleus in a very local area. This is more of a clump like with heterochromatin, but a little more specific in the regions of DNA that end up inside of it. Do these count or are they too nonspecific and wishy washy?  We can spot specific interactions of transcription factors interacting with gene promoters. This is sort of a TAD, but it is also something we have known about for ages and is just specific (sometimes transient) protein protein interactions. Do we set some sort of cutoff when we see it enough statistically to call it a TAD? What if the statistics are just reflective of the cell types it is happening in instead of the actual strength of the relationship.  My point is that if you ask two different people you will get two different answers. You actually have to look at the methodology of the original paper, which is difficult if you are outside of the field. Cis-regulatory elements evolve and change faster than protein-coding genes (most of the time), and their physical location relative to a gene can change even faster then that. How this all ties into 3D genome architecture, and the extent to which it has an impact on expression, is still a mystery.	1642943003.0	htvivky	t3_s9xpdb	t3_s9xpdb	/r/askscience/comments/s9xpdb/does_topologically_associating_domain/htvivky/
hr8pzgcj	There is, we just don't really call them parasites at that point.   Parasitism describes 1 of 3 types of symbiosis:   **parasitism**: *Where one organism, referred to as a parasite, benefits at the expensive of another.*   **Mutualism**: *Where both benifit from their relationship together, think those small fish that clean other fishes mouths.*  **Commensalism**: *Where one benefits and the other isn't harmed but doesn't benifit.*  I see no reason why you couldn't bend it a bit can call it a parasite. Gives it an exotic spin and I imagine people would use the word for commensalism even though it's not technically correct. But if you wanted to be a stickler, it wouldn't be a parasite. Venom uses the word symbiote; I don't believe they own the word, pretty sure it's a general term.	1642943004.0	htvivmh	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/htvivmh/

u2et838	You've gotten good answers to some of the others, but I don't think anyone addressed this one so I'll add an answer to it:  > * Infrared cameras see "heat" at a distance obviously, is that different from how our skin detects heat/IR?  There are different types of infrared cameras that use different types of sensor elements.  Some, like skin, respond to the fact that the infrared warms an element of the detector, and others use semiconductors to detect infrared photons more directly.    But the more important difference affecting what you can do with it and how you can figure out what's going on at a distance is that there is a lens that focuses an image of the infrared emissions of different objects onto the detector, which is really an array of detector elements.  This means that you can tell specifically where the infrared is coming from, whereas if your skin feels warm from some infrared you don't know much detail about where that is coming from other than the crude difference between say the front of your hand feeling warm in the back of your hand feeling cold.	1642945039.0	htvmb9w	t3_sa9uvg	t3_sa9uvg	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htvmb9w/

u2et838	I've never seen the movie Predator so I can't help there, but I can answer about lens materials.  For thermal imaging, the wavelengths of IR involved are typically  near 10-14 microns.  That is in the range of about 3 microns to 20 microns, often called far infrared, or FIR.  Glass cuts off around 3 microns—it passes near infrared just fine, but almost no far infrared.  So for thermal imaging cameras, you do need special lens materials.  They are typically germanium, and that's one of the reasons that they are expensive.  But the infrared that is part of the solar spectrum is almost entirely in the near infrared range, from the edge of the visible spectrum at about 0.75 microns to about 3 microns.  That range goes through glass just fine, which is part of how a room can be warmed the sun through a window on a sunny day.	1642946059.0	htvo6qm	t3_sa9uvg	t1_htvmt1y	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/htvo6qm/

2zun0c7z	I already read a lot of good answers here including non- inertial rotating frames of reference, which induce fictitious forces like centrifugal force.  Seen from an inertial, fixed frame there is no centrifugal force and nothing cancels out. The mass in motion reacts to the force of gravity. If the initial velocity is zero or pointing to the center of gravity, it will fall straight down. If the initial velocity is horizontal, it will (at least try to) go into an elliptical orbit, starting at aphelion with the center of the earth in the perigee. The initial radius of the curvature near earth's surface is r=v^2/g. It is the interplay between initial horizontal velocity and gravity, which defines the curvature. If this radius is smaller than the radius of the earth, it will hit the earth before it can complete an orbit. If you start with approx. 8 km/s, the curvature is equal to the earth's radius, so have an circular orbit. If you increase it further, the circle will turn into an ellipse, which is now wider etc.  It is just the gravity, which causes the acceleration according to F=ma. (F and a are vectors). If the force  is perpendicular to the velocity, it will only change the direction of the motion and will produce a circle with the radius given above. For larger distances from earth's surface you have to take into account, that g gets smaller with increasing distance.	1642947077.0	htvq4ed	t3_sa4s88	t3_sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/htvq4ed/

30qlnuag	He doesn't. I had two sister cats years ago that couldn't be separated, because they went through trauma together. I found them in a box on the side of the road, and their bond was strong, but I can't say they knew they were sisters, just that they had always been with each other. I helped raise them, before rehoming them *together*. When one fell down our balcony, the other meowed and meowed for me. I found her under the stairs, but couldn't get back behind them (plus it was an area definitely filled with widows and scorpions). I ran back upstairs, grabbed the one who told me, and used her to lure her sister out. She was like an emotional support cat, for her sister.    On the other hand, I had a boy and girl, raised together. I was unable to keep them, so took them to a very small and more attentive shelter. When I went back to go see them (was allowed), they were in the same enclosure, hissing and snapping at each other. The shelter staff was terrified of the two of them, despite them both being insanely sweet.    So I separated them. The girl had a nail stuck to her cheek, because they had been fighting overnight. As soon as they were separated, they were both back to being sweet as pie.    A new environment was all it took for the two of them, born and raised together, to forget they were ever even living together.	1642947504.0	htvqy2v	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htuncti	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvqy2v/

Farmers often exploit "olfactory imprinting" to foster lambs to unrelated mothers. Once the mothers have licked the new lambs clean, they treat them just like their own young. I predict the dogs would be similar. The one difference might be less inbreeding aversion to the foster sibling if that is based on MHC olfactory cues.	1642947938.0	htvrt09	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htvp8vo	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvrt09/

Also, the type of material or object would matter because of the reduction in pressure. It would expand and that could non-negligibly impact drag.  You also make a good point with the Reynolds comment on whether it would shift from laminar to turbulent flow around the object during ascent. That could shift things as well and would be object roughness/shape dependent.	1642947984.0	htvrw8p	t3_samslf	t1_htuvapv	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htvrw8p/

d4wac	Curious to how young the dogs would need to be, and for how long they'd need to be separated.  My brother and a friend of his adopted 2 brother puppies, they live far enough away they they don't see each other regularly while also being close enough for us to arrange visits. Sometimes they see each other twice in a week, but they have also spent years without a visit.  After ~6 years they still recognize each other, and my brother's dog even gets excited on the way up to his brother's house (I assume because of scent).	1642948439.0	htvst5g	t3_sa5r2f	t1_htseawr	/r/askscience/comments/sa5r2f/do_generations_of_dogs_understand_relation_to/htvst5g/

ee0f4	I'll start by clarifying that my answer is focused on mountain ranges built primarily of [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust), i.e., collisional mountain rainges, or orogenies, that form from the collision of the continental portions of two plates, like the Himalaya formed from the collision of India and Eurasia OR what we would call Cordilleran (or Andean) orogenies that form on the continental portion of a plate, but are related to [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) of [oceanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust) crust and lithosphere beneath that continental edge, typified by the modern Andes. This is sort of important to clarify as things that could be classified as mountain ranges in the topographic sense (e.g., the [mid-ocean ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge)), or thickened plateaus (e.g., [oceanic plateaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_plateau)) that are primarily or exclusively constructed of oceanic crust/lithosphere will have different dynamics because of the fundamental density constrast between continental and oceanic crust (i.e., continental crust does not subduct easily, whereas oceanic crust does).  With that clarification out the way, the most basic answer is that certainly orogenic systems and their topographic expressions (i.e., mountain ranges) do not last forever. There are plenty of examples of ancient mountain ranges in various stages of decay. Classic examples are the [Appalachians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains) in eastern North America or the [Caledonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Caledonides) in Scandinavia and the British Isles (though of note, the Appalachians have experienced a "topographic rejuvenation", i.e., additional processes after orogeny have increased the relief of the range, e.g., [Pazzaglia & Brandon, 1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2117.1996.00274.x)). Both of these represent the remnants of formerly much larger and higher mountain ranges. At extreme examples, we can consider things like the [Grenville Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenville_orogeny), which do not really exist as any real topographic feature (at least outside of portions that are involved in later orogenies), but we know existed from the various fingerprints left in the geologic record that define the existence of an extremely large mountain range ~1 billion years ago.  In terms of the direct influence of plate tectonics on "destroying" mountain ranges, the primary role are the variety of processes that lead to the eventual cessation of the convergence, which is the ultimate primary driver and maintainer or orogenic topography. The driver for this convergence within (and by proxy, the growth of) most mountain ranges, at least initially, is the negative buoyancy of the subducted slab of oceanic lithosphere. This can be visualized simply with a diagram of the [Wilson Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Cycle), which highlights that collisional mountain ranges represent the closure of a former ocean basin, and it is this force of the still attached, subducted "tongue" of oceanic lithosphere, i.e., the [slab pull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_pull) force, which drives the continued convergence and crustal thickening that builds a mountain range, and thus processes like slab detachment, whereby the subducted slab rips off and sinks into the mantle (e.g., [Davies & von Blanckenburg, 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0012821X9400237S)), which reduces this slab pull force can lead to the slowing and eventual cessation of convergence and orogenic growth (e.g., [Capitanio & Replumaz, 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ggge.20171)). Though, it is worth noting, there are a variety of mechanisms that may contribute to the slowing and eventual cessation of convergence besides reduction of the slab pull force, e.g., increased buoyancy from portions of continental crust entering the subduction zone/channel (e.g., [Capitanio et al., 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo725)), increased graviational potential from the mountain range itself (e.g., [Molnar & Lyon-Caen, 1988](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/356/chapter/3796610/Some-simple-physical-aspects-of-the-support), [Austermann & Iaffaldano, 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tect.20027)), or increased viscous resistance from the mantle (e.g., [Clark, 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10848)).  Once the forces driving convergence and continued "accretionary flux" (in the sense of [Willet et al., 1993](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/21/4/371/205893/Mechanical-model-for-the-tectonics-of-doubly) or [Willett et al., 2001](http://geology.yale.edu/~ajs/2001/Apr_May/qn10t100455.pdf)) into the orogen ceases, the primary mechanism "destroying" mountain ranges is erosion, not plate tectonics, and thus the controls of the "post-orogenic" phase become more a question of the details of the erosional mechanisms at play (e.g., [Baldwin et al., 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001JB000550), [Jansen, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X06001243), [Tucker & van der Beek, 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2117.2012.00559.x), [Robl et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825216304421)). As described in many of those papers, the timescales for orogenic decay is relatively long. This represents the contribution of a few different things. One important one is [isostasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostasy). When a mountain range is being built through crustal thickening, it forms both a large topographic expression, but also essentially a "mountain in the mantle", i.e., a thick crustal root which "compensates" for the topography of the range. As the topography is reduced by erosion and mass flux (i.e., transport by rivers away from the orogen), this induces an isostatic response whereby some of that elevation that is lost, is recovered by rebound. A way to visualize this would be having a block floating in water. If you started stacking some coins on that block, the block would sink a bit so the height of the stack of coins above the water level would be a little less than if the block did not sink. If you start to remove coins one by one, the block (and the remaining stack of coins on top) will gain a little height back because of the reduction in mass, so even though you've reduced the height of the stack of the coins by 1 coins thickness, the elevation is reduced by less than that because of this isostatic response. The same happens during erosion of a decaying orogen, each increment of erosion generates additional rock uplift (at least until the crustal root is removed by this, or other processes). Also related is that generally the erosion rate is proportional to slope. High slopes equals high erosion rate. High slopes can be maintained when you have equally fast rates of rock uplift (during the orogenic phase), but as this slows, the fast erosion rate reduces the slope, which in turn reduces the erosion rate. This means that the rate at which each next increment of slightly less steep topography is eroded is slower than the last increment, whereby you expect this gradually slowing rate of erosion and the persistence of some modest topography for a while. The linked papers above go into a lot more nuance on the details of the river erosion mechanism and how these might also be quite important, but for our purposes, isostasy and declining erosion rates coupled to declining slopes can get us most of the way to a satisfying explanation.  **In short,** mountain ranges go through a sort of life cycle of birth, growth, steady-state, and eventual decay. Plate tectonic processes are important for the growth and the transition into the decay processes, basically various tectonic or geodynamic processes will eventually stop the convergence that drives the growth/maintenance of the mountain range, but the final "death blow" for mountain ranges in terms of their removal comes at the hands of erosion, not plate tectonics.	1642949507.0	htvv34c	t3_saqg8g	t3_saqg8g	/r/askscience/comments/saqg8g/throughout_earths_history_has_the_movement_of/htvv34c/

ah9b96sr	No. First off, there is no such thing as centrifugal force, at least when it comes to gravity. Centrifugal force is when a centrifuge is active or when a washing machine starts spinning. Centrifugal force is an outward force.  Orbit is a combination of two factors: inertia, pushing tangential to orbit; and the centripetal force known as gravity.  Now repeat after me:  There is no centrifugal force.

If nothing is heavy, barbells don't crush against the skin, climbing isn't needed as you basically fly, carrying a wheelbarrow full of bricks would be the same as the barbell thing, etc etc. No friction without gravity.	1642953210.0	htw3ri7	t3_sa535n	t1_htvxdb1	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htw3ri7/

uljg3	3 thoughts:  1. The additional weight of the pressure vessel would counter all the advantage of the minor density difference between water and hydrogen.  Minor in that water is only 1gm/cc heavier than a vacuum, but steel is like 7.8gm/cc.  And then you'd have to shed all that extra momentum, once you were out of the water by dumping the dead steel mass that was no longer buoyant.  2. Didn't Polaris missiles used to release a flood of bubbles to reduce drag on missile launch, just because water was too slow?  3. If you could get the pressure vessel that strong, why not fill the volume with propellant gases and light them off?  A thought experiment... Take the lowest conceivable drag shape( a bullet, a missile, or a bullet train, or a Prius.). Fill a balloon with that shape with hydrogen/ helium, and release it from the bottom of your swimming pool.  It probably can't even gather enough energy to get it's whole mass above water.  Think of the amazing classic videos of the Los Angeles class subs doing an emergency blow, from hundreds of feet of depth, , maybe 70% of the ship is above water.   Think of the drag on a bullet that hits water.  It goes from Mach speed and  stops in feet, but goes miles in air.   Another terrible experiment that no one should run.  Get a helium tank from party city for blowing up balloons.  Tie it to an engine block. With thin wire which will break at maybe a few hundred lbs of force.  Throw it over board. When the buoyancy of the helium tank exceeds the breaking strain of the copper wire, it will surface quickly without the engine block.   Move boat to safe distance and see if helium tank even clears the surface.   Sorry, not a very constructive response, my math brain is lazy today.	1642953612.0	htw4rq9	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htw4rq9/
u2yyo	Exactly. You could still get some version of this if you had to quickly move heavy things (still takes force to accelerate any mass), but it's a question of gravity acting *on objects* that then act on your body, rather than gravity affecting your body more directly like it does for the circulatory issues and bone density issues that arise	1642953936.0	htw5l0n	t3_sa535n	t1_htw3ri7	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/htw5l0n/

5u65jiar	The destruction of mountain ranges is unusually caused by erosion, after the mountain building event has stopped, as described by u/CrustalTrudger.  Most subduction zones involve an oceanic plate going under a continental plate, because oceanic plates are thinner and denser. Occasionally, a continental plate will subduct under another continental plate. In this case, you could have the subduction of a mountain range.  India is currently subducting under the Eurasian plate. The ghats (the mountains in southern India) will most likely subduct beneath Tibet sometime in the next 50-100 million years.	1642954495.0	htw6yrd	t3_saqg8g	t3_saqg8g	/r/askscience/comments/saqg8g/throughout_earths_history_has_the_movement_of/htw6yrd/

The ghats (the mountains in southern India) will most likely subduct beneath Tibet sometime in the next 50-100 million years.  This expectation is not really born out in any literature. At the most basic level, thickened sections of continental crust would almost certainly not be completely underthrust or subducted, but rather would more likely be [accreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_%28geology%29) in some form (as this fundamentally is what needs to happen to allow for terrane accretion, of which there is abundance geologic evidence). More specifically, the expectation of what happens when elevated and thickened continental crust enters into the frontal part of an orogenic system is not well defined (e.g., [Forte et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014TC003651)). The most direct example is the ongoing collision of the Pamir and Tien Shan (e.g., [Burtmann, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195100000226), [Sobel et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X12006954), [Zubovich et al., 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015TC004055)), but suffice to say, the exact dynamics are complicated, but complete subduction of a mountain range is not an outcome described in any source of which I'm aware.	1642955405.0	htw99hq	t3_saqg8g	t1_htw6yrd	/r/askscience/comments/saqg8g/throughout_earths_history_has_the_movement_of/htw99hq/

Like you said it's because of the loss of elasticity in the skin, which results in lines wrinkles when the skin is repeated creased by muscle movement. Slow or stop the muscle movement, and the skin isn't getting creased so much, thus no lines. Younger skin doesn't develop these creases because it's more elastic and bounces back when folded. It has nothing to do with more "hyperactive muscles".	1642958266.0	htwgozi	t3_sawt39	t1_htwc72q	/r/askscience/comments/sawt39/why_do_muscles_become_hyperactive_with_age/htwgozi/

298hed	I would say it is impossible, even with an object with zero drag as the buoyancy force doesn't make sense at supersonic speeds, which would be necessary for orbit velocity upon breaching the water surface.  The ideal case would be a vacuum filled tube from space to the bottom of the ocean, with the object at the bottom sealing the tube.  With no friction in the tube and the tube disappearing as the object goes by to ignore any effects from water having to flow through the tube, water just passed by the object would have to flow fast enough to catch up to the object to apply a force to it.  When the object is going faster than the speed of sound in water, the water would have to move at supersonic speeds, which I don't think the water will be able to do without nozzle shenanigans.	1642958664.0	htwhqxj	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htwhqxj/

6qtf6	It means that after traveling a very short distance in that dimension, you arrive back where you started. Remember that dimensions are just any independent parameters we can use to describe something; they don't have to look like XYZ euclidean space.  It's analogous to rotation; you can be at 3 locations in space, plus some degrees of rotation around an axis. Once you rotate around 360 deg, you wind up back at the same state you started in. That parameter of how far you've rotated is a dimension. (The extra dimensions in string theory aren't actually rotations, I think, but they work similarly.)	1642959748.0	htwkkyx	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwkkyx/
jg2xa	The usual analogy is describing an ant on a string. From our perspective, it's a one dimensional system - the ant can go left or right. But to the ant, that string is a great cable and it can go around and around in either direction as well as left and right. Or another way is to think of videogames like asteroids or star control (dating myself) where when you go out the left you come in on the right and vice versa. No imagine your monitor getting more and more narrow - as you shrink the width, eventually "left side" and "right side" become effectively one. It's only when you get down to the one pixel level does left/right position become meaningful. Does that help?	1642959968.0	htwl5fw	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwl5fw/

As you get closer, you see that the rope actually has thickness, and something small enough, like an ant, is not only in a position *along* the rope's length, but also in a position *around* the rope's circumference.  Up close, the rope has an additional dimension that is "curled up" around it, one that is not apparent from further away.	1642960071.0	htwlfhr	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwlfhr/

n27na	Take a paper, place it on a table, the paper is now representing a bounded 2D space. You can consider the extension of the directions of the paper if you wan to imagine the open infinite 2D space. Take the paper and roll it into a cylinder, one dimension is now "curled up", it is finite and does not have an edge.  This is the first step in making an analogue to e.g. string theory extra dimensions. The first problem is that you can still see two dimensions, one is infinite (along the length of the cylinder), and once is finite going around the cylinder. In physics if we are considering extra dimensions they must also be small. So what does that mean? For the paper that would mean you keep on rolling it tighter and tighter together, shrinking the circle of the cylinder -- beyond what is physically possible with a paper -- until it just looks like a line. At this point it is also "small".	1642960373.0	htwm7y7	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htwm7y7/

htfb8	Not orbit, the best you could do is reach escape velocity but thats not quite the same. The thing about orbits is all the points repeat and they don't change until something acts on one of the objects.   So if we look at the points on the theoretical orbit we are trying to achieve we notice a problem right away. Some of our points are the ones starting at the sea bed and leading out of it. No matter what the rest of the orbit looks like, eventually part of it would need to cycle back to those undersea points, which can't happen without it crashing through the earth.	1642960517.0	htwmli7	t3_samslf	t1_htv5gwc	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htwmli7/

You simply lose your ability to digest it once your body stops producing the enzyme lactase, and it ends up in your large intestine where your gut bacteria digest and ferment it. It’s the bacterial activity byproducts that causes discomfort.  You will not die from it, just feel uncomfortable.

gekpw	Take a circuit that's just an AC power source connected to a resistive load.  The power source provides a voltage V(t) = V*_0_*cos(ωt), which is entirely dropped across an equivalent resistor of resistance R.  The current through the resistor is then I(t) = V(t)/R = V*_0_*cos(ωt)/R.  The instantaneous power dissipated in the resistor is P(t) = V(t)I(t) = V*_0_*^(2)cos^(2)(ωt)/R.  So the current is a cosine function, which has both positive and negative swings as a function of time. But the power is a cosine-**squared** function, which is never negative.  And while the current through the resistor switches direction, the power dissipation doesn't care whether the current is moving "forward" or "backward". When there is current flowing through the resistor in either direction, there is a positive power dissipated.  And if you average the current over an integer number of periods, you get zero, but if you average the power over an integer number of periods, you get something positive.	1642961679.0	htwpmst	t3_saldgr	t3_saldgr	/r/askscience/comments/saldgr/in_alternating_current_how_is_electricity_carried/htwpmst/

o9bp1	Yes. Basically what you are describing is viscous heating. Say you have a fluid in an infinite domain with some initial state of imposed turbulence. The system is then left to proceed in time. The turbulence would decay due to a lack of energy injection, through turbulent and viscous dissipation, until the kinetic energy was converted into heat. This heat would then diffuse until the medium had a homogeneous temperature. This is the basic mechanism and other physics can change the details (such as considerations of the boundaries, solid walls, etc).  This turns up in the modelling of compressible fluids where you find a viscous heating term in the temperature equation.	1642962195.0	htwr03e	t3_salqbo	t3_salqbo	/r/askscience/comments/salqbo/if_two_streams_of_gas_intersect_does_friction/htwr03e/

In diabetes, strict A1C control (<7.0) is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia contributing to increased overall mortality.

d79lh7f4	Strictly an observer…. No expertise at all in these topics beyond casual interest in some podcasts and observing some fascinating people around me.  My impression is that depression really comes down malfunctioning control of neurotransmitters or the lack of an appropriate balance for your environment … while the cause can be one of many… trauma, inflammation, dietary, genetic, environmental…. (Basically good luck figuring out every individual’s cause).   Considering that your main happiness comes from things working out better than expected, in particular a positive dopamine hit difference between plan and actual. Depression manifests itself as a lack of interest/interacting with your environment because your cognition is not getting reward for acting if things are not under its control and your sense making is malfunctioning. I’m particular you lose control over attention, and stimulus of the environment, your lambic system starts to autopilot and you may experience weight gain reduced activity and stimulation, as you are now spinning in just planning thoughts become more in your head and detached from reality. Tons of screen time becomes preferable to bench pressing those extra 5reps.  The way I understand it, cognition not responding with the right right stimulation of your brain can cause depression. So in result you can’t really learn how to respond to your environment… basically eat less sugar, exercise more and you are likely to feel “smarter”	1642962837.0	htwsocw	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwsocw/
39pradfe	Good discussion here, I'm very glad people are being so nuanced about this. Clear-cut determinism has been questioned only relatively recently in psychiatry, all the while more and more information has been available to the public about neurotransmitters and their proposed effect on mental states and behaviour. As a result, there used to be a strong incentive in popular science to communicate some (if not all) so-far known neurotransmitters in the narrow spectrum "good" vs "bad" and then communicating how certain medicines help the good guys and maim the bad. Results of this kind of communication can be observed when people self medicate, applying mechanistic logic on their own cognition and largely negating their surroundings or effects of suggestion, conditioning and other often blurry psychosomatic effects that may play a huge part in one's mental states.  While wildly misleading and unfortunate, this is also very understandable once you realize how science is made and how it clashes with popular science journalism and everyday logic. Science relies heavily on reproducibility, and to get there you take the reductionist approach: Minimize speculation, negate noise and look what happens when you change variables. But things get complicated once you apply reductionism in emergent, biological systems such as human beings.	1642962839.0	htwsohd	t3_sawfex	t1_htwmhqc	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwsohd/

5g4hw	In addition to the "direct-neurotransmitter" theory of depression which others in the thread have discussed, there is also a growing field of thought that in addition to (or even instead of) directly mediating depression, the neurotransmitter deficiency/imbalance contributes to structural/trophic changes in areas of the brain. These changes include atrophy (decrease in size) as well as diminished neuroplasticity. (https://www.nature.com/articles/1300371)  To answer your question more directly, depression can impact executive function and other areas of cognition indirectly (i.e. by impacting our emotions/motivations which in turn change how we think and act) and directly (by damaging the regions of the brain most responsible for executive function and memory, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) - good review article on some of the pathophys here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950973/  There's also no real "unified theory" of depression AFAIK - in clinical practice, for example, many patients will have to try a wide variety of medications with different mechanisms before they find one that works for their depression.	1642963184.0	htwtkah	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwtkah/

a4fbm	Each yearly flu vaccine is a variation on the ones that came before. There are special approval processes that allow the new flu shot to be admitted without having to go through the full set of clinical trials.   The covid-19 vaccine was developed quickly. A month after receiving the genetic code of the virus, researchers had the vaccine ready for first tests. By far the most time between discovery of the disease and rollout of the vaccine was spent on clinical trials: Proving that the vaccine is safe and effective. What further slowed down the full rollout is that the vaccine uses new technology, for which there wasn't a large amount of production capacity ready to go. Highly complex production chains had to be scaled up from zero to producing billions of doses.  Finally, a Delta-specific vaccine was never rolled out because the conclusion was that the protection offered by the existing vaccines against Delta was good enough and that it was more beneficial to keep up the high rate of deliveries than it would've been to switch to a new formulation.	1642963503.0	htwudfe	t3_sax5el	t3_sax5el	/r/askscience/comments/sax5el/why_is_it_new_flu_vaccines_are_developed_so/htwudfe/

Couldn't find a ton of stuff that isn't feasability/proposals/proof of concepts but I know they're being developed all over the place. Here's a [conference symposium abstract](https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/chatbots-for-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention-is-this-even-et) about the ethics of a chatbot for suicidality.  Here's a feasibility [paper](https://academic.oup.com/tbm/article/9/3/440/5489496?casa_token=Bx0ycLMDbK0AAAAA:kNe3yrwqspEBjjWaqd0_bA2RaCkVnbifIWsl1_W01jG5QNIbvl0wGt3UIgFtVPA8Mj4KVIBL1xr2ZA) looking at a support/coach chatbot for prediabetes/eating, for example.  Are you just generally curious about the tech? or have a more specific question or population, like does it help with coaching or motivation for treatment seeking, does it help people feel less lonely, does it help improve utilization of treatment resources, does it help patients stay in treatment, or does help patients reduce symptoms, etc.?	1642964097.0	htwvw6w	t3_savrvw	t3_savrvw	/r/askscience/comments/savrvw/are_social_chatbot_good_for_human_health/htwvw6w/

kzzng	There are as many different types of people in that bucket as there are different people.  Depression (MDD etc.) is a loose categorisation for commonly co-occurring symptoms, irrespective of cause. That goes for all the common psychiatric definitions. That's different from ordinary illnesses, say, tuberculosis which is caused by a certain bacteria or COVID-19 that's caused by a certain virus, and that's their definition.  Which is of course obvious to say, but it's the whole reason "holistic" or integrative approaches exist and ultimately seem to show the best results, rather than handing a million people the same type of medication to fix their serotonin. Isn't that definitively closer to just keeping people afloat? But that's unfortunately usually more of a question of time, money and resources.	1642964238.0	htww9an	t3_sawfex	t1_htwnm1u	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htww9an/
8yd3yin6	No. The main reason for the loss of eggs is not the menstrual cycle but atresia (a kind of apoptosis = programmed cell death).  This is illustrated by the fact that a girl has the most eggs (around 6 million) by the time she is six months old (still in the womb) but by the time she starts menstruating 'only' 40.000 are left.  And when the menopausal transition begins (around 35 years old), it's because the follicles will start to produce less inhibin and oestrogens and menopause hits (around 51 years old) when the levels of these hormones are too low. So assuming that you would have a few eggs more (that didn't die already due to pure luck) because you were pregnant, then these wouldn't have a big enough impact to significantly delay your menopause.	1642964415.0	htwwpm1	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htwwpm1/

11544l	I have a different interpretation of why integrative approaches have come to be favored. You can solve the problem for more people if you simultaneously throw multiple solutions at them. For some, therapy alone works, and will continue to work even if you prescribe medication. For others, medication is necessary, and therapy may additionally be helpful, or for people who've been in therapy for years, it's only when you add medication that their condition will resolve Others can get by with a change in diet or exercise. But if you tell people to get therapy, take medication, fix their diet, and exercise, the entire group will benefit and show improvement. So that approach will become the favored approach. Only recently have people begin to investigate why each is necessary and isolation for different subpopulations. Your original statement that depression is due to events in life is what I was objecting to, and the implied statement that all remedies must begin there.	1642964776.0	htwxn15	t3_sawfex	t1_htww9an	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwxn15/

t1nou	The issue with the neuropsychological approach to the human experience is that we end up with the conclusion that we are nothing but biological machines, which by itself is not a horribly misguided statement - everything from physics to medicine seems to largely indicate that being the case. But I feel like reducing complex phenomena like schizophrenia or depression to atrophy in brain regions or neurotransmitter deficiency nips any kind of progress that can be made through other means in the bud. It's akin to explaining Shakespear's work in terms of the paper on which it was written or the shape of the letters, or trying to deduce why a painting is aesthetically pleasing only in terms of the medium and paint and tools that were used. In my opinion that only sets us back and alienates the intimate experience of consciousness and the human condition, something with which we are all naturally familiar with.   I don't think anatomy and neurons play no role in conditions like depression or anxiety but it seems unfair to delegate our free will and the malleability of our organism to pharmacological solutions we seldom grasp or understand.   Unfortunately these simplistic pharmacological solutions will remain more attractive to pharmaceutical and insurance companies as well as to us in general in this age where everyone wants everyhing to be quick and done with at the lowest possible cost.	1642965255.0	htwyuw3	t3_sawfex	t1_htwsohd	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htwyuw3/

htfb8	I omitted a small but important part because I don't know that I can succinctly describe it all in words. The key bit is that the orbit is fixed and repeating once you stop applying forces. A rocket is continuously burning fuel as it shapes its orbit so it is effectively creating a bunch of new potential orbital paths as it does so.   If you go back to any particular time, say point C, and cut all thrust at that moment, the orbit you would see should either not loop at all, which is what escape velocity is, or it would come back to that particular point, point C. It would not in fact have to visit point A & B because it didn't make it from point B to C on gravity alone so it won't be able to make the exact same trip on gravity alone.  Despite that though, and especially if the forces involved are small, it will still trace a path back to point C and before that to points similar to points A & B. A rocket spends so much time and so much force thrusting out of the atmosphere that the differences before the point where it cuts thrust on its new orbit and the path it travelled to get there are enough to keep it in orbit.   In the case of our ocean vessel, the point where it leaves the atmosphere is where its orbit becomes fixed. At that point it is flying upwards away from the planet. That means on the next loop it needs to be flying upwards away from the planet at that same time. But if we then step backwards and look at what the bit of time before that looked like, because nothing but gravity is acting on it we know that a couple of seconds prior it must have been a little lower and travelling in the roughly the same direction. You keep iterating backwards and each time, since the vessel is traveling vertically, you find yourself a little lower until eventually you hit a point where it must have been in the ground or the sea.	1642966162.0	htx15kn	t3_samslf	t1_htwtpzo	/r/askscience/comments/samslf/is_there_a_terminal_velocity_for_a_buoyant_object/htx15kn/

ncxd6	The best way I know to explain this given my own limited understanding and the fact that this field is still being pioneered...  Your brain is a network of roads, or you can think of it as paths in a forest. The paths lead to many different destinations. A path may lead to a feeling of happiness, confidence, sadness, anger, etc.  Often times, paths lead to the same destination, with some being longer than others.  Like any path in the forest, the ones that are used frequently are clear and free of overgrowth. The ones not so recently traveled, overgrow and can be difficult to travel.  You have to walk these paths every day, but depression is like if you sprained your ankle. That sprain could be something that happened over time because you weren't watching your step and caused a repetitive strain injury. It could also be something abrupt, like the loss of a loved one. You still have to walk those paths, but you move slower, and it's more difficult. As a result, you may take the easier, shorter paths (instant gratification), leaving the longer ones (self care, work, exercise), to overgrow.  Your ankle will not heal unless you take proper steps towards that end. Mostly because you *have* to keep walking those paths daily. The longer it goes untreated, the worse it gets, and the longer it takes to travel even the easier paths all while the longer ones overgrow even more.  Eventually, you're just crawling at a snails pace through as few paths as possible. Sleeping. Sleeping is the shortest one, so you do that a lot. Eating isn't very long, but your ankle hurts a lot today, so maybe just travel down that one once and it's good enough. The laundry path has been too overgrown for weeks now. And you're pretty sure a storm blocked the leave-your-house path.  The suicide path isn't very long. You've thought of that one. There's a big boulder at the beginning that you have to climb over, but it's easy down-hill travel from there. Maybe tomorrow.  Then cue antidepressants. Suddenly, your ankle is healed. With a renewed sense of mobility, you may travel some of those paths you have not in a long time. They're overgrown, so the first few dozen times you travel them will be difficult, but after they're cleared again, they become easier.  But maybe instead of cleaning those difficult paths, you try a new one, the suicide path. Since your ankle is better, you can easily climb that boulder now.  (Side note, this is why some anti depressants say that they can increase suicide risk. They help you to regain your motivation often weeks before you actually start to get better. Meaning you might actually follow through before things improve)  On the other hand, there's a lot of nice sights you haven't visited down the other paths. Happiness, self fulfillment, generosity, you havnt seen those I'm a while. Maybe try to travel a couple of them and see.  Even better, now you have a friend, a therapist. They can't physically help you clear those paths, but they can help you prioritize which ones need clearing first. Maybe even give you some advice on traversing difficult terrain to make you more prepared for the hike.  Sorry if you're looking for more of a scientific response given that this is /r/askscience  I just don't have to knowledge to provide that. But maybe this explanation helps to illustrate things a bit.	1642966290.0	htx1h65	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx1h65/

People are diagnosed in adulthood because either their independence, a new environment (work), or a change in their lifestyle makes it difficult for them to manage ADHD symptoms, not because it has developed.  Presentation of similar neurological symptoms doesn't mean the same underlying mechanism. Comorbidity of ADHD with depression is stress related to ADHD management or impacts on lifestyle/work/relationships, not a shared mechanism, as far as I am aware anyway.	1642966423.0	htx1tei	t3_sawfex	t1_htwwy0y	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx1tei/

u63ch	While this is true in the sense that a low A1C can be an indicator of episodes of dangerously low blood sugars - there's some information missing here and I don't think this answers OPs questions about RBC and A1C in normal bodies. To clarify your points about diabetics though (as I don't have answers for OP) an A1C of less than 7 in Type 2 diabetics is considered the goal of their medical treatment so I have to assume you mean type 1s. In Type 1 diabetics, it is no longer considered an immediate cause for alarm. While it can indicate lower overall blood sugars or repeated episodes of very low blood sugar, today's technology has allowed many type 1 diabetics to reach near normal glucose levels safely. Additionally, while the overall 'low kills fast/high kills slowly' is very true - there are some considerations. A low that requires medical intervention is extremely dangerous and can cause death, coma, or other severe medical conditions. The term low for diabetics means a lot of things, though. Lows into the 70m/dL range are often considered trivial. Below 70 many many type 1s can treat a low on their own without medical intervention and treatment of these lows does not cause permanent harm. Sustained high blood glucose levels does cause harm that is potentially permanent and increases risk for complications and comorbidities that decrease quality of life and chance of death. So a low A1C in type 1s is generally considered a reason for celebration and a high A1C is considered reason for medical intervention.

ilows	**Recap for casual readers:- What is HbA1c?**  HbA1c  is a quantification of the amount of the "normal" variant of haemoglobin \[HbA\]\* which has been glycated at sometime during its working life.  Glycation means having a glucose molecule permanently bonded to the HbA molecule - the glucose attaches at a characteristic spot on the HbA molecule at a consistent slow rate but the rate is dependent upon the amount of glucose around about (inside a red blood cell \[RBC\] though this is strongly correlated with the concentration of glucose in the blood.)   RBCs work hard and wear out very quickly. Their half life (the duration at which half of them will have died, and them and their contents  have been broken up  and recycled) is about three months. Any particular HbA molecule has a limited time in which it may become glycated. Over the course of three months the chance is about 5% if there is a normal amount of glucose around its cell. If a large selection of cells are sampled - a typical blood test sample contains tens of billions of cells - then the average age of the HbA molecules in the sample from a healthy person is three months and around 5% of it is glycated HbA, a.k.a HbA1c.  **Diagnostic usage**  Glucose concentration in blood is actively controlled by your body, dynamically storing and releasing glucose to maintain the level at 3 to 8 mmol/L so that HbA1c level of 5% is consistently found unless the system of control breaks down - this is what happens to a person with diabetes. It is possible find a healthy person with a glucose well above 8 mmol/L if they have just swallowed a load of sugary food, but it will get stored away rapidly and the blood glucose level should be back to normal in an hour. This short blip of high glucose concentration will barely affect the HbA1c percentage\*\*. However, a diabetic whose body fails to control blood glucose levels automatically will have a highly variable and usually a higher average glucose concentration continuously. Thus Hb gets glycated a little more quickly on average throughout its lifetime and the percentage of HbA1c in any sample  goes up.   HbA1c is a one trick pony in diagnostics. Its unique trick is to estimate the average amount of glucose in a persons bloodstream over the past three months (or so.) Its useful because a diabetic can tolerate fairly high quantities of of glucose transiently but maintaining a higher glucose level causes the long-term damage. Thus, the momentary blood glucose concentration is not that useful for managing the disease compared to a measurement of the accumulated average glucose.  In practice HbA1c is not the definitive diagnostic criterion for diabetes (though it was recommended for a while by W.H.O. Currently they recommend a most uncomfortable and time-consumng Glucose Tolerance Test to be definitive) but it is of greatest utility in helping a person manage their diabetes over the (life)long term and for predicting whether the nastier side-effects of diabetes are likely to appear. (Most of the diabetic problems - retinopathy, nerve damage, kidney failure etc. are caused by glycation of other proteins around the body some of which, unlike Hb, are damaged or disabled by these stuck-on glucoses.) In addition it overcomes a problem with diabetics visiting a clinic for a regular check-up (usually every three months until the diabetic is 'trained' to monitor and deal with their condition by moderating their glucose/sugar intake.) The patient knows that their appointment is due and that they will have their glucose level checked in clinic and will be scolded by the clinician if they have been eating too much so their glucose level is high. It is common for patients to change their diet for the day of the visit. This means the clinician does not get an accurate picture of their state of health and risk factors, but also meant it was quite common for a patient, knowing they had recently over-indulged, to starve themselves on clinic appointment day and to collapse from hypoglycaemia (too little glucose to power their body) often in the clinic waiting room!  **Finally, to answer the question**  In diagnostic practice, low levels of HbA1c are not very useful. Any person with a normal rate of RBC turnover, typical HbA and a livable level of blood glucose should always have at least 3.5% of their Hb glycated in any random sample, so a lower level does indicate a problem with the red blood cells, but there are other, better ways to investigate these various problem.   There are a variety of root causes for high RBC turnover that can be diagnosed directly and they will typically associate with anaemia\*\*\* and other clinical symptoms so evidence of low HbA1c is usually redundant. Gross trauma or blood transfusions can also mess up HbA1c interpretation but are clear contra-indications for the test. Atypical variants of haemoglobin can cause the rate of glycation to change and give unrepresentative HbA1c results. HbA1c assays most commonly separate the Hb using chromatography so confounding variants can be detected and either accounted for or invalidate the test - though there are some very rare variants that may be missed (this is more of a concern for incorrectly identifying - or failing to identify -  high levels of HbA1c and mis-diagnosing diabetes.)   It is possible that occasionally one of these oddities may be noticed due to an anomalous HbA1c in an apparently asymptomatic person but there is not enough consistency, or enough occasions where this is likely to make for a deliberate diagnostic inquiry. However, if whole population HbA1c screening for diabetes were to be attempted (there is believed to be an epidemic of undiagnosed sub-clinical and pre-diabetic people who may only be discovered when they present with an associated condition or collapse into a coma) then mining this free data for indications that might signal, for example atypical Hb variants or chronic low level exposure to carbon monoxide might become worthwhile.  \~ \~ \~ \~ \~  \~ \~ \~ \~ \~  \*There are lots of other variants of haemoglobin - many associated with a pathology; for example sickle cell disease is associated which having the HbS variant of haemoglobin in place of the usual HbA. The different variants have differences in how well they glycate so the HbA1c analysis cannot be reliably done for a person without any HbA type haemoglobin.  \*\*HbA1c used to be reported as a straight percentage in several countries but by international agreement the measurement has been standardised as the concentration , in mmol/L of glycated Hb as a ratio of the molar concentration of all Hb \[ie. "mmol/mol Hb"\]. This provides a 'nicer' scaling, apparently (5% roughly equals 40mmol/mol) This is a UK biochemists equivalent of Pluto.  \*\*\*NB HbA1c measurements are not themselves affected by anaemia, so long as there are enough RBCs to get a good sample (you'd be dead before that number got so low) since only the ratio of glycated to total Hb is quantified.	1642967871.0	htx5hl6	t3_saxb1r	t3_saxb1r	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htx5hl6/

y9ybd	I just wanted to add that I recently learned (and translated) from a video that 50% of people with ADHD also develop Depression. This is significant because it doesn’t work the other way around, and so only 2.7% of people with Depression “have” ADHD. I say have because ADHD is with you since you are born. It’s a genetical “adaptation” rather than an illness. https://youtu.be/xkXpcs_an80 (Around 11-15 minutes I think). Anyways, you can probably guess why growing up with ADHD causes Depression so often…  On the other hand there is also evidence that ADHD could develop in adulthood. There was a study done in New Zealand that studied people for over 40 years. 90% of the people who had ADHD at the end of the study did not have it at the beginning.  https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/late-onset-adhd-may-emerge-young-adults Many people (including me) have some issues with this theory. Maybe the evaluation they performed 40 years ago was not good. Afterall, ADHD diagnosing improved tremendously over the past decades. But most importantly, supporting parents and teachers, and the most significantly a HIGH IQ can all mask ADHD symptoms.	1642968062.0	htx5z5b	t3_sawfex	t1_htwwy0y	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx5z5b/

g3v26w15	There's many things that have similar symptoms to ADHD. If you have no childhood symptoms they'd just rule out ADHD and go down the list of things that can present similarly. There's not really any sort of "adult onset ADHD equivalent."   In fact quite often when you bring up adhd to a doctor as an adult they'll want to check other things first. Get blood work done, treat depression, etc. There's actually quite a few things that can look similar, I'd have been able to list a lot of them before I got diagnosed but I've since forgotten them.	1642968659.0	htx7i09	t3_sawfex	t1_htx679z	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htx7i09/

28305w9e	You’re correct, it definitely is a chicken and egg situation.  But the problem with the human element is that either one can come first depending on how you look at it.  Here’s my take on it  People may argue that genetic predisposition can easily set people up for problems with brain chemistry.  From a surface perspective this gives people the impression that the root of an individuals problems with depression come internally.  And therefore it serves to justify approaching the problem of depression from a pharmaceutical angle, and medicating against those imbalances.    Now there’s nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but the problem with arguing it over genetic predisposition is that such a setup is, in and of itself, the result of an external influence, on the part of the parents.  It is not to say that the parents are to *blame*, because the genetic makeup of an individual is so complicated and chronological that it may not be either direct parent who may have left that predisposition in a persons genealogical makeup.    But most of the time people are much quicker to denounce the idea of external influences. What this results in is the pharmaceutical approach also justifies the existence of other external influences upon someone which could be negative, and ultimately harmful.  Let’s say your a student in a school.  You may have depression, anxiety, tendencies, or anger issues, or whatever as a result of GP.  Medication may be beneficial to help with enduring neurotransmitters.  But let’s say you are bullied by a bigger and meaner student, or renegged/hostily engaged by a teacher.  You might be negatively affected by that in a way that contributes to your risk of depression.  **Nothing is ultimately wrong with medication, except that it justifies the continuance of external negative influences to your internal brain chemistry which is also subject to the laws of thermodynamics in its own way**.  If you use GP as the excuse for how you would feel as a victim of bullying, or any other event that contributes to your depression, it is basically saying that those events do not have any factor on your brain chemistry as an external influence which acts upon it.  When we lose a loved one and go to the funeral, our brain chemistry is altered to make us sad.  When a girlfriend is kind to us, it is altered to make us feel happy and at ease.  Who are we to arbitrarily declare that such external events do not play a part in the integrity of our neural transmitters? And therefore who are we to say that such external forces and influences on our brain chemistry cannot exist or be valid? And from there who are we to say that our practice of mitigating problems such as depression cannot consist of a combination of both medication, and vindication, at the same time?	1642970386.0	htxbz17	t3_sawfex	t1_htwupe5	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxbz17/

39pradfe	Gladly some points you bring up are topical in certain scientific circles today. So just in case you or others (u/Brrdock) want to look further I want to share some sources:  One who would definitely share your criticism of the mechanical metaphor is Daniel J. Nicholson. Much of what he communicates is intense molecular and cellular biology, but he's very committed to working with scientists by highlighting the problems and offering work-arounds. This approach suggests better science communication and even better science since researchers are able to appreciate, identify and classify complexity in different metaphors.  More on the depression/neurology side I think Robert Sapolsky is worth checking out. He's authored several books that are incredibly concise yet acknowledging the absolute complexity of these issues and problems. There's a whole stanford lecture series on youtube, of which what perhaps touches my earlier point is his lecture titled "Chaos and Reductionism".   Nicholson has also a book out with John Dupre called "Everything Flows" that at least used to be free somewhere online. Nicholson has also a lecture somewhere on youtube about Schrödinger's influence on the history of molecular biology (and it's mechanistic underpinnings). I have found absolutely no answers or solutions but in this case I actually find it super assuring for some reason.	1642970839.0	htxd68l	t3_sawfex	t1_htwyuw3	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxd68l/
59i4p0yc	I bet you are right, and the reason why SOME people have very low Hb1C is because they have high RBC turnover due to a dangerous condition.   I know that you can have low HbA1c from minimizing carbs in your diet (which I believe is great for you if you get there slowly) but also from blood loss.   I also read that some people have much smaller sized red blood cells than the rest of us, and their readings are unreliable. I have no idea if that is linked to mortality risk, tho.	1642970868.0	htxd946	t3_saxb1r	t3_saxb1r	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxd946/

il4mt7pa	I am skeptical.  I believe consciousness is an *unintended* side effect of a larger brain.  Obviously it is unintended, being were not designed by an intelligent agent but shaped by inorganic forces over many millions of years to succeed at getting genes into the next generation.    But awareness itself is a sort of fluke that popped out of these blind forces.  Just like a starling does not see the murmuration, humans don't see the intentionality of awareness -- we are told by our own faculties that we understand cognition when the truth is that we have no idea how or why we are aware.  We see cognition as a standalone phenomena when all the evidence tells us that it is deeply concerned with pursuit of an objective, that consciousness is deeply tangled with intention, direction, purpose.  This may well be why depression is so pervasive through biological systems -- when one loses a sense of purpose the entire being becomes ill-adaptive.  We have no framework for directionless awareness -- it must manifest as dis-ease.	1642971264.0	htxebkk	t3_sawfex	t1_htx4ykd	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxebkk/

v8hlw	Theoretically, one key (set of) mechanism(s) which may tie together various theories of depression relates to neuroplasticity. This refers to alteration to the brain's physical structure and functional connectivity in response to the environment. In depression, this ability appears to be suboptimal, particularly in the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus. Growing pre-clinical evidence points to these altered plastic mechanisms as a potential common pathway in the pathophysiology of depression, which may bridge the gaps between evidence for other theories (such as those implicating individual neurotransmitters). For example, it is known that the monoamines functionally interact with mechanisms of what's called glutamate-dependant plasticity, giving a theoretical link between monoamine dysfunction (as described in serotonin and dopamine-based theories of depression), glutamate dysfunction and synaptic plasticity. Similarly, pre-clinical evidence suggests that enhancing plastic mechanisms in the pre-frontal cortex may be a [final common pathway](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26247862/) for the effects of various anti-depressants.  Neuroplasticity is a key function for basically everything the brain does (changing to respond to it's internal and external environment). In terms of human behaviour, cognition and emotion, deficits in plasticity specifically found in the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus (areas known to suffer atrophy and reduced plasticity in depression, as discussed by u/dragonblaz9) have a clear conceptual link to the symptoms of depression, due to their roles in cognitive processes, learning and memory, executive function and the top-down regulation of circuits involved in emotional processing. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7047599/) is a paper discussing the conceptual link between pre-clinical findings on plasticity and the human outcomes of depression.	1642972194.0	htxgsjv	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxgsjv/

But medications are cheap and fast, real therapy takes time and money.  And, incidentally, all people will encounter significant obstacles -- we're not at all sure why one person overcomes the kind of difficulty that flattens another.

9tpbm	Look up "black star" for some relevant information.  Short version, in the early universe where hydrogen was the only abundant element, massive nearly pure hydrogen stars formed.  They were super low temperature because very little fusion relatively speaking was occurring.  Since they were low temperature, they produced very little visible light with most of their emission in the infrared spectrum.  Eventually enough carbon formed to initiate carbon catalyzed fusion resulting in the bright visible light stars we see today.  This is greatly simplified so don't toss it at your physics professor without expecting a lecture.	1642972464.0	htxhhja	t3_s8195s	t3_s8195s	/r/askscience/comments/s8195s/is_it_possible_for_a_star_to_only_output_light/htxhhja/
v8hlw	It's important to remember that the lines we use to delineate different mental disorders are fairly roughly drawn, and our knowledge about the biology of individual disorders is poor (and is often derived from looking at what the mechanism of a successful treatment is). Similarity of symptoms *could* imply overlap between mechanisms - diminished executive function of the pre-frontal cortex being a candidate here, even if the direct pathophysiology isn't the same. That doesn't suggest that chronic depression would lead to ADHD, just that one symptom of chronic depression may resemble one symptom of ADHD due to a similar effect on the efficient function of the pre-frontal cortex.	1642972788.0	htxibsc	t3_sawfex	t1_htwwy0y	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxibsc/

When it decays to nickel-60, with almost 100% probability it populates a specific excited state in nickel-60, which then decays with almost 100% branching fraction through a cascade of two ~ 1 MeV gamma decays.  That's what provides the characteristic gamma rays from a cobalt-60 source, and that happens for many years.	1642973020.0	htxiy3i	t3_sb2l21	t3_sb2l21	/r/askscience/comments/sb2l21/if_the_metastable_state_of_cobalt_has_a_half_life/htxiy3i/

12bt9d	For me I was 'diagnosed' with depression first, spent the best part of a decade going on just about every anti-depressant under the sun with things not really improving overall, only to see someone much later and come to the conclusion that actually it was ADHD. I was depressed because my life was a disaster, I wasn't failing in jobs and in things because I was depressed, I was depressed because I was failing in jobs, projects, relationships and most everything with no solution in sight.     It was a real eye-opener when we found some old school records saying I had dyslexia but no trouble concentrating...followed by pages of reports saying I got no work done unless supervised in every single subject and that I had a 'daydreaming problem' along with my goals being to 'keep track of his possessions' because I was forgetting things on a daily basis. I also found out my parents were told by the then headteacher to not tell me or anyone else about the 'dyslexia' because I would be disadvantaged/labelled if they did, which explained why I got no extra help after primary school. Go figure :')     I often wonder how many people are out there on anti-depressants and other drugs when really they have ADHD because of bad attitudes from professionals back then.	1642973270.0	htxjmh6	t3_sawfex	t1_htx5z5b	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxjmh6/

3c26m	Very basic answer:Anemia causes tissues to become mildly hypoxic. The kidney can sense this and releases erythropoietin, a protein that goes and tells your bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Why? Because red blood cells are what carry oxygen to tissues.   There are tons of different types of anemia though.   There's sickle cell anemia, where you might have normal hemoglobin but your red blood cells are sickle shaped so they don't have the ability to bind oxygen. There are other anemias caused by deformities of the red blood cells as well.   There are anemias of chronic disease, like if you had poor kidney function you wouldn't make enough erythropoietin to maintain a constant level needed to maintain rbc production homeostasis, leading to decreases hemoglobin in the long run.   There are anemias caused by iron, folate, and B12 deficiencies. These are anemias where you are missing certain vital factors in the RBC building, or hemoglobin building, process. Eventually your body stores run out of these things and you fail to make sufficient RBCs, again leading to hypoxia of the tissues.   There are other types as well, but these are very, very basic overviews of some of the most common types.	1642975662.0	htxptsa	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5y5z	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxptsa/

ilows	Increased production of RBCs would be a response to losing cells. The higher turnover is an attempt to counteract whatever it is which is causing the anaemia - it does not really ramp up RBC production until there is enough of a physiological deficit - you are already becoming anaemic - and  the increased production may not be able keep up with the loss of cells.  There are also some specific pathologies which directly overproduce RBCs or make defective RBCs so the physiological signal of insufficient oxygen transport triggers and RBCs are overproduced in response - but this is outside my knowledge base; Red Cell Haematology goes deep.	1642976201.0	htxr7dz	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5y5z	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxr7dz/
f2xb4	While my response is not going to be anywhere near the above, high RBC turnover will contribute to anaemia.   With anaemia being a low level of haemoglobin [Hb] (the protein responsible for oxygen transport in RBCs). This can be because there are a normal amount of RBCs but low Hb in each, or a low amount of RBCs with normal amounts of Hb, both effect O2 carrying capacity of blood.  If your RBCs are structurally defective in one way (sickle cell for example) they are less pliable and unable to squeeze through capillaries and the thin vessels in your spleen. This causes increased breakdown of RBCs, the body will try to compensate by increasing haematopoesis (making red blood cells), but eventually the balance tips as it can't keep up and is unable to keep recycling the building blocks of RBCs.  This type of anaemia is called haemolytic, and also includes thalassaemia (which is a genetic defect in the coding of Hb proteins that cause it to fold funny and clump in RBCs) and a heap more.  There are other types of anaemia which are due to deficiencies (Iron deficiencies, B12 or Folate) and they come under microcytic or macrocytic anaemia due to the sizes of the RBCs when they are made. Iron is important in the making of Hb, and folate and b12 are needed for DNA synthesis.  PS.

uujlg	RBC production can be measured quite accurately using the reticulocyte count on any CBC analyser, rbcs still containing mRNA. Since production is closely related to rbc lifespan, I've wondered if the A1c could be adjusted for time of exposure using the retic count.

qoopp	The most obvious difference between telescopes and microscopes is the size of the objective lens (the lens oppose the ocular lens, where the eye is positioned)  The purpose of the objective lens is to gather and focus the light coming in. Telescopes have a large objective lens because they need to gather as much light as possible to get a clear image of distant objects. A lack of available light isn't a problem for microscopes, so their objective lens tend to be small and focused.	1642976851.0	htxsw32	t3_sb4jbb	t3_sb4jbb	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/htxsw32/

6ntxk	Adding to this: The public understanding of ADHD is still developing. Even today, there is a large contingent of people who refuse to accept that ADHD exists and that by diagnosing and medicating children, we're pathologizing 'kids being kids.' And the different presentations of ADHD may make it appear that something else is happening instead.   I was diagnosed with depression early in my life, and also have ADHD-inattentive. Because the inattentive expression of ADHD was less commonly known, no one (parents, teachers, doctors) ever thought to get me checked for it. I wasn't bouncing off the walls hyper - I don't get hyperactive symptoms - but I'm a textbook case of inattentive ADHD if anyone had known to look for it.   Because I'd already been diagnosed with depression, and there's a lot of overlap in how ADHD-I and depression are expressed outwardly, I didn't even think to get tested until a couple of years ago.   Depression didn't cause my ADHD, but my ADHD looked like, and was often hidden by, my depression.	1642977163.0	htxtp2t	t3_sawfex	t1_htx1tei	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htxtp2t/
iispz	Take an example of a piece of paper, and pretend there is a 2 dimension being that lives on the surface of that piece of paper. This being has the concept of up/down/left/right, but has no concept of forward and backwards and can only see and travel along the surface of that piece of paper.   If we then take that paper and crumple it into a ball, we would be warping that 2D sheet of paper in three dimensions, meaning the 2D creature wouldn't see a change at all, yet by crumpling it into a ball it's world now takes up less 3D space.  Now we live in 3 dimensions, up/down/left/right/forward/backwards and have no concept of higher dimensions since we lack the ability to perceive them. However, just like a 2D surface can be bent or crumpled in 3D space without a 2D creature knowing, a 3D surface can be bent and crumpled in 4D or higher space and we wouldn't notice a difference.	1642977355.0	htxu74g	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htxu74g/

ilows	Pathology occassionally suffers from 'mission creep'; an equivalent of off-label prescribing of pharmaceuticals.   HbA1c is a great example of a functional assay deployed to answer a specific question; Does the testee have a long-term damaging level of glucose in their body. But now the test has become very widely requested to screen relatively healthy patients, curious clinicians are looking at the mass of data and wondering what else it might show.   The paper referenced by u/silentlyscreaming01 above seems to conclude little more than that there is something to see here but the defects they associate with low HbA1c are fairly generic indicators of haematological diseases, anaemia, liver and kidney dysfunction - pathologies affecting RBCs more than glucose metabolism - which amounts to low HbAc being a rather woolly, insensitive and non-specific indicator of indifferent health. If there are clinical symptoms to trace then there are better tests and without, a low HbA1c is not selective enough to be the basis of a course of action.  I believe that there could be a benefit - possible a world altering benefit - in expanding on this as a data-mining exercise. Pathological testing is increasing at a near exponential rate and there is a LOT of data, all stored digitally, these days. If the privacy ethics would allow it, sending all known pathology test data and associated clinical notes on diagnoses and outcomes, to an enormous machine learning application to find multivariate links between a dozen, apparently random test results and, say, a particular cause of death could show new methods for early diagnosis, successful treatments and useful targets for population-wide well-person screening programmes.  We might not be able to cure you but we'd get much better at telling how and why, and when you're going to die.	1642978353.0	htxwvlr	t3_saxb1r	t1_htwvh05	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htxwvlr/

My sense is that there’s not a consensus on what causes low A1c values in people without diabetes, and not all of the causes are necessarily bad.

98vkc	How far we can zoom in with light microscopy used to be limited mostly on the hardware when we first started using them. Requiring multiple high quality lenses and not having everything optimized limited what we could and couldn't see.  With modern technology our optical microscopes are mostly limited by the physical nature of light. The wavelength of visible light is 400-700 nm. Your resolution limitation due to diffraction is therefore closely related to that wavelength and is approximately half that. With the best microscopes we can't discern individual objects smaller than approximately 250 nm. An atom is 0.03-0.3 nm and we therefore can't see an atom with microscopes. I don't know much about telescopes, but as long as a machine uses the visible light spectrum to image something it will run into the same problems with the laws of physics.  That is optical with visible light though! There are other microscope techniques that will be able to show you a lot more in detail on small scales. Scanning/Transmission electron microscopy as examples. They use electron sources and the sample will either backscatter the electron, give secondary electrons or the electrons can be transmitted which we can detect and form an image with. Modern top of the art scanning electron microscopes (SEM) under optimal conditions can have a resolution slightly above 1nm, just not enough to show us individual atoms. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is able to show us atoms.	1642978674.0	htxxq2h	t3_sb4jbb	t3_sb4jbb	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/htxxq2h/

Speaking of absurd strawmen:  > Does Michael Jordan have a PhD in Physics because of his perfectly tuned fadeaway jumper?   Computers can do calculus, but they aren't conscious and don't hold PhDs in physics. It doesn't matter if the computer was programmed by humans, or trained itself iteratively with machine learning, or if the brain arrived it its solution through millions of years of evolution. It doesn't matter if it's computing consciously or instinctively or if it can show its work. It's still doing calculus or a functional approximation thereof.

zobel	I am a physician and this is a somewhat misinformed comment.  People have been using continuous insulin infusion pumps for decades and there have been studies on this for just as long, particularly with diabetic retinopathy.    The pathophysiology isn't well understood but the data shows it showing up mostly in patients with long standing severe hypoglycemia over decades so there is some thought on osmotic gradients.  This is not my field of study so I can't confidently elaborate more.  Now to the practical application.  Despite small but significant paradoxical increases in some complications, overall mortality and morbidity decrease on a greater scale. From a weighed risk perspective prioritizing decreasing the A1c is the target to help prevent microvascular effects of diabetes.   Secondly, "rapid" is a shifting target with studies showing some of these effects with a decrease of only 1.5 over as long as 2 years(literally what I see with type 2 patients started on a single oral agent and compliant with diet and exercise over 6 months on average).  There is no evidence that any decrease over any period of time is "safe".  Lastly, as I alluded to earlier, CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) and CSII are not the same.  CGM when paired with a CSII pump have been shown to decrease glucose variability that more recent studies have shown to be a larger culprit in diabetic retinopathy and also implicated blood pressure as a modifying factor.  All in all, CGMs at least according to the data we have now attenuate the risks of glucose variability and hypoglycemia that CSII with finger glucose checks was often plagued with.    Its all evolving science but the information that we have now does not point to or justify any "slow" improvement of A1c.	1642980895.0	hty3o8m	t3_saxb1r	t1_htwyi8u	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hty3o8m/

There are also non hormonal medications that alleviate symptoms of menopause which are great for women who can’t or don’t want to take HRT.	1642985915.0	htyfuue	t3_sas6ch	t1_htyc05s	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htyfuue/

i5zr9	"A point reduces the force and the velocity." The point doesn't reduce the force. As you said, it reduces the velocity. Or as zeraul98 said, it reduces the torque.  For example, lets say you had a "top" that weighed 3 N (I put "top" in quotes because this is going to make a very poor top). Now instead of a single point, say it has 3 points (or feet if you prefer) arranged symmetrically about the center of the top. With this arrangement, each point will have 1 N of force on it. If the sliding coefficient of friction is 0.5, then each point will have a 1/2 N frictional force.\* It doesn't matter how far from the center of the top the points are -- 1 mm, 10 mm or 100 mm -- the frictional force will be the same.   The torque will be different, and the velocity will be different (for the same RPM), and the distance traveled per revolution will be different. But these are basically 3 different ways of describing the same physical situation.  \* Note: For simplicity, I'm ignoring the fact that at any significant rotation speed, a top with 3 contact points will likely wobble a lot with only one point touching a lot of the time. That's a different topic.	1642988996.0	htyn81s	t3_sa97gz	t1_htxkhcx	/r/askscience/comments/sa97gz/if_surface_area_doesnt_affect_friction_why_do/htyn81s/

11i323	Yeah menopause isn’t caused by a running out of eggs, menopausal women still have eggs. You are born with 1-3 million eggs, and you don’t live anywhere close to 1-3 million months. It’s caused by the aging of the ovaries that result in them basically malfunctioning. You can also go through menopause from a lack of access to nutrition. That isn’t going to affect the number of eggs you have, just how many resources your body has to upkeep your ovaries.	1642990744.0	htyre0e	t3_sas6ch	t1_htwqqxp	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/htyre0e/

kxz8j	I would like to point out some problems with using A1C as a metric for blood sugar stability.  Some people have longer living red blood cells and can measure on an A1C test at over 7.0 but not have any blood sugar issues.  We would tell a type 1 diabetic that anyone see a 5.5 is perfect and it correlates to an average blood sugar of 100.  However if the person spent 40% of the time with a blood sugar of 50 and 40% of the time with a blood sugar of 160 and 20% of the time at 100, A1C would still be 5.5, but they would have spent 1,700 hours out of a healthy blood sugar range and permanently damaging their organs.  A person who is chronically hovering around 120 blood sugar would end up with an A1C of 6.6 but be healthier than the first person because they are maintaining stability in a decent range even if that range is a little higher than optimal.  I have personal experience seeing the first one happen on multiple occasions.  While A1C can certainly be a tool for trends it's like BMI, and especially for type 1 diabetes not a very useful metric anymore.  I find this important as type 1s get the shaft in the world where whenever we use the word diabetes we automatically mean type 2 and they are two completely different things that just end up with the same results if ignored.	1642993039.0	htyx6uy	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5hl6	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htyx6uy/

Over about 5 years eating more and more dairy, I found I had effectively stopped being intolerant and was able to eat pretty much any dairy in any quantity. Later, I dated a vegan, and within about 6 months, I had gone back to complete intolerance. From what I've read and understand, I had built up enough lactose-eating gut bacteria and that was making things work out.

That's why their test model is in at least a partial vaccuum chamber, and it really needs to be full vacuum if they ever tried it at the actual speeds.  Even if it could be outdoors, a launch failure would be like if you took the main gun on a battleship and spun it around in a circle at 20 revs per second and then fired a shot off in a random direction. Not only could this easily obliterate the command center they put so conveniently next door, but could also pose a danger to anything in a 20 mile radius.  As a engineer, all I see immediately are the myriad of failure points, especially with repeated use, for an unimpressive design.

However, it’s important to note that diet, vitamins and supplements are very closely related to socioeconomic status.

This is a form of problem solving called insight, which involves frame shifting and abstract connection that breaks free of fixation. Fear and certain negative mindsets increase frame fixation, which would limit your resources to solve complicated obstacles. This doesn’t directly answer your question, but as this is a multi-factorial issue, this is certainly a contributing factor.	1643000754.0	htze0fj	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htze0fj/

It is common for patients to change their diet for the day of the visit.  Diabetes is a difficult disease to manage and good control depends on a lot factors, many of which are difficult for patients to control such as insulin resistance, consistent access to medication, slow adjustments to blood sugar from insulin, life-style restrictions... some are certainly at least partially within the control of patients but no doctor should be scolding patients for "eating too much" if the patient's blood sugar is high.	1643001239.0	htzevpf	t3_saxb1r	t1_htx5hl6	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/htzevpf/
2rrgnwlb	Core rot is caused by a number of fungi, including species from Alternaria, Stemphylium, Cladosporium, Uloctadium, Epicoccum, Coniothyrium, and Pleospora, with Alternaria spp. molds being the most common. Fungal spores will land on the senescing blossom, and during fruit growth and maturation, will begin to take root. Core rot appears to be more prevalent during intensive anti-fungal fumigation. High relative moisture, mild temperatures, and tissue susceptibility are factors that increase core rot incidence. Once inside the fruit, the fungi are protected from fungicides.

For this reason, anti-inflammatories can offer short term depressive relief, while things that promote systemic inflammation can also induce depression-like symptoms in the brain (some auto-immune conditions, or poor diet, lack of exercise).	1643001864.0	htzfznt	t3_sawfex	t1_htwtkah	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htzfznt/

8qq9axh9	> The thing is,  dinosaurs were already on the way out.  Diversity had plummeted by the late cretacious.   There is no cut and dry stance on this issue, and for every paper you can find on declining dinosaur populations, there is one on a lack of decline or about how communities were thriving right up until the K-Pg boundary, eg. [Lloyd et al, 2008](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2008.0715); [Chiarenza et al, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08997-2?fbclid=IwAR1imfAOP8_7xjIVGAf7z_X1MvvRfx0TSyHS4uP_FnPFFzw_tg0z_GgVpf0); or [Bonsor et al, 2020](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.201195). There does seem to be evidence out there for a decline in **some** populations, but certainly not all, and it’s difficult to say whether apparent declines are real or the side effects of the particular way we are counting things — whether that be via faulty statistical analyses, sampling biases, or the paucity of the fossil record.   > The dekkan traps had been going off for like a million years causing major ocean acidification and climate change.  Again, the jury is still out on how the Deccan Traps eruptions affected the Earth system and to what extent. A million years prior to the K-Pg boundary is a bit off though; those in favour of the Deccan Traps being a major contributor to the extinction put eruptions in the initial pulse tens of thousands of years prior to the boundary, maybe half a million years at absolute most. Then there are those who say that the most significant pulses took place *after* the K-Pg boundary. The main sticking point here persists because the two best geochronology studies on the exact timing of the eruptions use different approaches — one U-Pb and one Ar-Ar — and they have different interpretations, which are nicely summarised [here.](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/823313)	1643003159.0	htzi9b7	t3_s8cd4m	t1_htjtx2c	/r/askscience/comments/s8cd4m/after_the_kt_extinction_how_did_the_survivors/htzi9b7/

So aside from finding specific studies that say X or Y, there's not a lot of concrete and confirmed findings.   Some studies isolate specific chemicals like THC rather than utilize the whole flower/bud.   There's a lot more chemicals in marijuana than just THC. Again, not enough studies or research.    Some studies only focus on younger people and have shown results that it impacts development.   Other studies focus on adults and show positive effects.

a4fbm	The temperature referred to is the air temperature. There are a number of complications in properly measuring it. If you measure in direct sunlight, you'll get higher values than in the shade and certain materials and objects tend to heat up more easily than others, which means that a thermometer may show different values depending on where it is close to. For example, concrete retains heat better than soil, which means that cities are often hotter than fields.  To deal with all these factors, temperature measurements for weather reporting and forecasting have to follow a set of rules. For one, the thermometer should be at some distance from any buildings or other man-made objects. In addition, the thermometer should be shielded against direct sunlight. This is achieved by placing the thermometer in a white box with slits for air circulation, which is called a Stevenson screen.  The Stevenson screen allows air to flow through it, while keeping the influence of sunlight to a minimum. The white coat of paint helps reflect any sunlight. This box is then placed at a small height (1-2 meter) above the ground in an open area, away from buildings. And doing this gives meteorologists the best temperature reading to use in weather reports and forecasts.  The forecasts themselves start by gathering as much weather data as possible: temperature, air pressure, humidity, etc... Ideally from as many weather stations and things like weather balloons as possible. All this data is fed into computer models that apply the laws of physics to how air and heat move around to come up with a prediction of how things develop over time. From the outcome of such models, weather forecasts can take key information such as temperature, cloud cover, wind, etc...	1643009662.0	htzs3q8	t3_sb9wxd	t3_sb9wxd	/r/askscience/comments/sb9wxd/when_we_hear_about_the_temperature_in_weather/htzs3q8/

it7xmukc	Some of my situation is similar to u/ryan30z: refractory, atypical childhood ongoing depression, diagnosis as an adult of ADD (no hyperactive component), hypnagogia (violently acting out in sleep, unrelated to sleepwalking), high IQ, and very creative. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved ineffective and in a couple of meds, even dangerous.  Treatment is now centered around Emsam (12mg selegiline patch), which mitigates both depression and hypnagogia. After problems with ADD drugs, I've returned to self-medicating with prodigious amounts of caffeine to concentrate and sleep, and consider ADD not a handicap but a superpower for creativity.  Happy to share more if anyone is interested.	1643012240.0	htzvij9	t3_sawfex	t1_htx5z5b	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/htzvij9/

n27na	> Does the theory rely on those extra dimensions being curled up, or is it agnostic to their shape and we just say that if they exist they must be curled up because we can't perceive them? > > Also, what are their predicted circumferences? All the same?  There are several perspectives you can make your calculations from in string theory, two of these perspectives we can call "world-sheet" and "spacetime" perspectives. The "world-sheet" perspective in one where we consider the physics *on* the string, as it is (what is called) embedded in a spacetime, it is also known as an "intrinsic" point of view from the string perspective. In the calculation that gives rise to `D=10` (spacetime dimension (1 time + 9 space)) in string theory is done from this point of view. Meaning string theory tells you, if you want the physics *on* the string to make sense, the spacetime it is embedded into has to be 10 dimensions.  What shape/size are they? The "intrinsic" picture is one where you are very local in spacetime, meaning you only see the immediate surroundings, sort of similar to how you on earth has a hard time seeing the curvature on the earth from the small local part of the earth you can observe. For the string, this picture does not reveal much information about the shape/size of the surrounding space at all (not nothing, but also not too much).  What is common to do, is to then switch picture: OK, world-sheet physics says `D=10`, then at least the spacetime picture must have `D=10`. Then you ask: what shapes and sizes makes sense (~gives some physics like the one we perceive), and why? What you start to notice in such research is that some shapes (+ "ingredients", such as fluxes and branes, that the world-sheet picture also tells us about), are unstable (meaning if you freeze time, construct this shape, and again let time go on, the shape will change), has bad singularities and so on. Doing this one have built up a large set of rules, "this goes with that, under these circumstances, to produce such-and-such shapes and sizes".  These rules have varying amounts of evidence, and extrapolating these rules may often fail. In the community today there are people who both claim that these rules are extremely predictive, when it comes to size/shape, and others that say they do not predict much at all (again, when it comes to size/shape, which leads to other types of predictions, like a "landscape" of possible universes).	1643013021.0	htzwicl	t3_sar7af	t1_htx4c10	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/htzwicl/
u63ch	Going low is still dangerous - 40 is certainly way too low. My record low was recorded at 28 about 10 minutes after I consumed everything I could find with sugar in it. It was the first time I had a low that felt like I was going to die. DKA came much closer to killing me and I felt dine. As you get used to your t1 you'll learn how your body reacts and how much to trust it. Some people can't feel lows at all, for example. Come join us on the t1 sub - there's a lot of people over there sharing tons of info where they can and helping each other out.

it7xmukc	Until the ADD diagnosis, I'd self-medicated with caffeine– I consume prodigious quantities of caffeine to concentrate and sleep. Unfortunately, Adderall made me drowsy and Ritalin made me jittery at unpredictable times, so I returned to large doses of caffeine.Similar to u/Ryan30z, I wasn't diagnosed with ADD until well into adulthood. (My physicians use 'ADD' because I do NOT have the hyperactive component.)Like others, I have a high IQ and am very creative in multiple fields. I began to think of ADD as a creative superpower, which helped me deal with it.Since childhood, I've been plagued with refractory atypical depression. SSRIs, SNRIs, and TCAs proved either ineffective or outright dangerous.• Effexor® venlafaxine (extreme splitting headaches and weird popping sounds)• Lexapro® escitalopram oxalate (severe suicide ideation)• Remeron® mirtazapine (red splotches over body, MD doubled dose resulting in full-blown gout)There was some thought a reverse-MAOI might work, but none were available in North America.The clinical trial of Emsam (12mg selegiline patch) worked wonders… until the trial ended. Without the medication, depression set in.And so did acting out in my sleep, a type of hypnagogia unrelated to sleepwalking. The muscle inhibition from REM atonia had broken down. I punched, kicked, and leaped in my sleep. I was afraid of hurting my girlfriend, but I actually injured myself my eye striking the corner of a table. I mention this for a reason…My insurance company helped locate a psychiatrist knowledgeable about Emsam and willing to prescribe it. The malaise of depression begin to lift… and the hypnagogia began to fade. Selegiline was treating both… or possibly the depression and hypnagogian were related.Forgive me if I hijacked the thread. I merely hope others may benefit.	1643017144.0	hu01jh7	t3_sawfex	t1_htzvyus	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu01jh7/

rk1og	Not on a wide scale, no.   There are a few types of tests:  Antigen and PCR tests used to specifically look for the presence of covid proteins or RNA, respectively.   Covid PCR based sequencing test used to specifically amplify up the covid genome, and sequence it to determine which variant it is.  Respiratory viral infection panel sequencing tests, used to sequence multiple viruses including covid. This can find presence/absence of a number of viruses, and determine variants. It is however not widely used compared to the ones above.  So there’s some data on other viruses coming from covid tests, but overall not much because the diagnostic tests are primarily the ones specifically looking at covid, not the panel.	1643017449.0	hu01weg	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu01weg/

y9ybd	Thanks for sharing friend! I’ll look up Emsam. I’ve tried around 10 different medications for depression, anxiety and anti-psychotic (my old psych thought I was going Schizo, due to my Depersonalization which is as wrong as it gets).  I’m really hoping, IF I am actually ADHD, that, first of all, I will get to try ADHD medication, and then that ADHD medication will actually help. It’s different for everybody.   As you said, ADHD is more of a weird superpower than an illness. It’s not confirmed, only theorised, but I somewhat believe in the hunter/gatherer hypothesis that ADHD was an advantage back then. Not to mention creativity. Sort of like being superman but unfortunately our whole modern life is kryptonite, so we are reduced to a wreck.	1643018876.0	hu03l7d	t3_sawfex	t1_hu01jh7	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu03l7d/

r4b7r	Unfortunately, in many countries psilocybin is illegal, regardless of possession, use, cultivation, etc… I do not condone, or advocate, any activity that could land you in jail.  However, if you live in the U.S. it is technically legal (minus a couple states) to purchase magic mushroom *spores*. Emphasis on spores, since studying them as an amateur mycologist is totally fine but growing the mushrooms (cultivation) is illegal. Not that it doesn’t stop people from doing so anyway.  /r/sporetraders and /r/shrooms have fairly dedicated communities if “studying spores” is for you. There are other ways of procuring magic mushrooms for recreational use, all of which are illegal in most parts of the world.	1643019996.0	hu04y1b	t3_sawfex	t1_hu02s8q	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu04y1b/

gypkr	A wire is more like a perfectly flexible drive shaft that connects the power source to the power sink. Imagine you hold a saw at the end of a long metal pole. If you wiggle the other end back and forth you can cut through something. There's no net movement in the pole, but your arm is doing work, this energy is being transmitted by the pole and being spent cutting the wood. The harder the wood is to saw, the harder you have to push at your end.   This would also be the case if rather than a pole, you had a hydrolic plunger (dunno the right name!) and a hydrolic piston.	1643020844.0	hu0609f	t3_saldgr	t3_saldgr	/r/askscience/comments/saldgr/in_alternating_current_how_is_electricity_carried/hu0609f/

g1e6b	One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is that depression is known to play absolute havoc with the body's sleep cycle, disrupting how long one spends in the different stages of sleep and in what order one experiences them. One major issue is that people with depression arrive at the REM sleep phase earlier than those without, and remain in that phase for much longer. REM sleep is believed to be involved in emotional memory processing, problem solving etc so it makes sense that people with depression would get 'stuck' in that phase for longer than people without - but the problem is, it means that they spend less time in all the other stages of sleep, and those stages are responsible for a whole host of vital "housekeeping" of both brain and body.  So essentially, even though people with depression tend to sleep more than others, they are also missing out on some important stages of sleep for general mind and body 'upkeep', because their brains are spending huge proportions of sleep-time in one particular phase and letting other phases go by the wayside as a result.	1643021893.0	hu07bpl	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu07bpl/

snpmb7k	It's both, but any one telescope is only designed to capture one part of the spectrum.   A classic optical telescope is a long tube with lenses in it, because light is bent and focused by those lenses.  A radio telescope has no glass lenses in it, because radio waves go right through them. Instead, a radio telescope looks like a big radar dish, or more commonly a big field of radio dishes.   X-ray telescopes do have glass lenses, but their geometry is very different than optical telescopes. X-rays are so high energy they don't bend and focus the way light beams do, so instead x-ray optics tend to use shallow angles to nudge the x-rays onto a detector. Think of a bullet following a curved wall.	1643031019.0	hu0lh7z	t3_sb4jbb	t1_htxwn5t	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/hu0lh7z/

1hgxkqcz	> If the privacy ethics would allow it, sending all known pathology test data and associated clinical notes on diagnoses and outcomes  Wow- since I generally have worked for tech companies where data is currency I just kind of assumed this was happening without giving it a thought. Now that you've said it out loud I realize its not, and thats a goddamn shame.  The data available and resulting research would be worth whatever was required to anonymize the data and publish it. It absolutely could be done in a way that preserves privacy - and the value would _easily_ pay for any oversight and management required. The only (huge) stumbling block would be public opinion, and since that apparently can't be reasoned with or swayed with facts, I feel like this probably will never happen. Or if it does it'll be some end run around patient data and HIPPA that will be more invasive and less useful than an explicit law.	1643032361.0	hu0o4z8	t3_saxb1r	t1_htxwvlr	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0o4z8/

Have you never had days where everything went your way and life was good and you were definitely upbeat? And then a day when you couldn't do anything right and nothing turned out as you expected so you felt the world was closing in and you were all alone? What happens to your creativity and ability to find solutions if you are "in a funk" and just want to stay in bed? Some folks are born optimists and it's easier for them to stay on an even keel. Those who are the opposite have a tough time. They always see the thorns and the weeds in the garden and never the flowers. There are meds for those who are clinically depressed which help. I have a friend who was clinically depressed for years so that's how I know meds help. Why people are as they are is embedded in their DNA and they have their parents to curse or bless for it.  I don't know if it is possible to change the wiring though it can be masked with help.	1643033494.0	hu0qhni	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu0qhni/

As others have pointed out there are better standard CBC/LFT tests for RBC turnover (Hb, MCV, Bilirubin). If these are normal, then your low HbA1c could be a normal anomaly.  Some people have mutations in their RBC proteins that render these proteins less likely to be glycalalated, for example.  However, if you *are* experiencing symptoms of hypoglycaemia in your day to day life, then I recommend further investigations, like checking glucagon levels and screening for an insulinoma.	1643034465.0	hu0slc6	t3_saxb1r	t1_htxw8tu	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0slc6/

Hyperglycemia is a chronic issue (although if it gets high enough it can become an emergency if it doesn't come down or causes diabetic ketoacidosis.) Hypoglycemia is pretty much always an emergency.    My mom is a brittle t1 diabetic and we have lots of trouble with lows (and highs) but things are a lot less stressful now that she has one of those continuous blood sugar monitors.     Bad lows at night can cause t1s* to die in your sleep.      *I assume it also effects anyone who is insulin dependent but the insulin dependent t2s I know say they never have this issue unless they accidentally overcorrect.	1643034473.0	hu0slyf	t3_saxb1r	t1_htwyr3b	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0slyf/

I think flagging pre-diabetics is probably one of the best use cases of the HbA1c test.  If you’re pre-diabetic and implement good lifestyle modifications, you can push back the diabetes diagnosis by up to 10 years!

All you need is a surface that reflects as much sunlight as possible (white paint does the job) that covers the sensor and as much airflow past the sensor as possible to ensure that the sensor is measuring outside air and not air that's been sitting in the enclosure.  From a quick glance at a picture of that device, it seems to have something in place around the temperature sensor. So it should work quite well.  From my personal experience, I've found that leaving the temperature sensor in direct sunlight completely negates its usefulness. Except perhaps as a makeshift light sensor. The measured temperature spikes will beyond the actual air temperature once sunlight hits the sensor directly.  What can also play a role is any heat produced by electronics near the sensor. I've had an experiment with a temperature sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi (a low cost, low power small computer board) and while the Pi has a power consumption low enough to not require any cooling on the chip, it was able to affect the temperature measurements of the sensor connected to it unless I moved the sensor further away.  Doing proper temperature measurements of the air is quite difficult. Fortunately, for most people, the purpose of the measurement is typically along the lines of "Is it nice enough weather to go outside?" and they don't need scientific accuracy.	1643035506.0	hu0uxfe	t3_sb9wxd	t1_hu0pa5q	/r/askscience/comments/sb9wxd/when_we_hear_about_the_temperature_in_weather/hu0uxfe/
gekpw	We’ll never be able to achieve the pressures in the core of the sun in a terrestrial reactor. And such high pressures aren’t necessary anyway.  The thermonuclear reaction rate has a much stronger dependence on temperature than on pressure. It’s linear in the density, which is proportional to the pressure, with fixed temperature. But it’s generally some power law in the temperature, so ~ T^(p), where p is some fairly large positive power.  So your plasma can be at a much smaller pressure, but a moderately larger temperature, and still get the same reaction rate per particle as you’d have with a stellar temperature and pressure.	1643035555.0	hu0v1km	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu0v1km/

5lzlc	Just a mild correction, sickle cell disorder is actually due to a genetic mutation of the hemoglobin protein (HgbS). You have to inherit two HgbS genes from your parents, though it is possible to get just one bad copy and be a carrier with no symptoms. There are other HgB proteins as well, like fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)  produced when you are a baby with I believe a higher oxygen affinity. There are interesting new stem cell therapies to "remove the block" allowing sickle cell pts to produce HgbF again thereby reducing how much sickle hemoglobin they produce and improving their oxygen carrying capacity, basically turning them from sickle cell disease to more of a carrier phenotype.	1643036512.0	hu0x9o3	t3_saxb1r	t1_htxptsa	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0x9o3/
a6u8sfyd	What do you need to do planning?  First, you have to believe there's a point to it.  second, you need the mental energy to work out the details, puzzle out the problems.  You need to have a sense that there's a point to distinguishing between good choices and bad choices.  You need a sense that there are better possibilities.  A person in depression may lack motivation, lack energy, lack a sense that their actions are meaningful.  So, what would we be looking at?  Dopamine system for one, as it's centered on seeking behavior.  Limbic system, as it affects our moods.  Memory systems, as the depressive response, both traumatic and chronic, can be centered on memories and traumatic situations that are dwelled upon in excess.  We could also look at the prefrontal cortex, particularly the medial portions, which are involved in planning, in emotional responses.  Take this as an amateur neuroscience nerd's speculation.	1643036553.0	hu0xd4a	t3_sawfex	t3_sawfex	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu0xd4a/

ig34j	> I was just wondering what the Hubble would see if we inverted it as a microscope instead of a telescope.   It can't. Most telescopes we use are not lens-based but mirror-based. So you don't focus light using lens, but rather you have a bunch of mirrors which focus the light. The advantage is that lens has to be supported from the "edge" and this is very impractical for big and heavy lenses because they would "sag" and bend. Mirror can be easily supported from behind, which allows for construction of gigantic mirrors (there are some 30-40m mirror telescopes in construction right now).  So in case of such telescopes there is no way to "flip" it.	1643037446.0	hu0zhk3	t3_sb4jbb	t3_sb4jbb	/r/askscience/comments/sb4jbb/are_microscopes_and_telescopes_the_same_thing/hu0zhk3/

y5jls	I think your doctor would probably just try to closely monitor you. 5.4 isnt THAT far off from 5.7 and a higher fasting isn't great.  From a1c charts the "average" blood sugar for 5.4 is 115, the average for 5.7 is 126, so while they're not the same, they're closer than I thought they were.    Prediabetes is kinda a sign that says "please try to turn back before this gets worse!"    My doctor would probably tell me to work on myself as if I had prediabetes with the info you have given even if he didn't note down "prediabetes" in his chart, but I have family history and a hormonal disorder that makes me more insulin resistant so we likely aren't the same.    What did your doctor say about it? This is something they can answer better than we can.    They could order one of those tests where you drink something sweet and they monitor you to have a more accurate look. If I were you, I might ask if they want to order that so you could have a better idea one way or another.	1643037584.0	hu0ztmw	t3_saxb1r	t1_hu05oos	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu0ztmw/

8ds2uzku	No. When a vacuum forms like that it’s called cavitation which requires a truly sudden impulse to overcome the stickiness of the fluid to the object at their boundary.   But the idea isn’t without precedent. Interestingly for those studying Aristotle’s book physics (antiquity, renaissance) they thought that an object can only be moved by a contact force, meaning the cause of any velocity was attributed to sustained contact. The vacuum behind a thrown object and the fact that nature abhors a vacuum were invoked as the cause of of a thrown object’s continued movement. They went to such a length describing it because they hadn’t yet scientifically grasped inertia	1643038352.0	hu11qlh	t3_sbehp5	t3_sbehp5	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu11qlh/
4p7299hp	A turbulent low-pressure region may arise if the flow detaches from the surface of the object at the back. This results in something called form or pressure drag. This is also why golf balls have dimples. They cause turbulent flow over the surface which is less prone to flow separation and with that reduces the form drag a golf ball experiences.	1643038379.0	hu11syv	t3_sbehp5	t3_sbehp5	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu11syv/

yue6s	That's not how fruit storage is accomplished. Nobody freezes fruit intended to be sold fresh. They are kept at relatively low temperatures, but they're in an atmosphere-controlled storage chamber (I believe the air is mostly nitrogen). Those conditions greatly extend shelf life since there is little in the atmosphere to which the fruit can react and degrade. I believe ethylene offgassings are also removed from the atmosphere for the same reason.	1643038497.0	hu123l9	t3_sba8bm	t1_hu119bo	/r/askscience/comments/sba8bm/why_do_apples_start_to_go_bad_around_their_cores/hu123l9/
em4rp	Okay, to clarify: The term 'birthday apple' implies that they are specifically advertising '1 year old apples' for the very quality of being (exactly? approximately?) '1 year old'. That sounded like there was some supposed benefit.  Also if they are specifically selling 1-year-old apples, that would mean they would be selling last years season fruit *in the next season*... so any 'freeze to preserve for off-season' shouldn't work here (unless it's a '1 year (+-6 months)' thing).	1643038866.0	hu130y1	t3_sba8bm	t1_hu119bo	/r/askscience/comments/sba8bm/why_do_apples_start_to_go_bad_around_their_cores/hu130y1/

The power output is a few hundred watts per cubic metre in the solar core; the sun owes its enormous total power to its enormous volume.

I was going to comment something similar, all the publicly available research and tone of doctors communication is so rudimentary and full of half baked explanations. I have read and heard from multiple sources that the common complications from poorly managed hyperglycemia were from something to the effect of “glucose molecules clogging up small blood vessels”. Which always felt a little off based on the scale difference of a red blood cell that routinely passes through these areas and a singular glucose molecule (or thousands of glucose molecules for that matter).  That the glycation of proteins that weakens/prevents their normal function in the common problem areas is the reason for most diabetic complications was eye-opening and, strangely, motivating to keep working hard to maintain good levels.	1643039983.0	hu15wjw	t3_saxb1r	t1_hty46o7	/r/askscience/comments/saxb1r/why_is_the_hazardmortality_ratio_for_hba1c_higher/hu15wjw/
4bzt1zdh	Yes there are a number of factors that affect sound propigation:  as a constant the speed of sound is calculated at 1500 meters per second. .   Temperature, pressure, and salinity are the 3 primary factors in relation to SONAR. And increas or decrease in any of these areas will affect the speed of sound up or down.   Depth is the primary constant and at a sertain point around  3000 meters below sea level. Surface Sound is curved back up. This  produced a cool affect called a convergence zone. A sound source can have multiple convergence zones at increasing and calculatable ranges . Allowing for extreme detection ranges to be achieved.	1643039985.0	hu15wqf	t3_sbhzwe	t3_sbhzwe	/r/askscience/comments/sbhzwe/do_sound_waves_move_faster_or_slower_depending_on/hu15wqf/
smbs4ln	It’s only in the last couple of years that there is any inkling of general tests being available.  You’ve heard of Theranos. Back before they were outed as a scam, what they were promising was science fiction come to life.  Any tests that we have no that are multipurpose are very limited. They’re 3 different tests that just happen to not interfere with one another and also are useful together. Sort of like MMR vaccines. 3 diseases that are common and the vaccines don’t mess with the others.   Now, there’s a company called Grail with a product going through trials, but is also so promising that the UK government has paid for over 100k people to participate, that can detect from a single blood test 50 of the most common types of cancers. The idea is that you get this done at your annual physical at the same time as the blood draw to test your cholesterol levels. This test uses DNA sequencing and can’t detect things like chemical imbalances or viral infection at the same time. It’s literally just doing a bunch of sequences of the same person’s blood at once and the comparing the results. Remember, cancer is your cells with your DNA. Illumina’s sequencers that they use can sequence several thousand different individual’s genomes in one go, so I’m pretty sure they just put one person’s DNA on the whole test slide and then compare it all.	1643040048.0	hu162ju	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu162ju/
b1qa0x96	>No. When a vacuum forms like that it’s called cavitation   So ... yes then, right? Given enough speed the pressure behind the object will drop so much that the liquid will start boiling, producing bubbles. It would seem a natural extension of this fact that by further increasing the speed you can produce arbitrarily low pressure behind the object.	1643040094.0	hu166wd	t3_sbehp5	t1_hu11qlh	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu166wd/

q81tq	The plasma needs to be millions of degrees hot to get fusion (~100 million C or F for practical applications). No container stays intact at that temperature. The Sun doesn't need a container, its material stays together from the gravitational attraction of all the material. We can't use that on Earth. We use magnetic fields to contain the plasma, with a vacuum between the plasma and the reactor wall. The pressure in the plasma is pretty moderate so the density of the plasma itself is very low (it's still a pretty good vacuum compared to the atmosphere), but Earth's fusion reactors are hotter than the core of the Sun and use fuels that fuse easier. It's a different environment in almost every aspect.	1643040188.0	hu16fja	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu16fja/

si3mq	Definitely! I’m sure both factors have contributed. I’m guessing we will see more research on this soon since the 1st pandemic babies are now toddlers. In the particular study I was referring to, maternal stress was suspected because the babies born at the end of 2020 seemed to be more impacted than those babies born mid 2020. Both were born during the pandemic but the biggest difference was what stage of pregnancy the mother was in when the pandemic hit. Those past the 1st trimester when the pandemic started seemed to be a bit better off.	1643040474.0	hu1760l	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu0yp2e	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1760l/
12xxw6	Thank you, and no offense taken.  Menopause is kind of like puberty in reverse. Remember puberty with your friends? One started shaving first, another got breasts first, and a third got her period first. What goes first, second, third for any woman is as individual as the woman herself. Family history will provide tendencies, but no absolutes.  I just got a flashback to a commercial Sophia Vergara did when she's breezing through a room with a womens clothing designer drawing up his next creation and she playfully admonishes him, "No straight lines!"

5dm61war	In fact, researchers have found that having a higher body mass index (BMI) predicts a later menopause. One large British study found that eating oily fish and fresh legumes delayed menopause by several years.-  How much the new procedure will delay the menopause depends on the age when the tissue is taken and when it is put back. Tissue taken from a 25-year-old might postpone the menopause for 20 years, while that taken from a 40-year-old might only delay its onset for five years.  INTERNET  So   healthy diet and  habits may help in delaying menopause.	1643040631.0	hu17klo	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/hu17klo/

5dm61war	Both pregnancy and breastfeeding might delay menopause by temporarily halting monthly ovulation cycles to release eggs, Langton said by email. Women are born with a set number of eggs, and depletion of this egg supply contributes to the end of menstruation and the start of menopause.  Compared to women who had never been pregnant or who had been pregnant for less than six months, women who had one full-term pregnancy had an 8% lower risk of early menopause. Those who had two pregnancies had a 16% lower risk, and those who had three pregnancies had a 22% lower risk.	1643040772.0	hu17xuh	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/hu17xuh/

16qcpz	Pressure versus temperature is much of a muchness, but one way of looking at it is that stellar core pressure is not really the direct cause of fusion -- it leads to high temperature and high temperature is the cause.  Basically, inasmuch as temperature is a way of talking about how fast particles are zooming around, high temperatures are what make atomic nucleii bonk together hard enough to fuse.  If it were "just" pressure (if that were somehow possible without also getting high termperatures), you would eventually end up with something like a neutron star -- super compacted atomic matter just sitting there, chilling.  So for us on Earth, trying to ignite nuclear fusion artificially, a high-pressure mechanism is just one of many possible ways to achieve the high temperatures we want.  And it turns out it's not very efficient compared to other ways of getting to a high temperature.  So we mostly focus on those other ways.	1643041998.0	hu1b42q	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu1b42q/

3hmuyesw	It's the other way around. You can imagine L4+5 as the (relatively) flat tops of gravitational hills while L1-3 are local valleys. The thing is, minor disturbances can kick something out of the L1-3 valleys and into the main bodies gravitational well, while objects can quite happily roll around the L4+5. https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange-Punkte#/media/Datei%3ALagrangian_points_equipotential.png	1643042446.0	hu1cams	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu19cl6	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1cams/
xerioos	Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) interconverts in the body to a radical form that produces hydrogen peroxide. This peroxide goes around oxidizing stuff in red blood cells, and G6PD-deficient people can't produce enough antioxidants (namely, glutathione) to keep up with it. So in these cases, the red blood cells burst and die. This happens rarely, but only at very high doses of vitamin C. But the paper below says that if you give someone vitamin C and they start having problems, it might be worth it to consider if they have G6PD deficiency.

60w29	It's a little more accurate to call them "saddles" instead of hills. If you come from certain directions, you'll gravitate to the ridge of the saddle, but if you're not aligned perfectly, you'll keep rolling off the side.  For satellites that are parked at those points, they have to actively adjust their orbits to keep them there for extended durations.  By analogy, you can stand on top of a hill, but it helps if you're awake if you want to stay there.	1643042518.0	hu1chhe	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1chhe/

f0pjd	I'd really like a source on that.  I find it highly unlikely that any reputable IRB would allow research on hospital lab 'leftovers'.  Most of the time, hospitals dispose of all blood samples within 5-7 days of admission.  I know this because coroners and medical examiners have to subpoena those admission samples to test them for drugs/alcohol on people who have delayed deaths from ODs or trauma.  If somebody survives a week or more in the hospital before succumbing, we tend not to get any samples to test from their initial admission, meaning we can't tell *why* they suffered a cardiac arrest.  But our right to those blood samples is explicitly listed in our state's Revised Code.	1643042589.0	hu1co6v	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu0urxz	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1co6v/

4nrp2	L2 is a gravitational saddle point. The saddle is set along the orbit, and so objects eventually fall towards the sun or away from the sun. JWST is at this saddle point and without boosters, it would eventually fall off (it's in the order of months for things to begin to fall). It is positioned so that it would fall towards the sun (so, on the near side of the saddle). This is so that it can use its rocked - which is on the side facing the sun - to keep it in place. If it were to go too far and fall on the *far* side, then it wouldn't be able to make the correcting burn because it would need to turn around to do the burn, putting the telescope in sunlight which would damage the instruments.	1643042697.0	hu1cyq1	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1cyq1/
o59yb	My understanding is that they are less like valleys and more like hills. They are "stable" like how you can balance a ball on another ball if you get it just right. But if it tips to either side, it won't roll to correct itself back to the center, it'll just keep tipping until it falls.  Think of it like a pyramid with a 1 meter flat table on the top. You can put a ball on the table. It's stable, it will stay, no force is drawing it in any direction strong enough to move it. But if force is applied and it rolls off the table, it'll hit the slope and keep going. Because now one of the gravities is strong enough to pull it away from the other thing.  From your question it seems like you're thinking about it like a hole in the ground with sloped sides. That if something is at the bottom of the hole, and you try to roll it up the sides, and let go, it'll naturally fall back towards the middle. In reality it's the other kind of equilibrium.	1643042732.0	hu1d246	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1d246/

fhodm	L1 2 and 3 are saddle points, while L4 and 5 are 'hills'. But either way the gravitational 'contours' do not tell the whole story. In the rotating reference frame there is a Coriolis force. This means that an object drifting away from a Lagrange point will not 'fall' straight but will have its trajectory curved by the Coriolis effect. This is what creates stable orbits around L4 and L5 and must also be considered for the (unstable) orbits around L1/2/3.	1643042829.0	hu1dbca	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1dbca/

xerioos	Menopause doesnt happen because you run out of eggs. Menopause is when your body decides to stop maintaining your ovaries. There will be lots of eggs left over, but hormonal changes will cause cell death and follicular atrophy. Eventually your ovary just becomes a mass of tissue that doesn't really do anything, i.e. produce estrogen.  Repeated pregnancies might increase overall estrogen levels and some complex feedback loops might contribute to ovary maintenance, but at the end of the day, estrogen production eventually ceases causing menopause.	1643042845.0	hu1dcxq	t3_sas6ch	t3_sas6ch	/r/askscience/comments/sas6ch/could_pregnancy_possibly_delay_menopause/hu1dcxq/

Even though the muscles are contracting underneath, the skin can no longer stretch so it ends up folding. Repeated use will just make the folds more prominent.

8ds2uzku	Exactly, it’s a “no” in the sense of not a direct causal relationship. Any relative movement between a fluid and object doesn’t necessarily qualify as causing vacuum. More generally  for most applications, at the boundary we tend to assume 0 fluid speed relative to the moving surface. There’s a layer if molecules of both that are “glued” together when there’s not slipping or shearing. I’ve read that this boundary condition was observed by da vinci when he studied streams and vortices but I’m not sure if he was the first to observe it. E.g. in a pipe of flowing water the flow speed on the metal is 0 while in the middle of the pipe the flow is maximum and there’s a gradient between 0 and max decreasing with increasing radius.	1643043046.0	hu1dwmz	t3_sbehp5	t1_hu19hpv	/r/askscience/comments/sbehp5/when_an_object_moves_within_a_fluid_is_a_vacuum/hu1dwmz/

Biological samples  have variation dependent on metabolism and many other factors throughout the day. taking the whole days sample and mixing it gives an average of the whole day and makes it more reproducible. As for bacteria urine is mostly sterile if you refrigerate it there should be no significant growth in a day or two.	1643043066.0	hu1dyoi	t3_sboq6i	t3_sboq6i	/r/askscience/comments/sboq6i/how_do_hospitals_use_1day_urine_to_determine/hu1dyoi/

The answer is that yes, their is a ton of data collected about each patient as part of a clinical trial that looks at all sorts of data points. Things like biometric data, medical history, any new diagnosis or prognosis. I don't think a lot of respondents realize the amount of data that's required in order to get FDA approval. When it comes to drug trials these aren't a couple of small data points we're dealing with, we're talking extensive clinical data that in many cases contains decades of data on the same subject.   &#x200B;  To answer your question directly...yes our clients have teams of of data scientists who scour the data and are looking at anything that might be significant regardless of the intended purpose of the data collection.

arvol	L2 is like a ridge. You have to work to climb up one side, but if you're not careful you'll fall right off the other side once you reach the top.   Since JWST only has a thruster on one side, they just keep using that to gently shove it up the slope, careful to never actually reach the top or it'll fall off down the other side. So it will periodically start falling back down toward us, and we will use the thruster to push it back up again, like batting a ball up a hill when it starts to roll back down.	1643043275.0	hu1ej0j	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1ej0j/
8t0pzwe	I’d say the main concern is the concept of informed consent, the form is secondary. Pretty sure you don’t need a consent form for something like taking a nasal swab or blood sample anyway. The important thing is that people are supposed to understand what’s being done to them and why, including what’s gonna be done to sampled taken from their body. A consent form like you described would do nothing in the spirit of this principle.  But yes, you could draw up a form with an exhaustive list of all the tests you intend to do and have people read and sign it (or more realistically, just explain to them what you’re going to do). However, you still have the (arguably more important) consideration: are these additional tests likely to benefit the person? If not, you shouldn’t even be asking for consent in the first place.	1643043303.0	hu1elrz	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu1870u	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1elrz/

They planned a roughly 10 year lifespan, with the caveat that depending on how much fuel needed to be expended to correct its orbit after launch, that lifespan could be cut down to 5 years.

629tsjo1	There are debris accumulated there, but there's not more because it doesn't just require debris show up there, the debris has to show up and "stop". This is in the grand scheme of things very unlikely as the object would have had to already have an orbit similar to Earth's or form from a lucky crash: I'm guessing the majority of it accumulated around the same time the moon was formed, just out of more energetic ejecta, as well as dust from Earth's early accretion disk that was in just the right place at the right time. I can also imagine some of it getting there by photon pressure acting in just the right way.	1643043787.0	hu1fwxc	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1fwxc/

fwj3x	[Because it kills their red blood cells.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5727655/)  At high doses, vitamin C seems to promote the production of hydrogen peroxide, a very reactive molecule that can cause a lot of damage to cells. Our cells have a variety of ways of dealing with excess hydrogen peroxide...but red blood cells, specifically, aren't "normal" cells. They don't have mitochondria, they don't have a nucleus, they don't have DNA or ribosomes to make new proteins *from* DNA—when they enter the bloodstream, they eject their nucleus and their organelles so they can carry more oxygen!  So without DNA or ribosomes or mitochondria, red blood cells are dependent on a series of chemical reactions—something called the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentose_phosphate_pathway)—to protect them from peroxides. The Pentose phosphate pathway helps produce glutathione peroxidase, which in turn neutralizes excess peroxides and protects the red blood cell from reactive oxygen damage.  A catalyst for the very first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, however, is G6PD. Without enough G6PD on hand to make enough glutahione peroxidase, the red blood cells in a person with G6PD deficiency rapidly take on damage, which deteriorates their ability to transport oxygen. In the case study linked above, a man who received a single high-dose of vitamin C was short of breath within an hour.	1643043938.0	hu1gbgp	t3_sbjffp	t3_sbjffp	/r/askscience/comments/sbjffp/why_a_high_dose_of_vitamin_c_pose_risk_for_people/hu1gbgp/
gsx16	Another aspect to all this besides what's already been said is that on a cosmic time scale, a (tiny) third body in any realistic system other than nested near-circular orbits is only fleetingly stable.   On paper you can make it work out fine, but in practice the perturbations from very distant objects or the small object being a hair away from the idealized Lagrange point (or an orbit around it) will add up. Whether that goes haywire after a hundred days or a hundred millennia depends on the ratios of mass and distance between the three bodies involved. Jupiter is great for this. Earth only has a few dinky rocks that might last ~10,000 years. The limiting factor there is how incredibly precise their trajectory had to be to end up in those spots. Like hitting a 9-iron shot at a par 3 and having it land on *top* of the flagpole.	1643043973.0	hu1geuf	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1geuf/

d468q	>So how can I find what I need to do?  You look for precedents in related reactions where optimal conditions are known, and use those as a starting point, based on analogies and known reactivity trends.  For example: if I know typical conditions for, say, the oxidation of an alcohol to a ketone, but am trying the reaction with a "new to the world" starting material, I will start with the typical conditions and see what I get -- then adjust ratios, temperatures, solvents, etc. to maximize yield.   Note that there are usually many competing factors in any chemical reaction (except perhaps the very simplest) so some experimentation is *always* required to get an optimal result.	1643044235.0	hu1h496	t3_sbplyd	t3_sbplyd	/r/askscience/comments/sbplyd/how_would_you_find_out_what_conditions_are_needed/hu1h496/

d53772v0	Any light can damage your eyes. But UV has 2 special problems. First, it's higher energy than visible light, and the kind of energy level that organic compounds just love to absorb and subsequently disintegrate or denaturize. Of course, the compounds in your eyes love to absorb visible light as well, that's somewhat important for the whole seeing thing, but for this there are mechanisms in place to get the energy out of the system without damaging anything, to reverse all changes that resulted from the absorption of photons.   The second problem with UV is, we can't see it. If a flash of yellow light comes your way, you might blink and your iris will contract to limit the amount of light that can enter your eye. That doesn't happen with UV, it can just enter your eye unimpeded. You might also just consciously look away from a blinding visible light since you perceive it as uncomfortable, that doesn't happen with UV.  And there is a third, somewhat paradoxical thing that is relevant for all eye damage, e.g. visible laser light as well. Your brain is amazingly powerful when it comes to filling in missing information. That means if you suffer a bit of eye damage, you burn a little blind spot into your retina, you won't realize. Your brain will just do a bit more work in the image processing department and you won't even notice a thing. Only once you have accumulated so much eye damage that your brain can no longer fix your vision "software-side", you'll notice, and then it's far too late. That's why you should take warnings seriously about not looking directly into the sun or a laser. You might do it and find that you notice no difference. You might think "I've looked into the sun/a laser 20 times and never did anything happen, guess it's safe or I'm immune", just to find out at your 21st try that you've ruined your vision forever.	1643044257.0	hu1h6e1	t3_sbjj0a	t3_sbjj0a	/r/askscience/comments/sbjj0a/is_visible_light_damaging_to_your_eyes_and_vision/hu1h6e1/

t1ux6	Short answer is L1,2,3 aren’t stable so whatever is there needs constant orbital maintenance or it will wander away eventually.  L4,5 are stable and stuff does accumulate there.

gkq714gr	Well, I'm just going to point out to bacteria in the intestine. Specifically large intestine (colon). Plenty of bacterial flora lives there and is essential for human well-being. Killing them off (oral antibiotics for example) gives room for more harmful bacteria. Not going to specifics, but a balanced flora is required.  Some of these bacteria are beneficial for digestion as well. At least few studies have linked the balance of flora to diseases such as Parkinson's (there isn't exactly solid proof or consensus, more of a correlation). If the bacteria end up in a wrong place, they can quite well kill the person though. Ruptured bowel causes peritonitis (infection of the peritoneal cavity).  Now, the intestinal bacteria aren't exactly called parasitic. Parasitic is used mostly to describe something that harms the host while benefiting itself (like said in another reply, there are grey areas, it isn't a definition). But for fantasy literature purposes, you can just say that parasites become symbiotic at some point.	1643044406.0	hu1hkpv	t3_s9o4de	t3_s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/hu1hkpv/

nwo8b	This is kind of the raison de etre of core chemistry curricula of organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Organic or inorganic help you understand the key building blocks of doing things to molecules. If organic, is there precedence for moving functional groups or cutting this sort of molecule in half etc. If inorganic, are you dealing with purely ionic chemistry, is there an expected starting and ending crystal geometry etc. Physical chemistry helps you understand how to get things to the physical behavior that will best benefit the sort of thing you want to do. Can I melt this? Vaporize it? Get it in solution? How do I do it? How do I contain it or not?  This gives you the language for the next steps, which is first a literature search to find out what's the nearest thing someone has done to what you want to do. There will be several, and you need to start synthesizing your method based on how they can or can't be conceptually combined. Beside literature there is also physical simulation if you're lucky enough to have credit for mainframe time. Depending how well the thing you want to do is previously studied and how accurate the models are in your specific circumstance, you will have 1 to 100s of candidate synthesis methods. All that's left to do is try them out, dialing in the final conditions based on your experiments.  Chemistry research is sometimes (controversially) bucketed into the realms of theoretical, synthesis, and industrial chemistry. No one person is doing all the steps of theorizing a physical chemical phenomena, seeing how it works to affect chemicals in a lab, then figuring out how to scale it to useful industrial scales. The steps above are largely in that synthesis domain where the entire point of your research is to take some idea like "take AB and C and make AC" and see how many different ways you can make it happen. This builds up that core of chemical synthesis that is then available in college courses and literature searches for someone doing the next steps of "take AC and D and make AD" or "make AC profitably in a manufacturing facility." It's all iterative.	1643044601.0	hu1i3rs	t3_sbplyd	t3_sbplyd	/r/askscience/comments/sbplyd/how_would_you_find_out_what_conditions_are_needed/hu1i3rs/

qph6p	Partially, yes.  The green objects in that gif are in the lagrange points, but the red objects are hildra astroids ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid ), who also "shepherded" along, and in a 2/3 resonance with jupiter.   Jupiter and the Sun together influence most of the region around jupiters orbit. "extreme" points on this region are called the Lagrange points (where the forces cancel eachother out), however any other point in the orbit still gets influenced by both the sun and jupiter. Close to the sun and far beyond jupiter's orbit it is mainly the sun that influences things, but in orbits closer to jupiter, the massive influence of jupiter decides how things go.  Some objects get pulled into the L4, L5 points, but other objects still get influenced by jupiter.	1643044711.0	hu1ieip	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1dqaf	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1ieip/
n1ciu	Of you balance a stick on your hand with a tennis ball on top, that's like L1 L2 and L3. It'll stay there as long as you make small adjustments as needed.

mqtes	It probably will, but it is probably a neglible effect. In any case, they have fuel with them to ensure they keep it in the right spot, as it will eventually drift a little bit - they can make miniscule corrections. They had even estimated that they could stay in the spot for a lot less time than they actually can, because the initial launch was so effective - basically they didnt need to use as much fuel as estimated to reach the destination.	1643044718.0	hu1if8b	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1hgi8	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1if8b/
y2qs8	As some have alluded to, L4/L5 are more stable than the other Lagrange points, but technically on long time scales they are also unstable. There really can’t be a truly stable gravitational fixed point in a real universe with chaotic interaction of many gravitational bodies. This would be the case even if only the sun, earth, and moon existed, but is further exacerbated by Jupiter and other planets/asteroids/moons/stars/galaxies.  However, practically speaking we can call these 2 points stable, and there is accumulated material.	1643044733.0	hu1igpr	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1igpr/

12z7mc	It depends and the value of such data used correctly is immense, most use of modern data science is done without peoples knowledge or consent, and most marketing manipulation is done without peoples knowledge or consent, Russian use of bots in social media to gain the election results in Eastern Europe, UK and USA shows that by identifying and targeting concerns among groups then associating them negatively with more.extreme actions you can easily mass manipulate entire groups of people. In the UK it was queues of immigrants from Syria and Iraq waiting behind EU borders, UK far right groups used these images alongside images of war and terror to link these together, same with the caravan of people walking from Ecuador and Panama to the Us, Trump used that and images of Mexican drug gangs to sell anti immigration messages. Sadly the Internet makes it easy to control weak minded people - think qanon and pizzagate recently.   So yes if people are aware they are being manipulated they will be alienated, the trick is to not let them be aware. Indirect marketing can be used to loosen the areas of concern without directly tackling the issue. You would never stick up a billboard saying jab yourself.against covid, you might breakdown a less scarey more traditional disease like flu jabs, or you might promote healthier diets and exercise to raise body awareness etc.	1643047427.0	hu1pucz	t3_sb7qan	t1_hu1dnuz	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu1pucz/

5qr6c	There are, but only at L4 and L5.  The other points aren't passively stable and any small perturbation will kick anything sitting at the point off of it and away.  So, the only way to stay at L1, L2, and L3 is with active station keeping, which means nothings going to be there unless we keep it there.  L4 and L5 are more stable and objects at those points will tend to passively return when they are slightly nudged off.    The thing to remember is that the Lagrange points are really points in a 2-body gravitational system, i.e. they work and exist when only 2 major gravitational objects are considered.  But the Solar System isn't a 2-body system and even though the Earth-Moon system is, it exists as part of the wider solar system.  That means that there are always going to be perturbations tending to nudge the object at the Lagrange point.	1643047590.0	hu1qa0n	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1qa0n/

2hhmrodl	There are 2 aspects of light that matter for damaging something with light  1. Wavelength (energy of the photons) [see EM spectrum](https://cdn.britannica.com/75/95275-050-5FC96002/Radio-waves-rays-light-gamma-ultraviolet-electromagnetic.jpg) 2. Intensity (number of photos)  UV light has a short wavelength, and so it has higher energy photons than visible light. UV photons have enough energy to break bonds in DNA, which is why UV can damage tissue and cause cancer. Meanwhile visible light (as well as IR, microwave, radio etc.)  can't break those bonds. If you increase the intensity/brightness, i.e. number of photons visible light will still not break those bonds directly because each photon lacks the energy required to do so. However higher intensities of visible light will begin to heat or even burn whatever is absorbing the light so it can still cause damage. Interestingly this explanation, or at least one very similar to it, was first made by Albert Einstein and he eventually won the nobel prize in physics for it ([photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect)).   TLDR: Any type of light can burn/damage your eyes if it's intensity is high enough, UV light (and higher) can also cause additional damage to the DNA directly (making it particularly bad).	1643048008.0	hu1reo5	t3_sbjj0a	t3_sbjj0a	/r/askscience/comments/sbjj0a/is_visible_light_damaging_to_your_eyes_and_vision/hu1reo5/

L4 and L5 sit on potential peaks ("gravitational hilltops") while L1-3 all sit on saddle points (so local, but not absolute and, frankly, quite unstable minima). And the L4 and L5 points are indeed more stable although it's due to the coriolis force, which I'll admit I misremembered.	1643048168.0	hu1rtvs	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1ndn7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1rtvs/

The suffering because others could be as innocuous from our perspective as not getting them a job when they apply for it, or most bullying during childhood and adolescence, the effects of which most people attempt to separate and split into other types of crime in order to explain the psychological effect.  And ultimately when we divert back to the argument of neurotransmitters, we do so with the intent to separate the effect of their lack of integrity, from the cause which created that lack of integrity in the first place; external factors which come in the form of the suffering we cause others, both in extreme and less extreme ways	1643048917.0	hu1tv2r	t3_sawfex	t1_hty8eho	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu1tv2r/

Spoiler: The healthier you eat, the better off you are.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219480/  Also, there are plenty of studies that show that if you have a BMI of 30+, that you have about somewhere like a 33% increased chance of dying as per a study of risk back in July 2021.   And about just being obese even earlier. Like this article here points out.   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/08/covid-cdc-study-finds-roughly-78percent-of-people-hospitalized-were-overweight-or-obese.html  I remember seeing a study where they never were able to register anyone dying with a BMI of ≥23, IF they were healthy and under 50. Problem is that there is an obesity epidemic in many Western countries. Albeit governments could have pushed far more broad awareness of this.

This is the biggest limiting factor for the JWST's expected service life, and why an efficient launch was important - more fuelupon arrival at the L2 point means extended time there.  https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/29/nasa-says-webbs-excess-fuel-likely-to-extend-its-lifetime-expectations/	1643050499.0	hu1y4vf	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1chhe	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1y4vf/

72wgbmcl	Everyone has mostly answered the question, but being a lab tech, thought I'd weigh in. It's true, after collecting your sample all day, we keep about 20mL and flush the rest down the toilet. Most tests we don't have any additive, since bacterial growth won't affect them. Some tests have 25mL of hydrochloric acid. We don't instruct patients to keep it in the fridge, just a cool dark place, like beside the toilet. Your output changes throughout the day, so this will give us an average daily output. We also calculate creatinine clearance using the total volume of sample, which can tell the doctors how effectively your kidney are filtering everything out.	1643050916.0	hu1z90v	t3_sboq6i	t3_sboq6i	/r/askscience/comments/sboq6i/how_do_hospitals_use_1day_urine_to_determine/hu1z90v/

kug4o	Imagine you place a ball on the very very top of a hill. If it's perfectly balanced at the top, it won't roll in any direction. But if a slight breeze comes along, it gets pushed just a little bit off the top, and then it starts to roll downhill. If you act right when it happens, it doesn't take much effort to push the ball back up the hill and place it at the top. You might be able to just kick it a little bit without moving yourself even. But if you wait too long, the ball will roll faster and farther down the hill, and you'll have to run after it. It might even get so fast you can't keep up, and you have no hope of putting the ball back on the hill.  L1, L2, and L3 work kinda the same way. If the telescope starts to "roll" a little bit from the top of the "hill", it only takes a very small thrust to put it back. The JWST has enough fuel on board to keep it in place at the top of our hill for 20 years or so.	1643051188.0	hu1zz83	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1bbi7	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu1zz83/

gbrj0	In the direction of the orbit, L2 is stable; that's the high parts of the saddle. Without any station keeping burns, James Webb would continue to orbit L2, but it would slowly fall towards earth.  An object perfectly at L2 is unstable in the line pointing to the central object but stable perpendicular to that line.  James Webb will push almost far enough from Earth to L2 but will be careful to not go too far. It will naturally orbit around L2 due to the combined gravity of the Earth and Sun, but every several weeks they will burn a little bit of fuel to push away from the Sun to keep from falling towards the sun, but not quite enough to go too far and start falling away from the sun, which it couldn't recover from.	1643051709.0	hu21d2c	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu21d2c/

gbrj0	The heat shield will act like a solar sail. It isn't nearly string enough to overcome the mass of the spacecraft and push it into deep space, but unequal solar pressure will try to make it rotate, which the telescope will have to counteract using its momentum wheels and eventually fuel in its maneuvering thrusters.  They added a sun flap to make it cancel out as much as possible, but that will just reduce how often they have to use the thrusters to cancel out the build up of momentum in the momentum wheels.	1643051956.0	hu220j4	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1hgi8	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu220j4/

79bbv7x9	To add to the previous answers: UV, visble light, and infrared is dangerous for your eyes, depending of course on the intensity. But they are dangerous at slightly different positions, see for example this sketch: http://photobiology.info/Rozanowska_files/Fig1.png UV is absorbed before it can even reach the retina and rather damage for example the iris (and your skin of course). Visible light is obviously reaching the retina as it should, and so does infrared light. Infrared light is also very well focused by the lens, and thus will be concentrated on a small area on the retina. As you don't see it, it can cause damage there until it is too late and the respective area is irreversible damaged.	1643052727.0	hu24276	t3_sbjj0a	t3_sbjj0a	/r/askscience/comments/sbjj0a/is_visible_light_damaging_to_your_eyes_and_vision/hu24276/

16mujs	L4 and L5 are actually more like plateaus, though. They're hilltops - every way is down, and there is a gradient. When the orbiting body is of a comparable mass to the larger (roughly bigger than 1/25th the mass), then the gradient is too steep and L4 and L5 are unstable.  But when the orbiting body is significantly smaller, there's a more gentle gradient. Things still start rolling off - but this is a rotating reference frame, so you get a Coriolis force, which keeps them rolling around the plateau.	1643052899.0	hu24ibd	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu19cl6	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu24ibd/

There's no money allocated for one, and there's not even a design for what that mission might look like, but the telescope is designed to be refueled.  The telescope itself can't be serviced (replace instruments) in the same way that Hubble was.

They all are moving, but they're all generally going the same direction and speed, so they don't run into each other, and if you change your reference point from 'earth' to one of the balls, the balls would all generally seem to stay in about the same spot, while everything else would be moving.	1643053234.0	hu25dyb	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu22xdt	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu25dyb/
2lkl08o2	Aside from it being unethical, someone would have to be paying these testing folks to isolate and test the samples for anything else, and to store them and their isolates for a prolonged period of time. And that's not happening. Freezer space is very expensive when you take into account the cost of the freezer, the maintenance, the service contract, the very limited space within, and the electricity they take to run.  Then, there's the costs of testing the samples for literally anything else, like, idk, ancestry? genetic diseases? metabolites?  Can't get blood chemistry from oral/nasal swabs so the testing is limited, and massively expensive. With the huge demand for testing, most places only can afford to even hold on to your sample for a few extra days after testing, just in case you need a re-test for some reason.  They are definitely disposing of the samples as soon as they legally can, and only testing them for covid (or covid plus flu if they are licensed for that).	1643053271.0	hu25het	t3_sb7qan	t3_sb7qan	/r/askscience/comments/sb7qan/with_all_the_covid_tests_going_on_are_we_getting/hu25het/

5g4hw	My understanding of treatment isn't perfect, but my understanding is yes - in addition to alternative antidepressants above (psilocybin etc.), traditional antidepressants will also have a restorative effect on brain architecture/plasticity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739451/). These changes can take several weeks to occur from the initiation of therapy, however, and many patients will actually experience worsened acute effects during that "waiting period"   From my understanding, this is actually one of the stronger pieces of evidence backing up the trophic theory vs. the neurotransmitter model. The idea is that the antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs, and others - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25681575/) all take much more time to evoke structural changes compared to their acute effects on emotion.	1643053875.0	hu272ly	t3_sawfex	t1_htx0q3o	/r/askscience/comments/sawfex/on_a_neural_level_how_does_a_condition_like/hu272ly/
fwp4z	What you haven't mentioned is how fast those dust particles are coming. Even if (hypothetically) they perfectly matched Earth's velocity around the Sun, just the fall into Earth would accelerate them to 11.2 km/s, so they inevitably burn up when they reach the top of the atmosphere. Some lifeforms have been observed to survive the harsh environment in space (in a dormant state), but they cannot survive the extreme temperatures of atmospheric entry.  This is actually the weak link in the panspermia theory. Their best chance to survive would be deep in a crack in a meteor, so that they are not exposed to the extremely hot gases outside during entry.

g8l7r	Because practically, it *is* a one-shot mission.  Yes, JWST was designed to accept a potential refueling mission. However, currently no technology exists for a refueling-mission at L2 and none is planned. NASA is certain that no manned mission to L2 can be achieved within the next decade. To design a robotic refueling mission from scratch would take many years and billions of dollars. There is a very big chance this is not going to happen in the next few years and after that it would be too late anyways.   So while, theoretically, JWST could be refueled all parties accept this is probably not going to happen.	1643054162.0	hu27tm3	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu24pgt	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu27tm3/

63yca	It rotates in a sense but it's simpler to think about the Lagrange points in a rotating reference frame, where the earth and sun are "stationary."  In that frame, it doesn't rotate at all.

Hubble is near the end of its life in many ways and its technology is decades out of date.   NASA has [two more Hubble style](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasa-gets-military-spy-telescopes-for-astronomy/2012/06/04/gJQAsT6UDV_story.html) telescopes in storage with better optics.

Inertial confinement fusion experiments actually reach remarkable pressures, they are just short lived, but all the fusion reactions occur within a nanosecond or so.  Magnetic confinement uses significantly lower pressures, but much longer confinement times.	1643055176.0	hu2ag79	t3_sbic0f	t3_sbic0f	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hu2ag79/

16qcpz	They can't really move around within the L point, because sooner or later they would exit the zone of gravitational stability and fall away.  L4 and L5 are like flat parking lots on top of hills.  If you skate up there and brake to a halt, you just sit there.  But, if you give your skateboard a push and it starts to roll, it will roll slowly past all the other parked cars and everything, and eventually get to the edge of the parking lot, where the hill starts to slope down.  And then it will start to roll faster, and faster... and unless you make an effort to go back, you're never getting back to the L point again.  L1, L2, and L3 are more like a convex-bottomed half-pipe on top of a hill.  In one direction, you are actually very stable -- you can accelerate up the sides of the half pipe and it will actually bring you back down again until you come to a stop....except you won't stop, quite, you will start to drift sideways out of the half pipe altogether and down the hill.  Unless you exert yourself to stay in.  Which is why James Webb needs to spend fuel to stay in the L2.	1643055322.0	hu2atua	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu22xdt	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2atua/

77men	I think it's more along the lines of: they already have the momentum flap. Instead of it being a fixed structure, have it be a movable structure that can add or reduce the amount of photon pressure that is applied (possibly with more flaps to get more degrees of control). OFC you can't be perfectly still on an unstable point, but you don't have to generate all your dV to stay near the point from propellant.	1643055428.0	hu2b3t1	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1nfnb	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2b3t1/

h33l934d	I'm glad to see this answer, as it's the orbit *around* the L2 point that makes stationkeeping feasible.  If it tried to pin itself exactly on that point it would quickly run out of fuel.  But thanks to its bullseye launch it has enough maneuvering fuel to maintain that orbit-within-an-orbit for twenty years.	1643055642.0	hu2bo6x	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1chm1	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2bo6x/
tgcet	I thought it was really a hill. And at the top of the hill the slope is zero so as long as you keep up with micro adjustments you can easily stay on top of the hill.

g4fkh	This took me a bit to understand as well.  All the animations seem to just gloss over something that seems quite magical at first.  What helped my understand is to imagine a satellite just ahead of the L2 point.  The Earth's gravity will act to drag it back toward L2.  The same thing happens if it's just behind L2: gravity will act to drag it back.  This means L2 is stable in the orbital direction.  And the motion oscillates: as it's dragged back, momentum will cause it to overshoot past L2 in the other direction, and gravity drags it back once more.  Similarly, look at a point above or below the orbital plane.  The same as before, Earth's gravity will pull it back toward the plane.  This also oscillates as above.  Combine the two motions together and you get an "orbit" around L2.  It's not a real orbit, it only looks that way if you use a rotating frame of reference at L2.  It's really orbiting the sun, but bobbing up and down and speeding up and down as it mildly interacts with Earth's gravity.	1643055867.0	hu2c957	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2c957/
i1if5	It isn't really in an orbit around th L point since as you said, there is no mass there to orbit. But in the rotating reference frame that places the L point stationary, the JWST appears to orbit around it.   Imagine a satellite in geosynchronous orbit so it stays over a single point. Now imagine that satellite has a slightly elliptical orbit so the on average it maintains the geosync orbit, but sometimes it is a little closer and faster and sometimes further and slower. From the point of view of someone below it it would appear to circle the geosync point, but there is nothing there to orbit.	1643055907.0	hu2cd1k	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2cd1k/
112l9j	Short version, almost all the burn is on the hot side of the craft.    The equipment on JWST needs to be on the cold side, and as said better by the scientists in this thread, the main use of fuel is to fight the slight falling-towards-the-Sun (which also happens to be towards Earth).   So all the propellant and hot gas is mostly in the vector away from the equipment.	1643055968.0	hu2cisw	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2an6b	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2cisw/

6il0q	Because Lagrange points don't suck. Any moving object from outside the point will pass through the point just as if it were a point gravity. Only if two objects happen to arrive at exactly the same time from opposite directions and collide there can they stay at the point. That's incredibly unlikely, and even when it does happen, another passing object can just as easily knock it back out again. The exception is very small objects, basically dust, which is light enough to be perturbed by even solar wind.	1643056409.0	hu2dnx3	t3_sbmt50	t3_sbmt50	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2dnx3/

3pp7o	Nah. Thrusters throw out matter, but that matter is going in the opposite direction from the telescope, and it's more of 'tiny particles' that separate from each other and are essentially completely transparent because of the rapidly diffusing matter after after a tiny amount of time, than any sort of 'cloud'.   So, even if the telescope suddenlyturned in the direction of where it previously thrusted, it wouldn't be any sort of issue after a few seconds.	1643056958.0	hu2f3u4	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2an6b	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2f3u4/

gzspz	> In theory, they could just permanently keep it on the far side of the saddle point, right?  No.  On the far side of the Lagrange point its velocity (equal to the Moon's orbital velocity) would overwhelm the gravitational pull of the Earth.  It would drift away.  In order to keep on-station, it would have to thrust Earthward.   However, that means thrusting near the mirror and around all that science gear that they've worked so hard to keep cold.  In other words, if they have to thrust that way, they screw up the instruments.  So it is far better to keep the Webb on this side of the  Lagrange point and only use thrusters on the far side of the heat shield from the telescope itself.	1643057493.0	hu2giqe	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu27l3y	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2giqe/
dc6t4	>Is it just rolling around in this pringle shape and boosting back up every time, twice per complete orbit, or do the boosts not occur that frequently?  Okay, so the pringle shape works when considering two dimensions (with the third dimension of the pringle being the gravitational potential energy). Usually this is used with the two dimensions being the distance from Earth and the orbital direction. But there is a third dimension to consider: the height above the orbital plane. It turns out L2 is stable in the orbital direction and in displacement from the orbital plane, but unstable in distance from Earth. So the orbit of the JWST is in the two stable dimensions. So it doesn't need to go back "up" the pringle, because it is orbiting in such a way that it never goes "down" the pringle.	1643057640.0	hu2gwuc	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu1x5il	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2gwuc/

68e5u1yf	In your specific example, you're not really comparing apples to apples. Table salt is Na-Cl, which is individually Na+ and Cl-. That is, they are both stable ions because they have each already given up and received an electron, respectively, to create a stable shell. Elemental Na is dangerous because it wants to give up an electron to form the more stable Na+. Cl2 is dangerous because of its intrinsic properties that make it dangerous to biological things.	1643059332.0	hu2lf21	t3_sbje6x	t3_sbje6x	/r/askscience/comments/sbje6x/how_do_chemists_predict_chemical_compositions_and/hu2lf21/

12b6qt	Maybe someday, but moving parts in space is super duper hard. The transformer like deployment of the sails, the mirrors, the secondary mirror... Everyone was gulping and cringing at the number of things that had to move and click into place.   Things in space vacuum weld together. Two pieces of metal touching each other on earth have tiny contaminants and gasses keeping them apart. In space two pieces of metal touching can be indistinguishable from one piece of metal... and then it literally are one.   Everything is also going to change size and shape as it comes to a new, insane equilibrium temperature where the solar side is crazy hot and the shade side is mega cold. You need all of your joints to move and continue to function despite the temperture fluctuations.   Make sure to bring plenty of self applicating space lube!  I could imagine maintaining a continuous shape and just rotating it to change the amout of solar pressure and steer the craft, but that would mess up the instruments which need the shade to keep them cold.   The other thing is that the solar shade was already perhaps the hardest and riskiest part of the deployment. Making it into an even larger sail would mean fitting an even more ridiculous object into the nose cone of a rocket.	1643061753.0	hu2ru9w	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2b3t1	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2ru9w/

3j9zpa9d	Some good answers here, but another consideration is heat.  The management of unwanted heat gain is paramount in the design of the JWST. They have gone to extreme lengths to keep the cool side of the telescope as cold as possible, so adding a bank of solar panels on the hot side which is big enough to power an ion engine would have been counterproductive. IIRC, The telescope has less than 1000 W to operate everything on board, including the refrigeration compressor, which is one of its major power draws  The bipropellant thrusters that the telescope uses for station keeping are less fuel efficient than an ion engine, but they take almost no electricity to operate, just the actuation of valves with solenoids. In fact, the design of the telescope uses an abnormally large number of mechanical relays and solenoids for this reason as well,  unlike semi conductors they take no power at all in the resting state.	1643062714.0	hu2ubvl	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2k8b4	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2ubvl/

gbrj0	Yes, exactly. The thrusters are on the hot side, and if it turned around to thrust towards the sun, then the sensitive optics and scientific instruments would be damaged.  Even at launch in the folded configuration, JWST rocked/rotated to limit how long any one part of the mirror structure assembly was exposed to the sun.  The orbit around L2 happens naturally from gravity alone, it needs the thrusters for two reasons: to occasionally push away from the sun and to occasionally cancel out rotation caused by differences in solar radiation.  The JWST uses momentum wheels (reaction wheels) to rotate itself using electricity. However, asymmetry in the sunlight hitting JWST can apply a small torque that can add up over time, and the reaction wheels would eventually hit their maximum speed and couldn't absorb more momentum in that direction. To avoid this, JWST must occasionally use its thrusters to torque JWST in the opposite direction to allow it to slow down the momentum wheels.  Thrusters aiming at the sun but placed off center could allow JWST to apply torque to unload the reaction wheels and thrust away from the sun at the same time, getting double duty from the fuel it burns.	1643063280.0	hu2vsir	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2ng79	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2vsir/

8nlux	You can't just turn it around because the cold side needs to remain cold. Pointing it at the Sun would at worst destroy the sensors and other instruments, and at best would heat it up to the point it would take weeks to get back down to operating temperature.  In the rotating reference frame of the Sun and Earth, there are three forces acting on the JWST: The gravity of the Earth, the gravity of the Sun, and the centrifugal pseudoforce. The centrifugal pseudoforce always points directly away from the Sun (technically, the barycenter of the Earth/Sun system, but that's close enough), but the Earth isn't along the JWST-Sun line. There is a small component of the Earth's gravity towards L2 that isn't balanced by either the Sun or centrifugal pseudoforce.  That unbalanced component of Earth's gravity is what makes it orbit L2 in the rotating frame.	1643063480.0	hu2wb2t	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2ng79	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2wb2t/

3m6d8	It does, but the exhaust from an ion engine has a much higher velocity, so it has a better specific impulse than a conventional rocket, where 'specific impulse' is basically the amount of push you get from a kilogram of fuel.  Although, strictly speaking, xenon isn't fuel, because you're not burning it or reacting it with anything, it's just mass to throw out of the back of the engine so that you can go forwards. A more general term is "reaction mass". In a rocket engine, the fuel + oxidiser, e.g. liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen is your reaction mass.  Anyway, with a better specific impulse, you don't have to carry as much reaction mass with you to get the same impulse.	1643064845.0	hu2zrq2	t3_sbmt50	t1_hu2ny96	/r/askscience/comments/sbmt50/why_arent_there_stuff_accumulated_at_lagrange/hu2zrq2/

In that orbit, called a [halo orbit, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit)there is an attractive force within its orbital plane, but if it drifts either  outward or inward towards the earth, it will keep drifting.

Even the unfolded sunshield could nearly fit inside the payload bay, the length of it can but not quite the width.

kb1jo	This is also a concept I'm trying to better understand. But here's my current level of understanding: when JWST is displaced out of the Earth-Sun orbital plane at L2, there will be a net force (gravity plus centrifugal) that points back toward L2. When Webb is given a velocity component perpendicular to this net force, it will orbit the L2 point. In other words, gravity pulls the spacecraft "in" towards the sun and "down" towards the Earth-Sun orbital plane, while the centrifugal force pulls it "out" away from the sun. These forces sum to point "down" to L2, which can then be orbited, just like any simple circular orbit around a body.  Disclaimer: this is probably a gross simplification, or even altogether incorrect.

75u2e1if	Flying at high altitudes is more energy efficient due to reduced drag, and fater as it allows you to simply fly faster, so generally aircraft try to fly as high as possible, however flying high requires more powerful engines due to the low air density not providing much thrust, and modern civil engines aren't powerful enough to keep a plane at 50 pr 60 thousand feet, so 30-40 thousand is sort of sweet spot for commercial aviation	1643121313.0	hu5nfmb	t3_sc7jz7	t3_sc7jz7	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu5nfmb/
akdzf	As you go higher the air gets thinner. Airplanes fly because the curvature of their wings causes air over the top surface of the wing to take a longer path than below; the longer path stretches out the air molecules = lower air pressure and this pressure differential is "lift".   But at some point the lower air density starts to eliminate the lift except at higher speeds. So in general the planes that are capable of flying super high like 60-80 thousand feet are either specially designed  wth super high lift to weight ratios (U-2 spy plane) or super duper fast (SR-71), i.e. so fast they still generate lift at lower air densities.  At lower altitudes you have weather effects caused by high/low pressure boundaries, storms, clouds, lightening. At cruising altitudes of 30-40k ft you still have winds which can be quite strong, but they're more consistent airstreams. And sometimes you can take advantage of their direction. Flights at one altitude get a nice tailwind in a certain direction, others at a different altitude get a headwind in the same direction. So taking advantage of these can save some fuel.   But outside of weather and windstream related reasons, planes flight at certain altitudes because they strike a sweet spot in terms of fuel efficiency and speed vs the air density. An airliner at 35,000 ft may be 95% fuel efficient at 500 mph. Same plane at 20,000 ft might be only 80% efficient cause it has to power through denser air.  To add to this, you can design wings and engines that are capable of pushing your airplane at whatever speed and altitude you like, but to be fuel efficient (which is a key goal of commercial air travel) you have to design for a sweet spot which will require compromises which make the plane less efficient in other spots; either it will require more fuel, or it will be slower or have less lift or whatever.	1643121492.0	hu5nujd	t3_sc7jz7	t3_sc7jz7	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu5nujd/
64djk	Well, there was hope. Hospitalizations lag, deaths lag more, so there was a two week window of time where some folks capitalized on that hope and delay and claimed, too early, falsely, that this flavor was safe*. It served their purpose. People also are exhausted and looking for any way out.   The good thing is that a) more people are immunized and their immune systems won't give the virus a free two-week-pass to get cozy and established, and b) this flavor replicates faster in more tissues, so the body might be alerted to something wrong faster, so it doesn't get as established before the body fights back.   That said... not everybody *can* fight back. Or their bodies fight back too hard. Damage happens if they fight back or not, and fighting back also damages some cells. Some people can't heal as well.   **Another issue is hospital overload.** There's a tipping point when too many people need care - things that shouldn't kill, do, when care is postponed or unavailable.   5x more people sick, with 50% less hospitalization, is still 2.5x more people needing care than before.  So if you are in a car accident, have a stroke, or need a cancer screening... and the hospital can't care for you?   There are absolutely going to be excess "unrelated" deaths that wouldn't have happened if Omicron weren't filling hospital beds.	1643121611.0	hu5o4hd	t3_scdzhk	t1_hu5mb5c	/r/askscience/comments/scdzhk/how_does_omicron_actually_kill_people/hu5o4hd/

3oh1z5uk	There is less air resistance at higher altitudes and the airlines are able to maximise fuel efficiency.

e5wwg	Airplanes don't really experience much less drag at 40,000 feet than they do at 10,000 feet. Lift and drag are directly related to each other, and the airplane (neglecting burned fuel) has to produce the same amount of lift, so it experiences roughly the same amount of drag. Say a 700,000 lb aircraft experiences 50,000 lb of drag flying at 10,000 feet - at 40,000 feet and the same weight, the total drag will very likely be in the 45,000 - 55,000 lb range.  What the thinner air does is allows - actually, it requires - the airplane to *move faster* while experiencing that same drag. This does improve efficiency as well in terms of miles per gallon, all other things being equal.	1643123727.0	hu5t7rd	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu5nfmb	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu5t7rd/

39l3sezj	Unfortunately, probably not. Influenza constantly changes (basically annually) through a mechanism known as antigenic drift. This is when many mutations occur on the neuraminidase protein (the protein that our immune system recognizes), so much that our memory response will not be induced by the previous year's influenza exposure (either from illness or vaccination). This is why a new influenza vaccine has to be made every year.   u/lucky_ducker already said this, but influenza travels around the world throughout the year. Scientist "scientifically estimate" what influenza will look like in your country/global region based on the opposite hemisphere's influenza. For example, this Spring/Summer scientists will see what influenza looks like in Australia and develop a vaccine for what they believe it will look like in Fall/Winter in USA.   That being said, it is technically possible that previous influenzas can confer some degree of protection, but it is most likely not nearly good enough as getting the new vaccine, even if the efficacy of the new one is "low." I would be interested in reading a study that talks about this though!	1643134657.0	hu6mbf4	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6mbf4/

qfkab	It depends on how the current strain matches any of the flus you've had or been vaccinated against.  For example: The 2009 H1N1 pandemic disproportionately affected younger people, with one possible explanation being that older folks had some preexisting immunity from exposure to the 1918 H1N1 virus (or its descendants):  "Furthermore, the 2009 pandemic exhibits an unusual pattern of age-related morbidity and mortality reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish flu, as it disproportionately affects children and young adults (ages 4–25) (24). The infection rate decreases with age, with the lowest occurrence in the population 65 years and older (25–30). The low infection rate in the elderly, the common victims of seasonal flu, suggests some pre-existing immunity to the 2009 pandemic viruses (22)."  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897825/	1643134730.0	hu6mind	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6mind/
g81tx	Every year the people responsible for the flu vaccine predict/study which strains/changes the flu virus of that "season" will be by looking at what is circulating in the southern hemisphere, and they'll prepare a vaccine that protects against the top 3 or 4 variants. The vaccination from a previous year will generally be significantly different than what the current year's shot was designed to prevent. The immunity you get from the vaccination wanes as time progresses as well, that's why you get your shot in the fall/beginning of winter (flu season dies off in the spring).  So the short answer is no, your shots over the last 10 years don't stack/grant any immunity/reduction of symptoms in the future if you miss a shot.	1643134863.0	hu6mvut	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6mvut/
39l3sezj	I think what u/HumanityHealthCBD meant is that the opposite is possible where the vaccine can offer little-to-no protection. I wouldn't say "incorrect flu shot" because it is more so that the scientists are never "completely correct." And the vaccine is certainly not harmful at all (unless you have an allergy to eggs - but that's for another time). Even if that vaccine efficacy is determined to be \~30%, that statistically means you have a \~30% chance of decreasing your risk for severe disease and death from influenza. Some protection is better than no protection, but it would be nice if the influenza vaccine had a higher efficacy! That would certainly help promote it to more people	1643134996.0	hu6n93u	t3_scirna	t1_hu6k16u	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6n93u/

A light sail gives you twice the momentum change for the same amount of light falling on the sail as being emitted by the laser (as the light is reflected), has far less mass for the craft, and you can use much more powerful (and massive) energy sources on earth to power it. But you're also correct that we then couldn't bring it with us, so slowing back down is a lot more tricky.	1643135204.0	hu6ntbz	t3_sc4qsl	t1_hu5m4fq	/r/askscience/comments/sc4qsl/why_arent_lasers_installed_onboard_laserpushed/hu6ntbz/

It might be recognized well enough by its antibodies that it starts producing the imperfect antibodies, it might not.

6y75e	There are lots of reasons someone might need glasses. Some of the most common are myopia and hyperopia (near- and farsightedness). These usually occur because your eyeball is top short or too long so the light is focused in front of or behind your retina. There's a genetic component, but also likely some environmental effects during early childhood, specifically exposure to sunlight (need more of it to prevent myopia). As we age, the lens, which helps focus light on the retina, hardens and becomes less malleable, making it harder to focus which is why many older adults need reading glasses. You can find plenty of info with a simple search for myopia or hyperopia or other issues likes astigmatism. I recommend starting there and coming back with a more specific question if you have one.  No kind of training will change the shape of your eyeball or the stiffness or opacity of your lens. However, there is some evidence that you can train your eye muscles to have your eyes move together better and focus on the same point. This allows some people to gain stereo vision by training them to use both eyes.	1643135344.0	hu6o6zp	t3_sc8mle	t1_hu6d7h0	/r/askscience/comments/sc8mle/what_exactly_affects_eyesight/hu6o6zp/

ar1ws1wp	Here's a link to an interesting review article that looks at this question [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00956/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00956/full). Surprisingly, some studies suggest that vaccine acquired antibodies can start to decline within one single flu season, while other studies suggest that natural immunity could be lifelong based on the Spanish flu pandemic compared to the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Studies have also been able to tease out that this is most likely independent from the high mutation rate of influenza. So there are two problems that lead to the need for annual flu vaccines. First, the flu can mutate into many different combinations of proteins/virulence factors. Second, the antibodies acquired from the vaccine only last for a short time, sometimes less than the flu season.  So the short answer is no, 10 years of vaccination is not likely to give you much more protection than someone being vaccinated for the first time.	1643135864.0	hu6pknj	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6pknj/
bndbg	Isn't there cross-reactivity of the immune system for similar pathogens?

7kgi6	You are actually describing two different processes that happen in the evolution of antigen binding proteins (antibodies or T-cell receptors). I will describe antibodies as I think people are a little more familiar with them, but T-cell receptors work in very analogous ways.  First, before any antigen is present, B-cells will undergo *random* gene shuffling to create a large set of antibodies. Each cell will do so independently, without any input, and create some sequence of antibody that only that cell can produce. After the randomness, there is a process of selection, where cells that are making antibodies that don't fold right, or don't get expressed right, or bind something that is present on the surface of host cells will receive a trigger to kill themselves. Those cells die, new cells are created all the time, and ones that did not receive that trigger, stick around for a little while producing some amount of the antibody.  At some point an antigen gets into the system. There is interplay between cell localization, signals between different cell types, etc. but we can simplify. Some antibodies will bind antigens and start triggering whole cascades of signaling between different cell types. Eventually (simplifying a lot) the cell gets the signal that the antibody is binding, and to do two things. One, make more cells whose job it will be to produce a lot more of the antibody, and two, start replicating and making more of the B-cell. During that second step, the b-cells are set-up such that when they replicate, they have a very high rate of introducing mutations into the area of the genome that codes for the antibody.   In this case, the cells again *randomly* add extra mutations, but working off of the background of an antibody that has already had some function. So there is some "memory" but there is certainly no final goal. Simply random changes. After that set of antibodies is created, the process repeats. Antibodies with better activity are selected and more b-cells are created, more Ab is produced, and more variants are created. When the new variants get random mutations that don't perform as well, those cells get the message to kill themselves and not reproduce. In total, you end up with a large number of different antibodies against an antigen. In acute infections this can be easily hundreds of different sequences of antibodies that will all bind the antigen. Usually, only a few sequences will dominate around 2-3 weeks after presentation, which is when you have maximal immunity and clear the antigen from the blood.  As with all evolution, on the micro to macro scale, the variation is random and comes first, then selection pressure is applied, and more "fit" individuals (cells, clones, species, etc.) survive. There is no goal, so there can be no knowledge of how close or far you are from some specific thing, however, there is some "memory" in the sense that all biological entities come from other biological entities and the genetic code is carried over.	1643136131.0	hu6q9u7	t3_scfk7f	t3_scfk7f	/r/askscience/comments/scfk7f/does_the_immune_system_remember_its_last_attempt/hu6q9u7/

iy0cq	If you are unvaccinated, then your body will make antibodies until it finds one that binds to the virus, but because it is random, it could bind anywhere on the virus. You could develop antibodies which bind and region, it's a crap shoot. Vaccination with mRNA vaccines forces your body to find antibodies that bind to the spike protein. It was designed this way because the spike protein for COVID is especially inflammation inducing. It also maximizes the chances that antibodies, when binding to the spike protein, interfere with the spike protein binding to it's human target protein (ACE2 receptor).  Let's say you got COVID in 2020, and your body fought it off by finding an antibody that bound exclusively to the nucleocapsid. That means if you got the vaccine, your body would start all over again, finding an antibody against the spike protein this time, because the N-protien antibody would have very low affinity for the spike. Then, say you got COVID again, your body would likely start producing both antibodies, since both protein regions would show up when presented to the B-cells (?).   If your body got lucky and built antibodies to the spike protein in your initial infection, and then your were vaccinated afterwards, your body would continue to refine it's antibodies so they bind more strongly, or at the very least, increase your base antibody production to prevent future infection.	1643136363.0	hu6qw72	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu4i1zy	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu6qw72/
gekpw	It's about correct.  The first reaction in the pp-chain proceeds very slowly, and acts as a bottleneck for the entire process. So the rate at which reactions are occurring per unit volume in the sun is very low. But the sun has a huge volume (even just considering the fraction of the volume where nuclear burning is going on), so the total energy output of the entire sun is still large.	1643136393.0	hu6qz0j	t3_schi5m	t3_schi5m	/r/askscience/comments/schi5m/core_of_the_sun_produces_same_amount_of_energy_as/hu6qz0j/
fnu93	This. While highly variable, flu strains do bear more or less resemblance to each other. Another example of this was the 1957 “Asian Flu” pandemic. During the vaccine creation process for that crisis, researchers discovered that the only people who seemed to show effective antibodies were survivors of the 1889-90 “Russian Flu” pandemic who by then were in their 70s and 80s.   https://www.history.com/news/1957-flu-pandemic-vaccine-hilleman   “Hilleman couldn’t find any evidence of population immunity to this new strain, so he sent the virus to other health organizations to confirm his findings. These organizations found that the only people who had antibodies to the virus were a small group in their 70s and 80s who had survived the “Russian flu” pandemic in 1889 and 1890.”   So, bottom line, it’s unlikely that prior year vaccinations will help you with any one flu strain, but it’s possible.	1643136545.0	hu6rdk7	t3_scirna	t1_hu6mind	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6rdk7/

At 43,000ft if a rapid decompression occurs, your TUC is just 5 seconds. At 40,000 it doubles to 10 seconds. That's the amount of time a passenger has to pull the mask down and strap it to their face before they will become unable to take proper protective action due to oxygen deprivation.	1643136623.0	hu6rlc5	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu6lbf4	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu6rlc5/
iy0cq	The booster will give you a head start by at least increasing the amount of antibodies present at resting levels. There is still binding of antibodies to Omicron, even if it is not strong enough to prevent re-infection. Your body will have a head start developing stronger binding antibodies, while the weakly binding antibodies will still block some of the virus from binding to your ACE2 receptors.   So while it won't prevent an infection, you will be days ahead of the curve. Whereas if you didn't have a booster, your body would be playing catch up, having to first ramp up it's weakly binding antibodies, before starting to refine them to bind more strongly. The booster essentially buys you time by having your body primed to fight something that looks like Omicron.	1643136761.0	hu6ryvo	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu6njuf	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu6ryvo/
n27na	I have a very hard time to figure out what you are asking...  > the string theory assumption of 10 dimensions.  It is more than an assumption, but sure, there are people working on sub- or super-critical (as they are called) strings and their consequences. But it is not a wide area.  > that number is as many as is needed and the theory is _not_  That number is, lets say "preferred", but when you say that the theory is not needed, what do you mean?  > assuming that there is evidence against 11 and up  There is as little evidence against/for 10 as it is against 11, I would say. String theory is the theory that arise from considering a string, and it leads to a lot of predictions, or lets call them "consequences". These include an even higher dimensional theory, M-theory, which is the theory you get from considering M2-branes (2-dimensional membranes). If you prove 11 dimensions do not describe reality, you have proven string theory (at least how we understand it) does not describe reality.  > if there is nothing in them and nothing moves in them, or whether a dimension is strictly descriptive of a relation  Oh, it is definitely not at all that nothing is in these extra dimensions or that nothing moves in them. They have incredible rich in structure and dynamics. When we develop models all of the complicated dynamics and structures one have to solve is almost exclusively from what happens in the extra dimensions.  With these clarifications, perhaps you could rephrase the question?	1643136784.0	hu6s142	t3_sar7af	t1_hu6ctn3	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/hu6s142/

dl74xa6t	I'll try. I think this is the key point here:  \> "If you prove 11 dimensions do not describe reality, you have provenstring theory (at least how we understand it) does not describe reality."  My question is, are dimensions needed in the description *because* they describe a feature of an empirical entity, or are the dimensions *themselves* a feature of reality? E.g. if *everything* was two-dimensional, would an account of reality that assumes only two dimensions be a full account of reality? Or would that description be incomplete, because it fails to take into account the third dimension, even if that dimension is irrelevant to any empirically accessible entity?  edit: The inverse of which would be, I suppose, that even if only 10D was needed for a full account of strings, and thereby an account of all of reality, there could be additional dimensions - infinitely many of them - that "exist" without being relevant to the phenomenology of anything.  (I'm referring to a - by now very old - paper by V.A. Rubakov called "Large and infinite extra dimensions". It is probably on arxiv, if you care about the question enough.)	1643137186.0	hu6t3jg	t3_sar7af	t1_hu6s142	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/hu6t3jg/

iy0cq	Just to reiterate what was said in the other excellent comment, there really isn't a difference in the antibody. Antibodies really just bind to something, blocking it from binding to something else, and tagging it to be cleared by immune cells.   Think of them like targeted bombs against a warship. N-proteins protect the capsid, kind of like the hull of a ship. S-proteins are like the targeting computer of a ship, letting it identify and target enemies. If you wanted to design a bomb that did the least damage and prevented the ship from doing damage, you'd probably pick something that exclusively targets the ship's targeting computer. That way, the ship is rendered essentially useless with a small bomb, and you can go and take the ship over rather peacefully once it cannot engage. Versus, if you target the hull, it's reinforced and will only really work if you can completely compromise the hull and sink the ship.   That's why we design vaccines to specifically target the spike protein. The antibodies aren't that different, but they are targeted to block the virus's biggest threat.	1643137324.0	hu6tgnj	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu58gd4	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu6tgnj/

a6aftmyk	As others have said, clinically not usually, otherwise we wouldn't recommend a shot every year.  However (and this doesn't directly answer your question but is related), it's possible that the strain to which you're *first* immunized or infected with, presumably early in life, may modulate your immune response.  Specifically the notion of original antigenic sin (OAS) proposes antibodies to that initial strain may still do a *so-so* job at binding later strains (that is, they're cross-reactive but their affinity to the original strain is better), downregulating your body's need to generate novel B-cells that are *really good* at targeting that strain.  Longitudinal studies reinforced this hypothesis. When strains re-emerge, people who were originally exposed to that same strain (usually decades earlier) showed fewer clinical symptoms and enhanced antibody binding via serology than other generations.	1643138019.0	hu6v9vc	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6v9vc/

11qgai	You are correct.  If humans inbred continuously and kept the population closed so that new recessive genes did not enter the pool, the dangerous recessive traits could eventually be bred out of the group.  Of course, this assumes enough of an initial population so that they did not die out as a group through attrition early on.  Assuming normal sexual reproduction, unassisted by science, the earlier generations would likely have a high incidence of these issues, leading to stillbirths, fatal birth defects, and other less fatal defects that might still impact reproductive capacity later on.  The problem with inbreeding, even after that process has completed, is that the resulting group becomes much more susceptible to similar diseases and would still retain any genetic disadvantages which are not serious enough to prevent breeding.  So, anything that made you sterile or unable to thrive as a young person would be removed eventually.    However, something that vastly increased your chances of lets say, fatal cancer just outside of the reproductive age range might well remain more or less permanently.    A genetic program that was dedicated to not only breeding for expressed traits, but also had careful genetic testing of mated pairs combined with extensive genome mapping could provide a better outcome, in theory.    The effort would need to be massive, but it might be possible with some of the genetic and reproductive technologies we have today.  The problem with doing that is you end up with a monoculture in that group, which may have some advantages, but ultimately there is a reason that sexual reproduction evolved.    Even if you inbred to the point where you now breed true in your brother/sister populations, you just get a group of more or less normal humans with a very closely related set of very human genetic traits that could all be wiped out by a single disease which they were all particularly susceptible to.	1643138362.0	hu6w6l9	t3_sc1owz	t1_hu5zo3t	/r/askscience/comments/sc1owz/the_mite_genus_adactylidium_has_an_unusual/hu6w6l9/

n06ju	No problem, it's a really great question that strikes at the heart of how our knowledge of molecular biology is used to help manage the pandemic.  For example, one important reason we want to know the levels of N-antibodies in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals is because N-antibodies are the only way to tell if you've been infected using an antibody-based assay.  A vaccinated individual will have S-antibodies floating around in their blood, but no N-antibodies.  This is because the vaccine only teaches your body to generate an immune response to the spike protein.  N-antibodies as of now can **only** come from an immune response to the virus, because your body is picking apart the virus as a **whole** and learning how to develop antibodies to the entire mess.  If you developed a rapid antibody test for covid looking for the presence of S-antibodies, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between someone who's vaccinated and **never** been infected, or someone who **has** been infected.  Testing for N-antibodies however lets you distinguish the two!	1643138575.0	hu6wr1n	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu56tnp	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu6wr1n/
gelv4fss	>How can there not be mountains of money to fund research into every facet of something like the flu that affects hundreds of millions of people annually, some severely?  There is.   It's one of the most studied diseases on earth.     That's why we have a new flu vaccine ready to go every flu season.   Medical science is not magic.  Throwing more money at a problem does not guaruntee it will be solved.      As other have said, the viruses behind influenza mutate all the time, and with that mutation,   previous vaccines often become ineffective because the protein coating and signature of the new flu strain is so different from the previous that the body's immune system no longer recognizes it as the same thing.	1643138849.0	hu6xh69	t3_scirna	t1_hu6waz4	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6xh69/
39l3sezj	Yes, cross-reactivity is very real and often times helpful for providing some protection. However, cross-reactivity only works if the two pathogens are “similar enough” that this would happen. We don’t get cross-reactivity between measles and SARS because they’re so different from each other.   Alternatively, individual variants of a virus are more likely to induce a cross-reactive response because they are in the same lineage. But as more variants are made, they can distance themselves to a point that it is more foreign to our immune system than previous variants. This is somewhat what we are seeing with omicron. [This study ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00844-z) is an example of investigating cross reactivity among variants	1643138975.0	hu6xt3e	t3_scirna	t1_hu6psll	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6xt3e/

i7bd6	There are a lot of other common kinds of mutations than 1 for 1 amino acid swaps. Most mutations have no effect, but the ones that matter for flu are ones that affect their surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). These are the proteins that antigens target. Slow gradual changes through small mutations in the genes that code for these proteins are called antigenic drift. Another type of change is called antigenic shift, which is where there is a major change in the genes that code for HA or NA and new proteins are coded for that aren't closely related to old ones. That happens when a flu that only infects animals makes the jump to people. It's also the cause of all of the pandemic flu strains we have ever had.   These antigenic shift mutations generally come from a virus picking up new DNA from another virus. When an organism is infected with a couple of different viruses at once, fragments of the viruses can form new combined viruses. The 2009 swine flu pandemic was a new virus that had genetic material from North American and Eurasian swine flus plus human and avian flus. They all voltroned up to make a new flu nobody had immunity for.	1643139705.0	hu6zr85	t3_scirna	t1_hu6og2o	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu6zr85/

14iaj1	I think there is plenty of evidence that you retain immune memory and have an improved response upon subsequent re-infection that is tailored to specific major strains that you were exposed to historically.  Take this paper for instance that discusses that both history of infection and the order of early childhood infection impacts the strength of the response and the bias in the response to newly mutated versions of a given subtype.  [https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008109](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008109)  Of course antigenic drift means new infections don't get beaten down by an immune response to the point where symptom or even serious illness/death are reliably avoided, but its far from a clean slate immune response.	1643140069.0	hu70qbo	t3_scirna	t1_hu6mbf4	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu70qbo/

587d9	*Maybe*.  About 2 minutes into [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQOIfmR9SR0) she discusses a study that found that receiving an *influenza* vaccine within 6 months of contracting Covid-19 were less likely to have a severe reaction (though not including death, somewhat surprisingly) to Covid.   The upshot of the video is that vaccinations in general act to "exercise" the immune system and boost appropriate immune reaction (ie: kill the bad things while not going into a cytokine storm) to pathogens unrelated to the target of the vaccination. This video is about the response to Covid, but there's no real reason that you wouldn't see a similar improved response to influenza.

g2gra4v8	This may be due to lifestyle. People who are more social have a much higher base rate of infection than people who are more secluded.  Obviously I don't know your life or their lives, but that's one possible factor of many.  Also, the flu shot doesn't *just* prevent infection. It can also help lessen the severity even if it doesn't prevent infection altogether.	1643140369.0	hu71jrh	t3_scirna	t1_hu6xm8i	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu71jrh/

am3co	This comment isn’t entirely correct, as it focuses on whether a specific vaccine will work for a later variant. Which half the battle.  The other half is that your immune system learns from previously bested infections, of all types, and this data is stored in mRNA. You can think of mRNA as DNA’s cloud storage if you aren’t familiar.   In that way, your immune system can legit say,  >[dramaticized]Do you see what happens when you try to fuck a stranger in the ass?

jjeop	If you'd look further than this Reddit thread you would find the answer. It depends. In some cases previous infection or vaccination will have a measurable impact on the body's immune response to a new strain and other times it will not. It depends on what strain you were vaccinated against and which strain you're exposed to in the future.   That's the answer, sometimes yes, sometimes no - luck of the draw.

bo51q	The answer was a clear "no."  The reason it was worded "probably not" is because it's worded in the terms of science, which are always almost about probabilities.  If the new mutations of any given strain happen to render it vulnerable to the antigens produced by a previous vaccine, then yeah, though the longer ago you had that shot, the longer it will take your body to respond, so you'd still might well have some strong symptoms for a few days.  That's why you can have some colds that suddenly go away on day 4 or 5 and others that take 2+ weeks, the longer ones were novel to your immune system.  In short, asking for a positive yes or no on the topic  ***is*** asking for magic.	1643141142.0	hu73mis	t3_scirna	t1_hu70gsu	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu73mis/

2rrgnwlb	When chains of polymers interact (which can vary between a few 100-mers to 100,000-mers), they can latch onto different segments of the chain due to strong intermolecular forces that 'stick' one strand to another. Sometimes, different components can 'cross-link', which is when a covalent bond forms between the strains. Both cases create longer strands than the individual polymer molecules themselves, so it creates a rope-like texture. Other effects in play include coiling of the polymer molecules simply because of the sheer size of these molecules. Typically, it's a function of the intermolecular behavior between the different polymer components.  Xanthan gum is made up of chains of sugars, which bond strongly to water (hence it's viscosity effect in foods). PVA glue is made up of polyvinyl acetate, which is quite polar and somewhat water-soluble, and is easily absorbed by wood and paper materials (hence its use in paper products) so it can adsorb onto the xanthan gum chains. Polystyrene is relatively non-polar and is less likely to attach to the other two polymers, but acetone acts as a dissolve and can detach the polymer strands, forming a turbid solution of polystyrene. That allows the polystyrene chains to entangle amongst the xanthan polysaccharide and polyvinyl acetate chains.  Borax detergent, which is made up of sodium tetraborate, can form boron-based cross-links that covalently connect strands of polyvinyl acetate together.	1643143077.0	hu78sv7	t3_scmuxx	t3_scmuxx	/r/askscience/comments/scmuxx/what_determines_if_a_substance_is_stringy/hu78sv7/

gt1yd	Yeah, viruses mutate (antigenic shifts) - just look at COVID.  The flu virus strains are decided for the northern hemisphere after seeing what strains are prevalent in the southern hemisphere (their winter is our summer and vice versa).  It's just an educated guess because there is no guarantee the strains will be the same by the time they get here, so some years the flu vaccine is highly effective and some years it isn't.	1643143959.0	hu7b5wa	t3_scirna	t1_hu79066	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7b5wa/

68sj2	The thing to remember about viruses is that they are not living organisms and do not intentionally "do" things in a way we often conceptualize. Some viruses mutate more often and some almost never mutate, and there are benefits and disadvantages to both. If a virus mutates a lot, it has the chance to kill itself off by mutating something really important.   The thing that makes them susceptible is generally the fidelity (accuracy) of their polymerase (protein that replicates DNA/RNA). If the polymerase is error prone, it can introduce mutations in the genome of the virus leading to changes in the protein sequence. In general, viruses that mutate rapidly tend to be less severe in symptoms so we don't prioritize vaccines because they are 1) less severe and 2) the vaccines would not provide long lasting immunity.	1643144093.0	hu7biz0	t3_scirna	t1_hu6vbxu	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7biz0/
3i4og1qs	I had my second Pfizer vaccine January 2021. Then I caught delta in August, before booster recommendations came out. Was I more likely to be infected because it had been so long since I was vaccinated? I understand I had protection from severe disease - just asking about likelihood of infection. THEN, booster recommendations came out with no mention of a waiting period after delta infection. I had the booster in October. Now, just over 3 months later I am infected with omicron! Do vaccines protect against infection at all, or did I just get unlucky with the timeframes? Of course I’m wondering about my likelihood of contracting the next variant, and the timing of these vaccinations since antibody levels drop after a few months.	1643144405.0	hu7ccxc	t3_s62icy	t3_s62icy	/r/askscience/comments/s62icy/is_there_research_yet_on_likelihood_of/hu7ccxc/

6p5rk	There is a reason computer viruses are named after their biological counterparts. A computervirus is a program, but a program only does something when executed by a computer. A program by itself is just a code, it needs something to run on. And even then, the computer is following orders of the program, but the program itself is not really 'alive'.  A biological virus is just like that. It doesn't breath, or do any metabolism or other chemistry by itself. Neither creates nor uses energy. It just floats around as a particle. When it attaches to a cell that it can infect (which is all based on binding to some proteins it randomly bumps into!) the DNA or RNA from the virus enters the cell. There the cell is 'ordered to' do all kinds of things, and making new viruses is definitely on that list.	1643144990.0	hu7dx5u	t3_scirna	t1_hu7co75	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7dx5u/

dh0na	[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus#Life_properties), it's debatable whether viruses can be considered living. But some strikes against viruses include:  * Viruses don't have a cellular structure  * Viruses don't have any metabolic function  * Viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell  * New viruses are assembled inside the host cell, rather than reproducing via cell division	1643145060.0	hu7e3su	t3_scirna	t1_hu7co75	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7e3su/
bila8	No they aren't.   Unlike bacteria.  The distinction is that bacterias are cell based organism. These cells divide into two to replicate.  Viruses are like a little spaceship that carries a something akin to a computer code (DNA, RNA). They cant reproduce like a bacterial cell and instead require the spaceship to dock with a living cell and inject the code into it. This code takes over the cell reactor thing and forces it reproduce more virus.  This is why antibiotics (biotic basically means a living thing) only works on bacterial infections - because it is alive - and not on viruses which aren't alive.	1643145146.0	hu7ec55	t3_scirna	t1_hu7co75	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7ec55/
d4hec	There are two things at play: drift and shift.     Drift occurs due to random mutations in the viral genome.  The influenza viruses uses RNA for their genome and replicate that RNA using an RNA polymerase. The herpes virus families (including VZV and measles) are DNA viruses and replicate using a DNA polymerase.  HIV is an RNA virus that replicates with a reverse transcriptase that goes through an intermediate DNA step (aka a retrovirus).     Each one of these replicating enzymes has an inherent error rate.  DNA polymerase a generally have a low error rate while reverse transcriptases like HIV has usually have a very high error rate.  That error rate contributes to the propensity for genetic drift.     Genetic shift is what causes flu pandemics.  There are 4 influenza types with type A being the most relevant.  It has two proteins, one that tricks the cell into engulfing it into a little globule and another which then releases the engulfed virus from the globule.  Those proteins (H and N) are what our immune system must recognize and neutralize.  (Basically like COVID’s spike but in two phases).  Flu A has 19 H variants and 11 N variants.  Different species are commonly infected by different H and N combinations. Right now humans have H3N2 and H1N1.  Pigs and ducks have different combinations in their predominant strains.  When one of these susceptible species has their own flu variant and then gets co-infected by flu from another species, the H and N can get rearranged into a novel combination and passed back to either of the original species.  That’s when we get a huge pandemic.	1643145212.0	hu7eid5	t3_scirna	t1_hu6vbxu	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7eid5/
37nkb	When H1N1 took off in 2009, it primarily affected younger generations, with something like 80% of deaths occurring in people under age 65 (which is very unusual for influenza). It is my understanding that this was because a similar strain of the flu made the rounds in the 1950s. Half a century later, those antibodies were still kicking around and saved a *lot* of lives that year.	1643145401.0	hu7f0jo	t3_scirna	t1_hu769y2	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7f0jo/

1p3ecor	I think you might be implying that the immune system learns general lessons about how to beat infections (by raising body temperature, etc.). Those responses, part of the innate immune system, are hardwired into our bodies, not learned over a single human's lifetime.   The adaptive immune system, the part that learns, actually stores the information by evolving white blood cells that are good at recognizing the shape of something dangerous. Each cell has mutations in the genes that control the shape of some receptors. The ones with receptors that match well stick around for a long time. So the information is actually contained in the DNA of some individual cells. mRNA wouldn't work well for that. It's too fragile for the long-term storage of information.	1643146269.0	hu7hbpx	t3_scirna	t1_hu72m2o	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7hbpx/

s8fa3	Without reading the linked study, but having done a similar calculation myself previously, I'm pretty sure that's not how it works.     The 1/40 chance is so low because the base rates of flu exposures and infections are not very high. 50% or so (^(+)/- 30%) of those inoculated might have a useful enough immune response but never be exposed to the virus. So they would presumably still get some benefit when exposed to a similar virus later on.	1643149257.0	hu7ov0f	t3_scirna	t1_hu78nod	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7ov0f/

9dswi	None of the top answers answer your question, or seem to understand it, which is frustrating.   There are studies on this very question, and the answer is actually the opposite. People who have been vaccinated just for the current year, and not for previous years are less likely to get the flu, then people who have been vaccinated every year;  https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/11/flu-shots-reduce-effectiveness/  This is probably because you only have a limited immune system - the more diseases and vaccines you get, the more your memory cells are spread out across all of the diseases they're remembering, and thus you have less protection.	1643150649.0	hu7scgh	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7scgh/
9dswi	I don't understand how it depends on the strain matching. In the scenario OP is asking about, both people have got this years vaccine - the same vaccine. But one has got precious years vaccines as well and the other hasn't. How does the effectiveness of the matching for this years vaccine chance the results between the two people? It sounds like you're just explaining whether this years vaccine will be effective or not, without attempting to explain the actual question - will the previous vaccine history influence the outcome?	1643150907.0	hu7t08w	t3_scirna	t1_hu6mind	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7t08w/

141lhz	Something to remember too is that there are often two things that land people in the hospital/kill people when it comes to the flu (and this goes back to the Spanish flu, etc)…  You either have almost no immune response (elderly, very young infants, or immune compromised);  Or you have a Massive immune response. This tends to be young adults (late teens/ early 20s but not exclusively) whose immune systems are still naive to the invading pathogen.  This has been seen in many pandemics / epidemics where a multimodal mortality curve is seen (peaks at different age groups).   Is this a catch-all answer ? No. But it’s something to think about. Getting annual vaccines isn’t just about protection against the virus, it’s also about letting the body recognize the virus ahead of time so the human body doesn’t get as sick (immune response doesn’t need to be as strong).	1643151689.0	hu7v0k2	t3_scirna	t3_scirna	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu7v0k2/
12vtpw	Unfortunately, I can't provide an in-depth answer.     What I can say is that testosterone release is ultimately regulated by the hypothalamus through the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).  There is a decrease in GnRH with age, though I don't know the physiology behind that.  I would hazard a guess that it may have to do with degredation of the transcription process, but can't say for sure.	1643152071.0	hu7vz82	t3_sbtn2u	t3_sbtn2u	/r/askscience/comments/sbtn2u/why_does_the_human_body_stop_producing_as_much/hu7vz82/

fhodm	The practical reason is we have much more electrical power here on Earth than anything we've put in space. The USSR's Topaz-II nuclear fission reactor (designed for space but only ever ground tested) produced a mere 10 kilowatts and the International Space Station's solar arrays produce a maximum of 240 kW. By contrast the Breakthrough Starshot project is talking about up to 100 gigawatts of laser power.  There is however a more theoretical reason. A rocket in the broadest sense is a spacecraft that's propelled by expelling reaction mass it carries. A spacecraft propelled by a laser powered by an onboard reactor is a rocket, specifically a photon rocket - remember that by mass-energy equivalence the emitted laser beam must carry mass away from the spacecraft, and the used-up fuel for the reactor has less mass than the fresh fuel did.  This means that like all rockets, a photon rocket is limited by the rocket equation, which relates the change in velocity (delta-V) to the mass ratio of the spacecraft - the fully fuelled mass divided by the empty mass. The example Wikipedia gives is that a 2 tonne spacecraft with a fusion reactor and laser and 1 tonne of fusion fuel would reach a maximum speed of 0.001c. The theoretical limit would be 100% mass to energy conversion, and even that is still capable of a finite amount of delta-V for a given mass ratio.  While there is no theoretical limit to the mass ratio (considering that multiple stages could be used), the practical limit is from engineering and economics. How big a spacecraft are you prepared to build to propel a certain payload?  But a light sail propelled by an external laser bypasses the rocket equation because it is not a rocket, and can therefore potentially reach much greater speeds without requiring extreme mass ratios.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_rocket	1643152142.0	hu7w5nz	t3_sc4qsl	t3_sc4qsl	/r/askscience/comments/sc4qsl/why_arent_lasers_installed_onboard_laserpushed/hu7w5nz/

12vtpw	With gravity, your blood pressure is less in your head than at heart level.  That goes away with gravity, so your cerebral blood pressure increases.  As far as I'm aware, there are no countermeasures to this.     You can also have retrograde cerebral blood flow - where blood flows the wrong way in your cerebral veins (unlike systemic veins, they don't have valves that prevent this).  No countermeasures that I'm aware of.	1643153383.0	hu7z99q	t3_sa535n	t3_sa535n	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/hu7z99q/

12vtpw	I'd go with not true in the slightest.  Clotting isn't a gravity dependent process, so the absence of gravity wouldn't stop you from clotting.  There is \*some\* effect of gravity on distribution of blood (IE if you lay on your stomach, more blood flow goes to the front of your lungs, if you lay on your side, more blood goes to that side, things like that), but organ perfusion pressure is generally going to be equal to or slightly less than arterial pressure, so it's not like blood flow to organs is going to stop because of low gravity.

30mat3ml	Drag does depend on speed though.  There is parasitic drag, which is like the drag a car experiences, it increases roughly quadratically with speed.  Then there is lift induced drag, which decreases with speed as the efficiency of the wings increase. It also decreases with a larger wingspan, although a larger wingspan increases parasitic drag.  The sum of these types of drags gives a u-shape profile from which one can determine the most efficient speed.	1643154251.0	hu81dx5	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu5t7rd	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu81dx5/
12vtpw	It's not just not an easy task...it's an astoundingly difficult one.  For example, communications to Earth.  In order to communicate with Earth, you need to send a signal in that direction - the broader the arc of the signal, the more energy you need to put into that signal for a particular amplitude.  So, in order to get strong signals to Earth from a space station, you need to send a narrow-arc signal, which in turns means ensuring that whatever you're using to transmit that signal is pointed in the right direction.    If a space station is spinning, this means that you'd constantly be going in and out of being able to communicate with Earth, and anything you wanted to send them would have to be brief enough to be transmitted while the transmitter was pointed the right way.  There are ways around this (multiple transmitters, for example) but those come with their own engineering challenges (such getting every transmitter to point the same way at all times), as well as increasing costs and complexity.  The ability to communicate with Earth is one of the reasons the ISS slowly rotates while it orbits - so the transmitter is always pointed at Earth.     So even something so simple as being able to communicate with the planet starts to become incredibly complex when you start talking about rotating a space station.  The exponential increase in complexity and difficulty, for relatively little payoff (what's the scientific benefit to having astronauts at 1G?  Any experiment they'd do at 1G we could do on Earth a helluva lot easier) is the main reason while rotating spacecraft remain in the domain of science fiction, and probably will for a very long time.	1643154412.0	hu81ryu	t3_sa535n	t1_htt76gh	/r/askscience/comments/sa535n/what_are_the_gravity_related_functions_of_the/hu81ryu/

e5wwg	At constant air density, absolutely, drag increases with speed. So does lift. That's precisely why aircraft need to travel faster through the air in order to support their weight as they climb into less dense air. The most efficient speed you speak of is different based on air density, which is why pilots use the concept of indicated airspeed to control their decisions about aircraft configuration, at least until they are going fast enough to switch to mach control. Indicated airspeed is actually a measure of the quantity dynamic pressure ( 0.5&rho;V^2 ), which shows up in both the lift and drag equations, and is the quantity which must remain constant if a pilot is to fly at his or her most efficient speed.	1643154546.0	hu823lp	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu81dx5	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu823lp/

9dswi	It's not quiet that simple, because the amount of memory cells can change, and there are literally billions of these cells (so you'll never run out of memory), but yes what your saying is basically right. It's important to remember though that parts of this are theory, based on the observation that people with a longer history of flu vaccine have a weaker response in the current year than those with just the current one and no past history. We don't know for sure why it is, at this stage. It could be something different like your immune system doesn't respond as strongly the more times you're given similar vaccines, and if you did the same study with totally different diseases you'd get the same immune response to the current vaccine. It might also be a combination of multiple reasons.	1643154925.0	hu830fz	t3_scirna	t1_hu80pro	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu830fz/

e5wwg	Stall is actually entirely independent of airspeed and is only a function of angle of attack. But there is indeed an indicated airspeed which is the minimum required to provide adequate lift to support the weight of the aircraft in level flight when the aircraft is flying at the angle of attack which produces the maximum lift. It is this indicated airspeed which is often called stall speed, and it is indeed an *indicated* rather than true airspeed.	1643155133.0	hu83i6w	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu830k0	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu83i6w/

iy0cq	Were you vaccinated? If not, your body makes antibodies to whatever sticks to the virus first. It's not necessarily the spike protein. Getting a vaccine would guarantee your antibodies bind to the spike protein.  The key with getting a booster is it increases the number of antibodies around at resting state.  Mutations make it so antibodies bind weaker, but doesn't prevent binding completely. Even weak binding to a viral protein is a million times better than starting fresh. Your body will know weak binding is happening, and will absolutely flood your bloodstream with those weak antibodies. This partially inhibits the spike protein from binding to your cells, slowing the virus's spread for long enough for your body to refine and make strong binding antibodies.   Here are the steps to basically how your body responds to a virus. Remember, in each one of these steps, the virus is replicating exponentially.  1) Virus is detected, inflammatory response activated and virus samples are sent to lymph nodes  2) if there is any b cells activated at all, those b cells start pumping out antibodies to interfere. It takes time to ramp up antibody production.  3) Lymph nodes develop and refine antibodies, hopefully to the spike, but also possibly to the nucleocapsid or other proteins.  4) strong antibodies are released in huge quantities to interfere with virus and target it for clean up. Again, it takes time to ramp up antibody production.  4.5) t cells are sent to kill any remaining infected cells  5) your body keeps making antibodies, but this number decreases over time  So, if you don't have a vaccine or booster, your body first has to ramp up antibody production of the weak antibodies. Then it has to develop a strong antibody and ramp up production of that. In broad strokes, if you are vaccinated and boosted, you get to skip from step 1 to step 3, saving time that the virus could be replicating. If you aren't boosted, you may have to start at step 2 and ramp up your weak antibody production.   The further along in the progression that you can skip to, the faster you heal, and the less infectious you are. If you skip the booster, or any new vaccines, your body is playing catch-up with the virus instead of already having the upper hand. And if you haven't been vaccinated, there is no guarantee you have protection against the nasty spike protein.	1643156588.0	hu87040	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu7wcip	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu87040/

iiw8ykzv	Your answer was brilliant. Thank you for your insight. It is true that vaccination will increase your survival chance.   For the question about timing and N antibodies, I may have some  data to share.   The interval time between doses should be 3-6 months after the latest vaccination. while 6 months is the perfect time (for now) to increase your antibodies via vaccination, It is also a risk of breakthrough infection due to the fact that before vaccination your antibodies also waned to the lowest point as well.   In the case that you have infected or vaccinated with inactivated vaccine, you will have N antibodies. It is interesting that if the individual who had N antibodies got vaccinated with mRNA or viral vectored vaccine, their N antibodies are also increased as well, even though their immune did not reintroduce with N proteins.	1643158406.0	hu8bd4f	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu4ivz3	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu8bd4f/

If I might add, the running hypothesis in your link is:   “The idea is that the antibodies produced in year one may neutralize some of the vaccine in year two’s shot before it can trigger a full immune response, explained Dr. John Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.  Smith also argued that when the vaccine viruses were quite different from one year to the next the recipient would actually get enhanced protection. Positive interference, he called it.”  I believe this is different than addressing the number of memory cells or a limited immune memory. Are you pulling the hypothesis about limited immune memory from elsewhere?	1643158575.0	hu8bs0h	t3_scirna	t1_hu830fz	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu8bs0h/
710ai	Yup, if you are subject to a quality system you need the receipts, you have the certs for calibrations on all equipment that goes out for cal and you have all the records for not only when you calibrated your equipment internally but also what the reading was before adjustment, every asset has a tag to you can find it in your record system and there needs to be a tag with the set torque and when cal is next due (ideally the tag should also block access to the adjustment mechanism to validate that there has been no tampering since the last adjustment too)	1643158609.0	hu8buza	t3_sbyxni	t1_hu68yf1	/r/askscience/comments/sbyxni/why_are_torque_wrenches_rated_differently_for/hu8buza/
11plp2	Think of OAS as the immune system likes to have viral templates to draw from, instead of having to treat every virus like a blank slate.  Between a finite pool of naive lymphocytes, a limited amount that can simultaneous be active (not really relevant in thinking of one response to the next, but it has feedback loops for how it functions in longer terms), it’s a way for the immune system to moderate the amount of resources needed to fight an infection.   The “sin” is that changing that template can be slow, if maturations occur rapidly (like flu’s antigenic shift) you could say that the immune system spins it’s wheels on a template that may only have a handful of matching epitopes, devoting resources in a way which doesn’t fight the new virus.   but the virtue is that a wider array of immune response can occur because one strain to the next may have quite a lot of the same parts, especially if it’s not too radically mutated.	1643158753.0	hu8c7h2	t3_scirna	t1_hu73ac3	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu8c7h2/

qfkab	Possible but unlikely? The flu is weird because, in addition to antigenic drift out also can swap it's H and N proteins with other flu strains. So H1, for instance, can get steamrolled by H2 or something and then effectively disappears from global circulation for a while. When it pops back up, younger people won't have seen it and be more susceptible.  Coronaviruses can mutate as well, but their genome is a single piece of RNA unlike influenza (8 segments), so swapping pieces is a lot more difficult/unlikely.   So, in 80 years, the circulating SARS2 will probably have a spike protein that looks a lot different from the one we've got around today. But, the chance the omicron spike protein will suddenly just pop back into existence is pretty low.	1643159473.0	hu8dxs2	t3_scirna	t1_hu6wjlu	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu8dxs2/

eac746ds	It's been a long time since I did supersonic Aero in my undergrad, so I can only explain it conceptually but not mathematically.   When you start dealing with transonic and supersonic flows the concept of AoA being a function of the angle beyond which the flow will no longer remain attached becomes imperfect as the flow becomes compressible.  It's because the % of lift explained by Bernoulli is decreased. And the pressure gradient now includes a contribution by the increase in pressure on the underside vs the decrease in pressure on the top of the airfoil. The flow is still separating over the top (and so C_L is still decreasing) but now lift is ALSO being generated from the underside so stalls are no longer only a function of the AoA.	1643162487.0	hu8l27n	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu8auy2	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/hu8l27n/
fhodm	If there was only the three objects then the object orbiting L4/5 would be stable indefinitely. In practice what limits stability is perturbations from other celestial bodies. So it depends which system is being considered.  For example there are two known Earth trojans - asteroids orbiting the Sun-Earth L4 or L5 point. The more stable, 2020 XL5, is probably only stable for about 10,000 years, and the less stable 2010 TK7 for about 2000. Perturbations from Venus, which comes very close to the Lagrange point and is almost as massive as Earth, are the main problem. By contrast the Jupiter trojans are stable over billions of years; Jupiter is the most massive planet and neither Mars nor Saturn come close to Jupiter's orbit.  Stability analysis is pretty complicated, I'll link a couple of papers on it.  https://www.astro.auth.gr/~varvogli/tsig-varv-dvorak.pdf  https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/abe6ad	1643162775.0	hu8lqs7	t3_sc4wjj	t3_sc4wjj	/r/askscience/comments/sc4wjj/how_long_can_an_object_stay_in_a_lagrange_point/hu8lqs7/
cshogn00	People do not understand the difference between a vaccination and an immunization.  they are NOT the same thing.   one gives you a significantly greater chance of not catching something, and if you do, it will generally have significantly less symptoms.   The other gives a (often lifelong, sometimes requiring a booster) protection against catching the disease in the first place - see polio.    I think one of the biggest problems we have with the covid vaccination program world wide is that it was not explained properly and many people believed it was an *immunization* and they believed after the jab they would not catch it at all and that is where a lot of the distrust and wild theories have been born from.	1643162839.0	hu8lwcy	t3_scirna	t1_hu74v52	/r/askscience/comments/scirna/if_youve_taken_an_annual_influenza_vaccine_for/hu8lwcy/

Assuming I understand the above cited paper correctly, if the relative hospitalisation reduction among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis is 55.3-fold lower, versus 57.5-fold lower among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and the CI is 95%, does that not make the difference statistically insignificant and thus "little benefit" would be a reasonably fair assessment?	1643168817.0	hu8zprf	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu6im9x	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu8zprf/

ebbrnpsx	An interesting point, especially later in the pandemic everyone entering a hospital is tested.  Being hospitalized for a car accident and then testing positive during the admission could occur, but most hospitals would place primary reason as a car accident. Therefore you could control for that depending on record keeping.  Even if it was not controlled, then you would expect equal hospitalizations among everyone unless you believe that unvaccinated people are much more likely to get into car accidents, break arms, cut themselves, etc.  This seems like a silly notion, you could argue that they are risk takers and are more likely to test positive in general, so that could account for it, but then being unvaccinated with previous infection would not reduce hospitalization at all unless you believe everyone who got infected would start taking more precautions and that all vaccinated people would not increase risk taking due to the protection vaccines offer.  My original point was the the previous comment was trying to wrongful equate total COVID hospitalization risk as similar between unvaccinated with previous infection and vaccinated with no previous infection. This is a false sense of security for those who have never been infected thinking being infected is a good alternative to becoming vaccinated.  The initial infection also has a risk of hospitalization which might get ignored.  Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against hospitalization due to COVID.	1643170978.0	hu94abd	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu5kz6o	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu94abd/

dwx4l	I came to say exactly this. So, I guess I'll mostly just confirm.  Perhaps I can add a little. The skins are caribou, specifically. When I was up in the arctic on an ice floe in June 2002 (now it's May for that trip due to climate change), even just putting a caribou skin over you face down like that starts to feel warm almost immediately. They always kept one or two in the back of the komatics (sleds) that were pulled by the snowmobiles with the tour group members in them in pairs.  Interestingly, caribou herds can be tracked by their slight heat signature from satellites. Muskoxen cannot. Their fur is even warmer, so warm that there is not enough heat signature to track the herds by satellite.  I asked the Inuit guides (through our English speaking guide) why they didn't use muskox skins. The answer was "too warm". They said that when they used to build igloos for hunting trips, they might use a muskox skin as a rug in the igloo. But, they never wore them.	1643178713.0	hu9i5a1	t3_scbdvn	t1_hu9a2yk	/r/askscience/comments/scbdvn/what_is_the_coldest_temperature_a_clothed_human/hu9i5a1/

hkba5	[This comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/r9oijy/protection_and_waning_of_natural_and_hybrid/hndd7oe/) has some discussions on a very good source. Source is OP link.  What it shows is that natural immunity has a great place as a **supplement** to vaccines. When comparing at non-waned periods, vaccines show some dominance. It is questionable if vaccines alone can build as durable immunity, but probably not of much concern because this could also be because of sampling bias (how bad the initial infection was).  There are other sources I can provide that explain mechanisms, but I just want to highlight this data.  Note 1: By robust, I mean more consistent, not necessarily as durable.  Note 2: Israeli scientists also posted a lot more studies saying similar things, but I am too lazy to search rn.  Note 3: This link doesn't talk about how the antibodies wane faster in natural immunity, but that is pretty easily found in other studies.	1643171467.0	hu95apx	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu93ikr	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu95apx/

You can look up further info with keywords like ‘kidney physiology’, overall it’s a pretty convoluted process involving convoluted tubes guiding urine through a bunch of different places with different concentration of various substances, with selective channels allowing only certain things to pass in and out of the urine at each specific point, and some active pumps that expend energy to maintain a concentration gradient of certain substances.	1643179944.0	hu9jztg	t3_scwv0i	t3_scwv0i	/r/askscience/comments/scwv0i/why_urine_is_hypertonic_to_blood_in_normal/hu9jztg/

There isn't a single point where fusion 'switches on' - the collapsing (mostly) Hydrogen will fuse at increasing levels as it increasingly becomes more dense.

izwrfazs	The results you've linked show the opposite of what you're claiming; per 100,000, for previous infection, the infection rate *after a year* is lower (32) than the vaccinated infection rate *after 6 months* (88.9). Vaccine protection also waned faster; vaccinated infections increase by a factor of over 4 in 4+ months, whereas for the previously infected it increased by a factor of less than 3 in 6-8 months.  >Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago. For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.  The conclusion says:  >Protection from reinfection decreases with time since previous infection, but is, nevertheless, higher than that conferred by vaccination with two doses at a similar time since the last immunity-conferring event. A single vaccine dose after infection helps to restore protection.  In other words, vaccine-induced infection wanes faster, which is why the booster is needed.	1643185210.0	hu9r66o	t3_sc5zd5	t1_hu95apx	/r/askscience/comments/sc5zd5/if_someone_is_infected_with_sarscov2_before_vs/hu9r66o/
n27na	> a higher dimensional universe makes no difference so long as no physical phenomena ‘leak’ into the extra dimensions as it were.  But that is the problem in string theory, there is leakage. All of the non-gravity interactions ("Yang-Mills" (YM)-like) can be fixed to a brane, gravity cannot. Gravity is completely different from YM interactions (in string theory, and in reality), and from string theory this manifests itself as Gravity being mediated by closed strings, and YM by open strings -- whose end-points are stuck to branes.  And to elaborate a bit to u/Return_of_Hoppetar inquiries... the first evidence from a mathematical physics point of view that we live in only 3-dimensions (space) is from Newton's universal law of Gravitation or the Coulomb force, both of these scale as `1/r²`, which is entirely due to the number of spatial dimensions. This type of law in any other dimension would be `1/r^{D-1}`, so as u/physexistence said, if a force leaks into the other dimensions we would see it: this rule would change.  But what could, at least at that time, be possible is that the `1/r²`-law is not true at small scales (that is, where curled up small extra dimensions gets to be comparable in size to the experiment size), then it may be discovered that the `1/r²`-law is actually something like `1/r² + [some correction]`. Such detailed experiments for the standard model (which would include basically the Coulomb-law at small distances), reveals so far no room for extra dimensions (results from LHC). Gravity is however very hard to measure at small distances. At least a decade ago it was estimated that we know there is no leakage of Gravity into extra dimensions of the size of a few centimeters (it may have improved today).  So you can definitely not add extra dimensions however you like without breaking some observation. The "extra" dimensions of string theory are all required by "mathematical consistency" in one way or another, and the rules for non-gravity to stick to branes are derived in string theory, not added willy-nilly. You could in principle declare "well gravity is also localized", but then, until you find out the fundamental reason for this to happen, you are building an *effective* description of reality not trying to find a *fundamental* description of reality -- which can be useful -- but the ultimate goal is to find the fundamental description.	1643186708.0	hu9t11a	t3_sar7af	t1_hu8t5cu	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/hu9t11a/

4fzvw	Almost any system of two objects will be gravitationally stable. A black hole's gravity is just the same as any other object of the same mass. At long distances, all gravity looks like GM/r^(2). It's just that a black hole is so small that you can get close enough that gravity gets strong enough that it stops being Newtonian and starts doing weird General Relativity things - but that is only noticeable if you're very close.  The two objects don't need to be close in mass at all to be stable. They just need to have the right amount of relative speed/angular momentum that they aren't going so fast that they just escape each other, and aren't going so slow that they just fall together and merge. There's a big range of possible speeds in-between though, and the two objects can have nice circular orbits, or very elliptical orbits.  Though if they are really close together, then one object *can* start to rip material off the other. This does happen in black hole + star binaries, but also in star-star binaries. It particularly happens when one star goes into a red giant phase, and becomes so puffy and stretched out that the outer layers aren't stuck on very well, and the black hole or other star can start to peel that off to form an accretion disc.  Overall, there's no major difference between a black hole and a star here.  If you're adding a planet, then that's a bit trickier. Basically, only binary orbits are stable. But you can *nest* binary orbits to get a stable system with lots of objects. There's two options here. Either the planet is so far away from the binary that the binary "feels like" a single star, or the planet is much closer to one star than the other object, so that the planet is orbiting that star, and that star and the planet are together orbiting the other object.  You can't put a planet in the middle - it's unstable. If somebody sneezes, the planet will be slightly closer to one star/black hole than the other. The closer object will pull the planet more because gravity increases when you're closer. So any slight push will cause the object to spiral away from the centre.	1643188011.0	hu9unoc	t3_sd0ua2	t3_sd0ua2	/r/askscience/comments/sd0ua2/would_a_binary_system_of_a_star_preferable_a/hu9unoc/

4fzvw	Hubble is in Low Earth Orbit, and spins around the Earth about once every hour and a half. So it quickly gets a view of almost everywhere in the sky.  But JWST is too small to be seen as more than a dot, even by Hubble. The sunshield is 22 metres across, but it's 1.5 million km away. This gives it an apparent angular size of 0.0027 arcseconds, but Hubble's best resolution is 0.04 arcseconds - anything smaller than that is a blur. An arcsecond is 1/60th of an arcminute, and an arcminute is 1/60th of a degree. The Full Moon is about 30 arcminutes (2160 arcseconds) across - half a degree. Jupiter at its closest is about 50 arcseconds across.  So yeah, you could hypothetically point Hubble at JWST and detect a point of light there, but it couldn't see it as anything other than a dot.	1643188454.0	hu9v71c	t3_scvy3s	t3_scvy3s	/r/askscience/comments/scvy3s/can_the_hubble_telescope_take_a_picture_of_the/hu9v71c/
cl3rinzl	Short answer no, that's insane.  That implies that cells can communicate their genetic structure to stem cells.  Longer answer - ugh there's a lot you don't understand.  First off you're talking about B cell maturation, which deals with a *single* gene with multiple different segments.  One thing you absolutely need to understand when dealing with biological mechanisms is how to use terminology correctly.  Immature B cells have germline VDJ segments, they are generated from hematopoietic stem cells.  As part of the maturation process they undergo VDJ recombination to creat an intact BCR.  Take two different B cells and they will recombine differently.  There is absolutely no effect on the progenitor cells.  I'm guessing that you are actually asking about affinity maturation and somatic hypermutation.  But again those mechanisms, while they can occur multiple times to increase antibody affinity, there is no horizontal exchange of DNA to neighborhooding cells.  One thing in science is you have to defend your ideas, propose a mechanism by which it could work.  For DNA to be conferred from one cell to another you'd need a mechanism to make copies of that segment, mechanisms to export it, mechanisms to protect it from the extra cellular space, proteins to traffic it to the correct cells, markers for endocytosis, markers to traffic it to the nucleus, a way for the foreign DNA to be recognized as 'better' and then we can hand wave homologous recombination and try to avoid inducing mutations.	1643188644.0	hu9vfb4	t3_scfk7f	t3_scfk7f	/r/askscience/comments/scfk7f/does_the_immune_system_remember_its_last_attempt/hu9vfb4/

A good commercial battery will provide maybe 500 W/kg with an energy density of maybe 1 MJ/kg. To provide 1 GW we need 1 GW/(500 W/kg) = 2,000,000 kg = 2000 tonnes of batteries. The batteries can provide that power for 2000 seconds. After that your spacecraft has accelerated by 3.3 N * 2000 s / (2000 tonnes) = 0.0003 m/s.

645cs	Just to add a bit to what Astrokiwi said  >Would it be habitable? Would it be possible to place the planet in between the two celestial bodies? Thanks in advance!  The system that will feel closest to this would be that the inhabitable planet orbits the black hole, and then the black hole and the star orbits each other in that binary system. However, the event horizon of a black hole with the mass of our sun would be very small (less than 10 miles in diameter), so it wouldn't really play a huge role in the night sky (if that's what you're hoping).  You're also not going to get any time dilation from one side of the planet compared to the other, because that's simply not how things work (again, I'm just assuming that might be what you're looking for).  Honestly, a planet orbiting such a small black hole in a binary system is not going to be that much different from a planet just orbiting a star. there will just be more "wobble" to the night sky, as the planet orbits the black hole.  Of course, if the planet orbits the black hole closely you're going to see some crazy tidal waves, and possibly many earth quakes and volcanic eruptions, and if the planet is otherwise in the goldilocks zone, it will be very very hot due to the energy created by tidal friction.	1643193363.0	hua17q1	t3_sd0ua2	t3_sd0ua2	/r/askscience/comments/sd0ua2/would_a_binary_system_of_a_star_preferable_a/hua17q1/

xplhs	String Theory was an attempt to create a "theory of everything," a theory that combines quantum mechanics and Relativity into one. The path they took to accomplish this involved creating an 8-dimensional universe with 4 dimensions (3 spatial, 1 temporal) for quantum mechanics and 4 for Relativity. The math was too hard, so they created a ninth dimension to pivot in. The original plan was to have everything reduce back to a 4-dimensional universe like the one we live in. When that didn't happen, they just started saying that the universe is 9 dimensional.  If there were extra dimesions, gravitational waves would dissipate more than they do. If String Theory were true, they would have found supersymmetric particles in the LHC.  String Theory was a failure. It taught us nothing about the universe. It still has no testable hypotheses and no evidence to support it. It's a theory of nothing. The official death knell for it came in 2014 when Witten left, but there are still people trying to milk it to keep their careers alive.	1643195094.0	hua3fgb	t3_sar7af	t3_sar7af	/r/askscience/comments/sar7af/what_does_it_mean_for_a_dimension_to_be_curled_up/hua3fgb/

cmw4mzur	Thanks for the explanation ☺️. One question. Since they know the exact location and dimension of the JWST, is it possible to create an algorithm/correlation between the blur and actual dimensions which can then be used to resolve/back calculate smaller objects or distant objects which appear blue on Hubble Telescope? Just a thought.	1643198228.0	hua7v1n	t3_scvy3s	t1_hu9v71c	/r/askscience/comments/scvy3s/can_the_hubble_telescope_take_a_picture_of_the/hua7v1n/
4fzvw	JWST can't point back towards Earth without exposing itself to the heat and light from the Earth and Sun and overheating. But its resolution is the same as Hubble's anyway. You need a bigger telescope to get the same resolution in infrared as you can get in visible light.	1643198968.0	hua8zua	t3_scvy3s	t1_hua7t6w	/r/askscience/comments/scvy3s/can_the_hubble_telescope_take_a_picture_of_the/hua8zua/
4fzvw	The blur is the "point-spread function", which depends on the optics of Hubble rather than the shape of the object. If you cancel it out, it turns a blurring spot into a sharp point, but doesn't give you any shape information.	1643199054.0	hua94nr	t3_scvy3s	t1_hua7v1n	/r/askscience/comments/scvy3s/can_the_hubble_telescope_take_a_picture_of_the/hua94nr/

gekpw	Whether or not you sink is just buoyancy. So all that’s relevant there is the difference between the average density of your body and the density of the fluid.  However your ability to swim depends on the Reynolds number of the flow that you produce when you move your arms and legs around. The Reynolds number is a function of the characteristic size of your body, the speed at which you move your arms and legs, and the density and viscosity of the fluid.  For organisms that need to live with very low Reynolds numbers (not us), evolution has resulted in some [very interesting and different](https://science.curie.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Purcell_life_at_low_reynolds_number_1977.pdf) methods of swimming than what we do.  Flows at [very low Reynolds numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow) are [reversible](https://youtu.be/nvmtPsBlCAs), meaning that if you just flail your body parts around in some cyclic way (basically what humans do when we swim), there won’t be any net change in the motion of the fluid around you, and you won’t be able to propel yourself. If you happen to not be buoyant in the fluid you’re in, then you’ll just sink.	1643200313.0	huab7jq	t3_sd33hw	t3_sd33hw	/r/askscience/comments/sd33hw/what_makes_a_liquide_swim_able_viscosity_density/huab7jq/

c1wrm	Not sure what sort of perspective you are after - "why" as in the mechanism, or "why" as in the reason - or something else altogether.  Mechanistically Renal physiology is confusing but basically the basic unit of kidney is a nephron. A long U shaped pipe that runs 'radially' in the kidney. The kidney itself has an osmolar gradient which increases the deeper from its surface. This is maintained by selective ion channels and powered by ATP. Under hormonal action, the solutes are regulated after ultrafiltration at the glomerulus. PCT, DCT and collecting ducts. The one that affects tonicity the most significantly is are the aquaporins which are controlled by vasporessin because it controls reabsorption of water. The collecting ducts and bladder have a special lining which is not permeable to water so osmosis does not occur to make the urine isotonic to the rest of the body.  Reason The kidney is the final arbiter of water and salt balance in the body. Ingestion of water and solutes are variable. Losses of water can include: expired air, sweat, gastrointestinal secretions + feces as well as blood loss. The kidney thus needs to excrete the correct amount of water to maintain the body osmolality around 300mOsm. Since most of the other fluids contain a high amount of free water, the body does not need to excrete a large amount of water relative to the amount of solutes resulting in a hypertonic urine.  It's been about 20 years since I last studied it, so if someone spots a physiological mistake, please feel free to correct.	1643200603.0	huabpnr	t3_scwv0i	t3_scwv0i	/r/askscience/comments/scwv0i/why_urine_is_hypertonic_to_blood_in_normal/huabpnr/
bmhdiel	1 blade (with a counterweight) presents the least drag and least power, so some gliders use them for takeoff instead of a tug.  8 blades presents the most drag and the most power, so a military turboprop might have 8 to generate a ton of thrust regardless of efficiency.  Everything in between is a tradeoff. Keep in mind that you can't just spin a 2 blade prop infinitely fast because the tips will exceed the speed of sound, so eventually you add more and more blades but spin slower.	1643200954.0	huacbsv	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huacbsv/

f3l2g	Yes exactly! I didn't mean to imply that reproductive speed was, in and of itself, a driving force for evolutionary change. However it is the act of reproduction that provides the mechanisms for new allele formation in gametes, and therefore subsequently in offspring. Selective pressures will choose the best adapted alleles that are already present, but will not generate novel alleles. Both of these mechanisms are important to the evolution of species.	1643201265.0	huacvp1	t3_s5nej3	t1_htinmpm	/r/askscience/comments/s5nej3/do_species_with_shorter_life_spans_evolve_more/huacvp1/

gsst9	When it comes to pharmaceuticals, one thing chemists can do is essentially curve fitting.  We have a large database of molecules whose behaviours we understand fairly well. Furthermore, we also understand their structure.  We are curious about how a hypothethical molecule may behave.    We take our hypothethical molecule, and using various methods, translate its structure into a 2D or 3D matrix. 3D matrices are more powerful, but are also harder to handle computationally. Often, 2D matrices are enough. For 2D matrix, the columns are usually various structural elements, while the row is our hypothethical molecule. The matrix elements are either 0 or 1, depicting whether the structural element we're studying is present or not (1 is yes, 0 is no).  After we transformed the hypothethical molecule into a structural matrix, we gather databases of similar molecules and translate them into matrices too.  Ideally, we want the same number of columns as we got rows due to how linear algebra works. Failing that, we prefer over-determined (more rows than columns) than under-determined, as over-determined cases can be worked with still.   After we set up our descriptor matrix for the similar molecules to what we're curious about, we assign a column vector that contains each row's "activity" - activity is the chemical or physical behaviour we want to predict.   Then, using the activity vector and the descriptor matrix, we try to solve the M * a = y matrix equation, where M is matrix, a is weight factor and y is activity. Once we obtained a, we use various statistical methods to determine whether our obtained activities can be generalized.   If we find that the activity vector can be analyzed, we multiply the hypothethical molecule's descriptor matrix (well, more of a row vector, unless we're studying multiple hypothethicals. Since 1 row = 1 molecule) with the obtained activity column vector.   The resultant column vector tells us the hypothethical molecule's physical and chemical property.   We can do this for multiple properties.  If you wanna learn more about this method, look up "QSAR".	1643201314.0	huacz2f	t3_sbje6x	t3_sbje6x	/r/askscience/comments/sbje6x/how_do_chemists_predict_chemical_compositions_and/huacz2f/

30mat3ml	You can imagine an airscrew as a disk that accelerates air passing through it and creates a pressure change across the disk. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_theory  The average pressure change accross the disk is called [disk loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_loading).  If you want more thrust, you can either increase the disk loading, or you can increase the size of the disk (length of the blades).  In first approximation, it is more efficient to have lower disk loading and increase the disk size. It is more efficient to accelerate a lot of air a little bit, than to accelerate a little bit of air by a lot. As an analogy, if you sit on an office chair you need less energy to accelerate yourself by pushing away another person on an office chair than if you push away an empty office chair.   However, if you make the blades too long, the tips reach high speeds quickly, and you don't want them in the transsonic regime, which causes sonic boom that can cause damage, wave drag and so on.  You can also increase the disk loading, this you can do by increasing the rotation speed, but at some point you run into the same problem with the blade tips. Instead of increasing rotation speed, you can also add more blades.   With more blades you can run into the problem that they are affected by each other's turbulence.  In the end it is a complex tradeoff.	1643201770.0	huadt72	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huadt72/
hgk5l	The positrons are produced inside your body, not by the scanner. You are given some radioactive material that emits positrons when it decays. By far the most common is fluorodeoxyglucose (a sugar) labeled with fluorine-18. The sugar gets preferentially taken up by cells that are using lots of energy, so the intensity of positron radiation gives you a map of the body's energy usage.  The positron-emitting isotopes are short-lived. Fluorine-18 has a half-life of just under 2 hours, so it has to be made immediately before use. It is generated by shooting protons with a particle accelerator at oxygen-18 (which is stable and found in small amounts in ordinary water and air). Then it's a race against the clock to extract the fluorine, complete the reactions that create fluorodeoxyglucose, package it, and ship it to the imaging center before it's all gone.	1643202955.0	huag18y	t3_sczxdg	t3_sczxdg	/r/askscience/comments/sczxdg/where_do_the_positrons_come_from_that_are_used_in/huag18y/

xwpqi	Yes, this is the study of turbulent jet flow.    https://cushman.host.dartmouth.edu/books/EFM/chap9.pdf  It’s a deep subject, but here are a few easy pieces:  If the jet is flowing out into a uniform fluid, its shape will be “self-similar”: it looks the same zoomed out as zoomed in, with no preferred length scale.  This means it spreads out as a cone: its cross-sectional radius is proportional to distance downstream.  Experimentally we find the cone angle is always about 24 degrees.  For a jet with no buoyancy, conservation of momentum applies: the flow of momentum through any cross-section downstream is the same as the flow of momentum from the source.    So the flow gets weaker as it gets wider, and you can show that to conserve momentum, the typical velocity is inversely proportional to cross-sectional radius.  Take these together and you see that the jet velocity is inversely proportional to distance downstream.  Twice as far away from the source it goes half as fast.  Other kinds of jets are more complicated.	1643203654.0	huaher5	t3_sd3wcp	t3_sd3wcp	/r/askscience/comments/sd3wcp/what_determines_how_far_fast_moving_gas_can_move/huaher5/

Here're some horrible descriptions!  Within the next 5 seconds,   unless the animals were promptly recompressed,   they began to show marked evidence of gas   expansion and water vapor evolvement. This   was manifested by a high degree of sub-  cutaneous emphysema and expulsion of gas   from the stomach and lower bowel, often with   simultaneous projectile vomiting, defecation,   and urination similar to that previously re-  ported by others (2, 6). The water vapor   effect and gas expansion were of such magni-  tude that the animals became completely im-  mobilized with the extremities, neck, and body   in an extended position, similar in appearance   to an inflated goat-skin bag.   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14334706/	1643203694.0	huahhlf	t3_sc7jz7	t1_hu9iad5	/r/askscience/comments/sc7jz7/why_do_aeroplanes_fly_at_such_specific_altitudes/huahhlf/
gekpw	> But the reason we don’t need high pressure is more the reaction chain, than the high temperature.  That’s not correct.  DT fusion turns on at a little bit lower temperature than the other relevant fusion reactions, but that’s not the reason why terrestrial reactors are able to operate at lower pressures compared with the sun.  The correct answer is that the dependence of *any* thermonuclear reaction rate is much stronger on the temperature than on the density (which is proportional to pressure for a given temperature). So while the sun uses high temperatures and pressures, it’s possible to do it with moderately higher temperatures and *much* lower pressures, independent of what specific reactions your using.  The sun uses a chain of reactions bottlenecks by the weak, deuteron-producing reaction, so the number of reactions per unit volume is low. But since the volume of the active region of the sun is large, that’s still a large amount of power produced.

Since infrared wavelengths are not visible, you don’t learn anything about infrared absorption by looking at the absorption of visible wavelengths.	1643204133.0	huaie2o	t3_sd2log	t1_huacxx6	/r/askscience/comments/sd2log/which_color_reflects_the_most_infrared_heat/huaie2o/
4kmaz	You might find it interesting to read about [this plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_F4U_Corsair). It was designed to have a huge engine (for the time) to drive a huge prop--initially three bladed, later four bladed. In order to allow such a big prop, the wing were bent to give it enough ground clearance.  You could also read about [this plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_XF-84H_Thunderscreech), where prop tips going moving faster than the speed of sound ( a no-no, as u/dukeblue219 suggests) created all kinds of unintended consequences.  In addition, there are plane engines which operate at variable speeds with fixed props, or fixed speeds with variable props. And while in the early days, props were essentially designed based on ease of construction, modern props are computer designed and made with all kinds of exotic fancy stuff, based on the purpose of the plane they're dragging through the air.  In order words, there are a fairly large number of design considerations that go into that choice.	1643204287.0	huaipjx	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huaipjx/

xwpqi	To address your specific example, though, the flow would have to be hypersonic, so the physics I described in the other post doesn’t apply. Accelerating a gas to escape velocity from the ground would involve pressures and temperatures that make a rocket engine look like a joke.  I can’t do that math but I strongly suspect it would create light, heat, and a blast wave that look more like a continuous atomic blast than a jet of air, and it would definitely take far more energy to run the thing than you got from the CO2 you’re trying to dispose of.	1643204495.0	huaj4x2	t3_sd3wcp	t3_sd3wcp	/r/askscience/comments/sd3wcp/what_determines_how_far_fast_moving_gas_can_move/huaj4x2/

o9bp1	To add to this, and somewhat related to the observation of a persons breath by the OP. Things get even more complicated when the flow is particulate in nature. For example the 2m Covid distance thing is from 1930s or so research which modelled sneezes as particles and then you get that everything kind of ends at 2m. Modern research finds that particle flow is not quite accurate and sneezes (coughs too) actually travel as clouds and can happily reach 10m.   Essentially, there is a difference here between the jet itself and the cloud that is carried with it but it is an added complexity to considering "how far can you detect someone's breath"	1643204659.0	huajhbq	t3_sd3wcp	t1_huaher5	/r/askscience/comments/sd3wcp/what_determines_how_far_fast_moving_gas_can_move/huajhbq/

dpk8t	For simplicity, I’ll do this all in metric. Also for simplicity I’m going to focus only on raising the temperature of your body water.   Total body water in liters for a male is weight in kg x 0.6  80kg x 0.6 = 48L TBW  To raise the temperature of 1 liter of water by 1 degree Celcius you need 4180 Joules or 1000 calories (1 food Calorie, note the uppercase C) To go from 37C to 40C you need 3000 calories, 3 Calories, or 12540 Joules. To do this for 48 liters would take 144000 calories, 144 Calories, or 601920 Joules  Watts is a measure of power, which is energy over time. 1 Watt = 1 Joule / 1 second  To raise your temp over an hour from 37C to 40C would take about 167.2 Watts, over a day would be about 7 Watts  Please note this is very basic back-of-the-envelope calculation that ignores heat losses from the body and makes a lot of assumptions.	1643205329.0	huakx4j	t3_sd2u24	t3_sd2u24	/r/askscience/comments/sd2u24/how_many_watts_are_spend_to_raise_the_body/huakx4j/

15rzik	If I have gas that is not moving, when I consider it as a whole, on average, that doesn't mean the individual molecules of the gas are not moving.  They are all moving quite fast, in every direction, but on average the velocity of each of the gas molecules balances out, so there is no net velocity in any one direction.  If I have a gas that is moving at sub-sonic speeds, then there are individual molecules in the gas moving in every direction.  In this case, those moving in one direction are, on average, moving a little bit faster, and those moving in the opposite direction are moving a little bit slower, so the difference is the velocity of the gas, when considered as a whole.  If I have a stream of gas moving into some stationary gas, then some of the molecules of the stationary gas will be moving into the jet of moving gas, and some of the molecules from the jet will be moving out of it into the surrounding gas.  For gases at atmospheric type conditions (around room temperature and pressure), the molecules of gas bump into each other a lot.  There is a measure, called the mean free path, that defines the average distance an individual molecule can move before bumping into another one, and that distance in these condition is tiny, like nanometers tiny.  Every time one bumps into another, there will be some exchange of momentum and energy between them.  The result of this process is that as the jet moves through the stationary air, its momentum will spread as low momentum surrounding air comes into the jet and high momentum air from the jet moves out of it.  The effect of this is that the speed of the jet reduces and the diameter of the jet increases, so it spreads out and slows down.  Exactly how rapidly, in terms of time and distance travelled this happens will depend on a lot of factors like the temperature, pressure and velocity of each of the jet and the surrounding air, and whether the flow is turbulent or laminar.  If the jet is really high velocity so that it is supersonic, the situation is a little different, in particular there will be shocks formed in the flow, but the result of this process, as well as lots of noise and temperature rise, will be a subsonic flow that will eventually behave like the case above.  In terms of the CO2 question, the actual velocity needed to escape Earth's gravity (it's not just a question of getting out of the atmosphere, it's a question of actually escaping the Earth's gravity, otherwise you just create something like a fountain where it goes up in to space and then falls back down again) is far too high.  If you put that much energy into a gas jet and then send it into the atmosphere, the interaction of the two gases will cause a variety of other effects, like ionisation, massive noise, huge temperature rises, shock waves and other effects that will cause the jet to lose its energy to the environment, not only meaning it can not escape the atmosphere, but also causing some extremely disruptive effects to anything vaguely nearby.  Take a look at the satellite images from the recent Tonga volcano.  The velocity of the ash cloud from that volcano was insufficient to escape the atmosphere, and yet the energy release cased a pressure wave to travel all around the planet (it was measured on weather instruments in places like the US midwest), and obviously was hugely devastating to the island where the volcano itself was.  This hypothetical CO2 jet would need very significantly more energy even than that.	1643205717.0	hualrvv	t3_sd3wcp	t3_sd3wcp	/r/askscience/comments/sd3wcp/what_determines_how_far_fast_moving_gas_can_move/hualrvv/

8t0pzwe	As the other reply said, the PET scanner is just a scanner, there’s a whole separate particle accelerator needed to produce the radioactive sugar that is the source of the positrons.  And then there’s the fact that this sugar actually produces so very little positron. A small enough amount that it’s completely harmless to ingest. What’s more, the positrons produced are almost immediately annihilated together with some unlucky electron that happens to be close by. The PET scanner doesn’t actually read positrons, because no positron would make it out of your body. It reads the photon pairs produced from the annihilation reaction.  It’s still pretty difficult to produce antimatters, and even more difficult to *keep* them around after they’re produced. PET technology is just taking advantage of some radioactive isotopes that naturally decay into antimatter, and the fact that annihilation produces a characteristic photon pair. At no point does it involve keeping any amount of antimatter stable.	1643205963.0	huamb9z	t3_sczxdg	t3_sczxdg	/r/askscience/comments/sczxdg/where_do_the_positrons_come_from_that_are_used_in/huamb9z/

1km2sgeq	Disclaimer: Not an engineer  I would imagine it has to do with a combination of:  * The shape the prop blades need to take to actually generate thrust * The lateral force on the propeller blades moving through the air * The amount of space there is at the center of the propeller for attachment points of the blades.  At the outer edges of the prop, there is a lot of room, but near where the power is generated, a bunch of material needs to come together in a circle with much smaller diameter. As the number of props go up, the amount of material down there that is able to hold the blade to the rotor while still producing sufficient thrust.  Think of turbines in comparison. Usually WAY more blades, but they don't need to generate thrust from the air movement as that happens with more with compression and combustion. I'm sure there is a way more mathematical explanation for this, but I'm pretty sure this is the twenty thousand foot view of the answer (pun intended).	1643206151.0	huamq8a	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huaiaxo	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huamq8a/

In fact, I think there's only one obscure model to do that. Most self-launch and/or sustainer equipped gliders have a two-bladed prop, or a folding five-blade. Gliders don't care that much about propeller and engine efficiency, the motor isn't there to fly long distance, just to gain a quick kilometer of altitude and return to gliding.	1643209143.0	huats4s	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huacbsv	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huats4s/

8ndx4	While the maths is sound for raising the temperature in terms of J for the initial jump if it did it in an hour. If this system was allowed to continue every hour the body would be increasing by 3 degrees at this power usage indefinitely and you'd be the temperature of an oven after not too long.  The actual calculation required what difference between the rate of energy lost to the environment between 37C and 40C.  The body is normally quoted as a 100W device at a steady state of 37C assuming all that energy is used for temperature regulation maybe 100 * (40/37) is a better approximation so the body requires 108W.  So 8W extra is used.  Assumptions: heat loss is linear with temp (it's not, but for small delta can be approximate), efficiency (power usage is jot all for heat generation and heating more may be less efficient, bodies are complex bags of chimcal reactions with multiple fucntions)	1643209772.0	huavco1	t3_sd2u24	t1_huakx4j	/r/askscience/comments/sd2u24/how_many_watts_are_spend_to_raise_the_body/huavco1/
r0nlw	The answer is that it depends. To solve this I will consider the heat losses from a human at the two temperatures and make several simplifying assumptions.   1.) The rate of heat loss increase linearly with the difference in temperature between the person and there surroundings. Since the rate of heat loss from humans varies substantially based on how much they sweat, implicit in this assumption is that the person sweats just as much with a fever as without (undoubtably a bad assumption.)  2.) The person, on a normal fever free day with a caloric deficit of zero, burns 2000 calories.   3.) The person's energy lost through breathing also increases linearly with the temperature difference (unsure about this.)  4.) The person is in a 20 C room.   Under these conditions, the person without a fever burns 2000 calories per day per 17 C temperature delta. The person with a fever will have a 20 C temperature delta.  2000/17*20=2350 calories.  The person with a fever would burn an extra 350 calories in a 24 hour period. Taking 350kC/24 h and doing some unit conversions gives you 17 watts. Given I neglected the additional losses associated with sweating this may be a lower bound. This ends up being about 6 watts per degree C of fever.	1643209817.0	huavgrn	t3_sd2u24	t3_sd2u24	/r/askscience/comments/sd2u24/how_many_watts_are_spend_to_raise_the_body/huavgrn/

bskaw9ok	To add to this, as the temperature increases the heat loss increases exponentially (along with power needed to keep warm). For example, in the case of increasing temperature from 37 C to 40 C, the temperature increase is just under 1% (because 0 C is not the lower limit for temperature) but the heat loss from radiation alone increases by almost 4%.

Much of it is about the engine, and what configuration will transfer the energy most efficiently, with a few other considerations like resonance, material limits, and acceptable losses.

10cel8	The Tu-95 also has contra-rotating propellers (where there is a second propeller behind the first that's rotating the other way). Contra-rotating propellers have two features. The first is that they're very efficient, generating a lot of thrust. The second is that they're very loud (generating about 8 times as much sound as a pair of normal propellers).  So Tu-95 is really an example of "How powerful can we make a propeller plane if we don't care about noise levels?".	1643211386.0	huazio1	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huak2ky	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huazio1/
n41yl	The harder a material is, the more brittle and sensitive to crack propagation it is. The general mechanism goes something like: you have a crack (you basically always just start with cracks) and that crack provides a stress concentration at its tip. I don't have my book in front of me, but if memory serves it the intensity of the stress concentration should be proportional to sqrt(a/r) where a is crack length and r is crack tip radius.   There's two simple ways you could increase a crack: through shock loading or through constant force loading. An shock applies an energy into the material. This energy causes the crack to grow along its length until it's spent all the energy by breaking molecular bonds (brittle materials generally have very strong bonds, so the energy isn't nothing, but in theory it's only breaking a single plane of atoms). Constant force loading is going to apply a stress to that crack. Once it crosses the critical level, the crack will grow. This increases stress further, so once the crack starts growing it goes all the way.   This is only true for brittle materials. In ductile materials the cracks self-blunt. Applying force or shocks to the material causes the crack to grow, but because the material is ductile, the material spreads and the crack tip blunts. This increases the radius of the crack tip and lowers the stress concentration back down. It also absorbs energy as deformation rather than just in breaking bonds. Note that ductile materials can also experience crack propagation through compression. When the material compresses, that big round crack tip flattens out, extending the crack tip. Once tension is applied, the crack opens again, extends until it rounds, and stops. Therefore ductile materials can experience crack propagation and failure through cyclic loading, often of loads much lower than you would predict through simple stress analysis. Large structures often fail through crack propagation of welds and joints.   The other way to stop crack propagation is through the use of composites. Embedded materials can provide some elasticity for brittle materials, allowing energy absorption without crack propagation, or by giving something for the crack to run into. Once it hits a large embedded grain of material, the crack tip has been blunted, and the stress is lowered (a counterintuitive corollary to this is that you can stop cracks by drilling holes at their tip, strengthening the material by removing some of it). Embedded hard materials in ductile materials can also stop cracks by preventing the compression crack propagation, and again, providing blunting of crack tips	1643211497.0	huazt6b	t3_schwzl	t3_schwzl	/r/askscience/comments/schwzl/how_do_cracks_propagate_at_a_molecular_level_once/huazt6b/

d9r0u	Water propellers actually have an additional consideration to take into account during design - cavitation.  The fluid medium they're in can phase change under certain conditions if the propeller creates momentary areas of low pressure in the fluid as it moves.   In practical terms this means bubbles, but the formation and collapse of these bubbles can damage the propeller, make noise, and reduce efficiency, so the propellers are designed to avoid this happening.	1643212244.0	hub1st5	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huax08i	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hub1st5/

6plce	Sure, but IIRC the tricky part is inducing the blades to bald naturally rather than simply shaving them (which, obviously, would become a recurring maintenance cost).	1643212329.0	hub215j	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huawv4q	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hub215j/
d8t69	A lot of reason actually.  There’s a limited amount of air that can pass through the propeller in any given moment, and the larger the blade is, the more of that air each propeller interacts with. On the surface it seems like moving more air would lead to more total thrust, but this isn’t really the case.   One problem is that if the blades are too wide and moving too fast, they’ll start cannibalizing each other’s air, and that’s simply inefficient. The faster the blades spin, the more air each blade is able to use, the thinner they need to be to avoid the cannibalism.  Another problem is that the more total surface area that blades take up, the more drag they create. If you want your vehicle to be efficiently aerodynamic and travel at high speeds (like a 500mph airplane) you want to reduce drag as much as a possible, it’s better to have fewer, thinner blades. The only thing is you can’t have only 1 or 2 blades, since they tend to wobble.  The last problem is that the blades create turbulence in the air behind them. Keeping the air flowing through the propeller as smoothly as possible let’s you capture as much energy as possible. And if they’re attached to a flying craft, the bulk of the craft is behind/below the propeller. It’s not ideal for the propeller to eject highly turbulent air directly onto the craft. Minimizing that turbulence isn’t exactly simple, but it too can be solved mostly with a balance of fast-narrow blades or wide-slow blades (and making sure the blades are all the same size and equidistant of course).	1643212458.0	hub2dtp	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huayz18	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hub2dtp/
1210zd	It's also du to the forces in play. With air, you are pushing a lot of low density matter, so you want to spin fast, with a light weight propeller, and each blade isn't under a lot of resistance from the air. A ship propeller, like for big ships, is pushing tons of water each rotation, meaning the blade is under a lot of stress for pushing all that water. You need a big chunk of metal to resist the forces at play.	1643212471.0	hub2f5e	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huaz4kj	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hub2f5e/

9b2o1esk	The analogy is insufficient as our atmosphere refracts light (bending) and different colours of light are refracted through different angles due to their different wavelengths, which is why we get a rainbow. Also photons of light will be absorbed by atoms/molecules in the atmosphere which is why objects appear fainter the further away from us they are. Water vapour is highly effective at this task. Given there is no "atmosphere" in space, refraction cannot happen and photons being absorbed doesn't happen to the same extent (there are still atoms in space to absorb the photons but waaaaayyyy fewer), so if you have two stars of equal brightness and one further from us than the other, the closer star will appear brighter. As you know, Doppler shift is a completely different effect to above. It's not bending light and it's nothing to do with photons being absorbed.         How do we know for sure? Huge data sets covering millions/billions of galaxies show this to be a true effect plus the further away the object, the greater the red shift and this is consistent in every direction we look. Is it possible there is another explanation for this?

cfxqn	Propellers exist to **convert power to thrust**.  You can only convert so much power to thrust from a given propeller design.  So if your engines become more powerful, you can either redesign the prop, or add more of them.  Conversely, adding propellers for the sake of adding them creates extra weight and drag that the engine has to overcome.  Effectively you match the propeller to the engine output.  Propellers are basically just rotating wings and thus follow the same aerodynamics.  * Velocity - Make the propeller able to spin faster (Usually it has to be shorter)  * Surface area - Make the propeller larger (**This is the effect of using more propellers**)  * Coefficient of lift - Basically the combination of the propeller shape and angle of attack.

5gco4	Cavitation isn't far off from the trans-sonic tip problem in air.

d9r0u	Sort of, in the same way that you have to stay below mach 1 tip speed to avoid noise, shockwaves, etc. in aircraft propellers.  In water, you have to stay below the rotational speed that creates cavitation based on a certain propeller design.   A badly designed propeller might cavitate at e.g. 60 rpm, or a well designed one at 3300rpm or higher.        Cavitation isn't limited to the tips or simply based on speed of the propeller, it's fluid mechanics applied to a moving object in water, so low pressure areas can form due to vortices not associated with the prop tips.  Usually, it's a problem on the trailing edge of the propeller.  It's an upper limit for the speed of the parts of the prop through the water that can vary according to prop design, and it's only a limit in that above that speed cavitation happens.  That may or may not be a concern, depending on a number of things.	1643215771.0	hubbhht	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hub9jxt	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubbhht/

A human lives only 80 or so years, which is basically nothing when you compare it to 220,000,000 years. The stars do move around in our sky (it's called the "proper motion" of stars) but it's extremely slow. If you fast forward 50,000 years or so, many of the constellations will look very different from how they do today.

d9r0u	Right, it's just that it's not as simple as an object traveling through fluid, because the trans-sonic problem is due to shock waves and the critical speed varies according to the density of the medium, where the cavitation problem can vary widely even in a constant medium depending on whether the propeller design creates a pattern of flow which allows pressure to drop below the critical threshold.	1643216190.0	hubco02	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hubb846	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubco02/

5gco4	That variance can in turn be exacerbated by temperature fluctuations in the medium (although this is usually a pump problem rather than propellers).

30mat3ml	As I understand the real disk loading on a propeller disk is higher than in the naive picture, since propeller blades impose angular momentum on the flow. Contra-rotating propellers counter this, recuperating some of the lost efficiency. However, because of extra turbulence they are extremely loud, and they are also heavier than normal designs.  As for the disc loading, one has to calculate it by looking at the frontal profile of the propellers. If you generate, say, 10 kN of thrust using two 2m diameter propellers, you will have a lower disc loading than when you generate 10 kN of thrust using one set of 2m diameter contra-rotating props.	1643216970.0	hubev2o	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hub7sen	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubev2o/

12t62w	Disclaimer: I have no significant experience in any of these areas, but the other answers, while insightful, don’t seem to answer the question directly, so I’ll share my thoughts based on what I’ve read.  Generally it seems to be a function with many inputs, but I would venture that an airplane prop is solely a thrust generator, and all it needs to do is generate maximum force and let the ailerons, tail, etc. actually control the plane, whereas a helicopter prop needs to do a lot more than generate thrust so the interference of turbulence between blades is more relevant. Within helicopters, it seems like the idealized version has two blades and blades must be added to large helicopters when length becomes to expensive in terms of dollars, space, and/or stress on the blades (as /u/collegiaal25 pointed out).  Water is an entirely different fluid, so I’m sure the shorter fatter water blade shape is optimized for the much denser fluid. Looking at a water propeller, it generally appears that adding another blade would cause overlap between blades, so it seems like they are already maximized for thrust (in water).	1643217968.0	hubhpcl	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubhpcl/

8ntu46yk	There are constants for the different fluids.  ie:viscosity, density  There are physical state changes for different fluids at different temps and pressures.    The rest of the calculations and theories are identical'ish.  Speed of sound in water is 4.3 times faster in H2O than air.  Theoretically you said 'water' (I will say ignoring cavitation) ... so I say no...    The water pushes back on prop harder than air so the design would need to be beefed up resulting in more friction then more beef up, etc.  So the only 'never ending spin'  is this ineffective loop.    Add cavitation... the boiling would destroy the systems real world positive effects making speed of sound in water not possible.	1643218164.0	hubi9hs	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hubb5zr	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubi9hs/
53dzj	No, not all species have backup sexual reproduction.  Most totally asexual lineages seem to die out eventually, but new ones arise occasionally so there's always some around.  However, a few asexual lineages (like rotifers) have been around for hundreds of millions of years so it's not a hard and fast rule.  >and actually evolve to accommodate sexual reproduction to survive?  I'm not going to say it _never_ happens, but generally you don't see sexual reproduction re-evolving.

53dzj	So vaccines are often studied and approved independently for different age groups (under 5, 5-18, adults).  After all, body size varies quite a bit, so if nothing else they have to figure out dosing changes.    Now, many of our vaccines are have been tested and approved for babies and toddlers because, after all, the greatest threat from diseases is usually in childhood and you want to get people vaccinated before they get infected.  Vaccines have been important for stomping out the childhood illnesses that used to cause something like a third of all kids to die before age 5.    But Covid is different.  It just showed up 2 years ago, so it's new and honestly it's kind of impressive that we have _any_ vaccines approved by now.  Because Covid was killing older adults so much more than kids, efforts in this case first focused on making a vaccine for adults.  After that, they moved down to figuring it out for older kids, doing all the testing and safety and effectiveness studies.  And they also started doing studies on safety and effectiveness in younger kids.  But this got started later because getting the vaccine out for more at-risk older populations first was more important, and it took time.  So studies are only now finishing up.  And the pfizer vaccine trial found the dose they were trying was safe, but not effective, so they are going to have to go back and run another trial.  This is the sort of thing that happens all the time in medical trials, you just rarely hear about it,   Eventually they'll have vaccines available for small kids, once they've done the studies and gotten approval.  It's not anything different about these vaccines, it's just that it's been a short time since the virus showed up and small child trials weren't top priority so they just aren't done yet.	1643219061.0	hubktp8	t3_scux2c	t3_scux2c	/r/askscience/comments/scux2c/currently_no_covid19_vaccine_exists_for_toddlers/hubktp8/

3yzd3	Magnets can (nearly) indefinitely create magnetic fields, this is true. However, this doesn't produce infinite energy. In fact, magnetic fields don't produce any energy. To explain, let's change gears a little and look at gravity.   The Earth produces a gravitational field at all times. However, we don't say "oh, well the Earth's gravitational field is infinite energy source" even though we do use the Earth's gravity sometimes to get energy. For example, we sometimes use [water batteries](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/10-reasons-love-water-batteries), which is where we release water from high altitudes, and allow it to spin a turbine, thus getting power out of it. So, Earth's gravity is providing the force to pull the water down from the high point and spin the turbine, but of course, you're not getting out any more energy than you put into it from pumping the water up in the first place (now, you might think dams circumvent this, but this is just a more complicated water battery, where instead of us manually pumping water up, the sun evaporates water, making it rain at higher altitudes, and then flows down to lower altitudes). So, the gravitational field from the Earth can be used to convert some energy, but it isn't "unlimited" energy.   Magnets are no different. You can spin loops through magnets to make electricity, but here the energy comes from the spinning of the wire loop. You can use a magnet to pull a piece of metal towards yourself, but here the energy comes from the original building of the system (moving pieces of metal away from a magnet takes energy, and you will only get as much energy back from pulling it towards yourself as you put in to building it).	1643221697.0	hubsa27	t3_sd97nr	t3_sd97nr	/r/askscience/comments/sd97nr/permanent_magnets_and_finite_energy/hubsa27/

eq7cm	It does make a difference, but by WW2, planes were heavy enough relative to engines that it mostly showed up when you throttled up for takeoff.  You are absolutely correct that such things did happen, though it was in the First World War. At the time, one of the kinds of aero engines in common use was the rotary (a different kind of rotary from the one Mazda used in the 90s-2000s). The [rotary engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine) had a propeller bolted to the crankcase of the engine, with cylinders arranged in a circle around the crankcase. To spin the propeller, the _whole engine_ spun, cylinders and all.  That meant that the rotating mass was quite a lot larger than it was in later engines, the planes were extremely light. The Sopwith Camel in particular had a reputation as a bit of a widowmaker. It could roll and turn very quickly to the right, because that's the direction the engine was trying to spin the fuselage, but not nearly as well to the left.	1643222250.0	hubttpz	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hubrj4b	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubttpz/

Boiling is when the vapor pressure of a fluid is increased beyond the pressure of the surrounding environment and fluid undergoes a phase change.  If you heat a teapot until it whistles, that's boiling.

Also you usually have to go through the lower altitudes to get to the higher altitudes where it makes a big enough difference. if you get high enough, a propeller is not going to be able to catch enough air to work and will stall.	1643223465.0	hubx8py	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hub65ev	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hubx8py/

f9ja6me2	There's a few components at play here. First, in a ship you generally do not care much about the weight of your propeller. Ships can weight hundreds of thousands of tons. Planes, by comparison, especially small planes have very little useful load. A Cessna 172 may only be able to carry 750lbs combined of people and fuel (full tanks will take > 400 lbs of that). So aviation is always about weight first. I think that largely explains most of the design difference.  Obviously then you have medium differences. A propeller will require more structure to keep itself from collapsing under water. That is less of an issue in the air.	1643223759.0	huby2ig	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huaz4kj	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huby2ig/
7824t	It's not so much the expansion as the contraction that causes a problem. When the bubble forms it's just water boiling, exactly the same thing that happens in a pot of water. Generally a fairly gentle process. But those conditions don't last for long, and the bubble collapses quickly due to the surrounding pressure. With barely anything to resist the collapse all that water surrounding the bubble slams together at the center, creating a pressure wave that radiates out. That's what destroys stuff.	1643223829.0	huby9qs	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hubrho5	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huby9qs/

No energy has come out or gone into the system.  If we create a permanent magnet, we have done a finite amount of work to do so, and a finite amount of energy is stored in the field. Once the field exists, it *stores* energy, much like our mass on a shelf. If the field doesn't change at all for 100 years, then no energy has come into or out of it.	1643225366.0	huc2l1r	t3_sd97nr	t3_sd97nr	/r/askscience/comments/sd97nr/permanent_magnets_and_finite_energy/huc2l1r/
5bis49wt	Correct. Just like conventional current is the "flow of positive charge"--but the positive charge is not what physically moves, it's the electron that moves in the opposite direction. But that definition for current was decided before the electron was discovered, it wasn't known what was moving so the sign was chosen arbitrarily and we just live with it.

The smaller pan would then heat up faster because there is a smaller amount of material to heat.

3yzd3	The fact that the Sun is shining on the Earth does mean the Earth is more massive than it would be if the Sun was not there, but that doesn't lead to the Earth gaining mass over time. Stripping away global warming, the Earth/Sun system is in thermal equilibrium- that means we get heat from the Sun, but the Earth also is radiating heat out into space and the Earth is staying the same temperature over time. The Earth is warmer due to the Sun providing heat (this is obvious), so without the Sun the Earth would have less energy, and thus be less massive, but this isn't a continually changing amount of mass.   Two important notes: first, plants aren't really required here. Yes, the absorb sunlight, but so does the ground, water, etc. They heat up when the Sun hits them. Second, the mass of the Earth is actually [decreasing with time](https://astronomy.com/magazine/ask-astro/2017/02/planetary-weight-loss), due to losing matter into space (light gases floating away, dust leaving the atmosphere, etc). Earth gets mass from meteor impacts, but not as much as it is losing.	1643226481.0	huc5p1c	t3_scoygs	t3_scoygs	/r/askscience/comments/scoygs/if_plants_absorb_sunlight_does_that_mean_that/huc5p1c/

pi78u	> When the bubble forms it's just water boiling, exactly the same thing that happens in a pot of water.  It is important to note that people shouldn't think about the 'steam' in a cavitation bubble as being 'hot' like in when a kettle is boiling at sea level.  As pressure drops the phase change of water to vapor occurs at lower temperatures.  This is why water boiling at 15,000 feet of elevation occurs at 184*F / 84.5*C vs 212*F / 100*C at sea level.   Prop cavitation produces very low pressure across the backside of the blade which allows the water to change phase at the ambient temperature of the surrounding water.  Point being; is it the pressure differential that creates the steam vs heat in a boiling kettle.	1643226848.0	huc6qog	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huby9qs	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huc6qog/
6y75e	At a physical level, you can open/close some ion channels (e.g. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_receptor_potential_channel) by stretching the membrane that they are on ([Bocchero et al 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000750)). There's a little bit of a general and slightly more accessible discussion of this here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanotransduction.  Phototransduction has a similar stage in that photons interact with certain specific molecules which results ultimately in the closing of ion channels changing the flow of ions across the membrane (can read all the nitty gritty details [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_phototransduction)). The opening and closing of ion channels is what ultimately leads to cell firing and our experience of sensation.  This kind of mechanical mechanism for opening and closing ion channels isn't special or unique to the eye -- hair cells in the ear, sensory receptors in our skin, etc. also have some form of mechanotransduction.  Re why you had one experience one time and another a different time, can't really say definitively.	1643227020.0	huc77zy	t3_sd8jk3	t1_huc0jas	/r/askscience/comments/sd8jk3/why_does_the_vitreous_gel_pulling_on_the_retina/huc77zy/
9i4bv2ci	Interestingly, small race boats use propellers which operate on cavitation to generate thrust. What's Interesting there is that we're finding that smaller propellers with higher pitch are most efficient in that specific application. (The opposite of what's being described above)  It's also generally understood that # of blades doesn't really matter once you get to 3 - adding a 4th and 5th blade really only helps with stability. This is likely because the propellers are "surface piercing" meaning that the center of the propshaft is at or near the water's surface and at least 1 blade is completely out of the water at all times, and when more blades come into play, it's really just throwing less water per cycle, but at higher frequency	1643227173.0	huc7nkt	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hub1st5	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huc7nkt/

hgk5l	Even just comparing to other vaccines, more people are vaccinated against polio (with at least 3 doses) than against COVID-19. For just the oral polio vaccine, 10 billion doses have been administered since 2000, [according to UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/executiveboard/media/5501/file/2021_AS-SFS-Polio_Global_Overview-Information_note-EN-2021.05.20.pdf).  The polio vaccine is probably the winner in terms of the percentage of people who have received it, but if you're counting doses rather than people, it will be very hard to beat over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen/paracetamol. Mallinckrodt, the only Western manufacturer of acetaminophen, [reports selling about $200 million of it every year](https://mallinckrodt.gcs-web.com/static-files/a34f1a55-5635-4ff7-a879-8b65f18a8391).

Look at [this page](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/immunization-coverage) for example and you can see that global coverage is often in the 70-80% range.  Since many of these are multi-shot vaccines, that comes to a lot of doses (though older individuals won't be vaccinated in all cases, which will reduce numbers).    I'd say measles and polio vaccines both are good candidates for far surpassing covid vaccine numbers, just for example.	1643227486.0	huc8j8f	t3_sdcass	t3_sdcass	/r/askscience/comments/sdcass/with_the_covid19_vaccines_nearing_10_billion/huc8j8f/

These figures cover extracting energy from wind using wind turbines, but very similar considerations exist for any rotor disk (name for an idealised propeller, rotor, or turbine)  First, mathematically, a steady flow through the whole disk is ideal. That's identified as the "Betz limit" above, which says "60% is the most energy you can extract from the wind in this scenario assuming ideal physics/math within certain assumptions"  Now when you use spinning blades to move the air, you introduce a fluctuation. Everytime a blade passes a position on the disk, it pushes air through with a sudden burst. This means reality strays from the ideal steady flow through the disk. That's what the first chart Figure 3.30 shows. If you could pack an infinite number of tiny blades in the rotor disk, you could get close to that ideal mathematical steady airflow Betz limit.  The tip speed ratio in the graph you can think of as the wind speed. The power coefficient is like the efficiency of the rotor (although that's not strictly true for either, it works well enough for this example)  The second graph is what happens when you add drag. However, each blade also adds drag. That's what you see in the figure 3.31 which is for a 3 bladed wind turbine. You see the infinite blades no drag limit curve up top, followed by the 3 blades no drag labeled Cd=0. Then each curve adds more and more drag as the numbers go from Cl/Cd=100 (very efficient blade) to 25(less efficient blade). Don't worry about Cl, and Cd except that a higher Cl/Cd number is more efficient. Adding more blades will shift all the curves down since more blades = more drag. The effect of drag is even worse when the wind speed (tip speed ratio in the graphs) is high.  So that finally takes us to the answer to your question. Without drag, "more blades=more better" especially at slower wind speeds where the difference is high. With drag, each blade adds more drag ESPECIALLY at high air/wind speeds and inefficient blades. One thing to note is that blades can only be REALLY efficient for a specific airflow, so a blade that has to work at many different speeds will be less efficient overall. If you're designing for a situation where wind speeds are low (like for a helicopter rotor), or if you can really optimise your blades for a very specific air flow (like in a commercial turbofan) you can get efficiency gains by adding more blades. If you want to move air really fast (propeller) or can't optimise for a very specific air flow (like a wind turbine) you aim for a lower blade count.  Obviously this is a very complex topic and there are thousands of scientific articles to cover the topic. There are many other considerations as well. What I've discussed above is one of the most major considerations for blade count and I hope I've done a half decent job explaining it.	1643228624.0	hucbr57	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hucbr57/

7ipvp	>Boiling is when the vapor pressure of a fluid is increased beyond the pressure of the surrounding environment and fluid undergoes a phase change.  Which is vapor pressure exceeding static pressure. It is the identical process, just tweaking pressure instead of temperature. The bell jar example is also boiling. Turning from liquid to gas is boiling, no matter how you do it. Cavitation is a special term to describe _why_ the liquid boiled - ie from the motion of the propeller through the fluid.	1643229459.0	huce4vq	t3_sd3s3u	t1_hubx4h2	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/huce4vq/

ayiel	I have analyzed marine propeller (model and simulation) data for years. Many answers here are insightful and correct. But there are a few basic principles which I have missed, hopefully I can contribute.  First of all, all these propulsion systems (including airplane props / jets and wind turbines) are conversion tools, power to thrust or the opposite. This you want to do as efficient as possible often. Right here practical limits come in play, for turbines there is the Betz limit and for propulsion systems a similar, but speed depending limit can be found. Typically the pitch (angle of the blade) is optimal for a certain speed. Keep this in mind for now.  Say there is some relatively ok 3 blade propeller. Just adding a 4th blade (copy of the others and repositioning all blades at 90 deg angles) will not give more power, it is likely even to cost power. And that is nothing to do with overlap (a 3 blade wind turbine with 6 similar blades will not yield significant more power and may even loose out). This is the point I have been missing in other posts. The reasoning is that the initial optimum design had the pitch of each blade set to have the best conversion from power to thrust or vice versa for the mass flow through the propeller disc, turbine disc or the enclosed engine area and resulting in a pressure differential. This area times pressure diff is basically the thrust. And the propeller design determines the efficiency. Hopefully close to the theoretical limit of the regime under consideration.  Now a 4 blade propeller might be better for some reason, but it will require a new design with different pitch than the 3 blade and likely a different surface area per blade.  An optimum propeller design takes into account many things, power, speed, noise, material strength and even things as ice encounters (ice class prop). In various fields the optimum will vary greatly, hence commercial ships often have 4 blades, submarine blades 7 or even more, while jet turbines have… I don’t even know, 100? And those powerboat propellers are full on sharp edged cavitation knives not resembling ‘normal’ marine propeller design.  Hopefully somebody understands my rambling 😅.	1643229787.0	hucf2id	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hucf2id/

There are lots of ways to generate phosphenes (flashes) including rubbing your eyes, inducing a current in the visual parts of your brain (e.g. with transcranial magnetic stimulation), or simply by being in space -- astronauts report seeing phosphenes because high energy particles interact with either cells in the retina or the brain directly stimulating them.

So at least in theory, fast yaw and pitch rate should lead to increased vibrations on a 2 blade prop.	1643233088.0	hucobh2	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huchstw	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hucobh2/

4rbms	That's more complicated. First of all there are LOTS of different turbines with different blade count, from 1 blade to dozens. But you're right large commercial wind turbines settled on 3.  First of all Prime numbers above two offer reduced resonance and avoid some issues like gyroscopic precession that two blades tend to have. This means a lighter cheaper structure. The large structure (these blades can be mind boggling in scale in a way that's hard to appreciate from the ground) and complexity of the control system that twist the blades and regulate blade speed also means you won't get a lot of payoff from going into 5 or 7 blades, whereas you incur a lot of additional cost. It will generally be more cost effective to buy two 3 bladed turbines than 1 seven bladed turbine that has a small efficiency gain vs 3 blades.	1643233335.0	hucozxr	t3_sd3s3u	t1_huciii3	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hucozxr/
3yzd3	Yeah, but whether or not the thermal energy from the Sun goes into heating up the Earth a little more, or into chemical bonds in the plants, the energy is the same. And since that chemical bond energy will end up as heat anyway (after the plant dies and decomposes), looking at just the heat shows the full picture.	1643233395.0	hucp5u2	t3_scoygs	t1_hucnias	/r/askscience/comments/scoygs/if_plants_absorb_sunlight_does_that_mean_that/hucp5u2/

Those could potentially be gathered, but we know its not rotating and we know what it's made of, so there's not much to be gathered by investigating that pixel.	1643234574.0	hucsftp	t3_scvy3s	t1_hua7v1n	/r/askscience/comments/scvy3s/can_the_hubble_telescope_take_a_picture_of_the/hucsftp/

So knowing the flight characteristics of enemy planes took time, and many probably died before they learned (and in the case of the Camel, both sides!).  P.S.  For instance, allied pilots probably tried to turn with Fokker Triplanes early on (which was what Richthofen was flying when he died).

7824t	Thanks for elaborating a little more on that! You could also say that the pressure drop reduces the heat input needed to boil the water to the point that the ambient water temperature is hot enough. Warmer water will cavitate with a smaller pressure drop.   It's probably also worth noting that because the collapse is much more violent than the expansion, you can get very high temperatures in some cases. If there is [flammable material in the water](https://youtu.be/E5rGFZWQfzk) (in the explosion at 1:46 you can see the reignition as the bubble shrinks) or if you're working with ultrasound in laboratory laboratory environments you can get [some really wacky effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_of_sonoluminescence#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DSonoluminescence_is_a_phenomenon_that%2C%2C_cavitation%2C_and_light_emission.?wprov=sfla1).

K is dependent on the mechanical force applied, the geometry of the object and the length of pre-existing cracks in the material. The material eg glass will have a critical Kc when the stress intensity exceeds the resistance of the material and the crack propagates to failure at the speed of sound. Brittle materials like glass have a low Kc, tough materials like many metals a higher Kc.	1643236288.0	hucwzcw	t3_schwzl	t3_schwzl	/r/askscience/comments/schwzl/how_do_cracks_propagate_at_a_molecular_level_once/hucwzcw/

You could have a given disk area, tip speed, and solidity with any number of blades. Two wide blades or a dozen thin blades, solidity can be the same.

The amount of heat released in completely burning wood is on the order of 15,000,000 J/kg, which means the unburned wood has ~2x10^-10 kg extra mass due to its higher energy content. There's somewhere around 4 or 5 x10^14 kg of plants on the earth, so there's on the order of 100 tons of excess mass stored in chemical energy in plants!

gm3bz62h	There is no one answer to this question as it can depend on a variety of factors, such as the intended purpose of the vehicle and the available power/space. In general, though, the number of propeller blades a vehicle has will affect its performance and efficiency. A greater number of blades will create more lift and drag, but will also provide more stability and control. Conversely, a smaller number of blades will be less efficient but require less power and space.	1643238857.0	hud3lfe	t3_sd3s3u	t3_sd3s3u	/r/askscience/comments/sd3s3u/what_determines_the_number_of_propeller_blades_a/hud3lfe/

1m1e1z	Yep, that’s all correct. My answer also doesn’t account for other places the energy can go, such as heating up the surface of the earth or the atmosphere.  If the system is in steady-state — if the same amount of plant matter is growing as is decaying at any mombent, the temperature of the entire planet us about the same on average, etc — then there is no net change in mass from energy gain or loss as that is constant in that case, as the other answer already pointed out.  But yeah, we’re gaining far more mass from dust infall and losing far more mass from gas escape than we are from energetic gains or losses.	1643307440.0	hugxx2v	t3_scoygs	t1_huf28kp	/r/askscience/comments/scoygs/if_plants_absorb_sunlight_does_that_mean_that/hugxx2v/

Shorter cracks have less impact, but crack here can mean exactly what you think, or a small void or inclusion in the material, or just a rough surface finish.

6r7f8	My point wasn't that in all cases radiative heat transfer is anywhere near as important as conduction, simply to refute that it doesn't depend on gradient. Clearly it does when you are talking about heat transfer between two coupled bodies (like a person and a wall). And when a person is submerged in water, yes, I agree conduction matters more than radiation. But we live most of our lives standing or sitting with thermal insulators between ourselves and the earth.  Your filament example doesn't really give the right intuition.  A filament has a surface area 5 orders of magnitude lower than a person.  An ideal person sized black body at 37 C will radiate about 1000 W into the vacuum of space:  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/radfrac.html  Edit: this is also something that has been studied. I gave two citations (one academic, one lay medical) that say that radiative heat transfer is important. Are there any sources that say that it's not?

cnbms	> Let's say you and I are broadcasting bits by modifying amplitude at 100Hz and 200Hz - won't we interfere with each other?  Generally any nonlinearities (a certain kind distortion) can create harmonics and subharmonics that are multiples or divisors of the signal. These can be dealt with by making sure your filtering gets rid of it.  Generally on the transmit end you have a transmit filter that gets rid of out of band signals. Or your amplifier has a filter built in as part of its matching strategy.  On the receive end it is filtered by a variety of filters, and in heterodyning designs, you use an extremely narrowband filter that you frequency shift your signal into (say you have a filter designed to be narrow at 10MHz, you shift your 100Hz signal into 10MHz, filter it, and shift it back to whereever you need it to be).	1643308751.0	huh1n7h	t3_sdjkl6	t3_sdjkl6	/r/askscience/comments/sdjkl6/how_are_radio_waves_with_multiplicities_of_a/huh1n7h/

e6r4a	No, in general hypocholesterolemia is caused by disorders that prevent the secretion of cholesterol from the liver, for example hypobetalipoproteinemia.  The problem with that is not actually a lack a cholesterol, but a lack of transportation of fat soluble vitamins which accumulate in the liver.    There's also some very rate hypocholesterolemia variants that disrupt cholesterol biosynthesis, for example Smith-Lemli-Optiz.  Loss of function variants in cholesterol biosynthesis are generally not compatible with life.  ApoA-1 milano is basically like having a more efficient trash removal system in peripheral cells that move cholesterol to the liver.   Cholesterol is more efficiently removed from macrophages.  If it takes too much, macrophages can make all the cholesterol they need.  It's kind of the opposite of Tangier's disease.	1643309071.0	huh2job	t3_sdt52s	t1_hugscec	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh2job/

Those that did not, survived and passed on their genes.   But, what's surprising to me, is that they must have passed on their genes to everyone they conquered to a significant degree, but that gene didn't take I guess. Maybe it's recessive and got quickly watered down when introduced to a normal asian population with high lactose intolerance, when there is no motivating factor at work through natural selection.	1643309689.0	huh4a16	t3_sdt52s	t1_huh2r6d	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh4a16/

at59nuhz	We currently do not know the appropriate dosage. That can only be determined empirically by a clinical trial, which we hope to begin in the future. At least in the lung cells, CBD appears to activate an antiviral response called interferons that directly inhibit viral replication. Interestingly, the response also limits the activation of inflammatory genes called cytokines, which have been implicated in the later stages of COVID disease. Thus, CBD may have multiple beneficial effects. - GR	1643310340.0	huh625g	t3_sdwtff	t1_hufg13a	/r/askscience/comments/sdwtff/askscience_ama_series_were_the_researchers_who/huh625g/
at59nuhz	Yes, it is not adequate to make claims based upon an in vitro study. That is the reason we waited to publish in a peer-reviewed journal until we had animal data to back up our claims. None of our studies involved smoking. All the patient studies were focused on analyzing orally dispensed, FDA-approved, doctor-prescribed CBD.

4wg31cfh	No they’re literally right.   There’s been interesting computational models done on the importance of having a small proportion of the population with a tendency for impulsivity and risk-taking behaviour. It lead to increased nutritional intake and discovery of new food sources. The optimal level of individuals in a population with the condition seemed to be 5-10% which is close to the mark for the percentage of the population with ADHD.  Variation is key in population survival and the long-term outlook of the propagation of a species, even when there are deleterious effects to the individual, it can yield a net benefit for the population.   In essence, if someone making an impulsive decision ends badly or has no real effect every 4 out of 5 times, but has a very positive impact 1 in 5 times, it can prove to be viable in a small proportion of the population and the trait will continue to be passed on and tend towards an ideal level within the population where it could be described as being in an equilibrium of sorts where positive and negative pressures for the trait are balanced	1643310398.0	huh67v1	t3_sdt52s	t1_hufv5cl	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh67v1/
at59nuhz	The previous study used doses of the compounds that were significantly (e.g. 10 fold or more) higher than the doses we used, which is the reason we did not see any effect. Although drugs can easily have effects in cell culture since one can introduce any dose one wants, it is important to also determine whether such a dose could even be reached in our bodies. This is the reason that animal studies are the gold-standard for suggesting that a drug could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. For the FDA-approved CBD, a study was conducted showing that the level of CBD in the blood using this FDA-approved formulation is similar to the doses we used in cell culture. If one wants to use significantly higher doses, it is necessary to show that these can actually be achieved in our blood. - MR	1643310451.0	huh6cyq	t3_sdwtff	t1_hugsjb8	/r/askscience/comments/sdwtff/askscience_ama_series_were_the_researchers_who/huh6cyq/

4wg31cfh	The best description of the symptoms would be to call it an Executive Functioning Deficit, as what’s actually affected is executive functioning, task saliency, and set switching between the default mode network and task-positive network. A better description from a neuroscience perspective would perhaps be Dopaminergic Pathway Dysregulation, as what’s actually affected on a neuronal level is the regulation of dopamine (and to a lesser extent other monoamine) levels in the synaptic cleft along with their uptake at the postsynaptic terminals, and in a wider sense it’s an impaired function of the mesolimbic system.  ADHD as a name just describes how everyone except the individual suffering with it might view or feel about it, so it’s a name that describes how neurotypical people might find it annoying or strange	1643310858.0	huh7guq	t3_sdt52s	t1_huf3d94	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh7guq/

q8wnxcf	If you have a large enough family, with two carriers as parents on average  1/4 won't carry the allele, half will carry one copy and have the protection, and 1/4 will have sickle cell disease. That's assuming full sickle cell doesn't affect chance of going to term.  With one carrier and one without the allele, half the children will be protected carriers and half no allele.  Given that it also provides an advantage, it's very easy for it to persist in a population.	1643310896.0	huh7kk1	t3_sdt52s	t1_hufieg8	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh7kk1/
95gnoxnx	Yes, bone remodeling does occur. Most people, myself included, who undergo wisdom teeth extraction, will feel healed and normal after a few days to a few weeks. But actually, the empty socket left by the extraction will continue growing for six months until new cells have filled it entirely. Gum tissue grows over the empty space.   When adult teeth start coming in, the process of bone remodelling occurs gradually as the teeth emerge. As a result, there isn't a big empty space but gradual bone growth as the teeth emerge. This new bone is part of the permanent structure of the jaw, which continues growing until around 20 years of age.	1643310995.0	huh7u6p	t3_sdj51d	t3_sdj51d	/r/askscience/comments/sdj51d/when_our_adult_teeth_grow_out_do_the_holes_in/huh7u6p/

The results we have provide support for a clinical trial. Because we focused on prevention in our mouse and human data, we believe it has *potential* to be prophylactic but in no way want to leave the impression that we are suggesting that this is definitely the case.

13vt8f	You said you didn't think this comment was true:  >Radiative heat doesn't matter much because the interface of your skin so close to thermal equilibrium with its environment. So conductive and convective losses will dominate.  I disagreed and explained how conductive and convective losses will dominate and so for the application of calculating energy dissipated by a human it can be ignored.  If your argument is that radiation depends on the gradient that's just wrong. Radiation between 2 bodies is sometimes approximated like it were convection, but in an ideal system with two identical black bodies it would actually depend on the difference of the fourth power of the temperatures, because E=σT⁴.   The gradient is a very specific thing. Heat through the air and conducting along a material is continuous along the length of the material. The temperature along the medium is differentiable, there's a defined temperature at every point with no sudden jumps or discontinuities.  The temperature gradient (∇T) is defined as i(dT/dx)+j(dT/dy)+k(dT/dz), and is the rate of change of temperature in a material in any given direction in space. For simplicity, we assume linear 1 dimensional so it reduces to dT/dz, (T2-T1)  The same isn't true for radiation, it is not a continuous process, the temperature curve is non differentiable as transfer happens in discrete steps as energy is transported by photons. Radiation does not depend on the gradient.   If you want to say that it does depend on the difference between the two temperatures that's true, no one disputes that, but I would counter that it depends far more on wether either of these bodies acts remotely like a black body, and the emissivity is highly variable with temperature, and very low at low temperatures because there's less energy to feed thermionic emission.  So at this low temperature and at this small a temperature difference it wouldn't matter, radiation will be so negligible that it will disappear into the margin of error for conduction and convection.  >But we live most of our lives standing or sitting with thermal insulators between ourselves and the earth.  We model air as a fluid because it's a lot more something than it is nothing. There's 2.6*10^22 atoms in every litre of air around you. The convective heat transfer coefficient of still dry air is 5 to 1000w/m²K, depending on relative humidity. The convective heat transfer coefficient for still water is between 50 and 3000 w/m²K.  At low temperatures, heat flows more easily through air than by radiation.   Also, thermal insultors don't stop heat from entering them, they just conduct it very poorly through. So when our system is the heat expended by a person to their surroundings, it doesn't really matter if those surroundings are insulated from the earth. They are at ambient temperature and not in our system boundary. They are our surrounding temperature.   I am getting my degree in this, please don't link me to hyperphysics calculators it's very condescending.	1643311125.0	huh8787	t3_sd2u24	t1_huh0nst	/r/askscience/comments/sd2u24/how_many_watts_are_spend_to_raise_the_body/huh8787/
3pxu9	Sure, but even if he'd never played baseball he'd likely have become as famous a pilot / test pilot as, say, Chuck Yeager. He might well have been selected into one of the early astronaut groups.   Fun fact: Ted Williams was one of the best fly fishermen ever. *Salt water* fly fishing, even. That's another field - which, sure, wouldn't have made him famous in the wider culture, because it's, you know, *fly fishing* - in which vision and reflexes, as well as being cool under pressure, are prerequisites for success.  Anyway, Ted Williams was absolutely *that good*. Which field made him famous isn't all that relevant to evaluating his demonstrated superlative abilities.	1643311221.0	huh8gnb	t3_sdt52s	t1_huf8mv5	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh8gnb/
xf3s0	If you mean Curiosity and Perseverance, they are quite heavy and extremely low powered. Both rovers have a mass of about 900 kg, and 110 W of power available for all their systems, not just driving. That's about half the mass of a typical small car, but a typical small car would have more like 110 kW of power available: about 1000x the power.  Another, perhaps more intuitive example: a typical e-bike has a 250 W motor, a typical e-scooter maybe 350 W, 2-3x the power of Curiosity Rover. Imagine powering a small car with a weak (but highly geared) e-bike motor, and driving not on a road, but over rocks and sand, it is going to *crawl*, with the power limitations they couldn't go much faster even if they wanted to.  The more meta question of why the rovers are so heavy and weak is partly a matter of priorities: going fast is not a priority, and partly a matter of power density, RTGs do not have very high power density (but do reliably produce that meager amount of power for decades), and solar panels offer better power density but would require having pretty big and arguably impractical for a rover solar-array wings: for example InSight Lander, on a good day, generates nearly twice as much electrical energy as Curiosity Rover, but with solar arrays deployed it's about 6 m wide, and NASA have yet to devise a reliable way to keep solar arrays on Mars landers/rovers free of accumulated dust, so performance tends to degrade badly over time.	1643311223.0	huh8gwb	t3_sdb7il	t3_sdb7il	/r/askscience/comments/sdb7il/why_is_the_mars_rover_limited_to_014_kmh_in_speed/huh8gwb/
3xx0i763	For the sake of clarity this is may be a little oversimplified. In the normal immune system, your body essentially has two broad ways of avoiding autoimmunity and eliciting immune responses to harmless substances. The first is central tolerance, in which developing lymphocytes that turn out self-reactive are killed, made anergic (inactive), or induced to become central T regs (which inhibit immune responses rather than activating them). Lymphocytes that make it through development without recognizing self-antigens are able to go out into the body and carry out their functions. However central tolerance isn’t perfect and numerous harmless substances, particularly those that come from the environment, can still be recognized by our immune system. Therefore we have a mechanism of peripheral tolerance in which our already developed and functional lymphocytes can be removed. The oversimplified explanation of how this works is that if a lymphocyte recognizes a substance in the absence of “danger” signals that come from pathogens or tissue damage, it will be killed, made anergic, or induced to become a Treg similar as in central tolerance.  So going back to your question, it is speculated that SOME immunosuppressants (depending on their mechanism of action) may be able to allow SOME people to build peripheral tolerance to SOME graft/self antigens because the antigen is present for long periods of time without any danger signal.	1643311248.0	huh8jc4	t3_se2hup	t3_se2hup	/r/askscience/comments/se2hup/how_does_the_body_learn_from_immunosuppressants/huh8jc4/
4wg31cfh	There’s no real link with ADHD and creativity. It’s almost certainly beneficial for a small proportion of the population to have ADHD or ADHD-like traits due to the impaired inhibitory functions in the brain leading to impulsivity that can occasionally pay off and lead to discovering new beneficial features in the environment such as food sources or the effects of certain herbal or potentially new hunting grounds and techniques, even though it’s largely deleterious in nature for the individual.	1643311452.0	huh93ap	t3_sdt52s	t1_huf778e	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh93ap/

at59nuhz	The mouse studies were designed to be predosed, as to match the patient data, who were taking the FDA-approved CBD treatment prior to a potential exposure. We are very interested in doing a therapeutic study as you suggest. While we do not know the optimal dosage of CBD in mice for anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, we did observe a significant \~ 2-log drop in viral titers in the lungs of infected mice at the dose tested. We tried to control for confounding factors in the patient analysis, but this is an inherent flaw in retroactive studies. That is why we propose a clinical trial. I think the major potential benefit of CBD is its broad availability, as opposed to some of the current SARS-CoV-2 treatments. -GR	1643311521.0	huh9a2e	t3_sdwtff	t1_hugw33s	/r/askscience/comments/sdwtff/askscience_ama_series_were_the_researchers_who/huh9a2e/
cdwhy	Most humans (about 68%) do not have the gene for lactase persistence; that’s what we call lactose intolerance. If you do not persist in producing lactase once becoming an adult, then the lactose from any milk you drink after becoming an adult remains intact in your gut and can cause flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea. Lactase persistence is weird and strange among mammals. Lactose intolerance in adults is normal. They’re opposites.  Studies done on ancient DNA and dental remains of Mongolians show that they did not have high rates of lactase persistence in their population—which is to say, they were genetically lactose intolerant—despite drinking milk often enough that it left deposits on their teeth in the form of dental calculus. So the question is: how did they come to drink so much milk when they did not produce the lactase necessary for them to digest lactose? This is an active area of research.	1643311635.0	huh9ld4	t3_sdt52s	t1_huh7c6c	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huh9ld4/

7b5s6	Worth noting that having 4 cones doesn't grant you tetrachromacy. In the first study of this in 2010 only 1 of the 24 subjects with 4 cones demonstrated any enchanced colour perception.  https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191517  As the abstract points out "this participant has three well-separated cone photopigments in the long-wave spectral region". So you need to not only have 4 cones but also for the forth to a mutation that separates that sufficiently from the others.  To my understanding tetrachromats carry the 3 regular cones plus 1 of the cones that renders men colourblind. Colour blindness occurs because the brain is unable to distinguish the responses between 2 of the cones as their peak wavelength response overlaps too much. You might assume that this happens for tetrachromats, they have 2 cones whose response overlaps and 2 cones with separated.  To be tetrachromatic you would need all 4 cones to have well separated responses and that appears to be what that 2010 study showed	1643311879.0	huha90o	t3_sdt52s	t1_huf5nmt	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huha90o/

5syoiyn	Both.  “Radio waves” is a general term that encompasses all wavelengths (frequencies). The term “microwave” implies a certain frequency range, usually starting around 1GHz and extending to maybe 30 GHz.  Frequencies above that are generally termed “mmWave”.

I remember reading about 20 or 30 years ago about this village in Italy where the people all lived to like 90 or 100.  They did testing and determined that they had this giant protein that would inhibit arteriosclerosis.     There are some mutations that may be beneficial, but not necessarily in an evolutionary sense.   There's a woman who has four kinds of cone cells in her eyes.  She can distinguish something like 10 million colors while the rest of us may only be able to distinguish 1 million.   That may be beneficial as an artist or something, but will it make you more likely to pass on your genes?

People with ADHD have the ability to hyper focus on things and enter flow states, but they don’t have much control over what it is that they focus on. It could be a video game, when they should be focusing on homework.  ADHD is caused by having a reduced level of dopamine in the brain. If you understand that, you will understand how it is that a situation that would overwhelm a neurotypical person would only bring an ADHD person to a baseline level of stimulation.  People with ADHD can focus very well in highly stimulating environments. It is not a disorder of focus, it is a disorder of dopamine.

axrw5	i guess nobody uses CRT (cathode ray tube) displays anymore, but those definitely used more energy for brighter signals.  I am not an engineer, but back in the day I built a voltage attenuator for to combine VGA RGB input to a monochrome CRT display (to get higher grayscale resolution), and I learned the basic facts of how it all worked. white pixels were a voltage of ~1000mV, black pixels were close to zero, and the 254 levels were linearly spaced in between. so already, from the point of leaving the computer, more energy was spent sending an "all white" screen than an "all black" screen.  inside the display those signals would be amplified nonlinearly to charge the electron gun in the back of the tube, and so whatever the nonlinearity, brighter pixels would be costing more energy there too.  in a color (RGB) display, the R G and B signals would be amplified to a different degree - G should be most intense, and B least. so, I guess that an all Green screen would be more costly than an all Blue screen.  with digital displays, I suppose that every frame of the signal is much more similar than were the frames of a CRT signal, having a bunch more peripheral information that is not directly a pixel value. But still, wouldn't a bright pixel in the frame (coded as a 11111111, I guess) take a *little* more energy to send than a dark pixel (e.g. 00000000)? but this is where i cease to know anything.	1643312964.0	huhd7nj	t3_sdiqh3	t3_sdiqh3	/r/askscience/comments/sdiqh3/do_screens_use_more_energy_depending_on_the_color/huhd7nj/
q8wnxcf	It's taken so long to get to this point because doctors have almost no training in nutrition. And the so-called nutrition "scientists" are all too often epidemiologists, who are very statistics and analysis forward, rather than endocrinologists with a deep knowledge of the machinery of the body.  This is why you still see a food pyramid that recommends multiple servings of high glycemic grains, when unregulated blood sugar is the gateway to most modern killers.  I had an A1c test, the result was exactly on the border of pre-diabetes, and she told me a) if I were her patient she'd put me on metformin, and b) I should eat mostly vegetables and a little protein.

I sought to answer their question without getting into details that muddy the whole issue. the whole concept of a particle called a "hole" moving around is just a convenience anyway, so you kind of have to draw a line somewhere.

But just think about it: the outcome of consecutive hops into an open spot is completely different compared to everybody hopping at the very same time one spot.

udgj2	A proposed renaming of ADHD is Attention Dy(i)sregulation Hyperactivity Disorder because the current one has that mistaken connotation.    Regarding the attention part, an easy way to think of it is:    If you don't want to do it, they have a strong unconscious urge to not do it.    If you want to do it, they have a strong unconscious urge to do it.     This typically results   1. Avoiding doing things that are mundane, boring, annoying, or anxiety inducing. Typical things that 'normal' people would just "get it over with", can be debilitatingly difficult to do for someone with ADHD.   2. Pursuing highly stimulating behavior. This is subjective to the person and it can be something as innocuous as binging a media (books, videos, shows, games), or seeking some vice like drugs, gambling, etc. Since this can be compulsive and consume someone's attention, it can get quite dangerous.    The kicker is, even if you become aware or conscious of the issue, it's not as easy as just putting in more effort or trying harder, because **it's always there**.    Imagine having to think about breathing every time you need to breathe. Now, imagine having to do [X] push-ups every time you need to breathe.

lq5sr	One thing to keep in mind is that there is no such thing as an absolute "advantage". There are only advantages within specific contexts or environments. Without specifying a context, there is technically no way to answer your question.   Of course we will naturally fill in the blank to figure out what we assume the context should be, but this is at the heart of a lot of miscommunication. Gene mutations can definitely affect our biology and can affect the outcomes of our lives. However whether these changes are advantageous depends on the context.  For example a series of genetic mutations that lead people to gain weight and increase fat tissue mass more quickly could be an advantage in a population of people living in a cold environment, however the same set of mutations could be a disadvantage to a population living in a very hot environment.	1643317213.0	huhoq10	t3_sdt52s	t3_sdt52s	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huhoq10/

They end up having larger muscles and less body fat as a result. And as far as I'm aware, there are no drawbacks.

fqp8om5r	Yeah I’m the same.    The name ADHD is so bad.  There’s not a deficit of attention, there’s a deficit of attention *control*. In fact I feel like it’s a malfunctioning filter.  Most peoples brains are better at filtering out extraneous stimuli when needed.   Our threshold for filtering is higher - but when it’s triggered (hyper focus) we can filter out *a lot* - or too much! Like the passage of time for example!  There’s been a number of emergency situations I’ve been involved in where I’ve gone into fix it mode while others have just been a bit dumbstruck.	1643317322.0	huhp0m9	t3_sdt52s	t1_hufnx8f	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huhp0m9/

You can use all those pictures to explain the other transport too. It comes down to the point that coherent simultaneously movement of all entities is something different than consecutive single movements step by step. Look at the english wikipedia entry about hall effect. The latter mechanism can not explain sign change of hall effect. That bothered me for a long time and I finally got this wrong picture corrected at the very end of my university time.

A genetic disorder is a disease that is caused by a mutation in an individual’s DNA sequence. ADHD is not due to a mutation. It's a version of a trait that, in our current world, is mostly unhelpful.  But it's not a genetic disorder.  Source: The classes that I teach in university, not Google.

quojp	Sickle cell trait is not interchangeable with sickle cell anemia. Patients with sickle cell anemia receive two copies of the mutated gene, and patients with sickle cell trait are carriers who receive one copy of the gene. They both have the same mutation.  I would like to see your specific link, because this:  >There are different levels of sickle cell disease (the lowest of which is considered to have just the inherited trait, where there is still a good proportion of functional RBCs present) . Some with more severe symptoms for the patient than others. But they do all have some symptoms, and generally result in a reduced life expectancy.  That is not what Mayo Clinic has to say about sickle cell trait, and it is also not what my clinical training stated.  Mayo Clinic: [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876)  "If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one normal hemoglobin gene and one defective form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin.   Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don't have symptoms. They're carriers of the disease, however, which means they can pass the gene to their children."     Patients with sickle cell trait cells are more prone to sickle when infected with the parasite, which is what provides this advantage against malaria. But the majority of people with sickle cell trait are asymptomatic. In fact, many aren't diagnosed. Cases of sickling complications are generally in extreme environments of limited oxygen availability.   ^(I do testing to diagnose malaria and sickle cell anemia. Also, look anywhere and it'll tell you people with sickle cell trait are generally asymptomatic. If you're finding sources that say they're not, you're selecting with bias.)	1643319535.0	huhv0lo	t3_sdt52s	t1_hufdu71	/r/askscience/comments/sdt52s/there_are_lots_of_wellcharacterised_genetic/huhv0lo/

However, this effect is usually extremely weak, and only becomes noticeable for very massive bodies orbiting very close to eachother. Just put the star a healthy distance away from the black hole and it'll be stable for long enough. If you're worried you can use the [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Binaries) to check the time it takes for collision.	1643323245.0	hui4rzs	t3_sd0ua2	t3_sd0ua2	/r/askscience/comments/sd0ua2/would_a_binary_system_of_a_star_preferable_a/hui4rzs/

I hope this turns out to be a genuine road forward, given I have an autistic child (who is vaccinated!) but who cannot wear a mask due to her sensory issues. She's prescribed CBD oil as a mood stabilizer, so knowing that might help protect her where masks can't would be a comfort.

gekpw	Pay attention, I'll go through this one more time. The question that was asked was about how terrestrial reactors can operate at such low pressures, when the pressures in the cores of stars are huge. It's not about what specific reactions are used. (And comparing any other reactions with the pp reaction doesn't really make sense, because the deuteron-producing reaction in the pp chain is fundamentally different than all other reactions that might be relevant to this conversation, in that it involves the weak force, and has an absolutely tiny cross section under all circumstances.)  It's true that terrestrial reactors operate at much lower pressures than in stars, but they generally operate at significantly *higher* temperatures as well.  And the reaction rate per particle depends on the product of the densities of the reactants. But it also depends *extremely strongly* on the temperature, because temperatures modify the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections. So you can make moderate changes to the reaction rate per particle by changing the pressure a little bit, and/or you can make enormous changes by changing the temperature a little bit.  So for two identical systems, using the exact same reactions, but held at different temperatures and pressures, you can imagine a situation where the reaction rate is the same even though one has a pressure many orders of magnitude lower than the other. The one with the low pressure just needs to have a little bit higher temperature.	1643324745.0	hui8l17	t3_sbic0f	t1_hui6jg5	/r/askscience/comments/sbic0f/why_do_fusion_reactors_use_vacuums_when_fusion/hui8l17/

i5zr9	It depends on how far you want to go with you're ideal situation.  A) If there is gravity, then I think the end links would break first.   \- 1) If the chain is supported by only the hooks at each end and:  \-- a) If one hook is higher than the other, then the link at the higher hook will break first. It has the greatest force due to the weight of the chain.  \-- b) If the hooks are at the same height, then theoretically both end links will break at the same time (see below).  \- 2) If the chain is resting on a horizontal surface and:  \-- a) If only one end is pulled, then the link at the pulled end will beak first. The other links will have less tension because friction with the surface will reduce the tension slightly at each link.  \-- b) If both ends are pulled equally, then theoretically both end links will break at the same time (see below).  &#x200B;  Below:   Since you mentioned steel chain, when a sample of steel is tested in tension it will neck in one location before failure and then break here. See this video at around 3:28:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8U4G5kcpcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8U4G5kcpcM)  I think it's fair to say that even with a perfect starting sample, a neck will form in only one location. So, as long as the chain is stretched slowly (and is not too long, see next note), I don't think you could get a double break. Now if the chain is stretched rapidly, then the forces from acceleration come into play, and a double break should be possible.  Next Note: if the chain is very long and resting on a flat surface, then if you pull both ends, you could break both end links. A loooooong chain could have considerable friction with the surface. When the force at one end drops as that end fails, the force at the other end could could stay high due to the friction on the middle of the chain	1643325127.0	hui9j37	t3_sdaviz	t3_sdaviz	/r/askscience/comments/sdaviz/if_a_chain_of_perfectly_identical_links_is_pulled/hui9j37/

8dqo7	There are some tests we can perform, which let us distinguish between effects due to real expansion of the Universe, versus effects from other sources (like the ones you suggest).  First is the Tolman Test. (AKA the [Tolman Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman_surface_brightness_test)). In a Universe not undergoing cosmic expansion, then the apparent surface brightness of distant objects should be constant. Surface brightness is basically just the amount of light we receive from an object, divided by its angular size. For example, imagine if we were suddenly to move the Sun twice as far away. One the one hand, we would receive less light from the Sun; but, the light we did receive would be "squeezed" into a smaller area of sky, due to the Sun being further away. So the Sun's surface brightness would remain the same. In other words, an object's surface brightness shouldn't be affected by distance. But in a cosmologically expanding Universe, surface brightness will decrease with distance (read the linked Wikipedia article for a great summary of why). And we do indeed observe this.  There is also the [Integrated Late-Time Sachs-Wolfe Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachs%E2%80%93Wolfe_effect)... Which is about as exciting as it sounds! In short, photons of light from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) that have travelled through denser parts of the Universe should have slightly different wavelengths than CMB photons that have passed through less-dense parts of the Universe. The exact nature of this variation in wavelength will be different in an expanding Universe than in a non-expanding Universe. And when we look for this effect, what we see is exactly what we would expect from an expanding Universe.  There are other tests, beside, but they get increasingly technical. These two are some of the main pieces of evidence we have that the Universe is expanding cosmologically.	1643330656.0	huimv2x	t3_schv4m	t3_schv4m	/r/askscience/comments/schv4m/how_do_we_know_for_sure_that_redshift_in_distant/huimv2x/

6r7f8	You're totally right about the gradient of radiatively coupled bodies. I was using the term imprecisely to mean temperature difference. I thought that you were as well, but I seem to have misinterpreted your comment and perhaps missed your point.   You still don't address the fact that the two sources I link disagree with you about the fundamental question about if radiative heat loss in people is significant under normal conditions. I don't really know what to do with a convective heat loss coefficient and how it interacts with my t-shirt, sweater, and pants if it's 65 degrees in the house or 20 degrees outside, and what percentage of my generated heat this accounts for. The sources I cited say that radiation is significant under some normal conditions and conduction usually is not. I'd be interested to see a source that says the opposite.   My point in linking to the calculator was to show my source that a person radiates about a kW. I think it's good practice to give sources on Reddit science / askscience, even if the sources are trivial. I thought this was especially important to cite because it was directly refuting your implication that a person's radiative power must be much less than 60 W because they are much colder than a light bulb filament.	1643338030.0	huj43x2	t3_sd2u24	t1_huh8787	/r/askscience/comments/sd2u24/how_many_watts_are_spend_to_raise_the_body/huj43x2/

a5t2jv4h	The sides of the crack in effect act like a tiny pair of levers. This creates a mechanical advantage that greatly helps any stretching-apart force applied to the sides to break the inter (and, depending on the material, sometimes even intra) molecular bonds at the tip.  In flexible, more plastic materials, cracks are hard to propagate because the sides themselves can bend, thus redistributing some of the force away from the crack tip. For a rigid material like glass, the sides stay more or less the same shape as force is applied, which means *all* of it ends up at the crack tip, and the material breaks easy and fast.	1643339343.0	huj73r9	t3_schwzl	t3_schwzl	/r/askscience/comments/schwzl/how_do_cracks_propagate_at_a_molecular_level_once/huj73r9/

19dgp	You know how relative tuning works, I assume (he saays with trepidation).  First get the relative tuning bang on. Then pluck just one string vigorously, and note the other begin to vibrate "sympathetically". The vibrations are transmitted from one string to the other and being in tune, they both vibrate.  I've done the same thing by playing a note on my trumpet and even had piano strings vibrate sympathetically.  Or it could just be the forceful sneeze acting directly on the strings as if plucked.	1643342105.0	hujd919	t3_segatx	t3_segatx	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hujd919/
b1qa0x96	Your sneeze is essentially an air shockwave hitting the guitar. A guitar is constructed to resonate at certain frequencies, so while the shockwave will initially excite all kinds of frequencies in the guitar, only the resonant ones survive long enough for you to notice them.  BTW, this is kinda how a violin works. The bow doesn't know what note it should produce; all it does is scratch the string, which excites all kinds of frequencies. However, only the resonant ones survive, producing the familiar note.	1643342591.0	hujea9t	t3_segatx	t3_segatx	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hujea9t/

amoqgye	Resonance goes both ways. You can make a string vibrate by hitting with it's tone, in the same way that you can break glass with your voice. The tone that something produce when hit is the frequency(ies) it can't absorb, making it deflect back. The first law of motion says that would produce an opposing force that makes the object recoil. Repeat enough times, and the string will eventually be moving enough to produce the tone itself.	1643343055.0	hujf8p0	t3_segatx	t3_segatx	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hujf8p0/

in0ty7vy	Many times if there is too much open space there are specific high frequencies which I don't like, they are the ringing I was talking about. Never really thought about if a room isn't suitable for recording in general because I will use foam insulation and bass traps anyway and I do the trick I told you to find out what I need.  I'm only talking about voice recording specifically for hip hop music or pop while in other cases a whole lot of reverb and echo might be what you need.  I once put a sound system in a pretty open room to record a bass because the reverb changes the sound because it can resonate and makes the room and everything in it rumble.  It really depends on what I wanted to record but yeah I don't want unwanted frequencies echoing back into the microphone I want to have control over that so that I get a clean recording.	1643357445.0	huk3lqs	t3_segatx	t1_huk2dvv	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/huk3lqs/

e8p3j58c	As others have mentioned consumption is an old term for tuberculosis.  Only about 10% of cases of latent TB develop in to active TB and left untreated it has about a 50% fatality rate.  Which is not great by any means, but its also not likely to wipe out whole families or groups on the regular.    Keep in mind a few things though.    First, what's shown on TV vs. how things actually worked is not the same.  A TV series where all the characters died wouldn't last long.  Have a single family member or small number of characters get sick with a disease is a plot point, something for the characters to deal with, but it doesn't end the show.    Second, people depending on the time depicted people likely did take some preventative measures, but they also didn't have the types of resources we have today, nor the knowledge.  Medical masks first became a thing back around the late 1800's/early 1900's.  Families did what they had to do, in some cases they might be able to take them to a hospital, but more often they had no choice but to keep them in the house and hope for the best.  The alternative would be leave them out to die on their own, something most decent people wouldn't do.    Third, diseases like this were far more common in earlier eras due to lack of sanitation, lack of proper hygiene, etc.  You know when they cite how the average lifespan back then was like in the 40's or 50's?  Its not cause adults weren't living late in to life, its because infant/childhood mortality was so high that it dragged the average down.  Not having a child (or multiple!) die in early life was rare, especially as you descended down the wealth levels.  Dealing with diseases like this was simply part of life.  A sad and difficult part, but far more common than for people in many countries (though sadly not all) these days.	1643359183.0	huk5ysd	t3_sdt6hb	t3_sdt6hb	/r/askscience/comments/sdt6hb/why_didnt_whole_households_die_of_consumption/huk5ysd/

A catastrophic injury (say from a predator) and the body shuts off the pain response to give the animal a chance to escape first, worry about the injury later.

In some cases you can even find the resonance tone of a room that has few soft (and thus dampening) tissues like a bathroom or a kitchen via singing. My bathroom resonates to a b-flat-like tone at about 460 hertz.

Styrofoam cups are great at demonstrating this because you can feel them shake when music is being played nearby.

ee0f4	The geology of mainland Greece (with a focus on the Hellenides) is dominated by a long history of [accretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_%28geology%29), i.e., the closure of ocean basins via [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) and then the collision (and docking) of the two formerly separate pieces of continental crust, and in the case of Greece, often accompanied with scraping off and mixing bits of oceanic crust, i.e., [ophiolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiolite) (e.g., [Doutsos et al., 1993](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/93TC00108), [Papinakolaou, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493708001679), [Mposkos et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019TC005557)). Moving into the Aegean sea, subduction is still the critical processes, but coupled with slab rollback of the Hellenic subduction zone and the formation of a [back-arc basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-arc_basin) (e.g., [Jolivet et al., 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0024493794900515), [Jolivet & Patriat, 1999](https://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/156/1/427.short), [Philippon et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195114002297)).

The coastline of Greece (and the structure of the Hellenides, etc) are not totally separate from the rollback of the Hellenic trench, coupled to the westward "escape" of Anatolia (e.g., [Le Pichon et al., 1995](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95JB00317)), as the evolution of the Hellenides and the Dinarides to the north are influenced by the rollback, and have experienced somewhat significant strike-slip deformation (e.g., [van Unen et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818119300621)), which has likely contributed to the somewhat complicated coastline of mainland Greece.	1643378524.0	hukzpya	t3_seb3pm	t3_seb3pm	/r/askscience/comments/seb3pm/any_reason_for_greeces_one_of_a_kind_geographic/hukzpya/

1rl6ureb	Agree. Sleep is like going to the mechanic for your regular tune up. You can't get several 10k tunes at once and then not need to worry until 50k miles later, because driving adds wear incrementally, so there's nothing for it but to do maintenance incrementally.

ndxbj	The only thing I haven't seen mentioned is that a sneeze is mostly white noise, or a frequency sweep if you're one of those weirdos who vocalizes when you sneeze.  Much like an impulse load (hitting the guitar with something) makes the whole thing resonate at its natural frequency, so does white noise or a sneeze, which contains wide frequency content and thus excites many natural frequencies.  TL;DR - a sneeze is like a gentle airborne version of bumping your guitar into something.	1643380389.0	hul40d2	t3_segatx	t3_segatx	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hul40d2/
mskz2	When you sneeze, you create vibrations in the air (which, generally, we call sound). These vibrations are enough to cause your guitar and its strings to vibrate.  The efficiency with which energy can be transferred from sound waves into, say, your guitar strings, relates to the so-called "resonant frequency" of your guitar strings as well as the frequency of the sound. If you have a sound whose frequency is the same as (or close to) the resonant frequency of an object, energy will be readily transferred from the sound into the object in question, causing it to vibrate at that frequency. This is sometimes called sympathetic vibration.  Interestingly, a sneeze contains a very wide range of frequencies all at once. This means that the sound energy from a sneeze will pretty much cause your guitar strings to vibrate no matter what pitches/notes (frequencies) they're tuned to. But if you vocalize your sneezes (*ACHOO!* as opposed to *hh-tshhh!*) you'll typically find that it's the lower, vocalized frequencies that cause sympathetic vibrations in the strings of your guitar that have similar pitches to your voice.	1643380677.0	hul4p9m	t3_segatx	t3_segatx	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hul4p9m/

5xddq	I'd say it's rather both noise and a frequency sweep - even without using the vocal tract, usually a sneeze involves a difference in filtration of the sound. "A-choo" is basically low filtration (the vowel a) to high filtration (the vowel o).  White noise isn't a correct descriptor - I wouldn't even know what kind of noise approximates the frequency distribution of a sneeze, but the resonance of the vocal tract makes it quite impossible to be evenly weighted as white noise per definition is.	1643381230.0	hul60uo	t3_segatx	t1_hul40d2	/r/askscience/comments/segatx/when_my_acoustic_guitar_vibrates_loudly_after_i/hul60uo/

2n8fojmf	This gets to a long standing controversy in the sport science community. This article sums it up and has some good jumping point references    [https://www.runnerstribe.com/expert-advice/is-it-really-the-sleep-two-nights-prior-to-race-day-that-matters/](https://www.runnerstribe.com/expert-advice/is-it-really-the-sleep-two-nights-prior-to-race-day-that-matters/)  Basically there are two schools of thought on it.    1. If you get enough sleep and do a build up to the event you'll be fine missing one nights sleep.   [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307962/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307962/)  2. Science says that you will be less performant with less sleep. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10543671/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10543671/)   But you have to look at the exact conditions that are being looked at in the study.  You can't bank sleep like sleeping 12 hours a day for a 3 days and then stay up for a week straight, and you can't skip a night without effects. You can buffer the week coming up to an event, and use that to minimize the effects of getting less than a full night of sleep. So, both sides have valid points and the question has to be a bit more nuanced towards what you are looking to do.	1643382524.0	hul999t	t3_sdzy0k	t3_sdzy0k	/r/askscience/comments/sdzy0k/can_humans_effectively_bank_sleep/hul999t/

c20bhpgn	You have a fundamental misunderstanding of pn junctions. They are not random — there are driving forces, namely drift and diffusion. Look at the band diagram of a pn junction with no external bias. When an electron and hole are generated by a photon, the electrons “roll” downhill and the holes “roll” uphill. This is drift and and it works like a ball rolling down a hill. This is how unidirectional current happens. We’ve just described the short circuit current.    If you forward bias the diode slightly, but not so much that diffusion takes over, we now have current running reverse of our bias voltage. This is power generation.	1643387369.0	hulm4cf	t3_se90th	t3_se90th	/r/askscience/comments/se90th/how_does_a_solar_panel_produce_useful_current/hulm4cf/

89x6n8f8	The difference is the kinetic energy involved in collisions.  Collisional cooling: very cold gas in weak trap. Kinetic energy involved in collisions is way smaller than bond energy. Collisions occasionally give individual molecules higher-than-average kinetic energy, enough to exit the trap, at which point they remove that kinetic energy from the system, decreasing the average KE and therefore the temperature.  Collisional activation: very hot gas, or molecules accelerated toward each other. Kinetic energy involved in collisions is on the order of bond energy.	1643391458.0	hulx7vw	t3_sepgf8	t3_sepgf8	/r/askscience/comments/sepgf8/how_can_collisions_between_molecules_in_the/hulx7vw/

110lto	Yeah it makes sense now. I guess it's as simple as law of conservation of energy, when a population of ions are cooled, the gas is taking up heat. So it's the relative energy of the two populations.

hl03h	The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy always increases.  Given an isolated system that means heat wants to be uniform through out.  So it will move to equilibrate.  This means that higher energy molecules will distribute their energy to lower until it's all even.   Collision induced dissociation involves much higher energy due to bond strength.      But... no system is independent, so heat will always move out of the system overall.  It moves at a rate related to the whole kinetics of the system, so long as entropy increases.	1643393900.0	hum3u85	t3_sepgf8	t3_sepgf8	/r/askscience/comments/sepgf8/how_can_collisions_between_molecules_in_the/hum3u85/

The effect of the vehicle is dependent on the environment (Furniture Store = high concentration of furniture, Empty Warehouse = low concentration of furniture).

89x6n8f8	To address the "Maxwell's Demon" part: solar cells are not 100% efficient. Inefficiencies in the solar panel convert sunlight to heat, so the solar panel heats up more than its surroundings as it generates electricity. The conversion to heat here means the creation of additional entropy; in particular, as long as the solar panel is less than roughly 86% efficient, the total entropy of the system is greater after this process than it began, despite any reduction in entropy that occurs in the distribution of electron velocity. So there's a thermodynamic limit to the efficiency of a solar panel.  In reality, accounting for other sources of inefficiency (spectrum losses, impedance mismatch, etc.), solar panels are only about 33% efficient (the Shockley-Queisser limit).  >Why can’t we just put a bunch of PN junctions between metals to preferentially send those free electrons in one direction for infinite energy when it obviously works in a solar panel?  Real PN junctions require an imposed potential difference to turn "on" even in the forward-biased direction, called the "knee voltage". For silicon diodes, this is about 0.7 volts, and for germanium diodes, this is roughly 0.3 volts. So, at zero applied voltage, no significant current flows.	1643394868.0	hum6g18	t3_se90th	t3_se90th	/r/askscience/comments/se90th/how_does_a_solar_panel_produce_useful_current/hum6g18/
c20bhpgn	Fundamentals don’t change, but solar cells are a bit more complicated than a perfect p-type and n-type semiconductor. They usually have anti reflective coatings that help to gather as much light as possible. These can degrade either from the sun or humidity exposure or scratching. Less light means worse power output.   The solar cells are far from perfect crystals and are constantly hot. They have defects and impurities that can migrate with the heat. These can cause leakage or alternate paths for high energy electrons that no longer generate useful power.   Lots of things “break” with prolonged UV, heat and humidity exposure.	1643394938.0	hum6mx9	t3_se90th	t1_hulxw42	/r/askscience/comments/se90th/how_does_a_solar_panel_produce_useful_current/hum6mx9/

d9r0u	Cheetahs were likely down to a single breeding pair at some point, probably near the end of the last ice age.  All the cheetahs that are alive are virtually identical genetically, leading to a lot of problems with genetic diseases and abnormalities.  They're basically completely inbred.  That said, there's a debate open as to whether they can be considered to have "survived" or not, since they don't have adequate genetic diversity at this point to adapt to anything.

bnek1dj9	In tandem quad mass spectrometry, you have a gas cell between two high vacuum regions where an ion will only be affected by the rf and dc fields from the quad.   Ions will be transiting the quad will have some distribution of speeds based on previous acceleration. Once the ions start colliding with the gas in the cell their speed distribution will end entirely be based on the properties of the collision gas (which depend on the temperature) and hence the ions will be thermalised or cooled.   What you can do is raise the potential energy (voltage) of the quad wrt the gas cell, the ions will come in much faster and the first collision will be sufficient to smash the ion into bits.

11y2nf	I went the the natural history museum in DC recently and they said that it was no more than 10,000 adults of reproductive age and that occurred roughly 74,000 years ago. So certainly a genetic bottleneck. I think your figure may be on the low side.

It’s believed the American cheetah was out predatored by all the other carnivores of the day. Whereas in Africa they filled a small niche with they’re hunting style.

To be fair that's true of a lot of animals (and if you take climate change to its logical extreme, literally all of them (or at least all macroscopic ones).

The funny thing is that the people "concerned" about plant milks have been drinking cow milk without question their entire lives. Cows are pumped full of antibiotics and hormones to increase milk production, not to mention any naturally occurring hormones in milk.   But oats and water?!

dwzlduwz	Blackfoot ferrets cannot be said to have been successfully recovered. 18 individuals were collected from the wild for a breeding program. Of these only 7 were breeding age females. They’ve now been bred up to over 300 individuals but the subsequent generations are suffering from low fertility due to inbreeding. Recently some scientists have begun looking into cloning some of the original collected population females who did not/could not breed. The hope is to be able to introduce some new genetics into the badly interbred population remaining	1643400582.0	humlnhf	t3_setbxv	t1_humacl5	/r/askscience/comments/setbxv/which_animal_species_came_the_closest_to_going/humlnhf/

4gtyx	Well, aside from the fact that *generally* fungi aren't taxonomically classified with animals,   it all comes back to how much climate change we're talking.  Global temp rises a couple degrees, some species die out. "Runaway" greenhouse effect that brings the atmospheric temp to a couple hundred celcius?

1737wx	Yeah, honestly this sounds like some smear campaign stuff. The dairy industry in the US is subsidized by the government and there’s a lot of money to be made. There’s a reason why dairy companies have fought hard to prevent milk alternatives to even use the name milk. Same with the livestock industry battling over the term meat. When these industries are threatened they use “science” to try and defame or discredit the competition. It’s not unlikely that study was funded by the dairy industry. Just like when almond milk was gaining popularity there was quite a bit of fuss made about how much water it took to grow enough almonds for a glass of milk. It seemed like a lot and a complete waste of water but when compared to that of cows milk it was significantly less.	1643401541.0	humo6h2	t3_seybvk	t1_humn0by	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humo6h2/

n03o9	My first thought went to Glyphosate (aka the weed-killer used in Roundup), which is used in conventionally and organically grown oats.  There have been some papers linking glyphosate with reproductive health harm.  [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42860-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42860-0) (murine, 2019)  [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es404258h](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es404258h) (zebra fish, 2014)  But also lit reviews that show no effect:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22202229/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22202229/) (humans, 2012)  \>An evaluation of this database found no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspring. Furthermore, no plausible mechanisms of action for such effects were elucidated. Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposure....In conclusion, the available literature shows no solid evidence linking glyphosate exposure to adverse developmental or reproductive effects at environmentally realistic exposure concentrations.  Hopefully someone who has done more research in this area can provide further elucidation.  I do know that glyphosate is a hot topic on natural news-type websites.	1643401622.0	humoe7y	t3_seybvk	t3_seybvk	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humoe7y/

137mjq	Well, transphobia is certainly a part of it, especially insofar as they don’t believe in the concept, but I’d say it’s primarily an extension of their profoundly misogynistic core beliefs.   They imagine that soy is feminizing, which is inherently bad, because anything feminine is bad. This is convenient, because it justifies their negative views on “weak” men, trans women (who they really believe are just weak, feminine men), and East Asian men who eat more soy than western men on average and are *of course*, small, small-penised and weak. As a big man who consumes animal products instead of soy, they’re more masculine, and, as an extension of that masculinity, explicitly better.  This is all a bit beside the point, though, because the fact is that consuming soy does not have any feminizing affect on humans, value judgments of the feminine aside.	1643401811.0	humovy8	t3_seybvk	t1_humn3yy	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humovy8/

17g9e3	They’re amazing yes! I’ve seen them spread so much over the last 15 years!   Just last week a red kite eagle turned up in my back garden in London - never expected to see it there!  (My house backs onto a small local park)   The red kite tried to steal a baby pigeon or full fledging, got ambushed midair by the flock and it all developed into a 4-way interspecies war - red kite vs a 3-species alliance of seagulls, pigeons, and some crows that were also in the park. They spent about an hour fighting in the air - it was like watching a WW1 dogfight or something from Star Wars. Eventually the pigeons and gulls dropped out but one set of crows kept harassing the red kite for several more hours.   Over the next few days the red kite eagle came back a few times hoping to score more tasty chicks but the crows would zoom from across the park every time and chase it off.   I haven’t seen the red kite for a few days now, but it was wild while it lasted.	1643402073.0	humpkf0	t3_setbxv	t1_humilru	/r/askscience/comments/setbxv/which_animal_species_came_the_closest_to_going/humpkf0/

As people think they'll eat soy once and grow tits.     But you don't drink 1 beer and grow a beer belly, either.     Soy ABSOLUTELY effects hormones.

4gtyx	It's worth noting too that it's a really unique and subjective application of the concept of adapting.  Granted we often do change our behavior which is pretty normal adaptation (just like say... a bear might, we may switch from eating one food to another if it becomes scarce.   Clearly all the people who hunted wooly mammoths as a primary supply found something else to sustain them.     But another thing that is probably a bigger part of our success is we adapt our environment to fit us.  Sure other animals build dens and nest but we literally fully enclose buildings with basically their own climates.  We make clothes.  We make tools.  All of those are taking something that is intrinsically external and changing it to suit our needs which no animal does on a wide scale and only a few do on any notable level.   Hell I think if we ever actually ran onto another intelligent species from another planet that'd be the one surefire thing they had in common with us. They could look incredibly different, have wildly different biochemistry. Not even have DNA.  But at the end of it all if they were able to thrive in a fashion that allows us both to encounter and perceive each other, they will at some point have moved beyond living within their environment to fundamentally shaping it for their own needs.	1643402270.0	humq2we	t3_setbxv	t1_humog97	/r/askscience/comments/setbxv/which_animal_species_came_the_closest_to_going/humq2we/

olrw9	Yeah, the idea that soy increases the odds of breast cancer seems to be based on an old study where mice  experienced tumor growth after eating a large amount of soy isoflavine. This link was never established in humans, and it has since been shown that mice metabolize soy differently than humans, making any extrapolation to human ill-conceived (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192476/). To quote the conclusion, the difference in soy metabolism "...cast[s] doubt on the value of the use of these rodents for gaining insight into the effects of isoflavones in humans, especially with regard to the effects on breast tissue."  The link has been further debunked by follow-up studies, such as the one you posted. An excerpt of note from that study:  >Current evidence suggests that a diet high in soy may improve survival and lower the risk of recurrence in women with breast cancer.7-9 The benefits don’t appear limited to Asian populations either.  >One analysis combined data from three large, long-running studies of survivors from both Asian and Western countries. It found that women who ate at least 10 mg of soy per day after a breast cancer diagnosis had a 25 percent lower risk of recurrence compared to those eating less than 4 mg per day.9    >However, soy is not currently recommended as a way for breast cancer survivors to lower the risk of recurrence. There are still some open questions about these findings because the studies were looking at many different types of soy, and because women who regularly eat soy simply tend to be healthier than those who don’t.9”	1643402632.0	humr0x6	t3_seybvk	t1_humnl7m	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humr0x6/

extvi	Yup yup. The rare phenomenon of parthenogenesis - where a female can produce viable eggs asexually. It's most common in reptiles. It is known to happen in birds but most of the eggs don't make it to hatching.      The condors, though, did hatch! Two males known as SB260 and SB517.      Sadly neither was in terrific shape! They both died before reaching sexual maturity (which is quite old as condors live to be around 50-60 years old!) SB260 died in the wild in 2003 and SB517 remained in captivity and died in 2017 of an infection.      It's one of the most remarkable parthenogenesis stories ever observed.

Equally, there are compounds that have a masculinizing effect on people and there are those who don't want to become more masculine and who would be worried about *that* effect.  It's a good thing to learn and understand what compounds can do to your body but we should also look at the information critically and try to judge if the effects are likely to be major ones.

olrw9	>Soy contains phytoestrogens that may affect hormones in the human body  A recent meta-analysis provides evidence against this claim, see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383165/ (2021).  Here is the abstract: >Concerns that the phytoestrogens (isoflavones) in soy may feminize men continue to be raised. Several studies and case-reports describing feminizing effects including lowering testosterone levels and raising estrogen levels in men have been published. For this reason, the clinical data were meta-analyzed to determine whether soy or isoflavone intake affects total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). PubMed and CAB Abstracts databases were searched between 2010 and April 2020, with use of controlled vocabulary specific to the databases. Peer-reviewed studies published in English were selected if (1) adult men consumed soyfoods, soy protein, or isoflavone extracts (from soy or red clover) and [2] circulating TT, FT, SHBG, E2 or E1 was assessed. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. With one exception, studies included in a 2010 meta-analysis were included in the current analysis. A total of 41 studies were included in the analyses. TT and FT levels were measured in 1753 and 752 men, respectively; E2 and E1 levels were measured in 1000 and 239 men, respectively and SHBG was measured in 967 men. Regardless of the statistical model, no significant effects of soy protein or isoflavone intake on any of the outcomes measured were found. Sub-analysis of the data according to isoflavone dose and study duration also showed no effect. This updated and expanded meta-analysis indicates that regardless of dose and study duration, neither soy protein nor isoflavone exposure affects TT, FT, E2 or E1 levels in men.	1643403154.0	humsdrs	t3_seybvk	t1_humgax6	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humsdrs/

Oat milk is not the same as eating oats any more than drinking orange juice is the same as eating oranges. You have substantially modified the natural product, changed it properties, and given it new properties. I don’t know if oat milk is bad for you, but the fact that people have eaten oats for a long time does not make it impossible.	1643403196.0	humshl6	t3_seybvk	t1_humoopf	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humshl6/

We've tried *really* hard to get a glyphosate "aha." We haven't. That's not a conspiracy and it doesn't mean we shouldn't stop looking, but at this point glyphosate ironically has one of the most evidence-supported safety profiles in agriculture by virtue of all the scrutiny it's received.  Monsanto was a ruthless company. It's part of Bayer now. That doesn't mean despicable business practices translate into the science being bad. Glyphosate is a *huge* net positive relative to the alternatives it's displaced, and we *really* need to stop demonizing it unless and until we find an empirically sound reason to do so.	1643403446.0	humt54t	t3_seybvk	t1_humoe7y	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humt54t/

I didn't mention cheetahs in my response because 1) /u/Accujack already mentioned them and 2) we can only speculate on the actual population numbers left behind, based upon genetic information. It may have been 2, it may have been 7, it may have been 20 - It was 12,000 years ago! We don't know how few cheetahs there were but we know from the genetics that it was perilously low and it's frankly miraculous they're still here.	1643403488.0	humt8xk	t3_setbxv	t1_humlu9m	/r/askscience/comments/setbxv/which_animal_species_came_the_closest_to_going/humt8xk/

5xddq	I might be a bit pedantic here, but that's not true - hence why modern bioidentical, non esterized estrogens come in pill form as well as many other routes of administration. It is however a very ineffective absorption.     So the amount of estrogen you would get from cow milk is of such a small quantity that you would practically not absorb it.      For those who are interested: conraception, which is ethinyl estradiol, is a synthetic derivative of estradiol. As such, it has a much higher bioavaliability and greater potency compared to estradiol. This makes it work for contraception, because you can be sure that it's going to get into the system with sufficient effect. However, the heightened potency will greatly increase blod clotting factors when estradiol recpetors in the liver gets activated by it, so it's being phased out in other uses for estradiol.     There's also esterized forms of estradiol, like estradiol valerate, that is supposed to give it better bioavaliability compared to estradiol - real life results casts a bit of doubt on this.     For hormone replacement therapy, topical estradiol is rapidly replacing older forms of administration, since it by-passes first-pass metabolism and thus doesn't have any increased risk of blod clotting as long as the patient doesn't overdose the medication.	1643403729.0	humtviq	t3_seybvk	t1_hump52l	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humtviq/

Every single product on the market is industrially processed, and has been since the industrial revolution. Do you think the milk you drink comes straight from the cow's udder?

5y0lr	So I get that they “roll down hill”. Diffusion makes sense but drift it the hard part for me.   1) How can a static electric field accelerate electrons unidirectionally. We should just make such a static field near a wire and have it continuously spin them in a loop. The energy input to a solar cell is light exciting electrons into the conduction band so we should just take a substance that already has electrons in the conduction band (any metal) and get a free current from it. The thing that turns what is effectively heat into current requires no energy.   2) how are the electrons always rolling down hill but somehow ending up where they started? Electrons aren’t like grandparents who had to “walk uphill both ways”. What goes down must have been raised up at some point. It is assumed that the electrons will recombine with a hole in the p region after traversing the circuit but what’s to stop an incoming electron from just going down the hill “again” by having missed any holes along the way creating infinitely continuing current. admittedly it would statistically decrease but still result in greater than 100% energy conversion by making multiple loops from one photon.   3) related to point 1, we know that there is a thermal generation rate and photogeneration rate for electron hole pairs. Why don’t the naturally occurring thermally generated pairs result in a free current thus violating the second law of thermodynamics and decreasing entropy (exactly Maxwell’s demon). I know they differ significantly in number but I don’t know why they would differ in behavior.   I don’t mean to say I want to believe in free energy because I know it’s definitely impossible.

What I learnt was that phytoestrogens are good for people whose estrogen is too high, because some receptors will get filled with weak phytoestrogens. I know some scientists believe that phytoestrogens should be avoided in those groups of people.   I’m interested in research saying there's no effect. I've been told to avoid soy because it's GMO and sprayed with glyphosate.

xtenz	This may be true, but it doesn’t chemically alter the juice, which is what is being suggested with the oat milk. Drinking orange juice is only worse for you than eating those oranges because you don’t consume all the fiber and you feel less full, so you’re more likely to just consume more calories. The same is likely true with oat milk, too.

hjydf	You don’t consume the fiber and it is far easier to consume a larger quantity of the fructose without the filling effects of the fiber or the slowing effects the fiber has on the digestion of that sugar.   Oats contain phytic acid, lectins and avenin. These are anti-nutrients. How much more of those are you getting from a cup of oat milk than a cup of oatmeal? Again, I do not know if oat milk is bad for you, my point is that it absolutely could be, even if oats weren’t. This is all an academic exercise for me, because I DO believe that eating oats is unhealthy, but that’s unrelated to the logical failure I was trying to respond to initially (the idea that if oats are healthy it must follow that there is nothing unhealthy about oat milk).	1643404953.0	humx1hq	t3_seybvk	t1_humvvvq	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humx1hq/

hjydf	I’m not just talking about additives (which ARE in many brands of oat milk) but I’m talking about industrial processing of a food. Nothing is added (generally) to orange juice, yet while eating an orange is unlikely to cause harm drinking a glass of the concentrated fructose from 12 oranges is terrible for you.   Again, I don’t know if oat milk is bad for you. But it IS processed and modified and is not the same as eating a bowl of steel cut oatmeal. Perhaps their are anti-nutrients or allergens in oats (very common in seeds/grains, etc…) which are fine in the quantities you might eat, but when concentrated to the levels consumed in oat milk can cause problems.	1643403857.0	humu7ki	t3_seybvk	t1_humtako	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/humu7ki/

r4y5o	>Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposure.  This is the problem with research on compounds like Roundup. While glyphosate in total isolation can be studied and declared safe, it is not used in the real world in isolation. The formula of Roundup is proprietary, so other ingredients may be affecting people, or interacting with glyphosate in a way that changes its chemical interactions and effects.  It's like studies of nicotine vs. tobacco. A study might find that nicotine didn't cause lung cancer, and the very human mental shortcut that associates nicotine with tobacco would infer the same outcomes for tobacco.   That kind of language is scientifically precise, but can be used by marketing and pr people to confuse and distract.  In short, it is possible that glyphosate is 100% safe for reproductive function, but for a brand-name herbicide which contains that ingredient to have dangerous effects on reproductive function.	1643406408.0	hun0rl7	t3_seybvk	t1_humoe7y	/r/askscience/comments/seybvk/oat_milk_bad_for_reproductive_organs/hun0rl7/
