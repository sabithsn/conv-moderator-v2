I'm not interested in some petty slap fight on reddit with someone who wont even read a few pages.  Their strategy has been to get western capital to gut itself voluntarily emptying all their industrial capacity into China where it can be allowed to grow but remain under tight control. And it's worked brilliantly. From that they've been able to develop their nation and raise conditions for workers at a one of the fastest rates seen in history. Literacy, housing, life expectancy, infrastructure, and wealth for the average worker have all been on nearly straight line up.	1642662282.0	htfi05d	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htfe2mo	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfi05d/

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:  >18. In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker.   Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

bizzqh4f	> No they didn't. Gay marriage is STILL not legal there.  I didn't say gay marriage. I said legalized homosexuality. And they did. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, the US legalized homosexuality in 2004.  > You assume much about me. And you do so incorrectly.  No assumptions are needed, you were homophobic in the edit of your 2nd reply to me. Maybe you aren't typically but that doesn't change your comment.  > That doesn't explain why there are billionaires-- a product of capitalism-- in a state that alleges to be communist.  Let's get some terms straight. Communism is the goal of all socialists — anarchist, marxist, or anything else. All forms of socialism besides anarchism believe that it's impossible to instantly safely go straight to full stateless communism, that a transitional state in order to weather counterrevolution and outside capitalist aggression is needed. Socialist who are not anarchist but are revolutionary tend to call themselves communist. A communist country is not a country that has fully moved to communism, that's a contradiction in terms of course, it's a country led by communists.  This in between period, where communism has not yet been established but political power has been taken out of the hands of capitalists is called socialism, also called a Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Dictatorship is meant in the old sense of "rule", not autocrat as we often use it today. This means 1 or more working class parties have seized control of power and that capitalists have been removed from political power and are being oppressed by the state.  Some Chinese capitalists are billionaires in the sense that they own shares of a company worth this amount, but that ownership is very precarious for them. If they step out of line the government is very quick to seize their assets, jail them, and often even execute them. As [has] (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/05/china-sentences-top-banker-to-death-for-corruption-and-bigamy) happened [repeatedly.] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-07-23/china-executes-14-billionaires-in-8-years-culture-news-reports)  The capitalist class acts as conduit to the outside world, prevent China from being encircled and sanctioned to death and allowing them to receive investment that then gets channeled into development. But they are kept on a very tight & lethal leash.  > A communist country would not have homeless people in it.  I never said they were perfect, far from it. There are very few people living in the street but there are still people who lack permanent housing, the majority of their homeless population lives as migrant workers. That's still an area that they're improving on, but fortunately their homeless rate has been on the decline for a while.	1642666249.0	htfnjb9	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htfisvk	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfnjb9/

I would always "put on a happy face" before my first class would come in and because of that, the class would start off on such a great note that carried through to the end. By the end of the day I actually *was* in a great mood. But then I'd go home and have to spend hours planning my lessons because there was no time to do that at work, and thus my mood would fall, and then the cycle would continue with me putting on a happy face for my first class the next day.	1642666910.0	htfoekg	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htc96f5	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfoekg/

df3v7	Thank you for giving your reasoning for posting the video, and explaining the insights it gave you. I think however, that in order to truly understand how and why we need to change society, and which methods we should use in the struggle, we have to grasp the basic concepts of Marxism and learn to apply them.  Marxism is a science. Scientific socialism was a term once used by many well-known Marxists at the beginning of the twentieth century, to emphasize the origin of their political ideology. As Marxists, we look at matters from an objective, scientific perspective, because of the philosophy of our ideology, dialectic materialism.  The dawn of class society (antique society) meant the development of many forms of oppression. From circumstances where every individual was equal (primitive communism) humans subjected each other to slavery. Women were bound to the home and subjected to men. However, from a greater perspective, this was a progressive development. The surplus product that was produced by slaves meant that a few people no longer had to work, and were able to develop science and art. Over the centuries, this system of class society allowed people to create beter societal circumstances over all.  Capitalism, when it first arose, was a massive step forward for the entirety of humankind. It has been able to develop the means of production to an astronomical level. The problem is, however, that most humanity can't benefit from it, since they are only used to generate more capital. Like u/International_Ad8264 said, moralism is subjective. In any given society, the dominant ideas are always those of the ruling class, and such is the case with morals. From the moral point of view of a capitalist, capitalism can be justified. From the point of view of a worker, it can't be. This is not what we base ourselves on; we look at, from the objective material conditions, what is *progressive* for human society. And capitalism is no longer progressive; therefore it should be abolished.	1642676802.0	htg0wlk	t3_s7y2it	t1_htd5nf0	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/htg0wlk/

With that said, the Chinese avg. annual income is closer to 13k-25k rmb, so a teacher's salary of around 30k is no joke.

if29jgcc	It can only be used in a life or death situation, yes the ability to properly aim is important. Lethality is based off caliber and ammunition type. A hollow point 9x19mm is the most commonly carried and it has serious wounding potential. Lethality concerns arise when someone is using the wrong caliber (.22lr, .380, etc) with FMJ ammunition. Shot placement however is still the number one determining factor in that situation.   But there is not a good chance it won't be lethal, anything above the belly button is serious, debilitating, and if not treated within the hour, often fatal wound, and most people place 2-5 rounds on target in these situations, the psychological effect of being shot plays a big role as well. I go for two to the  heart/lungs followed by one to the brain, it's what the army taught me and it is 100% effective, 100% of the time.	1642678499.0	htg38rz	t3_s8b6q0	t1_htff8ev	/r/socialism/comments/s8b6q0/i_honestly_cannot_believe_how_ignorant_the_right/htg38rz/

7ss1axks	Anarchists, communists and many socialists have the same end goal. The dissolution of the state. The main difference is the way to obtain said goal. With the dissolution of the state, we can only postulate what it would be like. Most likely local communities solving their own issues and working together. A key issue is that we cannot think of it in the context of modern and preexisting cultures. A huge cultural shift is a part of socialism in which we refocus attention from the individual to the community. This was the goal in states like the USSR, China, Cuba, the DPRK, Vietnam etc. And they have made great progress towards shifting attitudes. We cannot think of a stateless future based on our societies today, but based on what we want them to be.	1642689762.0	htgobay	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgobay/

We can't say how *exactly* our society will look like, that will be up to future generations, however what I mean is what is the framework of stateless society. How, approximately, it will look like? How do you see that?   Marx presented the framework of Socialism, who will be the owner of means of production, distribution, and exchange, who would be ruling class in Socialism e.t.c.

7ss1axks	For anarchists, they wish to immediately abolish the state. This is what most other leftist ideologies have a problem with, as it is quite utopian sounding. They do not want or have a transition period, and have not elaborated the processes that would take place, nor have they had a chance to experiment in the real world. I believe this is why they have not seen any successes at all despite being an older ideology than socialism. Communists have a very specific set of methods to dispose of the state, in part from Marx/Engels/Lenin/etc.	1642691042.0	htgrezl	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgqk1k	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrezl/
5xddq	Yes and no - partly!  This is one example of a quality of realized anarchism/communism. But in anarchism especially, the freedom of association is very important as well for a people in a system to regain autonomy. So there are other structural things that needs to be in place concerning how you create organizations and such. The goal is not just to create a system with x characteristics, it's about making it as good as possible so people want to stay in it out of their free will.	1642691100.0	htgrk33	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrk33/

The prominence of information technology makes this task very possible, just make an electronic referendum and let people decide this, the lawmakers don't make these decisions instantly and it takes several days for them too.   What I mean by "system of regulating relations". If we go according to principle of "from each according to their abilities to each according to their needs" then how do we make sure that canned soups produced in Vermont can reach the people in need in Wyoming?

It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail." - Manufacturing Consent, p. 23  Chomsky is constantly hinting at a material analysis of academia, but never applies it to his own career or political beliefs. His work is important and academically rigorous, but always incomplete without understanding Gramsci and Parenti.  Still, he was incredibly important for the western left, and is perhaps more responsible than anyone for the anti-imperialist trend and more explicitly socialist operations like the Empire Files or the Jakarta Method.  Debating him on the USSR is beating a dead horse. Besides, there are much better uses of his time and his work.

542njka0	The only answer isn’t “a moral one”. “Freedom” isn’t an inherently moral notion either. “Freedom” can also be obscured as relative. You have to chose and then *define* a measurement or framework, like materialism, in order to bring more precision.  Materialist ethics aren’t simply framed under “morality”. It is based on conclusions derived of logic and necessity due to evidence from observation and examination of relational (dialectal) material conditions.  Capitalism dismisses and devalues the very conditions required for it to function (which one could argue as immoral or unethical), but could better and more precisely argue is irrational. Through observation and evidence, it can be concluded that profitability, production, and efficiency are not most adequately and sustainably met through exploited laborers, exploited labor, or exploited living conditions.  You can reasonably argue that consistent and peer reviewed study of human nature and biology presents solid evidence that taxed (exhausted, sick, stressed, anxious, despairing) individuals are not optimally functioning and so unsustainable as a workforce and that low wages coupled with high costs of living displaces flow of commerce. Ultimately a marginalized, exploited, unsustainable, and undercut workforce is counterproductive and counterintuitive to the objectives and sustainability of a capitalist economy.  Hence our current state of late stage capitalism and the inevitability of it’s inherent collapse.  There is no sense of morality or ethics requiring of factoring into this conversation. Yes, ultimately dehumanizing people is immoral to many, but it is simply counterproductive for a thriving capitalist market economy.	1642699884.0	hthf15i	t3_s7y2it	t1_htdes5c	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthf15i/

542njka0	Yes. The notion that happiness and contentedness actually factor into achieving an economically thriving and successful society is just beginning to creep back into the conversation.

Economics tries the answer the question of how a economy or society *could* be organised to accomplish a given goal.  Morality is a social construct. Morality itself is malleable by the social dynamics that economics studies.  To try to prove or argue a point of economics with morality is like trying to pull your self up by your own boot laces.	1642703086.0	hthnupd	t3_s7y2it	t3_s7y2it	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthnupd/
2owiyvu3	The reason why you were banned probably has to do with the fact that your initial question was answered and rather than accept the answer given, you dug your heels in and initiated what could be considered a debate.  Granted you weren't being rude, but rule #6 of the sub is "no questions or debates." You broke the rules more than once. It is not a debate sub or an educational sub. Also there's a rule in the sub against criticizing AES, as it is a sub for criticizing liberals.  You probably wouldn't of been banned had you not continued your line of questioning which was answered very well by a comrade.  Also the way you formulated your questions could lead to them being taken in bad faith, in my opinion. Your first question was answered and than you asked "how do you explain the poverty in China?"   You literally started from the assumption that China is impoverished, rather than asking if its true that China is impoverished. (It isn't btw look into poverty elevation in China) Had you not framed the question like this and began asking questions/debating, you'd probably be left alone.	1642703391.0	hthoouw	t3_s8oq6l	t3_s8oq6l	/r/socialism/comments/s8oq6l/just_got_banned_from_shitliberalsay_because_i/hthoouw/

By the end of the day I actually *was* in a great mood. But then I'd go home and have to spend hours planning my lessons because there was no time to do that at work, and thus my mood would fall, and then the cycle would continue with me putting on a happy face for my first class the next day.	1642666910.0	htfoekg	t3_s7ui5e	t1_htc96f5	/r/socialism/comments/s7ui5e/original_title_is_terrible_undervalued_and/htfoekg/

Really, I'd just spend less time worrying about it, because that gun is almost certainly just going to remain an expensive accessory to paranoia and anxiety about a nonexistent threat (if it doesn't get stolen by someone who can use it more effectively, that is). It doesn't really matter how effectively your mum is going to be able to handle a situation if it never happens.

df3v7	Thank you for giving your reasoning for posting the video, and explaining the insights it gave you. I think however, that in order to truly understand how and why we need to change society, and which methods we should use in the struggle, we have to grasp the basic concepts of Marxism and learn to apply them.  Marxism is a science. Scientific socialism was a term once used by many well-known Marxists at the beginning of the twentieth century, to emphasize the origin of their political ideology. As Marxists, we look at matters from an objective, scientific perspective, because of the philosophy of our ideology, dialectic materialism.  The dawn of class society (antique society) meant the development of many forms of oppression. From circumstances where every individual was equal (primitive communism) humans subjected each other to slavery. Women were bound to the home and subjected to men. However, from a greater perspective, this was a progressive development. The surplus product that was produced by slaves meant that a few people no longer had to work, and were able to develop science and art. Over the centuries, this system of class society allowed people to create beter societal circumstances over all.  Capitalism, when it first arose, was a massive step forward for the entirety of humankind. It has been able to develop the means of production to an astronomical level. The problem is, however, that most humanity can't benefit from it, since they are only used to generate more capital. Like u/International_Ad8264 said, moralism is subjective. In any given society, the dominant ideas are always those of the ruling class, and such is the case with morals. From the moral point of view of a capitalist, capitalism can be justified. From the point of view of a worker, it can't be. This is not what we base ourselves on; we look at, from the objective material conditions, what is *progressive* for human society. And capitalism is no longer progressive; therefore it should be abolished.	1642676802.0	htg0wlk	t3_s7y2it	t1_htd5nf0	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/htg0wlk/

With that said, the Chinese avg. annual income is closer to 13k-25k rmb, so a teacher's salary of around 30k is no joke.

if29jgcc	It can only be used in a life or death situation, yes the ability to properly aim is important. Lethality is based off caliber and ammunition type. A hollow point 9x19mm is the most commonly carried and it has serious wounding potential. Lethality concerns arise when someone is using the wrong caliber (.22lr, .380, etc) with FMJ ammunition. Shot placement however is still the number one determining factor in that situation.   But there is not a good chance it won't be lethal, anything above the belly button is serious, debilitating, and if not treated within the hour, often fatal wound, and most people place 2-5 rounds on target in these situations, the psychological effect of being shot plays a big role as well. I go for two to the  heart/lungs followed by one to the brain, it's what the army taught me and it is 100% effective, 100% of the time.	1642678499.0	htg38rz	t3_s8b6q0	t1_htff8ev	/r/socialism/comments/s8b6q0/i_honestly_cannot_believe_how_ignorant_the_right/htg38rz/

7ss1axks	Anarchists, communists and many socialists have the same end goal. The dissolution of the state. The main difference is the way to obtain said goal. With the dissolution of the state, we can only postulate what it would be like. Most likely local communities solving their own issues and working together. A key issue is that we cannot think of it in the context of modern and preexisting cultures. A huge cultural shift is a part of socialism in which we refocus attention from the individual to the community. This was the goal in states like the USSR, China, Cuba, the DPRK, Vietnam etc. And they have made great progress towards shifting attitudes. We cannot think of a stateless future based on our societies today, but based on what we want them to be.	1642689762.0	htgobay	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgobay/

We can't say how *exactly* our society will look like, that will be up to future generations, however what I mean is what is the framework of stateless society. How, approximately, it will look like? How do you see that?   Marx presented the framework of Socialism, who will be the owner of means of production, distribution, and exchange, who would be ruling class in Socialism e.t.c. So my saying is, what would be the framework for the Anarchy, what does abolishment of State mean?	1642690688.0	htgqk1k	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgobay	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgqk1k/

7ss1axks	For anarchists, they wish to immediately abolish the state. This is what most other leftist ideologies have a problem with, as it is quite utopian sounding. They do not want or have a transition period, and have not elaborated the processes that would take place, nor have they had a chance to experiment in the real world. I believe this is why they have not seen any successes at all despite being an older ideology than socialism. Communists have a very specific set of methods to dispose of the state, in part from Marx/Engels/Lenin/etc.	1642691042.0	htgrezl	t3_s8kejm	t1_htgqk1k	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrezl/
5xddq	Yes and no - partly!  This is one example of a quality of realized anarchism/communism. But in anarchism especially, the freedom of association is very important as well for a people in a system to regain autonomy. So there are other structural things that needs to be in place concerning how you create organizations and such. The goal is not just to create a system with x characteristics, it's about making it as good as possible so people want to stay in it out of their free will.	1642691100.0	htgrk33	t3_s8kejm	t3_s8kejm	/r/socialism/comments/s8kejm/can_direct_democracy_be_considered_an_anachy/htgrk33/

It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail." - Manufacturing Consent, p. 23  Chomsky is constantly hinting at a material analysis of academia, but never applies it to his own career or political beliefs. His work is important and academically rigorous, but always incomplete without understanding Gramsci and Parenti.  Still, he was incredibly important for the western left, and is perhaps more responsible than anyone for the anti-imperialist trend and more explicitly socialist operations like the Empire Files or the Jakarta Method.  Debating him on the USSR is beating a dead horse. Besides, there are much better uses of his time and his work.

542njka0	The only answer isn’t “a moral one”. “Freedom” isn’t an inherently moral notion either. “Freedom” can also be obscured as relative. You have to chose and then *define* a measurement or framework, like materialism, in order to bring more precision.  Materialist ethics aren’t simply framed under “morality”. It is based on conclusions derived of logic and necessity due to evidence from observation and examination of relational (dialectal) material conditions.  Capitalism dismisses and devalues the very conditions required for it to function (which one could argue as immoral or unethical), but could better and more precisely argue is irrational. Through observation and evidence, it can be concluded that profitability, production, and efficiency are not most adequately and sustainably met through exploited laborers, exploited labor, or exploited living conditions.  You can reasonably argue that consistent and peer reviewed study of human nature and biology presents solid evidence that taxed (exhausted, sick, stressed, anxious, despairing) individuals are not optimally functioning and so unsustainable as a workforce and that low wages coupled with high costs of living displaces flow of commerce. Ultimately a marginalized, exploited, unsustainable, and undercut workforce is counterproductive and counterintuitive to the objectives and sustainability of a capitalist economy.  Hence our current state of late stage capitalism and the inevitability of it’s inherent collapse.  There is no sense of morality or ethics requiring of factoring into this conversation. Yes, ultimately dehumanizing people is immoral to many, but it is simply counterproductive for a thriving capitalist market economy.	1642699884.0	hthf15i	t3_s7y2it	t1_htdes5c	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthf15i/

542njka0	Yes. The notion that happiness and contentedness actually factor into achieving an economically thriving and successful society is just beginning to creep back into the conversation.  I prefer ethics as well. “Morality” seems a dogmatic (typically religious) notion which wants to isolate and distinguish itself from all rationale or reason.

561em	I totally disagree.  Economics does not try to answer the question of how society *should* be organised.  Economics tries the answer the question of how a economy or society *could* be organised to accomplish a given goal.  Morality is a social construct. Morality itself is malleable by the social dynamics that economics studies.  To try to prove or argue a point of economics with morality is like trying to pull your self up by your own boot laces.	1642703086.0	hthnupd	t3_s7y2it	t3_s7y2it	/r/socialism/comments/s7y2it/excellent_breakdown_of_how_weve_been_conditioned/hthnupd/
2owiyvu3	The reason why you were banned probably has to do with the fact that your initial question was answered and rather than accept the answer given, you dug your heels in and initiated what could be considered a debate.  Granted you weren't being rude, but rule #6 of the sub is "no questions or debates." You broke the rules more than once. It is not a debate sub or an educational sub. Also there's a rule in the sub against criticizing AES, as it is a sub for criticizing liberals.  You probably wouldn't of been banned had you not continued your line of questioning which was answered very well by a comrade.  Also the way you formulated your questions could lead to them being taken in bad faith, in my opinion. Your first question was answered and than you asked "how do you explain the poverty in China?"   You literally started from the assumption that China is impoverished, rather than asking if its true that China is impoverished. (It isn't btw look into poverty elevation in China) Had you not framed the question like this and began asking questions/debating, you'd probably be left alone.	1642703391.0	hthoouw	t3_s8oq6l	t3_s8oq6l	/r/socialism/comments/s8oq6l/just_got_banned_from_shitliberalsay_because_i/hthoouw/

98la35d8	I would describe myself as a classical Marxist, but I don’t believe we have yet to create a formula to actually implement a truly Marxist society. So, in a practical sense, I call myself a Market Socialist. I believe that we should start off the shift to a post-capitalist society by democratizing the work place. However, I believe we should should experiment with retaining aspects of a market (perhaps consisting of Trade Unions and worker run cooperatives) rather than attempting a stark and sudden shift into a post-market society.	1642715111.0	htijhhw	t3_s8s9e6	t3_s8s9e6	/r/socialism/comments/s8s9e6/what_in_your_opinion_is_the_best_formideology_of/htijhhw/

To me, socialism is the public ownership (the community/collective/etc.) over the means of production (factories/stores/etc.).

qdt83	Think of it more in the plural "socialisms" the thing they all broadly share in common is that it's a mode of production in which the workers, either with some apparatus or directly, control the places they work.   When you talk about it descriptively it's not tied to a particular government structure or economic model, there are a variety of approaches with different transitional states to achieve this.

Is this a gut feeling or are there academic sources for such claims?  >Not to mention that women were still seen as objects in these regions/times  Were they? Can you give an example of what it looked like?  Remind me, was it after the collapse of the USSR or before that women became overtly sexualized in the eastern bloc countries in order to advertise products? Was it after or before the collapse that sex tourism became popular in the East as more women fell into inescapable poverty? Was it after or before kindergartens and child care started becoming privatized and unavailable for poorer women? Was it after the collapse or before that education stopped being free thus limiting the opportunities for women? I can continue these rhetorical questions, but I think you understand the gist.   &#x200B;  > I'm all for socialism, but this kind of information is a nothing burger, and really doesn't do our cause any good.  Its pointing out that even in the USSR, which was not as developed as the US, women still enjoyed higher equality in daily lives. This is like pointing out that Cuba under many sanctions still manages to have a higher life expectancy than the US. These qualities are the goals of our movement, when even during scarcity its possible to have a more equal society.	1642726650.0	htja10f	t3_s8s37u	t1_htj4zdj	/r/socialism/comments/s8s37u/wonder_why_eastern_europe_was_on_top/htja10f/

9yw0k1tk	The CPC believes that [globalisation is an unstoppable trend of the times](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202201/1246218.shtml) and argues that instead of fighting against that current, that we should 'go with the flow' instead, bending the market in such a way that it creates the conditions necessary for global communism (or as China calls it nowadays: [a community with a shared future for mankind](http://kotakinabalu.china-consulate.org/eng/zlgxw_2/202112/t20211204_10462303.htm)). This process, will undoubtedly take centuries to complete, but nevertheless, in my eyes, it can be a real chance at building communism in the long term whilst seriously decreasing the risk of WWIII by effectively 'dragging out' the class struggle over a longer period of time.   I think this article is a gem. [The Long Game and Its Contradictions](https://leohezhao.medium.com/the-long-game-and-its-contradictions-8ff92823cf68)  To quote a bit:  >Internationally, China’s socialist foreign policy is decidedly not a continuation of the past socialist export of revolutions, but focused on the restructuring of global trade. It is a new form of internationalism based on the promotion of independent economic development of the over-exploited nations of the Global South, through mutually beneficial relationships and a policy of peaceful co-existence. The long term goal is nothing short of the elimination of the primary contradiction of imperialist capitalism — inter-continental inequality. Ending the fundamental injustice of our age, disparity between rich and poor countries, will also spell the end of myriads of cascading ancillary injustices. Alleviating poverty, promoting trade and learning, and building relationships based on respect and cooperation, new economic alliances between colonised regions will together displace Western hegemony, break imperialist cycles of violence, and end capitalist domination.  >The creation of a more equal and level global playing field will have two major effects upon the world. One: workers in the imperial core, the Global North, the “first world”, will again have bargaining power to make demands, because their jobs will no longer be easily exported to poor regions with low wages. Two: people of the imperial periphery, the Global South, the “third world”, will be empowered to set the terms of their own engagement in the world, and have the chance to build independent economic strength. This reduction of global inequality produces the material conditions necessary for global socialism with local characteristics.	1642729420.0	htjgfec	t3_s8r6ex	t3_s8r6ex	/r/socialism/comments/s8r6ex/why_hasnt_china_abandoned_there_mix_economy_yet/htjgfec/

90chub9m	ataturk was a great person, he took the smallest remaint of a fractured empire and had the restraint to not rely on nationalistic urges to blindly try to fight people over lands that would probably only be used for the exploitation of the peoples as it had been for the life of the ottoman empire  he built a modern and for the time progressive state for the people who lived there  he created a democratic system to leave behind so that people with ill intent should not stay in power. this action has sense proven less effective due to the current state of electoral politics in turkey (or tyrkyié, i'm not sure on the current name thing)  all in all he was a good person who did good things for his nation, the only "bad" thing he did was show that a state could be created as he did and that has let some places like pakistan try to create states like ataturk did, but including religion in their state and undermining what made ataturk's state succeed.	1642736594.0	htjws5m	t3_s8xhfn	t3_s8xhfn	/r/socialism/comments/s8xhfn/what_do_you_think_about_ataturk/htjws5m/

bxap9g57	First of all, China is not a "leading country," though it has came a long way since 1978, when 90%+ lived in absolute poverty. Though the living standards in China is far higher than countries with similar GDP per capita (Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, etc), it is still a developing country by many metrics.  Second of all, there is no magic light switch for Socialism. You can't just turn it on and say well, all foreign investment goes out the window, the State nationalizes all the foreign factories and whatnot (might be useless without the technicians who knows how to use them) no more diplomacy with capitalist countries, all private business shuts down immediately and is confiscated by the state, all home owners now live in a state owned property, etc.   The real world is complicated and messy, anyone who even ask such a question I would assume is someone who never worked a day of his life before.   I'm sure everyone has their "perfect vision" of what Socialism "ought" to look like, or how a perfect novel ought be, or how a perfect software ought to be. When you try building that utopian vision of yours, you realized, the world is really complicated, and you run into all sorts of contradictions.  It is like those who criticize China and Vietnam as not really socialist because they don't have universal healthcare and everyone living in pent houses in Shanghai 10 seconds after the revolution (like how many doctors that is trained in modern medicines are there in 1949 China??).  A revolution is not an event, it is a process, a struggle between the old world (China being dirt poor and dominated by foreign interests), and a socialist China (everyone lives moderately well, the contradictions of capitalism handled by the State dictatorship over the means of production, without looting from the Global South through imperialism).  If you are a Western (armchair) "socialist" who is more concerned about how China is not socialist, and you have far better policy suggestions for them on what the State should do, even better than the people who actually lives in China and understands the material contradictions of China far better than you do, then I'd suggest you get rid of your colonial mindset. Your criticisms will have 0 effect in China since the people who actually live there won't listen to you.   If you are so smart at knowing what socialism is, then build socialism in the West. Show the Chinese why they are wrong.	1642784900.0	htmcpy8	t3_s8r6ex	t3_s8r6ex	/r/socialism/comments/s8r6ex/why_hasnt_china_abandoned_there_mix_economy_yet/htmcpy8/

895z4	I’m answering more as a communist than a socialist. Imagine money isn’t a thing; there are distribution centers for things people need, like food, clothes, medicine, etc. Everyone who participates in doing the work to keep society running has access to those places and can take what they need when they need it.  To start a new “business,” you’ll need space, materials, and workers. We can have some mechanism where someone with an idea goes to a committee and says “hey, I have this idea and I think it will be useful in this way. I’ve got signatures from these people who say they’d like to see my idea be implemented and this is how it would benefit them.”  We need to stop thinking of businesses as being something a person can own for profit, instead looking at them as something that either helps or hurts society and the environment.	1642784999.0	htmczm7	t3_s9e476	t1_htm8th8	/r/socialism/comments/s9e476/curious_to_hear_about_how_a_business_would_work/htmczm7/

5xddq	As has been pointed out, "risk" has to be defined in this context. Risk in modern economics is having capital to risk. Even without considering if our hypothetical socialist society is moneyless or not, or of it has labor-vouchers for that matter, capital doesn't exist in socialism since the goal is to get eid of it.  "Risk" makes it sound like someone is not going to eat if you do bad business ... Oh how ideology is contained in language, right in front of us!  So to better refrain your question - will the workers share responsibility for the venture. Well, absolutely - not in an absolutist sense since everyone does different things. If someone specializes in being the treasurer, they have a greater responsibility to manage the "risk" of the budget. But in a general sense, if a business fails they all share the responsibility to manage the bankruptcy in what form it may take on this society. They might need to see that the remaining resources gets distributed to the community.	1642785724.0	htmeyfd	t3_s9e476	t3_s9e476	/r/socialism/comments/s9e476/curious_to_hear_about_how_a_business_would_work/htmeyfd/

g22lrree	You don't.  The concept of arming the public is a flawed one and the second amendment of the US constitution should be read how it really is: to arm well-regulated militias, which is the only context in which your right as a person to be armed is valid.  If that isn't the case, then why have that opening statement about well-regulated militias?  It's like saying you have the right to expose your breast in public in a general sense when the real law states "Given the purpose of breastfeeding a young child, the right to bare a breast in public should not be infringed."  And if people want to continue to misread it, then the second amendment should be amended or repealed by another amendment.  Guns are too dangerous and people are too unhinged and unpredictable to allow general arming of the public.  I realize that there's some sort of "socialist ideal" that imagines a glorious armed public to ensure government cooperation, but let's face it -- against any government, you're going to fail because they can afford more and better arms than you.  It's a trick by governments to enable even more class warfare and social unrest so they can gain even more control over us.  Maybe at one point in our history when governments were not so well-organized and militant as they are now were weapons a tool for change but now?  Now they only serve to divide us, harm us, and allow governmental oppression.  Throw your weapons in the fire and win hearts and minds with the most powerful weapons of all: your words.  Someone with a gun isn't going to change the world, because a government with guns just waiting for retaliation is going to keep that society down.	1642786290.0	htmgii0	t3_s9c35u	t1_htm4gw1	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htmgii0/
cwl7ysxq	I find it genuinely confusing how someone can simultaneously believe that the state is more “organized and militant” than ever and that a revolution can be achieved via *talking*. Both statements are beyond absurd and completely ignore the history of state repression and armed struggle against states, including ones far more militarized than the modern American one.  I agree that militias (specifically, democratic ones accountable to the public) should be entrusted with arms and that this is a viable path toward healthy gun control, but such a thing could only ever be possible after the working class has already seized power. Implying that this can be done without arms, however, is a wildly naïve and frankly dangerous statement. We can only build a new world peacefully when possible, and forcefully when necessary.	1642786973.0	htmidie	t3_s9c35u	t1_htmgii0	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htmidie/

10l3oh	Yea I always saw the purges as one of the darkest moments in Soviet history. They left the nation vulnerable when the nazis invaded, and to think that people who helped build the Soviet Union were deported to the Nazis as well is insult on top of injury. So many needlessly killed and imprisoned during and as a result of the purges after the Nazi invasions. Obviously the nazis are primarily responsible for the deaths in their invasion, but I would not be surprised that if Stalin kept more of his veterans in command and did not constantly try to appease the Nazis that the mass casualties in the early months of the war could have been avoided. But anger at the "social fascists" seems to have blinded them to the threat of the literal fascists.	1642791363.0	htmu7vk	t3_s9hpwg	t3_s9hpwg	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htmu7vk/

10tdy6	Bruh this is literally a textbook example of a strawman. I’m not a fan of the United States government by any means, but the plans of Disney/Marvel aren’t synonymous with state planning/funding. If you wanted to make a more valid comparison it probably would’ve been better to reference something such as the U.S.’s continued funding of Israel, or any other illegitimate project that the U.S. government is actually currently involved in.  Additionally, how does the technological plans or advancements of either country, by association, reflect the rights/well-being of their workers, or more specifically the relationship/ownership of workers to the means of production? This post seems less related to Socialism as Marx or Engels articulated it, and instead an irrelevant comparison between two nation-states, neither of which reflect a classless and stateless common society.	1642791653.0	htmv00n	t3_s9h09m	t3_s9h09m	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htmv00n/

Since then, they have infiltrated the government in order to force them into NATO in a direct threat to Russian sovereignty. Ukraine is nothing more than a chess peace to NATO and Russians feel justifiably threatened by a military alliance specifically created to fight them is attacking their neighbors. Russia has no concrete plans to invade Ukraine, this is nothing more than saber rattling by the US to justify an increased military presence. Not to mention Ukraine has been using nationalist sentiments to attack Russian culture in the east which has angered the ethnic Russian population there.

isx3s	This is a really tricky thing. It's hard to know what works for a given person. For me personally, I think the biggest influence is just exposure to more and different kinds of people. When you find a fellow worker who does something that bothers you in your interaction with them in their job, politely ask them why they do it. Explain that you've always wondered about it and you don't know their industry very well. Try to understand the factors that create the end result you're seeing. When I see the things that produce other people's behaviors I don't like, I find it becomes easier to see the systemic nature of it.	1642792469.0	htmx7xj	t3_s9i9xq	t3_s9i9xq	/r/socialism/comments/s9i9xq/do_you_ever_struggle_with_unlearning_capitalist/htmx7xj/

3nhpoje1	This is well known. Here's some more examples:    "There were other consequences of the Pact too. During the detailed negotiations, the German side raised the question of German political refugees in the Soviet Union. Stalin had no interest in protecting them; indeed he was deeply suspicious of foreigners of any kind who had found a home in Russia, and of many of the Russians who came into contact with them. So he agreed to send them back to the Third Reich. Some 4,000 German citizens were duly rounded up and handed over to the Gestapo by the Soviet authorities after the Pact had been signed. Between 1,000 and 1,200 were German Communists. Some, like Margarete Buber-Neumann, had already been imprisoned by Stalin’s secret police before being sent to a German concentration camp; her husband, Heinz Neumann, had been purged from the German Party leadership in 1932 for urging a united front with the Social Democrats against the Nazi threat; sent first to Spain, then Moscow, he had been arrested in 1937 and executed. His widow was deported directly from a Soviet labour camp to Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1940. For those German Communist exiles who were Jewish, an even worse fate was in store. The conductor and composer Hans Walter David was one of their number. Born in 1893, he had fled to Paris in 1933 then Moscow in 1935. He fell victim to Stalin’s great purge in 1937, and was sentenced to a labour camp in 1939 for allegedly spying for the Germans, an example of Stalin’s paranoid suspicion of foreigners in the Soviet Union. In April 1940, David was informed that his sentence had been commuted into one of deportation. He was handed over to the Germans on 2 May 1940, and murdered by the SS."	1642792536.0	htmxejp	t3_s9hpwg	t3_s9hpwg	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htmxejp/

2krb31d2	Note: I am not a Ukrainian, but I was born in the USSR and my grandmother as well as her family come from Crimea. They lost everything during the October Revolution and many members of my family were murdered by the Bolsheviks. They considered themselves Russian yet they liked the Ukrainian culture and language more. I used to see myself as a Russian because that is the culture and language I grew up with, yet I am so utterly disgusted by what Russia is doing that I do not consider myself Russian anymore. Fortunately, I do not live there anymore either.   Now about the Ukrainians and Russians:  The relations between Russia and Ukraine have never been good. In short, Russia stole Ukrainian history and has been mocking the Ukrainians as some kind of simple-minded "brotherly nation" for several centuries in a row. The reality is that Ukraine is pretty much the birthplace of Kievan Rus as Kyiv was its capital.   Over time, Kievan Rus collapsed and was divided between different entities whereas some parts, mainly Novgorod and Muscovy, managed to survive on their own despite paying a large tribute to the Mongols. After the Mongols were beaten back several centuries later, Muscovy conquered the Novgorod Republic and then kept adding more territories transforming itself into Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire. The Russians began to view themselves as the "Great Russians" while Ukrainians were referred to as "Little Russians". The modern explanation is that this simply refers to the difference in size and population, yet I doubt you want to be referred to as "little + your people's name" by another nation. Because of the imperial past, many Russians are still very chauvinistic which you can easily understand if you speak the language.   In the Russian Empire the use of Ukrainian was forbidden. In the USSR it was discouraged and active Russification of Ukrainians (as well as all peoples of the USSR) took place. The Ukrainians were never truly fond of the Russians during the Soviet times but the gradual Russification and replacement of the ethnic groups by the Russians did make it seem that the relations were good.   After the collapse of the USSR, all the former Soviet republics had this brief moment of euphoria when they thought they would start living better because life in the USSR was absolute shit. People were extremely poor, yet the Soviet elite lived far better. In reality, the October Revolution changed nothing: they just replaced the Tsar with the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and the nobility with various top decision-making members of the Communist Party.   People were fed up, but nobody really knew how to transform their economy to become more productive and competitive in the global market. Remember, we did not participate in the global economy for decades and prior to that the Russian Empire was a backward agrarian state run by monarchs with absolute power. Just like most other post-Soviet republics, Ukraine was suffering from endemic corruption, poverty, inefficiency in virtually every sector of the economy, but this made it easier for the ultra rich business people and corrupt officials to maintain control and enrich themselves even more. Since all of them were still economically tied to Moscow due to the way the Soviet economy was built, they kept doing what Moscow told them to do.   In the early 2000s people got fed up with this situation and they demanded changes. This is why the Orange Revolution happened. The same things happened in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and to a lesser extent in Armenia. The Russians, however, felt betrayed, and who is easier to blame than the US and EU? Yes, the US was involved because it was the only unchallenged superpower left - can you imagine it ever staying away from such an  opportunity? But it played a rather minor role of advising and trying to limit the chaos, it did not start the revolution. The people themselves were fed up with the old ways of living.   Unfortunately, there is no quick and painless way to transform your poor country into a developed one when it had been an integral part of an autocratic regime for centuries. So they failed and this led to Maidan in 2014 with all the mess that we see today. Russia is paranoid about losing control over its former republics because Putin fears the same events happening in Russia itself. NATO, US, EU - these are all boogeymen created by the paranoid minds of the Soviets and kept alive by Putin and his team of kleptocrats.   The events in Kazakhstan are just the continuation of the story. People want changes while Russia and its puppet governments in the former Soviet republics want to maintain a firm grip and continue stealing. The West and especially the US have actually been very disengaged from the whole process. Maybe it is for the best but right now Ukraine does need help as they do not want to be with Russia and there is no chance they will forget what the Russians did there.	1642794686.0	htn3cjj	t3_s9hcwj	t3_s9hcwj	/r/socialism/comments/s9hcwj/opinions_on_ukraine_and_russia_conflict/htn3cjj/

68a85	Transcription:  Eight Stages of White Settler-Colonial Denial   1\. "They didn't exist"   - Complete denial of Indigenous presence in a given area (country, province, etc). Includes denial of Indigeneity, e.g. "Indigenous Peoples are Settlers too". (terra nullius)   2\. "If they did, they weren't here"   - Denial that Indigenous People inhabit/travel/harvest/exist in a specific area. Often based on euro-centric definitions of evidence of occupation. (terra nullius)   3\. "If they were, they didn't use the land"   - Denial that Indigenous People have a connection with the Land. Often based on euro-centric worldviews of the land as something to be owned and extracted. (doctrine of discovery)  4\. "If they did, they didn't deserve it"   - Denial that Indigenous People have rights to their Lands. Often based on euro- centric value judgements of "primitive vs. civilized", “nomadic vs. sedentary". (great chain of being)   5\. "If they did, they lost it"   - Denial that Indigenous People retain their rights to their Lands. Often based on colonially imposed European systems of law /"might makes right" worldviews. (right of conquest)   6\. "If they didn't, it doesn't matter any more"    - Denial that Indigenous Rights are still binding and take precedence. Often based on false claims of supremacy of colonial legal institutions and systems.  (Westphalian sovereignty)  7\. "If it does, we need to move on".   - Denial that violations of Indigenous Rights requires redress. Often based on claims redress is "disruptive/unfair/reverse racism" & false calls for "equality". (liberalism)    8\. "If we can't, we are you"   - Denial of separateness of Indigenous Peoples and Rights. Often based on attempts to reduce Indigenous Rights to Human Rights, claim Indigeneity, etc. "Eieht Stages of Sertler Denial". **(self-indigenization)**	1642794725.0	htn3gi9	t3_s9j4x9	t3_s9j4x9	/r/socialism/comments/s9j4x9/eight_stages_of_white_settlercolonial_denial/htn3gi9/

m2l6l	Turns out that it takes a *while* to catch up to industrialized societies with a two hundred year head start and the accumulated wealth of at least *five hundred* years of colonialism and Imperialism.  That's actually a really important thing to note, if China was willing to colonize, they'd be advancing much quicker like the West did, at the expense of their exploited subjects, of course. But imperialism runs directly contrary to the most basic ideas of socialism and communism, so developing the means of production necessary to begin the transition to socialism is taking longer.	1642795214.0	htn4tbj	t3_s9h09m	t1_htmsua8	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htn4tbj/

5kall6by	As a friendly reminder to all comrades, whether we find Stalin good or bad is mostly an irrelevant and useless debate.  We should seek to understand the history of the USSR *based on the conditions they faced at the time* and extract whatever lessons we can insofar as they reflect the present day.  There were tremendous gains for the working class under Stalin, yet there were also many excesses and misguided policies.  Our job as 21st century socialists is not to bicker with one another over whether the legacy of this particular era falls into the "good' or "bad" column- it's to learn from it and use it to help us understand our current situation.	1642796462.0	htn87qb	t3_s9hpwg	t3_s9hpwg	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htn87qb/

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:  >18. In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker.   Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

454o3	The marxist-leninist system is roughly (although not exactly) similar in China to what we currently can see in Cuba and used to in the USSR - although the chinese is the one I know the least about, so you should definitely research this yourself. [Here's a video that goes into more detail than I can cover in a reddit post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpOzT7alVK8).  In these systems you don't vote for parties but directly for individuals to your local council or assembly, these people are folks who live in your territory so you will probably know them, may or may not be party members, and may even be you if you get the votes necessary to be elected. All layers of government above this one are constituted from delegates from the lower levels.   The party does not participate in this process, it is in fact explicitly banned from campaigning for any candidate (at least in Cuba), so we can't really draw comparisons to parties in liberal democracies because the communist party runs parallel to the actual state apparatus, not within it. The one-party systems are more accurately described as no-party systems.	1642798233.0	htnd5s6	t3_s9h09m	t1_htn9yeq	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnd5s6/

Freedom House explains pretty well why this process is not democratic, I encourage you to read it if you are interested, particularly the electoral process part. (https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2021). The idea is that since all candidate members of the NPC are vetted by one-party it doesn't matter who is elected in the end, because they will oppose no resistance to the ruling party. Therefore it is not democratic since people do have the power to influence the decision of their government.	1642799129.0	htnfo2a	t3_s9h09m	t1_htnd5s6	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnfo2a/

2vu9zikv	I think arming up in a right proper "workers controlled production" society will be unrecognizable to anywhere in anglo-capitalist today, regardless of context.  Gun fetishism (both meanings) is bad, but familiarization with guns is good, and in some cases (arguably america the most), use of firearms may need to happen outside of certified revolutionary^tm moments.  Almost all states in the west have volunteer armies that go abroad to bomb poor people. On balance, a reactionary indoctrination force, not a proletarianizing one, with some exceptions. Even then it's of the "socialism is when free cafeteria and Veterans medical benefits" not "socialism is when my job is run by workers" kind of impressions.  We need to flip armies, and there's no question about it.

Additionally, I feel I don't need to explain why a state that meet political dissenters with violence does not offer a viable ground for democracy. The fact that they don't allow their own citizens to fully access internet while (pretty much) everyone uses VPNs is proof enough that the citizens are not in control of state policies, otherwise their great firewall would be long gone.	1642800145.0	htnii0c	t3_s9h09m	t1_htng77a	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnii0c/

2vu9zikv	Socialism grandpa Karl, in 1850.  > The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition, and the revival of the old-style citizens’ militia against the workers, must be opposed.  > Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.  In fact you can see how it's different from the 2A, which calls for arming people in defense of a capitalist state that was at the time an unlimited chattel slaving (versus today where you have to go to jail to be subject to "involuntary servitude" under 13A) native-genociding apparatus. Instead of being "citizens", marx calls for a subjectivity of "workers" to be armed with basically anything and everything, and an inalienable right to defend themselves and their collective interests.	1642800753.0	htnk6y4	t3_s9c35u	t1_htngjx6	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htnk6y4/

hrlimt9j	Partially yes, and it could be argued that this is due to the divide between different spectrum of the left, from the social democratic liberal to the Marxist-Leninist.   The main culprit of this phenomenon in my opinion is over a century of red scare propaganda that has been cultivated in the imperial core. Potential Marxist-leninists are repelled from associating with it due to smear campaigns like "100 million dead from communism" (this is actually taken from the Black Book of Communism, which includes nAzi deaths during WW2 as victims of communism). Likewise Marxist-leninists are reluctant to associate with SocDems because many of their policies are liberal and rely on capitalism and they only accept reform through electoralism (read Vladimir Lenin's book, State and Revolution if you want a ML point of view ;).  The red scare not only demonised and vilified socialists and communists, generally anybody who was even remotely left leaning. This was most common during the cold war but thanks to the rise of the internet and social media red scare ideology is once again taking hold and becoming more relevant.  This is just my take on it and I have only recently dived more deeply into theory. My recommendation is to read theory and get educated. The people who wrote prominent socialist literature have a much more solid grasp of ideals than most likely any of us.	1642801022.0	htnky67	t3_s9j83o	t3_s9j83o	/r/socialism/comments/s9j83o/i_feel_that_the_left_suffer_because_they_dont/htnky67/

eynhs	Head over to r/neoliberalism where you belong.  The last century of political history has shown time and time again that democracy as practiced under capitalism is merely a guise to disguise true political power. Republican or democrat, conservative or liberal, they are both fundamentally secondary to private economic actors who control their funding and asset allocation. Nearly every attempt to elect a socialist through conventional channels has descended into fascism or been overthrown in a coup (a la Pinochet). If you still think socialism can be achieved through solely through “representative” democracy than you’ve learned nothing from the lessons of the last century.	1642805517.0	htnx2yz	t3_s9h09m	t1_htn5ea6	/r/socialism/comments/s9h09m/sitting_in_a_bullet_train_sitting_in_a_movie/htnx2yz/

The other forms of colonization might have a different stage setup, though I don't personally know enough about how other cultures were affected by colonization to speak on it.  This list seems pretty accurate for how white colonialism has evolved thus far.     And I suspect the reason there isn't a "good place" is because we haven't achieved that yet and still aren't sure exactly what that'd look like.  We need hindsight for that, and so far none of the issues of white colonialism have been resolved. We haven't won that "happy ending" yet.	1642810518.0	hto9qav	t3_s9j4x9	t1_htnn9on	/r/socialism/comments/s9j4x9/eight_stages_of_white_settlercolonial_denial/hto9qav/

I can’t speak for every country but in mine more profits than ever are being spent on stock buybacks and share holder dividends enriching billionaire. So nearly every dollar of profit is going into the wealth of the richest untaxed and not into any investment that would benefit the workers. Also it goes untaxed because instead of selling stocks and classifying it as income they borrow against their investments avoiding taxes, that’s how Elon Musk paid no taxes for ten years.	1642811805.0	htocwkn	t3_s9g5vi	t3_s9g5vi	/r/socialism/comments/s9g5vi/how_can_this_tax_plan_be_fair/htocwkn/

4dkb6kkn	There seems to be a few holes here, but I'm also having trouble sorting out propaganda and the real thing.   The idea that "Ukraine is historically Russian" is a bold statement and ignores it being Polish-Lithuanian and even independent for a long time.  Additionally, from what I've been able to sort out, most of the ethnic Russians in Ukraine were communities established through Stalinist programs displacing and replacing locals. Crimea is neither Ukrainian nor Russian historically, but rather Tartars are the rightful occupants.  Also, the current government doesn't seem to have started as a facist one, but is rather colluding with them despite their lack of popularity.  I'd like to see reliable analysis and reports with more details, but from what I can find, this is tipped way more in the opposite direction than anything I've seen in the neoliberal media.	1642819581.0	htovhbp	t3_s9ojk7	t3_s9ojk7	/r/socialism/comments/s9ojk7/roots_of_the_ukraine_crisis/htovhbp/

Until you know people whose houses have been visited by nonstate fascists who also cannot call the police for their own safety, howabout you stow it?	1642822883.0	htp35es	t3_s9c35u	t1_htou0zi	/r/socialism/comments/s9c35u/some_days_i_just_want_say_to_fuck_it_maybe_this/htp35es/

ocfey	Oh, that is a weird claim (as in my brain couldn't process someone saying "I'm indigenous" when they aren't- reality is satire) to make so the title threw me off, leaving me much confused for context in the following weird wording.   "Denial of separateness of Indigenous Peoples and Rights." sounds like we're separating peoples and rights. I would write that "Indigenous Peoples and their Rights" if I'm reading it correctly now.  "Often based on attempts to reduce Indigenous Rights to Human Rights," again is a weird claim. I'm not sure what this would mean in actual application.   "claim Indigeneity," without the aforementioned context of colonizers claiming to be indigenous this was really confusing.	1642823605.0	htp4t2n	t3_s9j4x9	t1_htorizd	/r/socialism/comments/s9j4x9/eight_stages_of_white_settlercolonial_denial/htp4t2n/

1fysj11v	Here's what I understand about the orthodox marxist view on robots and automation under capitalism.  Most (if not all) Marxists are proponents of the labor theory of value. Meaning they believe that value is created through our labor.  Robots aren't sentient, and so they aren't people. If they aren't people then they can't create value. If they can't create value, then there is no surplus value that is being extracted from them.   So no exploitation and therefore no oppression.   That doesn't mean that Marxists shouldn't be opposed to capitalism's feverish efforts at automation. Automation is a part of what Marx called "dead labor". Dead labor combined with capitalism's profit-driven production inevitably results in crises of overproduction. This is because, paradoxically, as productivity increases, the rate of profit decreases.   So not only does automation result in short term losses for the worker whose job is replaced by a machine, but it also results in long term crises of overproduction. Sadly, The burden of these crises will inevitably be placed on the worker's shoulders.  There ya go, hope that made sense.	1642833872.0	htpofo2	t3_s9ujak	t3_s9ujak	/r/socialism/comments/s9ujak/are_robots_should_be_considered_oppressed_workers/htpofo2/

48egpu0v	If you listen to the video, he's kinda flimsy on what exactly he means. I bet he's thinking the potential for a European war like this hasn't happened since WW2, but yeah, it doesn't really make sense the way he worded it. Plenty of nuclear powers have invaded other countries since WW2. Russia invaded Afghanistan, then the U.S. did so as well. You've got Korea and Vietnam which involved a mix of Russia, China, and the U.S.. Let's also not forget that any invasion France has participated in since 1960 was technically an invasion by a nuclear power.  More modern examples would be obviously Crimea, as well as China siezing small pieces of territory from India.   Then there's always the potential China will invade Taiwan, or that the U.S. will find a new cause to stick their noses in.	1642835719.0	htprdqy	t3_s9qwnw	t3_s9qwnw	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htprdqy/

5rc91lv2	> I don't think the purpose is to "cover over"  My argument wasn't about Alex de Jong's purpose. Here's what i said in parenthesis:   > historical context (which is covered over by anti-communists)  The official anti-communist historical memory of western states cover over the millions of refugees saved by the USSR during that specific time period. You just don't hear about it even though it's a historical fact that impacted millions of peoples of lives. The Prague Deceleration and 'victims of Nazism-Stalinism' commemorations speak for themselves. By not mentioning it in a socialist perspective on those events, this article played into that dominant anti-communist covering over. It should have been mentioned at least briefly in a single line. That would not detract from the article's "focus" one bit.   So my argument wasn't originally about Alex de Jong's "purpose", but since you want to talk about that we can. Alex de Jong is a representative of a trotskyist Fourth International journal in the Netherlands. In a previous article he claimed that the CPP-NPA-NDFP are "orthodox Stalinist monsters marching towards irrelevance" and specifically singled out Joma Sison, a political refugee of that movement living in the Netherlands, as an alleged perpetrator of grave crimes (something the current government of the Philippines also claims in requests for his extradition). The article was the subject of many debunking by [members of the National Democratic movement](https://pinoyweekly.org/2015/08/capitulation-no-substitute-for-national-liberation/), among others.	1642839030.0	htpwbkp	t3_s9hpwg	t1_htptcss	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/htpwbkp/
39afm	It was definitely awkward and any of us can be forgiven for not understanding exactly what he meant. I think your interpretation is where he landed by my the end of the statement, but what he was thinking at that exact moment we’d have to ask him. What we shouldn’t do, though, is jump to the worst possible conclusion and act like there’s no other interpretation for something that wasn’t clearly spoken. My read is it’s just RNC Report pushing the senile thing.

I'd even argue the other way around since in Kosovo back in 1999 there were at least a significant amount of people who did not want to split from Serbia while in donbass 2014 there was basically no one who wanted to stay in the same country with the fascist ukrainian regime.	1642839763.0	htpxe8w	t3_s9qwnw	t3_s9qwnw	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htpxe8w/

The agents were mostly Polish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian exiles who had been trained in the United Kingdom and Sweden and were to link up with the anti-Soviet resistance against the communist governments (the cursed soldiers, the Forest Brothers). The naval operations of the programme were carried out by German crew-members of the German Mine Sweeping Administration under the control of the Royal Navy.   ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/socialism/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)	1642840643.0	htpynay	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htpym22	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htpynay/

122z72	Socialism references a wide variety of ideologies, it's actually kind of hard to land on a super precise definition.  I tend to work off the assumption that socialism is a desire to organise the economy in an aggressively egalitarian manner for the benefit of the lower classes, this can be done via the state or other means (like worker co-ops).  To help give a clearer picture, I'd like to give you the following questions that help paint a clearer picture of the current socialist landscape:  * How should we understand historical states like the USSR? What triggered their collapse? * Is China currently a legitimate socialist project? * What is the most practical method to achieve to socialism? * When is it possible to pursue socialism in an immoral manner? * How should we relate to cultural issues like religion and nationalism? * How do we deal with anti-socialists?	1642841357.0	htpzo2o	t3_s9x6pr	t3_s9x6pr	/r/socialism/comments/s9x6pr/what_is_difference_between_socialism_and/htpzo2o/

Not truly revolutionary, or beyond common sense, and he was granted a modicum of security due to his lineage as a prince. Hence, we hear of him and not a million others who met a tragic fate at the hands of the zealots.    But, Jesus is an invention. Far too little of Jesus is upto historical scrutiny and even the book is written by different people, compiled by others, amended and changed by yet others, modified and bowdlerized by others, still. Arrian Christianity, for example is fundamentally distinct from Catholicism as it is from Protestantism.   Anyways. None of them were revolutionaries.

My thought was that they rejected social classes, Gautama coming from a privileged aristocracy are not much different from Che, people twisting it into something else is exactly what happens even to this day.

f1r7djnh	Compare the GDP of the US to Russia. If Putin could afford it he would be doing the same shit.  Russia has been competing with the US in subverting local governments for their own interests. And these interests are no longer defensivd and/or in the interests of implementing socialism.  Some drivers of Russian Capitalistic Imperialism:  Its massive energy corporations which are the main component of its economy.  Rozneft, Gazprom, Transneft  Its remerging MIC in direct competition with the US to sell arms.  Russian so called military aid is imperialist in the sense it seeks to protect existing and gain additional financial assets. For example in Syria.  To prevent the construction of a US/Qatar backed Pipeline or a Iran backed pipeline which would compete vs Russian Pipelines into Europe.  Syria is critical in that it offers pipelines routes or Russias competitors through to Europe.	1642851673.0	htqdwys	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htporyp	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/htqdwys/

92u3hwv9	You are sadly making an argument built upon the fallacy of special pleading with zero-evidence to back up your claims or counter any position.   Of course, we don't need social classes. But, Jesus was built upon exclusionary principle and in agreement with slavery. This is not in dispute. So, Jesus was closer to ISIS level fundamentalists than say a revolutionary like Che.   Buddha is a bit complicated, since he never classified himself as being a Buddhist. Only a seeker of truth, a teacher. But, he was an obvious liar, wrt the ideas of Samsara or Nirvana and the rest.   Anyways. None of them were revolutionaries. Jesus, a theocrat was not even close to socialist principles.	1642853354.0	htqgc64	t3_sa03ye	t1_htqfjw5	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htqgc64/

In Jesus’ case the brutality that was unleashed in his name was unmatched and has huge ramifications in the past, present and future.  In Buddha’s case the sangha’s that were created exclude the majority of people seeking to become monks and in so doing they’ll become lay Buddhists instead. This is so they’ll support the monastics of which they are very few.	1642853553.0	htqgmtd	t3_sa03ye	t3_sa03ye	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htqgmtd/

bdtzv	Thank you so much. That is a very good quote, "An injury to one is an injury to all".   I think the pen often leads to the sword.  I don't know who said this originally, but I know I've heard that "revolution is war with bloodshed, and politics is war without bloodshed". I think that is very apt, and I think that we have arrived at the point now where there is much more politics than there is war. The right to bear arms was relevant in 1791, but I think our arms have changed. In a sense, our arms have always been our voices, our vote, but I think now the second amendment has very much become synonymous with the first: the freedom to assemble and petition the government to change. That is revolution, that is politics, in the current age.  And that's what we're trying to do here. We're trying to show people that their voices still have power. But instead of assembling in the street, we're assembling online, and we're concentrating our voices in one direction to have the maximal effect. We saw this with SOPA, what the internet could do, and we're going to see our power again with takejohndown.com.

The distrust is valid. But due to a lack of education and critical thinking skills, that distrust is exploited to fuel the culture war, the class war and really just keep everyone confused and divided while the oligarchy reaps incredible Capitol and Power/Influence.

2dvcf9gx	The conflict in Israel/Palestine is a geopolitical conflict masked as a religious conflict. Israel is funded by the West because it gives countries like the US a foothold in the Middle East. Palestinians revolt because their homes are stolen, not because they hate Jews. And by the way, victims of Israeli colonialism aren’t just Muslims, but Christians and Atheists as well. Western media paints it as a ethnoreligious conflict because viewing one side as mostly Arab Muslims means it’s easy for audiences to see them as the “bad guys,” because Arab Muslims are always the “bad guys.”	1642863118.0	htqy3oa	t3_s9ir4v	t1_hto3ne3	/r/socialism/comments/s9ir4v/dozens_of_israeli_settlers_attacked_palestinian/htqy3oa/

If you listen to his whole answer, Biden isn’t simply conveying a gross mischaracterization of history (ie [Russia defending itself](https://youtu.be/7zZwhGHeIYM) is literally Nazi Germany invading Poland; whereas NATO expanding right up to their borders is just another case of the Good Guys spreading democracy and rainbows and unicorns, as usual).  No, the context, the nuance, that’s missing in this discussion is that he used that mischaracterization to convey a thinly-veiled threat, not just to Russia, but to the entire world: The US is willing to risk starting WWIII in order to continue its encirclement of its near-peer competitors; we will jeopardize life on earth in order to win a game of chicken that we started in someone else’s driveway.

5xddq	Have at it with the numerous sources listed on the Wikipedia page about it:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus  This talk with historian, and professor of religious studies, Bart Ehrman specifically addresses the ideas spread on the internet about this (I think it's even quoted on the Wikipedia page):  https://youtu.be/hnybQxIgfPw  We have very limited information on exactly who Jesus was, and a lot of the specifics are of course mythical due to that the earliest sources happen some 20-30 years after Jesus' death, Paul for an example. But there did exist a preacher of some sort, probably named Jesus/Yeshua, who had followers who created the religion afterwards.  I recommend reading up on early Christian history, it's quite fascinating! Things like early theological debates and developments about whether Jesus was divine, or God himself, or not, which the synoptic gospels don't assert - only his resurrection by God is attested.	1642868195.0	htr9vcw	t3_sa03ye	t1_htr5glv	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htr9vcw/

I mean if the son of god, born of a virgin mother, inseminated by a sky-daddy sperm, re-animated after his death, etc was historically proven, then it would be some real special news. Alas, nothing of this sort is presented by you.   In fact, most of bible is a contradiction to known history - Herod was dead for about 4 years before Yeshua/Jee-suss' birth, for example. And no massacre of the children either.   And there is a Jesus who lives down the favela.

I dont see how goverments can ever care for people, they only exist to keep people in power and to keep 99% down.

4207vzct	If we take what you are saying as true, which we shouldn’t because it isn’t, but for the sake of argument we’ll say you are correct. I wonder why “straight” socialism never works? Let’s ask ourselves that.   The most glaring and obvious reason is American imperialism and hegemony. They will do anything to prevent socialism from being enacted anywhere. They even supported a regime change in Bolivia just recently. Even though, as you said, Morales is running more of a social democracy.   But the other reason is that most states who attempt socialism are more or less incredibly impoverished, sometimes third world, countries. They don’t have the resources to adopt a post scarcity society. So they have to make some sacrifices in order to build the economy they need to actually build socialism.   But again, this is pointless because pure socialism has, does, and can work.

5rc91lv2	Why is Alex de Jong someone you'll read and circulate but you dismiss Grover Furr out-of-hand? Alex de Jong claimed there was a ["assassination campaign" by the CPP-NPA-NDFP based on the allegation of Walden Bello](https://pinoyweekly.org/2015/08/the-war-rages-on/), a former revolutionary who became a government official and Ford Foundation employee ([Ford Foundation has a history of being used as CIA front](https://petras.lahaine.org/the-ford-foundation-and-the-cia-a-documented-case-of-philanthropic-collaboration-with-the-secret-police/)). Bello's allegation which forms the core of Alex de Jong's argument is based on an Ang Bayan chart from December 2004 showing trotskyist splits that is mischaracterized as a "hit list" (there is no call to extrajudicial violence attached to the chart). [You can see the chart here](https://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-47/041207eng.pdf)  It's certainly at least worth a look at, just like I read this article you posted even though I find Alex de Jong's politics contemptible.	1642881469.0	hts7o7t	t3_s9hpwg	t1_hts4ndj	/r/socialism/comments/s9hpwg/stalin_handed_hundreds_of_communists_over_to/hts7o7t/

fhdlo4eu	It has been my experience that there is no argument in existence for someone who has no interest in opening their mind or is just not open to having their minds changed by new information.   The problem with a lot of MAGA nuts is that they know absolutely everything and only seek information that reinforces what they already believe and any argument or evidence to the contrary has next to no meaning.  The left has theory, and discussion; the right has talking points and suppression. You can see it in their politics. They’re not really *for* anything.  My only advice is to give them the info, or the resources, and leave it be. If they care, they will seek it out. Don’t beat a dead horse. Save your energy for those who are open to having their minds changed, or espouse left wing ideals but are stuck with a negative connotation of socialism.	1642882591.0	htsaerf	t3_sa87wd	t3_sa87wd	/r/socialism/comments/sa87wd/is_there_a_more_clear_argument_to_a_maga_that/htsaerf/

Imperialism still very much exists in Bolivia even after all these years of the so-called "pink tide", so until imperialism is militarily and politically defeated in the area Socialism i.e. the dictatorship of the proletariat should be very much out of the question. Not to mention that Morales has been willing to court PRC imperialism becoming its comprador. But then again we have to look at the source of the tailism: Jacobin Magazine.

In our city parking is “impacted” and technically homeowners can get fined if their garage doesn’t have space to park their car, because that means their car is on the street contributing to the massive parking problem. It barely ever gets actually enforced, but the ordinance is there anyway so rental agencies have to have it on paper probably that garages are only for cars so they have their asses covered.   The rest of it sounds like blanket rules because they don’t want to have to deal with neighbors complaining about “unsightly” or “offensive” decorations or furnishing so they just no to practically everything.	1642890068.0	htsss9m	t3_saapmt	t1_hts9f3f	/r/socialism/comments/saapmt/landlords_are_leeches_on_the_back_of_the_working/htsss9m/

Bolivia would have been violently invaded, if not before the Bolivian military staged a coup or some shit. Which a coup did end up happening anyway because even social democracy is generally not tolerated by the west in the global south. It cuts into the western world's bottom line.  The imperial western core will do its best to install and maintain puppet politicians in the "third world". There are some exceptions but those are very contextual and extraordinary.

Corporations and Businesses earning profit margins over a specific excessive amount should then be taxed to the tune of 70%, like they were prior to the 1970’s, which then that money can be allocated back into social safety nets, stymieing gentrification from overly inflating property values and also aiding in community rehabilitation projects, thereby helping communities as a whole regardless of their racial differences to thrive and progress healthily forward with security knowing that their basic needs can be met.

The white/European working class should seize control of the means of production and the stockpiled wealth of the capitalist class and use that to help Africans in the diaspora, indigenous people, and all colonized countries/nations/people build themselves up from the position European colonialism and capitalism has put them in.  So yes, but it must be done in a systemic way on a mass scale in the context of socialist revolution.

4lpkqm5q	I mean this really depends how you approach it and your personal perspective in how you understand the marxist tradition.  As someone who comes from a classical marxist approach of Marx/Engels, with Lenin added on. And someone who thinks Gramsci/Rosa Luxemburg despite being flawed in some areas have a lot to offer. And that Trotsky was much closer to Lenin and also a very useful theorist (has his own flaws) and Stalin was pretty much a party bureaucrat grifter. To where the USSR by the 30s was a degenerated workers state and Stalinism is a form of bonapartism. I tend to follow a similar analysis of China. Although i will conceed Mao is way more theroetically advanced than Stalin and China has a lot more differences in how it came to be and how what it transformed into.   The book i forget the author but its China from permament revolution to coubter revolution. Is a pretty good introduction and very persuasive. Although it definetely comes from a much more hard line approach of the tradition i tend to follow.    The events in China are in one hand over blown and in one hand not. It is very clear the Chinese bureacuracy is a totalitarian and anti-worker government that has repeatedly conceeded to captialism. However the US specifically has a lot of overblown criticisms aimed to support their own personal inperialist agenda.   My position i take is one step removed from Cuba. Cuba is also somewhat degenerated owning to its own revolution. But overall still attempts to stand for socialist principles especially the people to where the illegal blockade by the US and constant antagonistic behaviour is worth to support them against. But with the caviat of a critical defence, one where we want them to push further to a true workers state.   China i see as a lesser version of this, where we should not support US imperialism against China, but also shouldnt support Chinese imperialism. Hong Kong and Tibet are prime examples despite what are personal opinions are which tbh mine are somewhat pro-China, us as socialists support the Right of Nations to self determination something Marx and Lenin wrote extensively about and this is something that should not be blocked. That doesnt mean as I said you fall for US imperialism, just that you stand against both and always stand for workers and people. China is currently the only imperialism power to reliably challenge US imperialism, but is not a socialist saviour. We must defend China against imperialist aggression, because we stand against imperialism, but simultaneously stand against their and only support the advancement of the workers in both the US and China. As we are internationalists and shouldnt be blinded by national bias.	1642894700.0	htt44iv	t3_sa6i5t	t3_sa6i5t	/r/socialism/comments/sa6i5t/question_about_china_ugh_i_know/htt44iv/
5xddq	First of all, I'm not a dude.     You are just being rude and obtuse. There has never in this conversation been a claim that there's historical proof for a divine Jesus. There has never been a claim in this conversation that the stories in the gospels are all historical truths. The gospels are later texts based on oral sources, they contradict eachother. They're used in research as important sources, but they're not read as such *uncritically.*  I'm not sure if you're trying to troll me - the first sentence of the wikipedia articele very clearly states the consensus, and it is repeated many times in the article.     The claim is simply that the academic consensus is, to paraphrase the wikipedia article, that *Jesus is accepted as a historical figure.* I could go through all the different points about how history works as an academic field, what this means, what the limitations of this claim are etc but I have a hunch it's a time of waste.  &#x200B;  (Not that the story about Herod is true - or believed to be as such by historians - but the actual estimates for Jesus birth isn't 1 CE you know, but rather 6-4 BCE. Which you can find out if you just do some basic research. The estimates for Herods deaths are, unsurprisingly, listed in the wikipedia article on him. Have fun: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herod\_the\_Great#Year\_of\_death:\_either\_4\_BCE,\_or\_5\_BCE,\_1\_BCE,\_1\_CE)     And that concludes this conversation.	1642894714.0	htt45t4	t3_sa03ye	t1_htrs677	/r/socialism/comments/sa03ye/buddha_and_jesus_were_both_revolutionary/htt45t4/

With that being said, he had quite the anti-semitic tone in some of his lists and that he was a bit of a asshole for creating the list anyways.	1642895752.0	htt6qax	t3_s6v8dn	t1_htaa66r	/r/socialism/comments/s6v8dn/tell_me_if_i_forgot_any/htt6qax/

While I'm not entirely sure about the political leanings of the protesters, (I've heard a lot, and I'm sure there was a great mix) one must recognize that fighting back against the army being sent in to a protest is reasonable.   Even if the army had yet fired a shot, *they are the army* their job is to kill. It's reasonable to assume they are there for violence.	1642895955.0	htt78bn	t3_sa6i5t	t1_htrzbgm	/r/socialism/comments/sa6i5t/question_about_china_ugh_i_know/htt78bn/

bxap9g57	There was no "massacre" in Tiananmen Square.   An Indian diplomat there basically said very few people died, it was a huge overexaggeration from the West to call it a "massacre."  Basically under the reform and opening up era, there was a liberalization of China's political orientation (a dialectical process from the earlier period of Cultural Revolution).  Faith in Marxism Leninism worldwide was also fading for a variety of material reasons. The Berlin Wall did fall 4 months later after-all, so you can say it was a global process.   So there were a bunch of protesters asking for more liberal reforms, thought maybe the Leninist single party state that was formed post 1949 wasn't the best decision, thought Western "Liberal Democracy" was maybe the better system, after-all Japan and South Korea got rich with that.   Eventually the Party did what was needed to defend the Chinese Revolution and save the one party state. Sent in the tanks and told the protesters to leave and there will be mass amnesty.   That's what basically happened. Most people left, the more violent ones fought the PLA, and less than 100 died overall. What should be emphasized was no one died in Tiananmen Square, it was outside the square.   My overall verdict of it: I personally think it was the right decision, though I don't celebrate people dying, even if they are brainwashed by liberal idealism. What exactly should Deng Xiaoping done otherwise? Disband the Party? Have complete anarchy?   The difference between China and Eastern Europe post 1989 is all the justifications I need for supporting Deng's decision for decisively ending what looks to be a liberal counter revolution, supported by CIA, in a very humane manner I must add.	1642897286.0	httagsn	t3_sa6i5t	t3_sa6i5t	/r/socialism/comments/sa6i5t/question_about_china_ugh_i_know/httagsn/

bxap9g57	Well it is somewhat contradictory, which is why there was never any socialist revolution in rich Western countries.   On one hand, especially in US, the workers here are being drained by Wall Street vampires of all their labor value. 70% lives paycheck to paycheck because the ruling class who controls the FIRE sector (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate, coined by Micheal Hudson) jacks up the price of housing, rent, insurance, medicare, to the point where most people have nothing left at the end of the month.   On the other hand, US workers benefitted massively from Capitalism, because they live in the highest stage of Capitalism, Imperialism. There is a massive difference between a worker in the US living in "poverty" making $50k a year, and a sweat shop worker in Indonesia making $0.50 an hour making nike shoes, and lives in the slums on the outskirts.	1642898178.0	httcpms	t3_sadowt	t3_sadowt	/r/socialism/comments/sadowt/most_obvious_ways_westerners_are_hurt_under/httcpms/

2h8owb	>Russia defending itself    >   >expanding right up to their borders  It takes a lot of gall to say you're justified "defending yourself" from other countries' internal matters. As this post points out, and you seem to have conveniently forgotten, *Russia already invaded Ukraine in 2014.* And now you're pointing to Ukraine's defensive maneuvering to say that what Russia provoked through aggression justifies more aggression?   You're arbitrarily putting the burden of not starting a war on the country being invaded. And to disguise that fact, you pretend like it's the US spearheading this and not Ukraine asking for help. "How dare you state your desire to defend yourself and ask for allies to aid you if necessary?"   Plus, Ukraine doesn't qualify for NATO membership anyway. It doesn't meet the democratic standards required. It could, perhaps, in the future, but for now it falls short. But even if it did, why should Russia get a say in how other countries act to protect their borders? It's like saying the local burglars should get a say in whether you install a security system. Ukraine has its own agency, and if Russia weren't threatening, it could just as easily ally itself with them over the countries to its west.	1642898992.0	httenm1	t3_s9qwnw	t1_htr05gv	/r/socialism/comments/s9qwnw/the_war_that_biden_supported/httenm1/

This avoids people saying things like "my family didn't even immigrate until after slavery" because existing national debts are something citizens have to accept as part of their citizenship even if they were incurred before you became a citizen.	1642907196.0	httxj4v	t3_sadsyf	t3_sadsyf	/r/socialism/comments/sadsyf/should_white_people_pay_reparations_to_black/httxj4v/

8xnd7i7h	Im not sure what you're trying to convey with this comment, tbh. Goldman wrote this in response to Trotsky's ["Hue and Cry Over Kronstadt"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm)  > Wasn’t she writing from Russia?  Pretty sure she was in Spain when she wrote "Trotsky protests too much." She went there in 1936 to help the CNT-FAI and returned to Canada in '39.  > Wasn’t Berkman just broken after he tried to shoot Frick?  He was sent to prison for over a decade which certainly did a number on him.  > Was any of this relevant to anything when both of them died two years later?  No, but it was relevant to what Trotsky put forward. Also Berkman died two years before Goldman wrote this.	1642908209.0	httzs4o	t3_saeiac	t1_httt3zm	/r/socialism/comments/saeiac/trotsky_protests_too_much_emma_goldman_1938/httzs4o/

30qo4h8a	That's really the easiest-to-answer question you could have asked. Depending on what exact conceptualization of socialism you adopt:  (1) Social Democracy -- Tax the rich.  (2) Democratic Socialism -- Tax the rich, tax the co-ops, surplus from state owned enterprises.  (3) Marxist-Leninists -- Tax the rich (if, for whatever reason, they're allowed to continue existing), tax the co-ops (insofar as privately-run institutions are allowed to exist), surplus from state-run industry/enterprises.  (4) Anarcho-Communism -- Money is an outdated concept, we already have the industrial capacity for communism to exist.  ***The question you should be asking yourself, is "how does Jeffery Bezos pay for 30 second rocket-rides to space?"***	1642909675.0	htu33hn	t3_sa5z39	t1_httl3o6	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/htu33hn/

1fqiovyr	Since MLK never belonged to any specific party or socialist organisation it might be hard to tie him to anything specific. But it is interesting to note that one of MLK's early influences were AJ Muste, [at least according to the AJ Muste institute](https://ajmuste.org/):  > Muste was a central (yet largely unknown) figure who introduced a young college student and seminarian named Martin Luther King, Jr. to the notion of nonviolent activism and, by doing so, changed him and, through him, the entire country.  > When Muste first presented his views to King, the two men fell into a “pretty heated argument,” before King could agree. A.J., not Gandhi, was the first to influence King in his turn toward nonviolence.  AJ Muste himself was a sort of christian democratic socialist, and ex-trotskyist.	1642922811.0	hturzq2	t3_sabk9o	t3_sabk9o	/r/socialism/comments/sabk9o/was_mlk_a_democratic_socialist_or_a_social/hturzq2/

It's fairly easy to point out that workers, no matter where they live, are treated as objects and that they have no ownership of their labor or the means of production. Producing under capitalism and the alienation that comes with it is incredibly demoralizing and everyone feels it at some point.  Imperialism also affects westerners because of the wars in the middle east, in particular the Iraq war and lies about WMDs. Imperialism also causes jobs to go overseas which reduces available production jobs within the borders of the imperialist nations.	1642924250.0	htutymn	t3_sadowt	t3_sadowt	/r/socialism/comments/sadowt/most_obvious_ways_westerners_are_hurt_under/htutymn/

hw9dg	Yes, except it does something a lot of this kind of propaganda does: draws a false equivalency between capitalists/bigots and the New Left.  The founders of BLM are Marxists and so are many members. So is a big part of the LGBTQ community. A more accurate propaganda shows them protesting against Capitalism *and* bigotry, rather than what this shows, which is marginalized people and their oppressors squabbling with each other while the Capitalists reap their profits.  It reeks of "the problem with our society is that the 'elites' are sowing 'division' between us", as if marginalized groups and their allies are equally at fault for these divisions as those who are marginalizing them. Liberals, POC, and queer people not being anti-Capitalists *is* part of the problem; the much, much bigger part of the problem is the right-wing which is not only *more* pro-Capitalist, they're vehemently anti-anticapitalist on top of being bigots.	1642932502.0	htv4nm5	t3_sajbe4	t3_sajbe4	/r/socialism/comments/sajbe4/is_this_propaganda_realistic_in_any_way/htv4nm5/

Everyone else is constantly walking the fine line between prosperity and poverty. 99% of salaried workers live pay check to pay check and are only ever one months missing salary away from destitution. And it's this fear that forces them into doing jobs that for the most part offer no rewards or incentives other than financial scraps. That is not a good system or a 'success' for workers.	1643118460.0	hu5h68d	t3_scdrhh	t3_scdrhh	/r/socialism/comments/scdrhh/how_is_socialism_better_than_capitalism/hu5h68d/

dxffxb6	No, that’s not what inflation is. A growing economy means more people have access to goods and services. Growth is a good thing. Short term profit at the expense of environmental destruction is not growth, it’s just bad accounting.  A guaranteed basic income is a tool workers can use to free themselves from bad jobs. It’s a way to make the government LESS capitalist. I agree that citizens need to pay close attention to the implementation and fine print, so that the actual laws don’t get diluted or perverted, but now we’re talking about regulatory capture (cronyism) and not a UBI policy.	1643124918.0	hu5w8nu	t3_sc5vim	t1_hu5utaj	/r/socialism/comments/sc5vim/what_are_some_criticisms_of_universal_basic_income/hu5w8nu/

bz1psz0b	My main concern is strategic (though I think it can and should be criticized from a material standpoint). It's no coincidence that UBI has gathered so much support on the neoliberal sections of many of the main European parties (and it famously "fascinated" Hillary).  You can say it will come as an extra on top of everything else the welfare state already provides - no cuts needed; you can say all you want. Truth is it's already pretty difficult to \*keep\* - much less to improve - the welfare policies and institutions we have (particularly in southern Europe, where I'm from) without succumbing to the "and it is economically responsible" traps. It's hard to imagine a world where, once implemented, it would not be used as leverage or distraction for justifying or allowing cuts in other areas.  We need equity and justice-based solutions to social needs and I fear this will only come as a distraction that ultimately will contribute to undermining what we so painfully achieved in the past century.     EDIT: [This Jacobin article makes a really strong material case agains](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/12/universal-basic-income-inequality-work)t UBI, highly recommend it (I was afraid I was misremembering the hilary thing - turns out I wasn't)	1643125218.0	hu5x0j7	t3_sc5vim	t3_sc5vim	/r/socialism/comments/sc5vim/what_are_some_criticisms_of_universal_basic_income/hu5x0j7/

Inspired by their success, workers in over 25 Starbucks stores nationwide have begun their unionization campaigns, including right here in Seattle.   Join the struggle to begin rebuilding a fighting labor movement in the United States!

dxffxb6	Yes growth in an economy is a good thing. It means more people have access to goods and services. How can you deny that fewer people living in poverty, or new medical treatments and cures, cheaper goods, etc, is a bad thing?  I’m not going to defend capitalism, I’m a socialist, but cronyism can happen under any socioeconomic system. It’s favouritism by the state, it doesn’t matter what kind of state it is.  UBI is a great idea. A step in the right direction. Not a magic bullet.   It sounds like you’re saying “UBI is a bad idea because we can’t have it” which doesn’t make much sense. Maybe you’re right that we can’t ever elect a government that will implement UBI, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad idea.	1643125687.0	hu5y8nd	t3_sc5vim	t1_hu5wq4o	/r/socialism/comments/sc5vim/what_are_some_criticisms_of_universal_basic_income/hu5y8nd/

The Fox reporter brought up Canada as an example (we also aren’t explicitly Socialist)… I feel like if you’re speaking with someone so clearly biased against your movement, it might be helpful to show them countries that adopt some aspects of socialism for better results.	1643311497.0	huh97tb	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huh8ea6	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huh97tb/

73jcjyjg	First of all, I have no clue why this is in my feed, but say I'll bite. I'm baffled that socialism is actually a thing in America but I guess I shouldn't be since you guys have very little clue about how life was in post communist countries. Im from Eastern Europe, specifically Romania. Let me give you an example of how life was before 89 for us. Lack of food, you literally had to wait in line at 7 am to get your daily rations of bread and a few other goods that were given to you based exactly on how big your family was. The money you earned was so little that you could barely afford much, except for the higher paying jobs which allowed those to get a little more. You couldn't express your opinion unless they were pro communist otherwise you risked jail together with your family. I've met someone who was kicked out of highschool and wasn't allowed to join any other highschool ever because his father was against the regime. He ended up working as a construction worker for the rest of his life. The poor were still very poor and those with higher education were only doing slightly better. To quote my dad "in democracy, I am rich and you are poor, in communism I am poor and you are poor". The only people who were really doing very well for themselves were those involved with the communist party (what a surprise). Not even the Russian population were doing well, most of Russia entered a food crisis too because of mismanagement. I'm disgusted to see people still believe that this garbage ideology is actually any good. It works well on paper, it worked terribly in practice. The educated will always abuse the uneducated, this is the truth, whether you like it or not. I don't like it, but it is the way things have been, whether in democracy or in socialism. But hey, at least you people have the right to agree with each other and not go to jail. How great is that right? I wonder what that's called.	1643311554.0	huh9df0	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huh9df0/

Socialism doesn't work for the people but for the government. Socialist "healthcare" in Cuba sucks, yes its "FREE" but so it is the BOGO on shoes and/or other items yet, you buy one and get another free, in Cuba Healthcare is free but it ain't no medicine at the farmacies, hospitals are falling apart and let's say that there's NO A/C in "comunity" Hospitals.

51nsa5ej	Looking into structures that allow financial investment (and return) without control. Seems possible under some legal coop structures using the dual-class system which is how the oligarchs keep control of their businesses now - Berkshire Hathaway and FB being examples.  To be clear, the investment would be into a coop holding company that would have some number of tiers. Ideally, everything would be worker owned and democratically controlled. And certainly no monopolies.  Have theorized about a self-destruct mechanism that would force the individual coops to reform their inter-coop bonds after a certain amount of time.  Still thinking it through. Need to focus on the first coop first 😆	1643311908.0	huhabso	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huh2yza	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhabso/

8s4cp	Just to help crystallize this concept:  So 1m taxed at 70% with progressive tax brackets would look like say 30% for the first 100k, out of that you would keep 70k. Then from 100k to 250k you’d be taxed at 40%, so out of that 150k, you’d keep 90k. So out of 250k you’d have 160k. Then between 250k and 500k you’re taxed at 50%, so you keep 125k of the money in that bracket, and the overall total is 285k. Then say 500k-750k is 60%, so you keep 100k of that 250k, and your total is $385k. Then that last 250k between 750k and 1m is at 70%, so you keep 75k, and your total is $460k. This lowers wealth disparity, and provides more funding for socialized programs to benefit those who don’t make a lot of money, but the person making $1m still has a lot of money that they can live very comfortably on.   Also, if you have 750,001, you pay 70 cents on that one dollar over, but not on the money below it. It’s not like it suddenly means the government gets to take 70% of all of your money.	1643312168.0	huhb1jw	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huh4imp	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhb1jw/

i96rdp93	That's geopolitics man, taking control of strategic resources or territories. And the sanguinary part that you named is neither American or cold war history, is just history, human nature. After the germans raped the territories of USSR, the soviets did the same with the german people, and something similar happened with the French troops. In the pacific the Japanese  where mounsters with the people that "libereted" and the americans had their own war crimes, not as horrible as the Imperial army. It is not generally a Ideological reason what motivates people into doing this sort of things.  The other thing that surprises me is the call for revenge or hatred towards other nation, I know that a nation should not forget his history, but if it doesn't progress from it will fall into chauvinistic rhetoric (just see the balkans, especially Greece vs Turkey), and that's not really socialistic.	1643312878.0	huhcz4z	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huh94uk	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhcz4z/

And you can’t expect the viewers of Fox News, who are completely devoid of any critical thinking skills, to accept any points - no matter how correct - that diverge from their preconceived notions. You’re talking about a group of people who pride themselves on “this is what I believe, and this is what I’ll always believe, and nobody will ever change my mind”. They view that mentality as a virtue. They LOVE that that’s their identity.

tenum	You are greatly over estimating the intelligence of the target audience of these interviews. Firstly you have to forget the content of the actual discussion because that is beyond the folks watching. They typically just go by the attitude of what the talking head is telling them. When the talking head is assured and confident,  they'll believe anything he/she says.  The counter play here, despite appearing weak from the standpoint of a logical discussion or debate, is to actually attack head on and weaken the confidence of the host. The typical show watcher is not gonna understand or really care about anything else the guest is saying. They will understand to some level of "your argument is weak" especially if the host falters a bit afterwards.  You won't win the ideological battle by being logical. You need to appeal to emotion and humiliate (from their point of view) the person they previously placed all their trust in if you want to win their minds.	1643313251.0	huhdzzh	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hufxxi0	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhdzzh/

i96rdp93	Is a more pessimistic form of seeing life that a liberal rethoric, I consider myself a communist some time, but I started to see the problems with the idea, so a became discouraged to continue believing in it, not because of the USSR, China or Cuba, but  because of the 20 and 70 experience of my country and other examples, like in Africa. The centralization of the economic power, means that the state has to be able to centralize power too, just to avoid extreme corruption and complete the demand of products that the state needs. Without a powerful party, the profund changes that a nation needs to completely turn into socialism are improbable, in other words, is a total democracy or socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat(Under many forms or subideologies). Even inside the authoritarian soviet provisional government under Lenin there were divisions, the left with Trotsky, the center with Stalin and the right with Bukarin.	1643314477.0	huhhbvx	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huhe048	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhhbvx/

Ask question that aren’t questions, they are attacking statements, interrupt before they can respond, personally insult them, act smug and above then their counters, never actually engage anything they say.

20xf8lzo	When will we ever learn that this still is not how you go on Fox News? You think this was a win? We tied. We didn't win. We didn't lose. At best we tied. But Jesse still controlled the interview, and Mimi never got a point in that would have come close to actually landing with the Fox News viewership. He touched up against it when he mentioned how much Jesse makes and how that relates to him attempting to tell people who are suffering how things should be. He had Jesse dead in the water there and should have went after him harder.    "So, Jesse, you say you make enough that you're paying 50% taxes, which means you're obviously earning more money than 99% of Americans, and you're telling your viewers in West Virginia, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, etc., who gave a lifetime's worth of hard work to mine companies, factories, etc., and who are now struggling to afford housing, food, and a good life, who are suffering from debilitating health conditions often at the result of their grueling careers and can't afford healthcare...you're telling me you're not willing willing to slide into just the top 10% of earners so those same viewers can share in the prosperity our beautiful country affords us? Are you sitting here telling me that Americans can't do better than the Castros and Maduros and Stalins of the world? You're telling me your fellow Americans are no better than them? That we can't succeed where they failed? How very unpatriotic, sir. Shame on you.   What we want? To show people like your viewers that the problem never was and never will be us vs. them. It will always be about us *and* them vs. you. People who, like you, are oh so often born in their ivory towers, where they never seem to lack the desire to look down from their tower and tell the rest of us why they shouldn't share in the wealth. No more. Healthcare, a living wage/housing, and true quality of life for all. A shifting of the power back to the people this country was intended to represent. Not tomorrow. Now. Get on board or get out of the way."    That would have been a win. Say those words forcefully and continually without interruption. If he tries to interrupt, keep going. Either he stammers his way to a commercial and ends the interview or you finish your speech.

It wasn’t even needed, this would have been a great time to dispel the myth that tax rates in USA would need to increase to have the same socialist benefits as other countries by pointing out the tax rates of other countries that already have many of those benefits.

If a capitalist is taxed 50% on a single dollar they earn, they will extrapolate that to every dollar they earn.

That's like saying north korea is a democratic republic because they say so in their name. Those countries are dictatorships."  No way that fucker pays 50% in tax.

5evvji45	It’s important to make the distinction between liberals and leftists. CNN and MSNBC are pro-US, pro-imperialism, pro-business, pro-capitalism and anti-working class. Righties are for drone strikes and worker exploitation, liberals are also for those things, they just advocate for war criminals and capitalists to be female, gay, and non-white.   The true “left” advocate for worker-control of production, and basic human utilities to be publicly owned.

fdja2	Because it's not news, it's a propaganda outlet. It's entire purpose is to shape public discourse and influence wells of power by making corporate interest look like public consensus.   People sometimes balk at that description, but Rodger Ailes himself was quite clear in ["A Plan For Putting the GOP on TV News."](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ailes-nixon-and-the-plan-for-putting-the-gop-on-tv-news-202083/)  > The idea was to provide “pro-Administration, videotape, hard news actualities” that could be woven into local television newscasts across the country.” According to the memo, this arangement “avoids the censorship, the priorities and the prejudices of the network news selectors and disseminators.”  I also recommend Carlos Maza's "[You're Watching Fox News. You Just Don't Know It.](https://youtu.be/VzoZf4IAfAc)" for a fantastic examination of how this from of propaganda works.	1643315775.0	huhkuew	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huhhd8z	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhkuew/

1ku7cl3	Ok—you’re confusing “money” and “currency” with VALUE. Wealthy people don’t have all the money: they have a legal claim to the MoP, and through coercion are able to force terms on workers that allow them to extract VALUE—which our system expresses as a $$$ value; but they don’t have “the money”.  This is why we say “seize the means of production” not “let’s grab/burn all the money”.	1643316174.0	huhlxhp	t3_se5hhg	t1_huhkn06	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/huhlxhp/

130s5r	Things can be learned from all sides in this.     A subreddit for those who want to end work, are curious about ending work, want to get the most out of a work-free life"     The number of users who were using the site to further support labor and worker movements, were unfortunately misguided in their intentions. It's apparent the original intention for that subreddit was not to fight for improving working and labor conditions, but to 'end work', and 'live work free'. To live in a utopian world where being a 20 hour a week dogwalker is sufficient, but that is not reality.     The sub grew because it became this hub for worker and labor related discussion, and when the drama happened yesterday, people became heated saying the mods don't speak for the users and don't speak for the workers. And they are right, the mods don't speak for worker solidarity, they speak for anti-work and anti-work ideals, which was only supportive of the proletariat, because the sub became more aligned with working class folks than anti-work idealists.  It's unfortunate what happened, especially how its still in a state of collapse with the continued bad decisions the mods are taking with that place, but all in all, anti-work was never a movement fighting for working class conscience, it was a celebration of languor and apathy.	1643316808.0	huhnmsx	t3_sdu641	t3_sdu641	/r/socialism/comments/sdu641/we_should_take_the_debacles_surrounding_rantiwork/huhnmsx/

d67zihwg	Contrary to popular belief, currency was never "naturally adopted by society as an evolution over barter". This is complete fiction, largely propagated by the influence of Adam Smith's works.  The historical introduction and adoption of currency has always been done by the use of violence by a central authority. The goal has always been as a form of control over the population, by regulating and taxing all the material exchanges that were, originally, mostly community driven and trust based, as gift/favor economies. These are the natural ways in which human beings set up economies.  Barter was only used between strangers, when there was no trust or hope for future reciprocity. You needed an equal exchange right there and then. The introduction of currency severed a key component of human communities, placed everyone as competitors for material exchange, and added a whole roster of other issues due to the fungibility and accumulation of currency.  Read "Debt: The First 5000 Years" by David Graeber for a good account.	1643317019.0	huho75z	t3_se5hhg	t1_huh5jmc	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/huho75z/

aaf0mqu3	If you believe in socialism you are already poor. Poor in brain cells. I'd be damned if I give you lazy fucks and or drug heads my money. Anybody who wants to work can work. In this country you literally have the right to make for yourself whatever kind of life you want. If you choose to experiment with drugs and you get hooked then that's on you. If you had a tough life growing up and you can't make it in school that sucks. But you can still get a good job. I don't have a college degree. I still make good enough money to live comfortably on. This country and the opportunities it holds are ALL in what you make it. Socialism is solely everyone have the same amount of nothing. If I can make the same as a surgeon then why the fuck would I not work at McDonald's. When EVERYONE is forced to live the same life. Then how is anyone living any life. Quit trying to blame successful people for your faults, mistakes, situations, or down right laziness. It's very unbecoming of all of you.  Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

157vqs	Exactly. *You don’t have the money to buy the power* because they have all the money. In a society where money is power (which is all of them) the people with all the money have all the power. It’s like you never played a game of monopoly before. You can see it in action when one player starts getting all the money. They use the money to buy things to make more money because they have everyone believing that the money is the real wealth. The only difference is you can quit playing Monopoly because the money (and even the game) doesn’t actually matter, where as I can’t just quit an economic system that uses currency unless I’m ready to live like a mountain man or die in a ditch somewhere.	1643317385.0	huhp6ue	t3_se5hhg	t1_huho9ou	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/huhp6ue/

c67ckus7	I strongly disagree... Anybody watching that on Fox is going to see "socialist loser thinks the Cuba is better than America"  And anybody who's open to that discussion, isn't watching Fox news.  There's nothing to be gained there, all that interview did was give Fox a bunch of sound bites to "own the libs" even though they were incredibly articulate and prepared in my eyes... But again, my eyes aren't watching Fox news, and the people who we would need to persuade that are watching Fox news are going to see their $32,000 household income, hear "70% taxes" and flip out that 'some pink haired commie wants to take all my money' and they'll never know that same person would likely see them taxed at a negative rate, much less increased.   The absolutely best outcome is to go on that show, get annoyed, but manage to tip toe around every possible sound bite they aim for, and change zero minds because the audience is either never voting for anybody left of Reagan for reasons of personal identity, or they're watching because they know and support the position already. There's nothing to gain going on Fox, only things to lose.	1643317569.0	huhpoip	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhpoip/

13jur9	I disagree. I think the express priority of the advocate of *any* variety is to adjust rhetorical course according to the terms of the forum, no matter how difficult should the advocate choose to engage in that forum, which Mimi did. What the fox news host pulled was not unique; every talking head forum like that is structured in exactly the same way: quippy 2 minute slots where you have 1 sentence to dunk on your opponent or at least answer the question concisely. Mimi, as well as anyone who’s ever seen one of those shows, knew this going in and failed to prepare accordingly.   Media training is a very specific skill set that is mostly irrelevant to intellect or expertise on whatever subject you’re engaging in, so to suggest no one could have done a better job is incorrect. Someone with media training could have easily pushed back against those goofy middle school thought terminating cliches the host pumped out.  Alternatively, if it is indeed true that no one could have done a better job, than socialism as a political project is fucked because in your scenario apprently theres no simple way to push back against the kind of reactionary rhetoric, which I dont believe to be the case.	1643317872.0	huhqia6	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hugdcno	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhqia6/

3607jfd8	Anchor says, he doesn’t know what the guest would have down with Nazi Germany.   The only reason the United States intervened and joined the Allied Forces was because they saw how big the Nazi was becoming and how they were able to take over more and more of Europe. And what was in Europe, the a majority of the superpowers at the time. If Europe completely fell in control of Nazi Germany, then the United States would have been in trouble and would have been taken over as well, as they would not have the strength to fight all of Europe alone.  But since the United States saw the suffering and mistreatment of the Nazi, and when they were no longer cowering because they originally saw it not being their problem, they joined and helped end the war.  The talking point of this guest was that when you see the suffering and the exploitation of capitalist minds of what America is now, you should want to help end the suffering and exploitation.  But the real problem here in the United States, is not Capitalism, but the greed of its people. Want more than the other, the competition of beating their competitors and gaining more money.  I agree that 70% is too much to ask from people who work for the money they receive for the work they provide. But how do we all fix this, so it’s just to all it’s citizens?  Better living wages across the board. Making sure that wages in cities can cover living expenses in that city. The thing is minimum wage is way below the actual cost of living for people. Let’s say their monthly salary is $4000 taxes taken, but their apartment of mortgage is $3500, they will only have $500 to spare for food, utilities, and other misc. expenses. What more if these people have children to account for?   The system is broken, the rich make an effort to have lobbyist to lobby for their riches. Making sure they pay who they need to pay to make laws that benefit them. This is what’s wrong with a capitalist mindset.  What we need to do abolish corruption in the government. People will say there is no corruption, but what they don’t understand is that the corruption that is being done is underhand and within policy. To make sure they don’t really break the law. Which is what’s sad.	1643318764.0	huhsxol	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhsxol/

66zr26z5	I cannot put you in a basket with just the beliefs you mentioned here. We, socialists believe that in nature contradictions exist. As of now the society is primarily divided into two classes, one that of proletariat and other that of bourgeoisie. In a capitalist country, the bourgeoisie is the dominating or principal aspect of the class contradiction; while in a socialist society, the proletariat, is the dominating or principal aspect of the class contradiction.    The contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is what we call, an "Antagonistic Contradiction". Antagonistic contradiction is a hostile relationship of exploitation that can't be resolved peacefully, as history bears testament to. However, there are Non-Antagonistic contradictions that can be resolved peacefully. The contradiction between the proletariat and the peasantry is Non-Antagonistic contradiction and can be resolved through the means of agricultural collectivization and mechanization.

5evvji45	So currently I’m working as a freelance illustrator, so that business mode wouldn’t really apply to me right now. There are actually some businesses that already do this on a smaller scale, where the business is partly owned by employees, or there are a number of “key long term employees” that get a cut of the profits. Co-ops are an example of this. So it’s definitely possible, but it’s not the main system of business operation in our current times.

3jgi1be4	> Some rich Canadians go to America to get their healthcare.   You know something there’s a bit of validity to this statement. More importantly I think it exposes a Issue with the American healthcare system. There’s a lot to breakdown here so bare with me.  We (Canadians) have a shitty healthcare system. It’s so fragile and underfunded from decades of neoliberal policies. When the country wants to spend on things like military equipment or tax cuts, the money eventually comes from the healthcare budget. Even if it doesn’t come out in the short term, healthcare funding always trends downward. That is a legitimate criticism of universal healthcare systems in general. They will often be underfunded. See the NHS in the UK for a similar set up. Although the NHS is much better than the Canadian system.  If you compare the quality of healthcare between a Canadian patient on the public system to a fully insured patient in the American system, assuming they’re in-network and covered for all costs, the American system would win in every conceivable metric.   However, if you compare healthcare between patients earning a minimum wage job, or near minimum wage (e.g. fast food workers), the Canadian patient would be better off in every way. __Healthcare in Canada is treated as a right not a privilege__. That is the key difference that makes Canadian healthcare better on the whole.  It’s not an issue of quality on a patient by patient basis. It’s a matter of access for all. There are quite a few of the ultra wealthy who engage in medical tourism. They don’t want to have the same level of care as a fast food worker. They can afford to go and purchase the higher quality care and they do it. We’re also not talking about petite bourgeois like high-skill workers and successful small business owners, etc. we’re talking about 0.01%ers here. The kinds of people who can afford to pay American prices out of pocket. On top of that they almost never go for life-saving procedures, they often go for elective or experimental procedures, and some go for plastic surgery. Still the majority of Canadian medical tourists go to Asia. India, China, Japan, South East Asia, etc.   I write this because I what people to know what the real story is when American propagandists are hiding when they talk shit about Canadian healthcare. It’s a dinosaur of a system that desperately needs improvements, but it’s not a complete shitshow like the U.S. also, Regular Canadians almost never go south for healthcare.	1643319111.0	huhtvrj	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhtvrj/

jynjo	The specious argument about high tax rates for relatively(and I use that phrase liberally) normal salaries is always used as a gotcha.   The conversation always needs to be redirected when middle class people talk about tax. They need to be reminded of how far they are from the super rich. And that if everyone from a street cleaner and dinner lady to a lawyers and doctors banded together and demanded and end to people hoarding billions the world would be a fairer and better place.   If we only truly taxed the 1% we could fix a lot of issues.

dt3sk	The problem isn't that militaries are intrinsically right wing. (At least orientationtally, philosophically is debatable).  It's that the militaries in places like South America and the Middle East (for examples), tend to be built, trained, and incentivized heavily to act as suppressive force against popular movements.   They have to be, otherwise the military will absolutely act (to varying degrees) in the interests of economic strata that they come from.  Burkina Faso, Egypt in the 50s, multiple Arab Socialist movements, they all had a core of support in army officers.  Likewise, the army was some of the most radical elements in Republican Russia.   Being at war, even going through training, can be a radicalizing experience. But radicalizing experience can be pushed in any direction. It can even be, and often is, redirected back into bolstering the preexisting system.	1643319543.0	huhv1fg	t3_sa5z39	t1_htuliza	/r/socialism/comments/sa5z39/on_this_day_in_2006_evo_morales_become_president/huhv1fg/

Isn’t that the world you want to live in?	1643319587.0	huhv5ji	t3_se5hhg	t1_huhtrrl	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/huhv5ji/

This Fox News guy is an ass, if I was asked to speak I would be doin’ hella research beforehand since it’s super easy to predict what they’ll ask? “has it worked before?” is an easy bait. I think the activist here had the right strategy and recognized what the “reporter” was doing, but could have said A LOT more than just “oh its progressive” “thats unfair question”. Venezuelan government and economic history is a pretty transparent string of failures that you can get into and really show that you know more than the Fox News guy. Obviously he’ll interrupt you again but it’s better to make him interrupt you with seemingly well read answers rather than “hey i talking now :( y u talk”	1643319745.0	huhvkrl	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhvkrl/

11em70	while i do think he interrupted this person a lot thats what they all do on both sides. I would have just let him dig his own hole.   The problem with socialism and communism is all the real hard core ones always think theyre going to be the new elite and not the ones digging holes, and trust me there will need to be hole digger. I always ask the same question  "what will be your place in the new socialist uptopia?"  Their answers are always some kind of intellectually skilled position. I re inform them they will be digging holes and we dont need anymore of "those people in those positions right now, but we will gladly put you in a list for re examination at a future date. Here is your shovel, Javier over there is your supervisor, do what he tells you.   Socialism is built on the premise that everyone will be happy to work, happy to work where and when ever they are placed and never want more. Their will never be envy or desire or greed. You can not eliminate the human ego. If this was so there would be socialist hippy compounds everywhere but there arent. The ones that attempt fail because there are always more people wanting to be cheifs than indians. the ones that come close generally turn into cults. In the end it will still work like capitalism. It will rely on luck, skill and nepotism with nepotism skyrocketing. Sadly a lot of the people I speak with on this dont actually know how the world or economy works.	1643319762.0	huhvmfn	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhvmfn/

t9083la	>Socialism is the worker ownership of the means of production. ***Anything less is not socialism.***  Its perspectives like this that make me realize how lost people have become in capitalism. People are pulled in by the gestalt dissatisfaction with exploitation and prize ideals for a better world over analysis and study of their dissatisfaction.   We are sooner to shoot ourselves in the head because our theory doesn't line up with reality; while proposedly being the legacy of individuals who knew reality comes before and shapes theory.

He reeks of arrogance and he knows he's just talking shit, it's what he is specifically getting paid for.  Why are people so attracted to this? Like even if you agree with him his behaviour is insufferable. Like those famed Peterson interviews where people constantly interrupt and straw man him. Even if you think he deserves it, what kind of debate culture is that?  It's just so poor that people are so focused on looks, decsiveness, charisma and just cannot have a civilized debate.   All those "my guilty pleasure is trash TV" people can go f themselves. You're supporting this shitty drama driven TV politics shit and just finding joy in something so bewilderingly toxic is worrying.

88ykjcjr	Got it, thanks.  So you perform the labor and are directly compensated for your effort. You also own all the downside though right? For example if you have a falling out with a client you don’t get paid.   What I don’t understand is why would a business another business owner who owns their downside risk, ever share 100% of their profits. Employees of their company will still be compensated for their input even if the business fails.  I’m failing to understand how your freelance business is different besides for the fact that you don’t have employees. If you hire someone to help you with menial tasks, would you split the profits 50/50?

3xuab08r	What irks me, is why dont we ever just say, these are not and never were socialist regimes when the right brings up russia and china? I get that he wasnt given the time to respond, but the point almost never gets made because the responder gets caught trying to correct the last blatant misunderstanding.  He shakes his head and everyone who has read socialist and communist philosphy know why, but his response goes to, america kills the world. Which is true, but the left and right are speaking completely different languages.  And what often happens is the right attacks the strawman of socialism, the charicature of socialism espoused by authoritarian regimes disguising themselves as socialists. The right has no real conception of socialism or communism, just strawmen.  This is why so many people think squid games is about communism. Because theyve only ever know the likes of china and the ussr who claim certain ideals but actually just practice state capitalism.  Why can we not just get out the point that the right concept of socialism is flawed? Why cant we say theres never been a true socialist society? Why cant we get on the same page here?

14lryp	The issue is, he makes a million but the government takes 70% of what he has earned to give to other people and I think thats why he’s laughing because its. Absurd when you boil it down to that. Obviously 300,000 is more than enough to live with but thats not anywhere close to what he has worked for and it would deter people from even wanting to work that hard and would leave them to say “fuck it then” and end up relying on others to help them get by. Lets say (hypothetically of course) less and less people make those big margins because of how much they get taxed so high that its not worth it anymore and those that do have a st*pid(this word is censored on this sub for some reason) way of avoiding that big tax, that would mean less and less money going to the government to support those that are relying on them now because of this new system. Leaving it all to crumble below that. These are my thoughts, Im not trying to argue, Im only here to pick some brains and get the perspective of others and Im happy to discuss this with anyone willing to reply or DM me. Im a center libertarian for those who wanna call me out btw but Im not trying to point fingers and name call Im just trying to learn more about different viewpoints.	1643320645.0	huhxyzz	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhxyzz/

ibbdg	Yes it is. He wasnt discussing a 70% marginal tax rate for income above a certain threshold, he was talking about an effective tax rate of 70% on an income of one million dollars.    Imagine, for example, 0% tax rate for 0-$300,000 and a 100% marginal tax rate for over $300,000, this would give the above effective tax rate of 70% for the given income.	1643320891.0	huhympf	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hufzqnq	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huhympf/

64dr6uxn	Well, in short, while the general principal of the ruling class dividing the working class, so that they dont reach the power to overthrow them is generally true, some class divisions, and dissagreements (, on for example civil rights,) within the working class are justified and not just worth fighting morally, but also strategically.  For example:   Whilst the culture war on for example Trump, CRT, the threat of fascism etc., might technically divide parts of the working class and take the place of issues such as unionization, worker solidarity and poverty, the prevalent discussion of which would actually create a threat to the ruling class, it is still nescessary to fight this culture war, as it is directly effecting peoples lifes (through such things as legislation regarding trans rights) right now, and in the long term to prevent the rise of fascism through the culture and power of fascistic parts of the working class, which still hold an important part in this process.  &#x200B;  im bad at long sentences and english istn my first language, but i hope this is understandable.	1643321162.0	huhzcqi	t3_sdwtyt	t1_huhlssc	/r/socialism/comments/sdwtyt/they_got_you_fighting_a_culture_war_to_stop_you/huhzcqi/

Our public schooling is going downhill nationally, the roads are always in shambles anything that involves government assistance seems to take years to work out and all the while we all pay so much to them. Paying lobbyists and debts the government owes with our taxes is abhorrent and thats a little bit why Im concerned with a new system to give the government more money because will it actually help us or will it continue down this money-pit that we’ve currently got? Its why fellow libertarians are “anti-tax” because it feels like the money gets taken from us and goes nowhere that we actually want regardless of whichever of these two evils we vote in.

It’s alright though, better to spend billions repairing the damage and taking the opportunity to cast the blame on renewables for political gain, diverting attention from actual massive failure points of the fossil fuel infrastructure.  Instead of taking a small consistent amount regularly and building the infrastructure to avoid those catastrophes, might as well just have everyone on their own dealing with the consequences.

5evvji45	So for freelancers, we actually form legal contracts before any business deal so we don’t get taken advantage of, but I see what point your making.  Your question now is getting into the deep rooted differences in thinking between anti-capitalists and capitalists lol. Now we are getting into philosophy and theory…So I’m going to try my best. Anticapitalists argue that the reward in potential profits is much higher than the risk taken by an entrepreneur. And for many entrepreneurs, they inherited their business - or wealth to take out a loan to start a business. For a lot of entrepreneurs, the risk isn’t really an issue because they have daddy’s money to help them, and won’t be starving on the streets if it doesn’t work out.   One critic of capitalism (e.g. Andrea Trumann) says that the risk of the worker should be valued far higher, because it is a bodily risk and it involves embodied labour and investment of lifetime. According to this view the capitalist pays the worker quite literally for part of his life, with the possibility of using up all of it (depending on the work). Trumann argues that life and body are severely underrated in a capitalist society and equating them with money only makes sense in a capitalist logic. (From personal experience, my fiancé is a chef and has carpal tunnel in both hands from his hard labor. He’s 25.)  So arguing that the risk of the initial investor somehow is equally or even more deserving of reward than life and body of a worker is only possible if you already take capitalism as granted.	1643321436.0	hui02pq	t3_se5hhg	t1_huhxike	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/hui02pq/

17770y	What bothers me is not that Fox News is so openly shallow and manipulative.  It's that half the country is gullible enough to buy it all.   And it distracts those who see through it.  Fox has the microphone and its not giving it up.  Our only option is to stop coming to the venue and stop feeding Fox the traffic.  Wish we could just starve Fox of new viewers.  Ramping up education is probably the best way.  Whatever Fox is trying to keep down is the very thing its afraid of.  Education and a thriving population.  They depend on misery and illiteracy to keep viewers emotional and impressionable.	1643321635.0	hui0ldz	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huhhy6f	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hui0ldz/
648puoef	I was a part of r/antiwork because i think ideally work should be optional, ie if you don’t want to be employed you don’t have to be just to survive. I was fine with slightly more moderate perspectives in antiwork because the fact that they would see socialist/communist ideas may have pushed them further in that direction if they found themselves agreeing.  I do understand that reform is an appealing idea for many, and if r/workreform can actually be a place where strikes/walkouts/protests can be organised then great, I’ll be a part of that.

3xuab08r	Yea idk, these points dont really relate to what i said. In my view, capitalism has intervened and strong armed at every opportunity when a nation was seeking worker freedom. China is not socialist, condisering if i was a citizen i would not be able to speak my mind should it contradict the state. Considering if i was uyghur muslim id probably be in a work/death camp. That i would not have access to unbiased information. Same with russia today, and the countless murders conducted under the USSR. Im not trying to down play any good these nations socialist policies may have provided, but the horrors committed by their authroitarian states is very unequitable.

You wont be able to convince anyone that more than that is actually needed and wanting to have a lifestyle that can’t keep up with that doesn’t really make people sympathetic of you.   That doesn’t mean earning that much is inherently wrong or bad, all people are really asking is that such a lifestyle is not built on top of their own livelihood and well-being.	1643321808.0	hui11mn	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huhdhco	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hui11mn/

5evvji45	As for the “menial tasks” part - I worked in restaurants for 6 years. Every night I would make around $500 - $1000 in sales, yet walked out with around $100 - $200 in tips. The most important part of a business is the worker providing the labor to make money for the business. If I wasn’t there, or any of the other servers, hostesses, or cooks, production would come to a halt. The business relies on our labor to keep money flowing. So what some people consider “menial tasks” I would argue is essential work not only for the company, but society as a whole!  If I were to walk out with all the money that I had made in sales, (minus production costs, materials, etc) the owner of the restaurant wouldn’t make a profit. **For a business owner to make money, it’s a rule that they must pay their employees less than the value their labor brings into the company** Marx talks in depth about this.	1643321999.0	hui1jc2	t3_se5hhg	t1_huhxike	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/hui1jc2/

The history of that time wrongly proved them that market is the way to go (Gorbachev in SU, the book called The Economy of Feasible Socialism, popularity of market reforms).  In response to this trend, professor Cockshott and his colleagues wrote the Towards a New Socialism. They argue that planned economy is very much possible with computers. They even go as far as to say that the modern computing technology (year of 1995 for them) can already almost fully calculate the economy of any size of any country.	1643322459.0	hui2qzq	t3_se5hhg	t1_huhyl11	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/hui2qzq/

As an aside. Day one in media studies we were given a set of Murdoch newspapers and the teacher spent the whole class deconstructing it and showing how sensationalized it was. I then also started to notice how often media studies was written off as a “Mickey Mouse” subject in right wing media.	1643322475.0	hui2sgm	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hui1w7f	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hui2sgm/

88ykjcjr	Very detailed, thanks.   I think that’s a big jump from my very simple point though. And all of those ideas you brought up are interesting, but separate discussions.  I would really like to walk through a practical, real world example vs theory if okay with you.   Let’s use your job as a freelance illustrator.  Let’s say you have 10x the clients who want your services. In this hypothetical example, your barrier to doing 10x the business is hiring someone to handle all the menial scheduling and billing so you can focus all of your time and energy on meeting your clients’ need.   Your employee’s function allows your business to grow 10x, but their role is doing menial tasks while you provide the value the client’s pay for you.   In this example do you split the profits 50/50 with your employee? If not, why?	1643322319.0	hui2dql	t3_se5hhg	t1_hui02pq	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/hui2dql/

I didn't feel talked down to, despite being an uninformed kid. I felt like I had learned something, and encouraged to do my homework and learn more.

ivn7kgao	I'm a clinician. Far fewer people in the US are able to receive early treatment before their cancer progresses. Therefore those who don't have early access to care affect survival rates of the US compared to other countries. Even those with health insurance can't pay because of an insanely high deductible.  It's called the cycle of poverty for a reason.  By law with EMTALA, hospitals are not able to deny care in life-threatening situations. The people who don't have access to early interventions often seek care far too late (because they didn't have much of a choice).  Then they're saddled with medical debt they cannot. Which does (by the way) have ripple effects on the economy and country at large.

a7pjow3q	I suppose what I’m getting at is, is there a non violent solution to retaking the means of production? In my mind the alternative would be some titration of western capitalism through very aggressive taxation of the ownership class.  Having said that… they own the majority of the legislators. So we look to labor rights, yes? But that is forevermore diminished by the political class, if the system stands as it is. I try very hard not to be cynical, but practically, these are the options: or the masses stage a coup and we likely end up with a Maoist authoritarian regime that really nets no gain for the working class, as we can see.	1643325831.0	huib9ue	t3_seat06	t1_hui9n9t	/r/socialism/comments/seat06/would_someone_please_engage_with_me/huib9ue/

4207vzct	Socialism has existed. It just hasn’t always been a perfect implementation. I know the optics are rough when we say that the USSR, Cuba, and the like are socialist- but the fact is that they are.   They are just socialist countries which had to contend with material reality, and for that reason they are always imperfect and greatly flawed.   I think it’s a mistake to complete ignore the successes of countries like Cuba, the USSR, and China because they didn’t create a perfect socialist country. I think it’s imperative that we, as socialists, have nuanced discussions about those countries and their successes and failures- if only just to learn from what they did wrong and right.   Maybe it’s not the best idea when talking with liberals, but I think amongst ourselves it’s okay.	1643326131.0	huibzyk	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hugzyea	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huibzyk/

elofzgj3	Serious question here (and I hope I don't come across as rude as that's not my intention).  Since many of us who've been on the planet for decades saw what socialism did to countries like Cuba, Russia, China and Venezuela, that's going to be our go-to with referencing Socialism.  I kept waiting for a relatively concise response from Mimi but he didn't seem to be prepared for that.  What is the answer to why those countries shouldn't be viewed as examples of socialism that didn't work?  I think people would be more open to learning about socialism if someone could provide a concise overview of that to the average person.  I don't know that socialism is the answer, but I would like to understand where people who support socialism are coming from without having to do a lot of in-depth reading.  It seems overly complicated and I'm an intelligent person.  Please understand, I'm not saying socialism is bad or wrong.  I don't know enough about it without going on a research bender.

2t8tcu3c	Honest question: if I made a million dollars but my take home was only $300k, why would I work that hard?  I really don't understand this.  It takes more work to make more money. If the tax rate on a lower income is less, doesn't this encourage taking jobs of a lower income?  Lets say you have to work 60 hours a week to make $100k which is taxed at 50%, or work 40 hours to make $75k which Is taxed at 25%  You'd make more money working 40 hours.

hiss89mz	I feel like we are giving too much importance to the Fox debacle? It was an absolute shit show, and I agree we need our own media, and we must understand that as socialists out in daily life we carry the image of our ideology as individuals, that it is our duty to present it well and articulate the necessity for it. That being said, this shit will be old news in a few days, the funniest part to me has been watching the arrogance of some people, saying that this discredited the entire labor movement. If that was the case then we have a serious problem and must certainly look inward if our ideas are so fickle they’re torn to shreds by poor media performance. I find that laughable. What we truly need aside from media operations is leadership, this whole generic brand leftism will yield these results always because there are no goals to work toward. Also, for the record, I don’t think anyone gives a shit about it in real life.	1643327247.0	huiepdi	t3_se5hhg	t3_se5hhg	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/huiepdi/

All you hear is what you want to hear?? Nonsense.   Anyways. What’s the point of being anything or doing anything if 70% of your success is axed? If I was making a video game, and I was projected to make a million, but taxes were gonna take 70% of it, why the fuck would I do that??? I’d rather move somewhere else so I don’t have to get ridiculously taxed on something I made.   Venezuela is a perfect talking point. Why are immigrants from all over the world flocking to America? It’s because they can make good money doing hard work. They’d never go back, yet all these liberals and socialists are all “I want to open a coffee shop in (insert nice European place)” or “those socialist/communist countries are better” THEN MOVE. GO LIVE THERE!  If your life is seriously so withholding here in the states, go free.    I just don’t get it. If you guys want to live this free and anti work lifestyle, get income generating assets that outweigh your liabilities.

99lqvlte	I don't think it's a full on failure, as a European the fox news fall out doesn't even touch me and my interest in the subreddit.   Yeah we can see to how the mods have assumed control, been unrepresentative of the movement and haven't helped educate the masses of members. This parallels with the worker - capitalist relationship which drove a lot of people into the subreddit.   From what I can tell its just proven how important socialists are to educating the working class. Our role can still be to go into r/antiwork and piece together the reasons why people are struggling with work. We don't have to be mods to do that, but we could also suggest more democratic methods for choosing mods like worker democracy (I don't know if that's possible in Reddit though).   Just because something's online doesn't mean it's useless, there's a lot of connections and learning people can do and bring those skills back to their jobs and lives.	1643327565.0	huifh01	t3_sebd3v	t3_sebd3v	/r/socialism/comments/sebd3v/here_are_my_thoughts_on_the_recent_events/huifh01/

cgy99	> But the most insidious aspect of selling yourself short is described by Noam Chomsky in the documentary Manufacturing Consent, who notes that appearing on television necessitates the ability to speak in thought-bites. "The beauty of concision," Chomsky explains, "is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts." If you want to make a seemingly outlandish claim (Chomsky's examples include "education is a system of imposed ignorance") you have to provide sufficient evidence or no one will believe you. "But you can't give evidence if you're stuck with concision," Chomsky says, tracing the perfect circle formed by brevity's Catch-22.	1643328077.0	huigoqk	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huieuho	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huigoqk/

Both capitalism and socialism are failures in different aspects. This is why mixed economic systems work so well in comparison. Socialism on it's own will fail due to just our nature of greed.

Similarly, however, capitalism has done some good. Any system—even including fascism—is capable of producing at least *some* good. But socialism as classification of social organization, is stubbornly and rigidly defined in its simplicty. Did china and the ussr implement some socialist policies (or what i would personally consider to be socialist inspired)? Totally. Were they, again, **in their totality** socialist? Absolutely not.

hn8ghpun	My dad watches Fox News almost every night. I have seen a large amount of the bulk of every opinion show on from around 5pm-12am CST. Of all the hosts, whether it be Hannity, Levin, Tucker Carlson, Greg Gutfeld, Judge Jeanie, whatever, Jesse Watters is by far the most unlikeable and annoying of all of them. Even from a conservative perspective-- my dad even hates him.   Most hosts on Fox are biased and bad-faith interviewers. Most people can agree on this fact. However, if you recognize this fact, with some hosts, information can still be gleaned from their shows. With those that don't put out a lot of information, they're usually at least funny, whether it be intentional or not.  Jesse Watters is not funny, intentionally or otherwise. He is not likeable. He is biased and a bad-faith interviewer. He is smug and entitled 100% of the time. Seriously, watch a Fox show with a group of hosts, it feels like even THEY hate Jesse and just have to tolerate him as a coworker.   The fact that he has a new, primetime show is absolutely mind-boggling to me.	1643330564.0	huimn22	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huimn22/

ib5ntq2l	Educated leftists agree that capitalism works. The issue is who does it work for? Not the working class which is always the vast majority of a population. It is a system where the bourgeoisie will endlessly exploit workers for profit.   To say socialism doesn’t work is also silly just as you explained. Any objective look at AES for the past 100 years shows great accomplishments and improvements for the working class. Of course it isn’t perfect and no reasonable leftist would make that claim but we also have to consider the challenges socialism had to face. We have yet to see socialism develop undisturbed.	1643330797.0	huin78u	t3_sebvj3	t3_sebvj3	/r/socialism/comments/sebvj3/to_say_socialism_has_never_worked_is_just_as/huin78u/
hu7p2	My suspicions are that the US is exceptionally close to accidentally triggering widespread anti-capitalist dissonance.   For example: A failure to forgive student debt during this current wage shortage will almost certainly put significant portions of the underclass against institutionalized indenturement. This would come out of a deep sense of self preservation and survival, which have no match in the human arsenal.	1643330829.0	huin9z4	t3_sed5yw	t3_sed5yw	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/huin9z4/

15rc6c	Corporate media will always overpower independent media, there's no way around that.  But as the US continues its decline, people will be looking for answers that mainstream media can't provide, and for explanations that mainstream media can't explain.  That's the battle space - getting people to view left-media instead of hateful far right propaganda, which is obviously difficult because blaming weaker people is easier than blaming powerful people.  That's what it essentially comes down to, and that's why right wing media is easier to consume - it makes people hateful and feel superior, makes them blame desperate people instead of the people they've been propagandized to adore.

a2qr27uk	The Venezuela question is my favorite.  We block trade with a country and get our allies to do the same, crippling the economy and scream, "See, I told you it doesn't work".  Better to use current examples like Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Quater.  They pay no tax at all and have their energy subsidized.  Their government sucks because they are autocratic but their economic systems are sound. No country should hand over the countries natural resources to a small handful of people (Old already rich white males in US case).	1643331649.0	huip8wc	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huip8wc/

78glbcb5	Honestly the interviewee didn't even get to make a distinction between democratic socialism and authoritarian socialism, which are completely different concepts - fox guy just cherry picked a couple of authoritarian options.   A secondary consideration is to question whether without embargoes and extensive intervention, socialist countries would've further militarized, or channeled the resources as intended into social programs. I'm totally unsurprised the fox guy kept interjecting and going straw man but these are all valid considerations when comparing socialist countries to heavily capitalist ones.   Soviet economy collapsed because it was politically bound to a bipolar world in which they had to constantly re arm in a planned economy.   Cuba has been throttled since it's revolution by embargoes, and has never been afforded the opportunity to prove whether it could succeed or not, and has surprisingly STL developed world class doctors and education.   Venezuela was a mess long before maduro or Chavez. It was made More so so by embargoes, which hardened their stance and forced them into the arms of authoritarian. Bolivia? Well that ended in military takeover.   Comparatively, China is used as an example, and is not a purely socialist country, it follows its own characteristics and applied full market economics with an authoritarian ruling model, built on the skeleton of the old politburo style system of communism. This is all important to consider, and is relevant to the discussion when considering how to counteract authoritarian states. Being smug and believing you're the best is what crashed every empire in history, pure arrogant complacency. It's in growing and adapting that you get progress, and that is 100% not visible on fox news because there is no vision for a better democratic future, only visions of some glorified past.	1643332189.0	huiqivc	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huiqivc/

7xq039ti	When commies start talking about their commie dream you really just have to ask them of commie success stories on large scale.  There are none.  Commie often reach for Europe but every successful European county is capitalist in nature. But unlike US, they use fruits of capitalism to fund welfare programs that actually help the citizens.  So you can go to good school just by studying hard. You don't have to worry about bills when you go to hospital. And when you can't find work they will supoort you as long as you are willing to look for one.  All that crap about owning means of production - who is stopping you? Gather 1000 people. Start a factory. If what you are preaching is better then you will be nr 1 and you way will become THE way.  Problem with commies is that they are preaching things that are not grounded in reality.

"has socialism ever worked before?"   answer: Yes, in America. Public libraries, military, police, highways/roads, electricity and internet (in come counties), schools!!!, national parks, our government (senators, local, etc), the list continues. Im blanking right now on other things, but the point is we have socialism in the US RIGHT NOW. Certain markets are fit for socialism and certain markets are not. There is no such thing as full socialism either. You wouldn't socialize restaurants. But you might do for basic groceries (o wait, like when the AMERICAN government gave every AMERICAN cheese+). And looking at our country, you should certainly work towards socialized healthcare.	1643332847.0	huis2jd	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huis2jd/

p9lskmk	Its about the same as the US and Germany.  If you want to theorize though you could say its a lack of education. People in developed countries tend to be more educated and tend to have more time to contemplate the system around them. Meanwhile in developing countries they don't have that. You can't exactly diagnose issues of the world when you're uneducated and working 14-18 hour days. Another interesting thing to note though is that communists also tend to much more popular in the 3rd world. Why? Because the 3rd world struggles under imperialism. This is something that they do reconize as its directly in their faces.  They also tend to be much more revolutionary than 1st world communists because they have even less to lose and much more to gain.	1643333567.0	huitrkn	t3_see9j7	t1_huiswo6	/r/socialism/comments/see9j7/why_do_people_in_developing_countries_have_such/huitrkn/

ak6orkgb	If this guys really pays 50% in taxes, he makes atleast $1,077,550 per year. I did the math. And if he makes exactly $1,077,550, even then he only pays tax at an overall rate of 44.218%. Which means that he definitely makes way more than 1 million dollars a year.   &#x200B;  I could do the rest of the math to find what income would have him paying exactly 50% in taxes.   &#x200B;  But even if we say that he rounded up (lets say from 47%), he would be making way more than 1 milly a year. Because at an income of 1,077,550, the tax rate is not even 45% for him, let alone 50%.  &#x200B;  This is all contingent on two assumptions:  1. He is a resident of the New York state. 2. He has a permanent address in New York City.	1643333818.0	huiud5y	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huiud5y/

g90pr	Cuban here, in all fairness Cuba is the worst example to use for socialism. There is no resources, and everyday is about survival. Socialism was not practiced in Cuba, there was a moment where things seemed to be going in the right direction before the Castros kept the resources to themselves and everyone got paid the equivalent of 20$ per month. They got a small bump recently but basically the families in Cuba survive off of what people in America send to Cuba whether thats money or food.

The easisest example, they say "socialism killed millions of people" then you say "well, same as capitalism" and they say "yeah but that's because people got corrupted and bla bla" well, that's the same problem with socialism, the core isn't the problem, is the people who wants to make it work, they accept it in "their system" but not in "your system".	1643334125.0	huiv31j	t3_seefes	t3_seefes	/r/socialism/comments/seefes/can_someone_help_with_defending_points_of/huiv31j/

4zvs3y6l	Yeah, that's their strategy. They ask loaded questions using the repeated buzzwords and talking points, then when the person starts answering them decently, they cut them off and the interview is way too short to have any sort of serious discussion on such complex things. Like, he was able to sneak in the important point about socialism being about workers controlling the means of production right off but has no opportunity to explain the differences between these various countries.   Leninist countries believe they need to first focus on developing to get to the point Marx believes countries need to reach before they can really shift to socialism rather than shifting everything to actual socialism asap.   If the interviewer didn't constantly cut him off, he could also talk about how it's not right to compare developing countries with highly developed countries who have head a head start in terms of development over the rest of the world, are the preferred countries of the world's richest people and top countries, and also exert far more power. It's not like the countries started at the same point of development and given 2 different economic systems. There are far more developing countries with capitalist economies, are they proof capitalism is a failure because they're not as developed as the US?	1643334326.0	huivju5	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hug6dq1	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huivju5/

6mfaue4f	Venezuelan living in venezuela here, he wasn't a dictator, a dictator is someone who subverts a democracy, disregarding institutions and laws through power, is not a insult to throw around people you don't like.  Venezuela have had real dictators, terrible men like marcos perez jimenes and carlos andres perez, which killed people in the tousands, black cars would appear sudendly and take people away, univertisty students mostly, and if the families were lucky, the bodies would appear eventually in bags, most weren't so lucky.  And then i read foreing people just blanketing acusing chavez, a president who won 3 elections in popular vote in a democratic system, a real direct democracy, not a indirect one like in the US, of being a dictator, ridiculous.  The only thing he was gilty was being againts the US, he didn't lick their boot and took the national resources of petroleum and steel and put them in control of venezuelans, and not of the US, so they demonised him, acusing him wildly knowing that US citizens don't care in the least of truth, they hear chavez is a dictator, of course he is a dictator, all those banana republics there on that backwater of latinoamerica are dictators.  But in reality the truth is that he was a great man, not a super president capable of everything, more of an idealist than pragmatical, and definetly no someone "who used the army as a cudgel to stamp out political oponents and dissent within his own party", that acusation you throw at him is ridiculous, hell, when he was kidnapped in 2002 and a real dictator self apointed himself president, US backed of couse, it was only the popular support that got him freed and returned to office.	1643334488.0	huivxgd	t3_se5am1	t1_huimy9t	/r/socialism/comments/se5am1/hugo_chavez_deals_with_fox_news_like_a_pro/huivxgd/

hgxlfkxk	I have to, politely, disagree. The political discourse in many capitalist countries has been mangled by the co-optation of "left" as a description for a bourgeois party which supports at least some form of welfare state. However, even though it is often very small, there still exists an actual anti-capitalist left in most of these places.  What concerns me is that top/bottom framing may steer disillusioned workers away from the very detailed and coherent critiques of capitalism the actual left has developed over generations.	1643334492.0	huivxuh	t3_sdwtyt	t1_huiity3	/r/socialism/comments/sdwtyt/they_got_you_fighting_a_culture_war_to_stop_you/huivxuh/

25aqeucq	"There is no direct evidence of cheating, it must be said. But the following peculiarities raise concerns that would likely prompt official investigation had they been observed in the United States: 1) Performance levels are incredibly high, 2) gains from one grade to the next are miniscule, 3) socioeconomic gaps in student achievement are unbelievably tiny; 4) teachers report extraordinarily high homework assignment rates and low incidences of disciplinary problems, and 5) Cuba withdrew from participation in 2013, despite its number-one ranking in earlier surveys. Countries that win gold medals don’t typically withdraw from subsequent competitions without good reason."  This entire article is speculation, they outright state that there's no evidence AND  that there are alternate explanations for any of the things they point out. They even specifically say that the discrepancy between score discrepancies between grades when compared to other Latin American countries could just be because cuban students are scoring so high that their scores can't improve as much as other students.	1643335734.0	huiytl3	t3_sef7pz	t3_sef7pz	/r/socialism/comments/sef7pz/evidence_indicates_that_cuba_cheats_on_national/huiytl3/

pc1yx	I don't think its a matter of siding with Russia, I think it's about understanding how modern imperialism works.   Nuclear powers seldom exert pressure with direct military confrontation. It's almost always through some sort of proxy, a political contribution, arming/training militias, destablization campagins (i.e. blockades, sanctions, sieges etc..) and it is clear that the Ukraine is another battleground for the US and Russia to engage over and not a 1 way act of aggression by Russia.   Russia is an aggressor, Russia is a bully, Russia is not the only aggressor here and I think leftists are trying to steer ppl away from the prevailing, "yeah the US is bad but we arent the big bad" mindset that is growing on almost every international topic. The more you subscribe to that, the more you contribute public support to US warmongering.   The US has been funding right wing militias in Eastern Europe since the end of WW2. It's important to understand how deep seeded it's influence has been in the region and we can't separate it when we are talking about what Russia is doing.	1643335947.0	huizbec	t3_sedkar	t3_sedkar	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/huizbec/

First he left before it was successful... and second He sold his shares and left the business to support his family. the point of that arc is that one shouldn’t have to choose between having a family and being able to support them but not being able to spend time with them Or being able to spend time with them but only maybe being able to support them. Also do you think high school just shouldn’t exist? If no one should become a teacher how will people learn things?

e8i1ipkc	You have to understand that the US wants to solidify American hegemony and Russia is a huge obstacle. Putin is nowhere near being a socialist but he understands what is strategically necessary for Russian interests and those interests conflict with the interests of the US and NATO. The US backed the 2014 coup in Ukraine so that a far-right, anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalist would take power and hopefully be friendly to NATO and increase their influence in the area. Russia does not like this and for obvious reasons! The West has been actively sabotaging Eastern Europe for over a century.  What is missing in this heavily propagandized picture is that NATO has been increasing military presence for months (we only get to hear of Russia sending troops to the Ukrainian border) and the CIA has been training neo-Nazi Ukrainian paramilitaries. This is the West exploiting reactionary nationalism in Eastern Europe to destabilize it and establish dominance there.  And even if Russia is some kind of evil aggressor, that literally in no way, shape, or form justifies an imperialist war waged against them. The US has never acted in the best interest of anyone but the American bourgeoisie. This is not about defending Ukrainian self-determination against evil Russian oppressors but directly funding fascists to threaten Russia about what might happen if Russia doesn't concede to what the US and friends want to happen in Eastern Europe.	1643336527.0	huj0nv3	t3_sedkar	t3_sedkar	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/huj0nv3/

hzsosi0z	Most western European countries incorporate socialist ideas into their political system. This is closer to what is known as "social democracy", but the results are good, much better compared to the pure-capitalist US. The "Nordic model" refers to the collection of policies implemented by Northern-european countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland. These countries are by many metrics considered to be some of the best countries in the world to live in, they have high social moblility and relatively high social equality, low crime rates, free education, strong labor unions, etc. They aren't explicitly "socialist", but they're the closest we have to socialism in the modern world.	1643336732.0	huj14qv	t3_seefes	t1_huiyf3m	/r/socialism/comments/seefes/can_someone_help_with_defending_points_of/huj14qv/

I don't think we make it over that hill without being radically transformed by the struggle. To succeed will require a degree of class solidarity which will force us to confront many of our preconceptions, attitudes and beliefs. I believe we cannot postpone dealing with reactionary ideas and ever hope to succeed.	1643336744.0	huj15tw	t3_sdwtyt	t1_huix714	/r/socialism/comments/sdwtyt/they_got_you_fighting_a_culture_war_to_stop_you/huj15tw/
6qbt5wix	In Robert O. Paxton’s *Anatomy of Fascism* he observes that rifts between progressives, socialists, social democrats and communists created and space that fascists were able to take advantage of in order to recruit and build legitimacy.   Ex.   Italy: Communist refusal to drop anti-Christian policies to coalition with Christian Socialists  Germany: the KPD under Thälmann broke with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and called them ‘social fascists’.  Globally: disagreement on whether to enter World War I or not split many left-wing coalitions in the 1910’s   Notably Trotsky pointed out the KPD-SDP rift as being the leading cause for the left’s defeat in the 1932 election.	1643336752.0	huj16gu	t3_savgp0	t3_savgp0	/r/socialism/comments/savgp0/know_your_enemy_thread_for_january_2022/huj16gu/
za6nw	If we all back the workers in a class war, that would unite us more and reduce or eliminate the cultural issues you mention: gender, race, etc - because we're all workers. How is distraction from that worth a possible smaller cultural advancement?   It takes numbers so the bigger the numbers we can get, the greater chance of success. Also, advancing worker rights would give other minorities (who are predominantly workers themselves) more power from which to advance a culture war.	1643336757.0	huj16wi	t3_sdwtyt	t1_huhzcqi	/r/socialism/comments/sdwtyt/they_got_you_fighting_a_culture_war_to_stop_you/huj16wi/

But saying essentially it's irrelevant would provoke a why, and the why would he self evident and if you can't see it it's because you choose not to.

Because democrats time and time again deny children the choice of their school selection and a free market. Housing. Mostly because democrats make policies where they run from and infect other states. Bringing in large amounts of money and buying political influence, in turn creating the same policies they ran from. Sad how you delete anyone whom speaks out against all in favor of not having your feelings hurt. Notice Right wing subs aren't out right banning others for the sake of their beliefs.

Just remember that the USA despises every anti-imperialist leader, so imperialist media always will try to diminish these people (and for some of them, they will try to "bellish" their image, as they did to Mandela and MLK).  We hear a lot of stuff on a daily basis that we just accept as the truth, but as socialists we need to learn to doubt this things and also how to unmask the true faces behind everything.   Chavez was a great leader that tried to show the world the true faces of imperialism and succeded during his life.	1643338274.0	huj4nxv	t3_se5am1	t1_huihc6g	/r/socialism/comments/se5am1/hugo_chavez_deals_with_fox_news_like_a_pro/huj4nxv/

3rvppmw6	Instead of calling Russia a bully, why don’t you ask yourself why NATO still exists, 30 years after the dissolution of the USSR? What purpose does NATO serve other than to destabilize developing countries and enrich the military industrial complex? And just so you know the USSR attempted to join NATO in 1954(a year before they created the Warsaw Pact) but they were denied membership. In 2000-2001, Putin attempted to join NATO, but Russia was denied membership while Eastern European countries around them were all being offered membership. So why wouldn’t Russia view NATO as a threat? Why wouldn’t Russia look at the US backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 and see it as a threat to their National security. Better yet why don’t you bring up the fact that Ukraine is bullying ethnic Russians in Eastern Ukraine by bombing civilians on a daily basis while simultaneously arming neo-NAZIs to fight their battles. Keep in mind that Poland, France and Germany have historically invaded Russia through Ukraine. More than 27 million Soviet civilians died during WW2, a huge portion in Ukraine where some of the biggest and most important battles were fought. So this isn’t a simple “two nuclear powers” argument, and frankly I’m disappointed that a self ascribed Socialist would give such answer.	1643338304.0	huj4qau	t3_sedkar	t1_huizbec	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/huj4qau/

3aj44pd6	I could go on for hours about it, but I'll give you the main point he did:  FDR's programs served primarily to neuter the socialist movements in the US by temporarily providing a higher standard of living to the primarily white beneficiaries of the New Deal, while simultaneously maintaining the burgeoning global American empire.  That's a lot, so point by point:  - The New Deal offered temporary boons to Americans which have since withered away. The point of this was to neuter socialists first and foremost. Rising unrest in the early 30's lead to a growing popularity of socialist parties, so the Democratic establishment capitalized on it and won in a landslide, demolishing the power of local communist groups; nothing to say of the red scare at the time, and attempts to continually diplomatically isolate the USSR and choke out socialist revolutions in other nations (China, for example)  - The New Deal was structured to benefit industry, white communities, and lastly, workers (in that order). This was seen by its destruction of black communities in many cities, often building highways clean through places where people lived. Car-based infrastructure forced people to buy cars, rather than walkable urban centers in Europe and East Asia. And while workers were benefitted somewhat, the neutering of the socialist movement (many were arrested, mind) meant those wins would be temporary. This is to say nothing of the many other racial iniquities of the 30's and 40's, looking at Japanese Internment, for example.  - Our military continued to occupy multiple countries in the developing world, and the repression of these peoples was unacceptable. The argument of the White Man's burden was used to justify it, and only after the war would these states see independence.    The point is this, FDR was a kind of reaction to socialism. Not a socialist, just the same as the Nordic Countries are not socialist, just as Bernie Sanders isn't socialist. Their kind of Social Democracy (a term which is ahistorical to apply to FDR, but bear with me) relies on cooperation with oppresive industries, export of their exploitation to the developing world, and the perpetual quieting of the internal working class.   America needed a cure for capitalism, and FDR presented a temporary prolonging of it.	1643338359.0	huj4uzl	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huj07y2	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huj4uzl/

All you need to do is reframe the question spin it back towards the main point you want to get across -- a single payer healthcare system. Workers rights. Keep saying that.   If you're a skilled debater, sure you can debate the nitty gritty but you don't have control of the time. They do. Obviously if someone says something like "we tried it in Venezuela" they're not going to be arguing in good faith. Sure they tried capitalism in Somalia too, are we comparing them to Lichtenstein?

151bl8	Whilst there's indeed a real risk about it, Ukraine isn't even the centrality of the topic, but rather has become a tool for a greater conflict which goes towards two directions:   1. A defensive response from Russia towards the US's expansionist policy of the last three decades, for which Ukraine would (understandably) be untolerable. And I say understandably because we are talking about getting rid of the same conception of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) as a concept of geopolitical equilibrium, which is EXTREMELY dangerous.  2. Ukraine's anti-russian/pro-western turn, which Russia after all recognizes as a coup, which at the same time reinforces Russia's worries of the first point.

They don’t want answers, they just want to float out a loaded question and if the person starts to look like are going to handle it well then hurry along to getting to Just Ask another one.	1643339047.0	huj6fti	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hufx5c0	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huj6fti/

So its not just one conglomerate entity. Many people in china critique their government. They have a vast history in doing so. But there are many contradictions. its complex. If china social credit is authoritarian which is just regulating capitalism what does that make the usa credit system where it ranks who is able to get a house or go to college. Like i said. 90% of chinese people dont pay rent. I bet you pay rent or a mortgage.

bxap9g57	There are 2 reasons.   1. They want to be more like the West.  2. They might see their current system as "free market" and support their current system.  Basically the priorities of developing countries and developed countries are different.   People who live in US might think it is the most awful thing ever and wants to tear it down.   Those who live "on the other side of Imperialism" sees the material status of US as something to be desired. Making $50k and living in poverty in the US is a far better life style than living in the slums of Indonesia making Nike shoes. That swearshop worker of the Global South might even see the "poverty" wage of US as living like a king. That's why US imports Filipino women as teachers (which US treats as glorified baby sitters). Workers of the North North sees that $30k a year teacher job as a insult, while that Filipino woman thinks it is 10-20x more than her salary, if she can live meagerly, save even $1k, it is worth it.  When "Western leftist" proclaim lofty ideals like "all workers suffer the same oppression" they really don't know what they are talking about. The people of the Global South don't go shouting "workers of the world unite!" because they really don't feel unity with workers of the Global North, people who benefited massively from Global Imperialism and participated in Imperialism.   So these surveys asking about "free market" a lot of people in Global South might think it means "being like the West" and that is something to be desired.   Even nominally Marxist-Leninist states like China and Vietnam, I have met a ton of super educated Chinese who went to US for graduate school and works at Silicone Valley. At the end of the day, people in Socialist countries want to be rich and have comfortable life styles.   Second point is, people in China and Vietnam think of free market as their current system (which is the market decides prices for a lot of things, but the state has overwhelming power on other aspects). China and Vietnam are the absolute superstars of the Global South (all poverty alleviation in last 30 years were caused by China and to a lesser extent Vietnam basically), and the people there have huge support for their system, which is why they support "free market"	1643341707.0	hujcdn9	t3_see9j7	t3_see9j7	/r/socialism/comments/see9j7/why_do_people_in_developing_countries_have_such/hujcdn9/

2ta2s05d	I know many of you probably are new to this subreddit and I don’t post political stuff much. But I want to tell you about Mimi Soltysik.   Mimi Soltysik was my very dear friend and a total badass.   I met him at a SP-USA Convention years ago. We instantaneously hit it off the first time we met. We liked the same punk bands and read the same books. I’ve never met anyone like that. Mimi had this uncanny ability to care about people and their struggles, especially those who had been in poverty for a long time, just like he remembered growing up in LA. He could break down ideas and was a patient listener. It didn’t matter where that person or group was from. Mimi listened.  One thing Mimi told me which I want to share here to all of you: “Every small victory is a victory and should be measured as one, even as we struggle for a better way of living.”  I think that says much about who Mimi was.  It was very hard for us Socialists in the SP when he passed away in 2020 due to a rare illness. Other than Greg Pason who keeps the lights on, Mimi Soltysik was the pilot who drove us. I can’t forget anyone who has made such a positive impact in my life and others as he did. I hope everyone here learns more about what Mimi did, and check out SP-USA’s website archives. Maybe what he wrote and done could inspire you to participate, debate, and stay active like he did.   He was special.

1fujoxum	Am I wrong thinking that a good response to that question is "You are confusing dictatorships, which I do not support, with worker ownership of the means of production, which is socialism."  Next opportunity to be interrupted:  "Socialism can be done in a representative democracy, like America.  Capitalism, on the other hand, focuses more and more wealth and political power into the hands of fewer and fewer people. That is antithetical to a representative democracy. Capitalism is killing the ideal of America. Socialism could cure it.

The modern government might not be Marxist Leninist anymore, but they are never an aggressive power, just a defensive power trying to find its way in developing, after the internal contradictions of the Soviet system proves impossible to sustain.  NATO on the otherhand is using Ukraine to wage war with a country that defies the West's goal of subjugating the world.	1643343277.0	hujfpbh	t3_sedkar	t3_sedkar	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/hujfpbh/

I don’t see people struggling to overpower the ruling class, I see pissed off people who will probably vote for Trump in 2024 or whoever the Dems end up nominating. I see a lot of people pissed off about the pandemic, largely in two camps with opposite reasons, I see people who hate their job but want a higher minimum wage, not a full fledged class war.   If the U.S had a revolution right now, who would be the constituents? The biggest left faction would be probably be a bunch of DSA nerds and any larger fighting would be Liberals vs wannabe Fascists.   What I *can* see is a potential balkanization of the U.S., that seems like it could happen in the medium to long term at least, maybe even some type of civil war is possible, but I’d anything that probably involves some sort of Trumpist insurrection rather than a workers revolution. What I know for *certain* is that failing to provide student loan forgiveness *will not* be the factor that tips the U.S. into a genuine revolutionary moment.	1643344235.0	hujho6b	t3_sed5yw	t1_hujglni	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hujho6b/

fnzrsovf	The analogy isn’t perfect, (it probably sucks)but easy to understand. “A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products. “ capitalism functions in a similar way. A product may be involved but the owners provide no real value outside organizing wage labor. There is a promise that if you can compete or succeed you too may someday make bank, but it almost never happens. The only way you make bank is by enrolling members to actually do work.	1643344929.0	hujj286	t3_savgp0	t1_huj2zsk	/r/socialism/comments/savgp0/know_your_enemy_thread_for_january_2022/hujj286/

The best way to combat someone who isn’t actually thinking and just repeating talking points is to as questions and put them on the defensive. “Has socialism ever worked?” Point towards Socialist nations that are still active. Then immediately ask, “why do you think the current system will last forever since all empires historically collapse. “You participate in capitalism” point towards how curious that they dependent on Chinese goods in order to live their lives. They fund Chinese nations because goods manufactured under their current system are inferior from a price/performance perspective. “You hate communism yet you type this on a phone made in China🤔”.

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:  >18. In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker.   Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

k5iram	Very good, brother. FDR's New Deal was a peace deal designed to put an end to "The Red Scare" and its developing leftist movement in the US. The Nation Labor Relations Act outlined unions' and unionists' legal rights and forced them into the fascist bureaucracy of the National Labor Relations Board and the boardrooms of legal arbitrators, thereby watering down and taking control of the revolutionary unionist movement in the US. It made a less risky path to potential "justice." The labor movement accepting this and going home was a massive sellout and is what put us where we are today.	1643346530.0	hujm6cv	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huj4uzl	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hujm6cv/

I'm not saying the Soviet Union wasn't important, they were pivotal.     But that's no reason to dismiss the other Allies efforts during the war. The Allied bombing of Germany was incredibly effective and forced the Germans to divert over a million men to anti-aircraft operations, over 200k troops stuck in Norway due to Allied blockades and all the material and supply diverted to Africa all add up to a substantial diversion for Germany.	1643346959.0	hujmz5d	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hujhbpy	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hujmz5d/

adm6ugv0	Couple different strategies to use, you've already mentioned foreign intervention in CIA backed coups and the like, but it's often worth addressing the USSR since that's where most people's minds go when you mention socialism or communism. In that case, mentioning that there was a referendum six months before the USSR was dissolved on whether or not to dissolve it, that went firmly in favour of keeping the Soviet Union intact is a good starting point. In the minds of reactionaries, this was the low point of communism in the popular imagination, so it's good to remind them that even then, as the Soviet economy was "collapsing", capitalism was still not a popular alternative, and capitalist restoration happened in a decisively non-democratic manner.   As part of the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, there was mass death, poverty, and destruction of social institutions. Life expectancy cratered, infant mortality went up, median income went down, rents went up.  Michael Parentis Blackshirts and Red, which also exists in part as a talk on YouTube, is a good tool for general defense of imperfect revolutions. It will not get down into nitty gritty details, but it does offer vectors of support for revolutions that simply made life better for the impoverished masses. Literacy programs, school building, fighting gender oppression, eliminating poverty, feeding the people, are all things that can be pointed to. A fun random one in terms of gender oppression is that the share of female scientists to male scientists in the Soviet Union in the 70s was around 50/50, which is still not the case in either Canada or the USA, and I don't believe is the case in any Western European country but I'm not as certain about that. It's a fun one to bring up in case someone is trying to do some biological essentialism in terms of natural proclivity towards STEM fields, or argue against the existence of the wage gap between men and other genders.  Overall, it is worth pointing to positive effects these revolutions had, as well as the work of foreign governments to take them down.	1643347533.0	hujo163	t3_seefes	t3_seefes	/r/socialism/comments/seefes/can_someone_help_with_defending_points_of/hujo163/

70gdy6ve	First off- North Korea and South Korea were in the same income category and directly compared. While it's true that there were no high-income socialist countries, there are systemic and historical reasons for this. They were often economically isolated and strangled by the west, and not to mention they were outnumbered and had fewer willing trading partners than capitalist countries. But it still means something that if you're going to be a low-income country, or a middle-income country, you'd be better off socialist than capitalist when it comes to quality-of-life outcomes. Global capitalism relies on the existence of not only poverty within the borders of rich countries, but also easily exploitable poor countries. This study clearly illustrates that they'd be better off becoming socialist, rather than subservient to Western capital.       Libya nationalized its petroleum, and used that money to vastly increase the welfare state, but Gaddafi himself rejected communism, and embraced "Islamic socialism", which in practice has more in common with social democracy. I'm not knocking it, Gaddafi's Libya achieved a lot of great things, but there was a significant private sector in Libya and I wouldn't call it a socialist country. Of course, the study allows for some level of market forces even within the socialist countries, but that's as long as the country was not primarily a market economy. Libya, by all appearances, was primarily a market economy. I will concede that Yugoslavia's inclusion as a socialist (and thus centrally planned) economy is at least an arguable point, considering Yugoslavia experimented with market socialism. However, the market principle only really applied to consumer goods, while capital, labor and raw materials were allocated differently.       You say that Ghana, Chad and Lebanon should've been in the "post-revolutionary" category because they were "fighting civil wars". But you forget the reason why these countries were given their own category, it's not because they were in the midst of civil wars or even that they were post-revolutionary, it's because they recently changed their economic system through a process of social revolution. Changing your economic system is essentially starting from scratch. It wasn't JUST the domestic unrest or instability that put recently post-revolutionary socialist countries at a disadvantage in developing their economies per se, it was the challenge of developing an economic system that had no precedent under their particular, unique conditions. Therefore, the mere existence of recent civil unrest isn't the main issue here, since capital readily asserts itself wherever it has an opening. It has to coincide with a substantial revolutionary change in how the economy is organized. I don't think Ghana, Lebanon and Chad met that test in these periods, though I will admit that Burkina Faso does, especially if you consider that Nicaragua was included in the recent post-revolutionary category. But for whatever reason, the World Bank tables the study used considered Nicaragua recently post-revolutionary and did not consider Burkina Faso so. This was clearly an oversight, though I don't believe it skewed the results enough to invalidate the whole study, especially considering the study also excluded several oil-rich capitalist countries. So now, let's get onto that.    We've already established that Libya was largely a market economy outside of petroleum. You say that the UAE, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were quite developed at the time, and even if you were right, the fact is their quality of life indicators were not good, so their exclusion would tend to benefit the performance of capitalist countries as compared to socialist countries, which goes against your thesis, that this study's data was tortured to dishonestly portray socialism as achieving a higher standard of living.       I am confused by your "evidence" of supposed Soviet "falsification" of living standards. The article you link me to stems from a disagreement between the CIA and Soviet economists on the size of the Russian economy and USSR living standards. Nowhere does it say that the CIA was using old data in this article, nor does it ever mention that any Soviet data was falsified either in 1990 or prior. If your claim is that the Soviets falsified data regarding living standards prior to 1990, well, the article itself does not make or hint at that claim, and they certainly don’t prove it. All the article says is that the Soviets disagree with the CIA on how big their economy is, and that they think it's smaller and living standards worse. So, far from embellishing claims of living standards, they were actually low-balling The United States' own estimations! Even if you're to believe that the Soviets are lying here, which direction are they lying in? If they're downplaying the size of the Russian economy and Soviet living standards, well, then all the better for my argument! But if your claim is that they're instead exaggerating the size of the Russian economy and how high the living standards are, well then, there's no proof (in this article anyhow) of that claim. Finally, this article is comparing the United States, a high-income nation, with the USSR, a middle-income nation- despite the fact that this study accounts for economic development and never claimed that Soviet living standards were on par with or higher than American living standards! Really not sure what to make of this article, it appears to have nothing to do with your claim whatsoever.	1643348629.0	hujpzrr	t3_sbf1we	t1_hu3ef3a	/r/socialism/comments/sbf1we/this_1986_study_which_concluded_that_socialist/hujpzrr/

Yes it's better than America in many key aspects (access to healthcare and higher education in particular) but the bar is on the ground.   I'm genuinely tired of the American left claiming that I live in a socialist country when I see homeless people every day, a housing crisis that has lasted my entire adult life, no inheritance tax (we abolished it "because it's unfair to pay tax twice"), and a staggering amount of racial and economic segregation as a result of horrendous policy.  Social democracy was an admirable experiment, and many people who founded the movement were good people, but it has clearly failed to move the countries that adopted it towards long term change.

The other guy using Venezuela, Cuba and (intentionally) misrepresented tax rates should have been easy to explain but, Mimi fell into the trap of praising societies that are in an absolute state. He also responded to the taxation point poorly as a 70% tax rate of 1million wouldn't be 300,000 and then did the boomer scaring 'your days are numbered' thing.

Any media you give an interview to MUST be someone friendly to the cause or at least neutral in their coverage of it.	1643352764.0	hujwsef	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hug1yw9	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hujwsef/

r53di	Taking 70 percent of someones earned money? Money they worked for?   What if they don’t want to just “get by”? What if someone works their ass off on a company & it becomes successful. They’re making $1M a year, this person has kids & wants to be able to set enough money aside for their life & their grandkids life.   Why should they have to pay 70 percent more than someone else because they worked & sacrificed for a dream they had & it became successful. Now this person has to have a later retirement date because he makes more money than everyone else so he should have to pay more.

Sure athletes and TV personalities and movie stars paying tons in taxes on their contracted income and they seem to be fine so lets just leave that alone.

Our society is literally being dumbed down before our eyes. I don’t mean to sound like a pessimist but I feel this war is already over and “they” have won.

itgn2njy	The military and government of Ukraine are explicitly far right Neo-Nazis and fascists. Russia is a corrupt morally bankrupt oligarchy, there's no denying that. Aiding actual Neo-Nazis in Europe won't solve anything besides further strengthening and emboldening the already emboldened far right in Europe. Also, the Ukrainians have been routinely attacking two republics that broke off and sided with Russia. No leftist is siding with Russia. Its an oligarchy that is the antithesis of leftists and socialist ideals. We just agree that a war is not the right answer and arming and strengthening a fringe group of extremists in Ukraine is just as bad of an idea as when the did it in Afghanistan and ended up creating the Taliban. At some point, Western powers have to learn their lesson about the disasters of their misguided interventionism.	1643354345.0	hujz61l	t3_sedkar	t3_sedkar	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/hujz61l/

Knowing good and well that the mantra of the US is that no socialist ideological government shall flourish in this hemisphere. Sanctions and entities such as the military and CIA, FBI see to that end. For if the American people were to see a country like Cuba or Venezuela thriving and their citizens happy and taken care of(do some research, Venezuela was thriving before the US intervened and tried to bring them “Democracy”) there would be an uprising in this country the likes you’ve never seen.	1643353625.0	hujy3pb	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hujy3pb/

They only hear familiar phrases like "when has socialism ever worked", "Venezuela, Cuba, Soviet", "USA is the helper and saviour of the world" etc. That goes straight to their pre-conditioned feels, and from this alone, they truly believe that the interviewer won and absolutely humiliated the interviewee, when it is in fact objectively the other way around. Notice how the only thing that matters to the interviewer is to get these same overused and identical phrases thrown in there, happily several times, and preferably while interrupting the interviewee so that it seems to the fan base that he completely obliterated their point with a super intelligent and well founded counter argument.	1643360063.0	huk74wq	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huj8uue	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huk74wq/
ia6cepw5	I think that's a real simplistic view of it. The United States does not have to have NATO for any reason other than the fact they want to control part of that world. You didn't have to look at it from the Ukraine's perspective. You can look at the perspective of being an American. There's no reason to ask the Ukraine to be part of a military pack.  I think looking at it the way of Russia just simply wanting to control everything around it because it has the same imperialist policies is in some ways true in other ways a little dismissive of the differences between Russia and the United States. The United States already doesn't let that happen most of South America for instance. If Russia wanted to put military installations in Honduras, the United States would not tolerate it for any reason. But that would be far less dangerous than what the United States is doing in Russia, which is a country that already is devolving back into the third world.  The things that the United States propagandizes is threats to its survival is an actual real threat to Russia right now. It could both be true that Russia's run by terrible people, is a country bent on looking after its own interest, but is also very reasonably worried about the fact that the United States pushes for a country right at its borders to join military compact.	1643360102.0	huk76os	t3_sedkar	t1_huiwoei	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/huk76os/

14x8vwvb	So there's this concept called "revolutionary defeatism", where if you live in an imperialist country that is at war or sabre rattling or whatever with a rival power, communists generally *oppose their own empire*. This was Lenin's position during WWI: Lenin famously opposed Russia's war against Germany in the 1910s. The point is that this is not *our* war; it's our bourgeoisie's war. Our war is the class struggle against our bourgeoisie, and we should be using conflicts like this as opportunities to organize and exploit the ruling class's weaknesses.  We don't support Russia or Putin. But this is not our fight. It's just an imperialist conflict. The US/NATO competing with Russia for influence. The "socialists" who are overtly pro-NATO are not demonstrating class consciousness. They're identifying with their own countries' governments, which are in fact instruments of bourgeois class power.	1643363168.0	hukb14h	t3_sedkar	t3_sedkar	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/hukb14h/

4kkfqszj	I assume you are a united stater. One can see that because your suggestions are the type of "putting their cart before the horses". I mean Trump was on power for 4 years and there was no massive protests from the recipients of his wrongdoings which seemed to be like a vacation with presidential privileges financed by taxpayers. What did you do? I saw that actually quite the opposite happened and his "guys" got upset when he had to leave.  It is no wonder that reformism became mainstream on the left side on the political spectrum. At his moment in history, any type of civil war or violent revolution wont find much support from the population and if it takes place the watchdogs of the capitalist bourgeoisie are gonna smash it hard with their security apparatus exactly like it has been happening with basically all developing countries under western influence since WWII. I mean, if you are fighting for something and you wanna convince other your cannot be the only beneficiary of the sought-after change. Well, that's mostly why no left wing movement supports anything in the US. Because there is no real left there, they fight for their own privileges in the international supply chains. Same valid for Europe but their get some support are "internationally integrated" because left supports left the same way right supports right, including financially.    I mean, ppl might somehow try to juggle around and argue that the US is a democracy however in theory and practice a 2 party system is far away from the concept and etymology of the word democracy itself. The vast majority of the population in any given country (specially the ones with children that have a "family lifestyle") are not gonna go on strike even if that is completely legal unless they are pretty sure they wont get retaliated. If the action threatens their job i.e. if they cant buy their bread and have their circus on TV for the family they wont take part. I mean, this is all so old and obvious. They are also the ones who actually really need stable jobs and compose the "real labor market".  So, first thing is actually to have or shape structures (laws) that entitle agents to demonstrate their dissatisfaction legally and effectively, assuring they wont be retaliated. Electing socialists and communists for the legislative is massive step (well not gonna happen in the US so soon). Unionizing and/or becoming politically active even as an anonymous agent might be way more attractive for a "family person" before simply joining any "rebels" that walkout and might end up losing their jobs.  Civil disobedience is adventurous and wild and stuff, less shiny but  way more effective is to ride a bike to work or to insist on fair trade and ethical consumption. It can indeed be useful in extreme cases, cruses, famine and war. In these cases besides civilian tool being massive, it makes no ethical and environmental sense anymore, there are so many costs involved nowadays that rebuilding things is way more costly than changing their functions e.g. reforming them.  I suggest you take a read on Gramsci and his sort of passive revolution ideas. To me personal revolution is everyday through contradicting and/or not reinforcing capitalist patterns. Democracy is also everyday practice and not only when voting.	1643363975.0	hukc128	t3_sed5yw	t3_sed5yw	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hukc128/

35p2b	I'm sure I'll be banned soon after my comments, as has been the case with every Marxist based sub...but you do realize that bringing up Venezuela, China, USSR, in addition to other countries like Vietnam and Cuba is totally legitimate, right? These are, in fact, failed socialist states.   And China is succeeding quite well at the moment because they allowed a large proportion of their economy, at least 40 to 50%, to be private controlled, free market. Plus they trade heavily with the US, a capitalist state.   If you're goal is to convince people that socialism is worthwhile to pursue, by either avoiding the question or stomping your feet when it's brought up doesn't serve your goals at all... it just makes you look like you shouldn't be listened to... ever, like never ever.   All that aside, i.e., the fact that you're not addressing these technical, totally factual issues, you bring in ethical arguments which are completely transparent. You wouldn't sacrifice the things that you care about for others well being... why should anyone else?   I mean, this guy is your leader? Really?

719qwl8k	They're all propagandizing. All of them.   FOX News is different in that they aren't even trying to come off as a truly credible source of information. They aren't even newsman or news anchors or reporters, they're "personalities". It's entertainment, period. And, their viewers watch to be entertained, not informed. Nobody cites FOX News anymore in serious political discourse because it's simply entertainment.  It's the other "news" outlets which are worrisome. CNN being the most insidious. The "liberal news" media outlets leverages capitalist rhetoric slick enough to be convincing and appeal to a Democratic audience.   Ultimately, FOX and CNN are both pushing the same economic agenda: capitalism. Murdoch and Turner aren't buddies and never will be, but they respect one another in their quest to control and their utter lack of respect for the American government and people whom are but pawns in their chess game of power and influence.   As Turner said himself in regard to Murdoch and his bid to merge with Time Warner in 2014 which he and Murdoch knew full well the federal government would never allow on the basis of monopolization, “The game’s over when they break you up. But in the meantime you play to win. And you know you’ve won when the government stops you."  I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that it's all garbage. Fuck the politics - we're smarter than that and they, the capitalist oligarchy, sure as shit are. Smoke and mirrors used to obfuscate who's really in control of this country and who's holding the political puppet strings.	1643364699.0	hukcxtb	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huhkuew	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hukcxtb/

62auu2mh	Russia is mobilising troops INSIDE of its OWN borders, in response to the systematic eastward expansion of NATO since the collapse of the USSR, despite the US Government's promises NOT to encircle Russia with nukes.   Consider the 20th and 21st century history of this region. Ukraine was the second largest administrative unit within the USSR after Russia itself. The two countries have at least since then hadclose political, economic, diplomatic and cultural ties. Ukraine has a sizeable Russian-speaking minority based in the eastern part of the country.   In 2014, the US supported a coup against the democratically elected government of Ukraine. Whatever one's gripes against that government may be (that it was corrupt, for example), the armed takeover of the Ukrainian Parliament was orchestrated by ACTUAL NAZIS.   What invasion are you even talking about? Crimea had a referendum in 2014 during which the popular vote was to join Russia. The reason for that is that the Russian-speaking ethnicity of the east has been systematically persecuted and disenfrachised. Is Putin wrong to take defensive measures within his own country against the aggressive alignment of Ukraine with NATO and US-led imperialism?  Would you kindly inform yourself better about this matter before simply repeating Mainstream Media talking points that can only lead to the legitimation of a hot-war and the ACTUAL INCINERATION of Eurasia?	1643364963.0	hukd9y3	t3_sedkar	t1_huiqkkw	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/hukd9y3/

16paix	The answer to this, “Where has socialism ever worked before?” Question has one answer:  A lot of the countries you’re going to list were/are communist nations, so let’s not get confused here, and what type of socialist country do you believe is going to better resist the inevitable coup attempts organized by the CIA? One with an authoritarian political structure or one with a more democratic political structure? So when you ask me to name a place that it worked, and I’ll tell you Catalonia before the fascists crushed it, you’re being entirely disingenuous because you know that in dozens of South American countries where it was attempted, the CIA murdered it in the crib. And now you’ve got a handful of authoritarian versions that survived these CIA coup attempts to point to and say, “See how they don’t respect the freedoms that you and I have and have serious economic problems!” When you know full well that they are drowning in American sanctions and more prone to looting by unaccountable political elites while simultaneously ignoring that some of them do amazingly well at educating and caring for their citizens, far better, in fact, than the USA.	1643365641.0	huke5kw	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huid8pr	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/huke5kw/

ju9jd	I've found [What is Marxism](https://www.marxist.com/what-is-marxism-book.htm) to be really good, and it includes a lot of discussion about how Marx is relevant today. Written in 2015, and in the introduction it writes things like  >Not so long ago, Gordon Brown confidently proclaimed “the end of boom and bust”. After the crash of 2008 he was forced to eat his words. The crisis of the euro shows that the bourgeoisie has no idea how to solve the problems of Greece, Spain and Italy which in turn threaten the future of the European common currency and even the EU itself. This can easily be the catalyst for a new collapse on a world scale, which will be even deeper than the crisis of 2008.  It explains the *method* of Marxism, and is really useful for understanding other theory works that you read.	1643366096.0	hukeqok	t3_seimnj	t3_seimnj	/r/socialism/comments/seimnj/book_on_socialism_recs/hukeqok/

ju9jd	These kind of events are tempering and forging the groups and class fighters of the future. People have realised that organising on a subreddit doesn't work. They've also been disillusioned in their so-called Anarchist methods of organising, with all the nepotism.  That's going to push people towards a much more democratic centralist model of organising. Because the leadership needs to be accountable, and it needs to be elected on the basis of agreement of the membership (as the antiwork moderators were told very loudly they didn't lead or represent the movement).  One could also make the argument 'how could a socialist revolution happen in Tsarist Russia when every prominent socialist leader gets carried off and sent to Siberia after mere months of organising? When it's impossible to get many books and leaflets past the state censor? When workers meetings are illegal and they break them up even if you so much as teach them the decimal system? These obstacles really aren't insurmountable.  Well worth reading 'Bolshevism: The Road to Revolution'. Explains the very serious problems that the movement faced in its early years, the huge splits and divisions, the crushing weight of the Tsarist police, and how these barriers were overcome in practise.	1643366413.0	hukf5y2	t3_s8jmri	t1_huis8n3	/r/socialism/comments/s8jmri/biweekly_discussion_and_solidarity_thread_for_the/hukf5y2/

Imagine if China talked Mexico and Canada into joining an alliance and built Chinese military bases there. The US would never stand for that, so why should Russia?

ju9jd	[This is a good article.](https://www.marxist.com/will-russia-invade-ukraine.htm)  You're right in saying that the only people who benefit here are the leaders. Putin aims to drum up nationalist support at home (to shore up his falling approval rate) and to push back NATO's influence, to benefit Russia's capitalists.  Germany doesn't want to step on the shoes of Russia and has largely broken with the US owing to their reliance on Russian gas pipelines, only offering to send a few thousand helmets. The US is obviously motivated by its own imperialist interests, but its unwillingness to commit ground troops and mere threats of more sanctions show its real weakness.  The real dialectical punchiness comes at the end,  >The situation in Ukraine reflects the world situation. When the capitalist system is in a period of general growth, and there is enough loot to be shared amongst the different capitalist classes, the system can appear stable. When the system is in crisis, however, each nation state attempts to assert the interests of their own ruling class all the more forcefully, leading to more friction and flare-ups such as the one we are witnessing. This is compounded by the crisis of US imperialism, which can no longer dictate the rules of world relations as it used to, and to thus stabilise the situation. On the contrary, it is becoming a destabilising force itself. This increasing instability is the hallmark of the period that we live in. It is the reflection of a sick system.	1643367361.0	hukgffi	t3_semn5j	t3_semn5j	/r/socialism/comments/semn5j/dialectical_perspective_on_the_conflict_in_the/hukgffi/

dnozh	„ A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked union workers from one of the country’s largest freight companies from striking over a new attendance policy.  U.S. District Judge Mark T. Pittman of the Northern Texas District ruled in favor of BNSF Railway, which said in court papers that a strike would deprive shippers of transportation, hurt revenue, threaten the safety of the general public, force other employees out of work and cause immediate and substantial schedule disruptions.  BNSF had asked the federal court to block thousands of union members who help transport agricultural and industrial goods nationwide from striking, arguing that the two unions representing 17,000 workers would be in breach of their obligations because the nature of the dispute was “minor” and it didn’t rise to a level that would justify a work stoppage.  Pittman agreed, writing that BNSF had established that implementing the new "attendance standards is 'arguably justified by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement' such that the dispute is minor."  The temporary restraining order that he granted expires Feb. 8.  In a statement, BNSF said it was pleased with the ruling and that the attendance policy would “provide more predictability for our train crews while also providing more reliable crew availability, which is essential to meeting our customers’ expectations and the demands posed by an increasingly competitive global supply chain.”'  The decision means the company and members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers will head to mediation over a new attendance policy set to go into effect Feb. 1.  The policy is a complicated system that would allow employees to earn and lose points depending on when they work or take off.  “I think it’s going to hurt us and take us away from our families. If I can get another job, I would do it,” said union member Robert Moore, a freight train conductor based in Winslow, Arizona. “I would say the majority of guys out here feel the same way.”  About 17,000 workers — more than half of the 30,000 employees — had threatened to stop working over the policy dispute, which would have disrupted the transportation of goods and commodities across the U.S.  BNSF, which operates more than 30,000 miles of track in 28 states, ships steel, crude oil, ethanol, lumber, sugar, cars, chemicals, wheat, corn and soybeans to thousands of industrial and commercial customers.  It hauled 4 million carloads of industrial products and agricultural commodities in 2020, according to company officials.  Freight workers, in many cases, don’t have assigned days off and are typically on call 24 hours a day. The current attendance policy allows union members to have seven days off per month. The new policy, a points-based system, penalizes employees for taking days off, the unions say.  In its lawsuit, BNSF characterized the disagreement as a “minor dispute” over the interpretation of existing rights under its collective bargaining agreements with the unions, which meant the matter must be resolved by negotiation or arbitration, not by striking, according to court records.  The unions claimed the new policy constitutes a unilateral change and a violation of their collective bargaining agreements that could be considered a “major” dispute.  “I hate the policy. We feel unappreciated,” said union member Douglas Prather, 37, a freight train engineer based in Temple, Texas. “It’s really not a place to be, but you need 30 years to retire, so I’m trying to ride it out.”	1643367848.0	hukh32l	t3_seoaf3	t3_seoaf3	/r/socialism/comments/seoaf3/judge_rules_bnsf_unions_cant_strike/hukh32l/

4txda2sw	That's by designed.   Republicans cut funding to education significantly for many decades. That results in a less educated population that's incapable of critical thinking. Which results in more voting for Republicans which results in more education cuts.   A well informed population doesn't vote for the interest of elites above their own. 54% of American adults read below a 6th grade level.    The Democrats pathetically fail at stopping this because Democratic Congressmen & Donors are also wealthy and they would rather Republicans win than a progressive like Bernie. See both times the DNC cheated against Bernie.   Basically "oh no! I tried so hard to stop them from giving me a tax cut. I'm so sorry guys, maybe next time!".

gmo4m	OMG, imagine trying to survive on more than 600k per year.   We were blessed with a boosted income last year, and this year we'll be over 100k, probably around 80k after taxes. We've started paying off student loans (finally), moved into a much larger house in a good neighborhood (like I'm mostly locking my doors at night out of habit at this point), splurged on several things in the last few months that would've been an every other year kind of purchase before, and greatly increased our charitable donations. If I netted 600k for even one year, I'd be a debt free homeowner and my kids could go to college without having to work or start off with a modest home of their own.  Of course those numbers would be different in a higher income state, but the point stands.	1643369739.0	hukjrno	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hui5d6p	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hukjrno/

We let everyone annihilate each other for years and then come in(especially in the first war) and then come in and mop up.  In WWII, Russia was Germany's undoing (well, Germany helped). Not dismissing the rest of the Allies, of course, but Russia absolutely was the instrumental party.

4o4ibi3b	This just popped up in my popular feed, I'm not a socialist.  But it seems to me that messaging from him could've been better. I'd make the argument that pure socialism doesn't work, it typically leads to authoritarianism and puts too much faith in the competency of government.  That being said, pure capitalism doesn't work either. It leads to wide spread suffering and corruption. (both statements are pretty generalizations but I think hold relatively true)   Couldn't a better message for the socialist party be, "we don't want America to be a socialist country, but we want more socialism in America. It should be the battleground of ideas. Pure socialism doesn't work, neither does pure capitalism. But it's my opinion that a hybrid of the two is the best option for the welfare of all."??

e8i1ipkc	Russia as it exists right now is a reactionary and capitalist government. However, the US is trying to force Western hegemony in Eastern Europe, placing Russia in a defensive position between itself and NATO.  Russia did not meddle with the elections and this has always been a Democrat lie to paint Russia as an aggressor and blame American leftists for the failures of the Democrats. I remember when it first started; activists who supported Black Lives Matter and Standing Rock - No DAPL were targeted by social media and had their accounts deleted on suspicion of being Russian bots. I was a college student who had participated in BLM protests and was very outspoken about my dislike and distrust of the US government and Hillary Clinton (and Trump) and I was at risk of having my account deleted, too. I have been accused of being a Russian bot and reported so many times for it that my old Twitter account used to make me constantly verify that I was a human. This is all because I am a communist. And even though Russia is not a communist nation, Democrats really want you to believe that there is no revolutionary thought that exists in the US.  Not to mention that the US meddled with Russian elections in the 90s and has participated in even more meddling and coups around the world to install right-wing leaders thay serve American interests. Do you remember when Trump got impeached? The reason he was talking to Ukraine was because Biden's son worked as one of the directors of a Ukranian gas company and was extremely corrupt. Biden meddled with the investigation by having the investigator fired, but people were more up and arms about Trump talking to Ukraine than Biden's involvement with a cover up to protect his son.  The anti-Russia sentiment is an extension of the Cold War because Russia is a) huge and b) still exerts a lot of influence on former Soviet states. A lot of what is said about both the USSR and Russia is either fabricated, exaggerated, or excludes certain facts that change the interpretation of what really happened. Russia in this day and age is definitely reactionary, but it is also the victim of a lot of Western narratives that are hostile to it and want to justify warmongering behavior.  So with that all said, it's not a matter of Russia being "good" or "bad", it's a matter of being anti-imperialist. If the United States, the leading imperial power, wants to start war with Russia, history has shown that this will be an unjustified war with nefarious intentions. We know this from looking through American history. As socialists, then, we should oppose war with Russia.	1643370263.0	hukkj95	t3_sedkar	t1_huisjfd	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/hukkj95/

14x8vwvb	Just to use an analogy, have you ever supervised kids (say, as a parent, a babysitter, a teacher, etc) and had to deal with the he-said-she-saids of who started a fight? "He hit me!" Okay, why did you hit her? "She took my bag!" Okay, why did you take his bag?...  In some cases, it turns out that the conflict actually goes back a long time and is much deeper than just one kid hitting another. That's just the moment that you started paying attention.  Now, NATO and Russia are not children, nor are we their parents. I'm certainly not advocating that we act as parents would. The point of the analogy is that the conflict is much longer and deeper than big bad Russia wants to invade little innocent Ukraine. US media want you to see it that way because such a reductive explanation suits their own imperialist motives. We shouldn't be giving them that inch. These are decades' long imperialist struggles, and Russia building up troops near the border is just the point where the American public were told (by their government and media) to start paying attention.  On the topic of the Nazi battalions in Ukraine, I'm not of the opinion that their existence makes Russia somehow the "good guys". But this should be a wake-up call that this conflict is way more complicated than the "big bad Russia attacks sweet innocent Ukraine" narrative makes it out to be. This is not our fight, full stop.	1643371142.0	hukluwt	t3_sedkar	t1_hukbdah	/r/socialism/comments/sedkar/can_anyone_explain_why_leftists_are_siding_with/hukluwt/

6l4z3	As a friendly reminder, China's ruling party is called Communist Party of China (CPC), not Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as western press and academia often frames it as.  Far from being a simple confusion, China's Communist Party takes its name out of the internationalist approach seekt by the Comintern back in the day. From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:  >18. In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party’s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official “Social-Democratic”, or “socialist”, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker.   Similarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And it's also about the capitalists (management) taking and taking as well. If I do 6x60hr weeks because we have some massive project or important deadline, the company won't suddenly say I should do 6x20hr weeks afterwards. They'll still expect me to work min 40hr weeks even once that bulk of work is done.

p9lskmk	I'm not sure, I know its more than I make now. I'd need to look into each individual cost both now (for a current number) and how much that would be post nationalization. Take healthcare for example, for profit healthcare is way more expensive than universal healthcare, this means that by implementing a universal healthcare system you can reduce wages and people will still end up in the same place as before with more convenient healthcare services.  Same thing applies to nationalization of higher education.  Building robust public transit would greatly reduce all kind of costs both directly (cars being unnecessary to get to work means less people would need them) and indirectly such as through reducing healthcare costs by reducing accidents and pollution.  Same thing with building public housing (reducing housing costs). As things are right now though? With prices for everything being stupidly high let's call it $30 hourly base. If cost of living decreases this number can to but for now its fine.	1643375129.0	huksoiy	t3_septk0	t1_hukqucz	/r/socialism/comments/septk0/how_much_do_you_need_to_make_per_year_to_be_happy/huksoiy/

What, it's only minor when it's something someone else wants, but not minor when it's something you want? If it's such a nothingburger that they aren't allowed to strike over it, why is it so important for the employer to push through?  &#x200B;  This kind of reframing of 'other people's wants and needs aren't important, but mine are' happens a lot by people in power btw.	1643376531.0	hukvhcg	t3_seoaf3	t3_seoaf3	/r/socialism/comments/seoaf3/judge_rules_bnsf_unions_cant_strike/hukvhcg/

73rg	transcript:  > Economic crises are not exceptional; they are a familiar condition of the corporate capitalist system. The abnormal is the norm. Consider US free market history. After the American Revolution, there were the debtor rebellions of the late 1780s, the panic of 1792, the recession of 1809 (lasting several years), the panics of 1819 and 1837, and reces- sions and crashes through much of the rest of that century. The serious recession of 1893 continued for more than a decade.  > How does the capitalist state address this problem? Theodore Roosevelt found a solution: “I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.”1 A war brings the economic stimulus that comes with enormous increases in government spending. War wins access to colonies rich in resources. War also distracts the public from its domestic grievances. Urged onward by political leaders and opinion molders, underemployed citizens rally around the flag and fight for the empire, all the while thinking of themselves as liberators of some sort. Civilians would find employment in munitions plants or enlistment in the army or navy. In Roosevelt’s day, a war certainly did come—against Spain, much to the satisfaction of McKinley, Roosevelt, and others of their class.2 Then came the industrial recession of 1900–1915, with the panic of 1907 (engineered by J. P. Morgan), succeeded by the agrarian depression of the 1920s—cloaked behind the razzle-dazzle of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties. All this was followed by the unforgettable crash of the Great De- pression of 1929, which continued up until the United States entered World War II in December 1941.3 Through much of the twentieth century we had wars, cold wars, recessions, inflation, boom-and-bust cycles, labor struggles, and chronic underemployment. Wars and recessions help to increase capital concentration; they help big capital to monopolize labor markets and consumer markets; they plunder natural resources and weaken worker resistance toward management. The brut- ish vagaries of plutocracy and the hyperbolic outpouring of patriotism are not the products of particular personalities but of systemic interests.  > Our White House leaders come from different regions, differ- ent families, schools, churches, and social backgrounds. They have different personalities, yet they pursue pretty much the same policies on behalf of the same configuration of powerful systemic interests. I am not arguing that all policy decisions are firmly fixed. Unintended consequences, troublesome personalities, and other unexpected oddities do arise in the realm of public policy and worldly affairs, as in personal life itself. But we also must take account of interest-driven intentions. More often than not, the “aberrations”—be they wars, market crashes, famines, or whatever—take shape because those at the top are pursuing gainful acquisitions. Knowing your class opponents and what they are capable of doing is the first step toward effective opposition. Only then does the world become less of a horrific puzzlement. We can only resist these global (and local) perpetrators when we see who they are and what they are continually doing to us and our priceless environment.	1643376839.0	hukw407	t3_seqwxe	t3_seqwxe	/r/socialism/comments/seqwxe/parenti_explains_why_us_has_been_at_war_for_225/hukw407/

4n8oulr	I hear your points and do understand. To a Fox News host and Fox audience though that is missing the Forrest for the trees.  To advance socialism in the United States people need to be un afraid of ending up with a destroyed economy or brutal totalitarian regime.  You’re right that the vast majority of Americans have no idea what socialism actually means; to most it seems to mean ‘government’.  Socialism is extremely unlikely to come to the US in our lifetimes as no American politician seriously advocates for it in any real way.  Politicians like Bernie Sanders who advocate social democracy get derided as socialists who want to turn the United States into Venezuela.  Saying ‘umm actually that’s a totalitarian regime and not socialism’ sounds like a no true Scotsman fallacy to an American audience.    I do think in some ways referring to a capitalist social democracy as socialism shortens the political window by making that seem as far left as you can go, but I would argue it’s a position that is easier to advocate socialism from then the current plutocracy that is the United States.	1643376995.0	hukwfug	t3_sdyfo5	t1_hujqt2i	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hukwfug/

uis42na	Yes the only problem is the people actively fighting against our cause are willfully ignorant. They don’t understand that these people are charged up off empty words and legit want to murder us. How do we combat these things ideologically when they propose no arguments? I was hopeful for my future growing up but as HS came to an end, I realized normal life came to an end. The resentment all political parties have garnered for each other in the past 5 years have been a direct consequence of our lack of action to hold the powers at be accountable. I’m so passionate ab OUR future because I was robbed of my present (technically past now 😂) and that’s what made me realize I had to unlearn what I THOUGHT Socialism meant. I want better for every single person truly busting their ass here. America is nothing without its people and the people are idol now because of the willful ignorance I mentioned earlier. It feels nonsensical to even try to get these people to understand what the fuck is actually going on but, maybe these people could unlearn their hate. I’d be honored to change some minds but I’m not going out of my way for it. Prove you are conscious, seek awareness in what you don’t understand. It’s benefits are incredible.	1643378121.0	hukyui5	t3_sed5yw	t3_sed5yw	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hukyui5/
ju9jd	A great number of people in the US military have been more or less press ganged into it with the threat of massive debts from college, being sold into it by a lying recruiter, or because there aren't any other real job opportunities.  I would definitely say that being in the military doesn't make you a bad person, particularly given your anti-war, anti-imperialist standpoint. In a real revolutionary situation, the military and police will have some sympathies for the people they're shooting at, and skilfully exploiting those cracks can both paralyse the state's repressive apparatus, and get the workers tools to defend themselves.	1643378175.0	hukyyrr	t3_s8jmri	t1_hukmx52	/r/socialism/comments/s8jmri/biweekly_discussion_and_solidarity_thread_for_the/hukyyrr/

h515m	Liver cancer. He had a rough first half of life and struggled a lot with substance abuse. He cleaned up his act in his 30s, graduated with an MBA. But it looks like the damage to his body was already set and it caught up with him.   I got a friend that’s nearly 30 and he’s a raging alcoholic. Like Leaving Las Vegas alcoholic. He should be dead by now because of all the absolutely batshit things I’ve seen him do like walking on a edge of a 10 story building then trying to do a handstand (he can’t do a handstand). Any day now I’m expecting to find out my best friend is dead and no matter what I do to try and help him, he can’t stop nor change.   He was such a smart person but alcoholism has literally eroded his mind. He’s just not the same person I met when we were kids. It’s so sad watching it happen in real life.   Alcoholism is a disease. I wish there was better and more effective ways to treat it backed by a society that doesn’t covet getting blackout drunk to escape reality.	1643378903.0	hul0kl1	t3_sdyfo5	t1_huiwvni	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hul0kl1/

fizrfgx	I don't think this was a good interview imo. When asked where socialism has worked, the obvious answer is that some parts of socialism works all over, like healthcare in Cuba. About Canadians coming to the us, he should have pointed out it's very small number and most of them are elective surgeries. And the taxes, both of these guys don't know how progressive taxes work. 70% tax rate on $1 million is not $700k in taxes! WTF.

9lvqy202	Socialism is not a monolith. We all agree on the common tenets that the means of production must be owned and democratically controlled by workers or society.

Yes we know what are the problems with capitalism, but it is a very different thing to have the ingenuity of proposing something else. If we just destroy the status quo and capitalism, what will sprout from the ruins? Take into account that these types of fragile moments are where fascists leaders appear and start organizing people around worse ideals.	1643380448.0	hul45hz	t3_sed5yw	t1_huj654s	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hul45hz/

But there's a thug stopping them all because the thug has them trapped on a subway car to rob them. Their individual/minority needs can't be met until they band together on their common interest - get rid of the thug that's stopping them all.   It would be counterproductive to let the thug have his way but instead work together to get the 1 sleepy dude a nap on the subway. Plus that would be selfish of Mr Sleepy to ask everyone to first sacrifice their needs to satisfy his and maybe then he'll feel gracious enough to support the larger interest (some would say it's a need but I'm aiming to avoid disagreements with u). The greater need actually benefits them all.	1643380703.0	hul4ri3	t3_sdwtyt	t1_hukz8wg	/r/socialism/comments/sdwtyt/they_got_you_fighting_a_culture_war_to_stop_you/hul4ri3/

Ask for demands that suit all of everyone's need. I don't think everyone would put their money down and y'all can buy the property so quickly. For sure i agree more people are realizing that everything is shitty and that's why so many are quitting.   I read in a LPT that now is the time to demand requests because so many employers are in need of people to run their business. Don't expect for the boss to agree in one sitting though. It does take time but with the advantage we have now, i dont think they can afford to lose people.	1643381550.0	hul6t9u	t3_sed5yw	t1_huiut65	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hul6t9u/

Imagine only 50 of y'all agree to revoult but each memeber lives in one state, how will you organize people in your state? Im trying to be realistic because i have once thought like that too.   I think the best option is to start small and unionize your place of work.

7hfya	Nice post! More people definitely need to be educated on what positives Socialism can and has achieved. I don't think many socialists in the US are saying "We need to EXACTLY emulate (insert any socialist or communist country)". Every country has issues that can be pointed to, but we can learn from them all as far as what to avoid and what worked well.   But until enough people are educated on it to even a minor amount (IE: socialism isn't just high taxes and welfare), it's going to be a crawl. For most Americans socialism might as well be a synonym for bad. It needs to change in public discourse and education. I dont remember learning a single positive thing about any socialist or communist governments or ideologies throughout my entire public education here in the US. Though I do think it's trending a good direction. It starts by, at the least, understanding there is a problem with the USA's wealth inequality, and that is now a serious concern for many people (in part thanks to Bernie Sanders' popularity and regular harping on about it).	1643384273.0	huldsl0	t3_sebvj3	t3_sebvj3	/r/socialism/comments/sebvj3/to_say_socialism_has_never_worked_is_just_as/huldsl0/

a2qr27uk	Using American history as my guide, the only time you see the kind of change FDR made is when Middle class white males get left behind.  While I will agree that this is happening, a majority are republican or at least voting that way.  The 35 years of right wing propaganda has convinced them it's not the White billionaire masters of the universe, or greedy non tax paying corporations, but poor brown people draining the government.  They called Trump a populist for Pete's sake.  His sole accomplishment was cutting corporate taxes by 40% from 35% to 21%, while leaving carried interest and capitol gains untouched.  He campaigned against drug companies but then held their water while in office.  Then you have to overcome the 80% of Evangelical fake Christians who vote straight Republican ticket.  Supporting people (usually, white male) that believe Jesus wants us to tear gas asylum seekers, separate and cage families, secually assault vulnerable girls and women while in custody, deny the expansion of medicaid under the ACA even though it's paid for (cruelty for cruelty sake), deny a minimum wage increase, oppose equal pay for equal work, violence against women act, paid time off.  They even want to close planned parenthood and other women's clinics that provide the kind of care, counciling, and contraception as well as prenatal care to help insure a happy healthy birth for both mother and newborn.  They vote to allocate the states limited resources to building and funding prisons over schools and even pass state laws to make it illegal for school boards, local governments to install temporary protocols to keep everyone safer. When cops are caught on video torturing and killing black people they fly blue lives matter flags.  I'm not saying nothing can be done, just that we're a long way off.  Remember too, when FDR gave us Social security, he was only able to get it passed by excluding agricultural workers and domestic workers.  This passified the White democratic racists of the South who demanded it.  At the time 95% of all employed black people in the south worked in 1 of these 2 fields.  Consider the severity of this level of racism; you would rather see your own parents, yourselves and your children starve to death or work up to the day of their death than see a black man or woman be able to retire for a few years with a little dignity.  Same happened after LBJ gave us Medicare.  The southern strategy.  Aside from Carter their has not been a Democrat in the oval office for 42 years.  Very few to be found in congress either.  Between Eisenhower,  Nixon, Reagan we got free college in the GI bill (unless black, for many anyway), massive infrastructure (Interstate HWY system), a small measured military.  Well not small but a fraction of today's monstrosity that eats up over 60% of our tax dollars.  Nixon gave us Earth day and the EPA, thanks to LA smog protests, Reagan was pro choice, banned assault weapons and gave amnesty to all 7.7M u documented people in the country.  These Republicans are way to the left of almost anyone in the D party today.  So, where does that leave us?  You can vote for fascist authoritarian or right wing Republicans (D's).  These are the only 2 choices our corporate masters will allow.  They let the public pick their new employee who we mistakenly think pof as our representative.   I'm afraid it gets much worse before it gets better.	1643384687.0	hulew6d	t3_sed5yw	t3_sed5yw	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hulew6d/
du0mq7li	This is where a major issue lies. We think judges have that kind of power to decide what the working class does. We as a working class need to become way more class conscious and understand how much power we actually have in this country. When we lie down and allow judges to tell us what we need to do but we need to understand that we, the working class are what make this country move forward and have always moved it forward. This is getting ridiculous that we believe people can tell us what we can and cannot do at our workplace, how we manage our workplace, how we decide workplaces go. We have to understand that these truckers are way more valuable than we will ever imagine. Hell, 1000 times more important than that judge! That judges decision alone should show that the strike is needed 100%.   Seriously, until more labor militancy happens we will not go anywhere and this WILL continue. We can post on Reddit all we want but until we physically get out there and show them that the working class is actually who rules this country, the ruling class will continue to make sure that we are way more complacent, numbed and beat down by working so much, being told we can't organize, that we have nothing more to do and no fight in us.  If we don't have more working class consciousness happening, there will be no revolution and reform will never work. Again we have to understand the power we have in our hands! Do not let any ruling class use their state power to oppress us any longer!	1643384745.0	hulf1n0	t3_seoaf3	t3_seoaf3	/r/socialism/comments/seoaf3/judge_rules_bnsf_unions_cant_strike/hulf1n0/

wd5u2	Do your unemployment statistics include everyone who dropped out of the labour force or just those who are actively continuing to seek employment? Do they reflect patterns of underemployment? Is the unemployment rate consistent across different demographic groups or is it uneven and perhaps concentrated in particular areas or among specific groups of people (whether by age, gender, race, etc.)  I recall reading a while back that there are issues with rural white men in particular heavily dropping out of the labour force. They don’t count in the unemployment statistics anymore for the same reasons that retirees don’t. The anecdata also suggests that younger groups tend to have more problems finding employment, particularly if they aren’t doing anything related to computing.  I would be slow to assume this is an “immediate lie”.	1643385426.0	hulgw3w	t3_sed5yw	t1_huktt8j	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hulgw3w/

8inx27jt	Honestly I feel the anarchist tone is detrimental to the movement becoming anything near serious.   Even though I love the idea of anarchy the truth is that if you don’t have a hierarchy you are unable to engage with the public opinions properly. One only needs to look at how MLK and Ghandi built their movements to see that, by creating a hierarchy and building a strong foundational organization, they were able to not only engage with the public but sway general opinion in their favor.   Then you see anarchist protests like occupy and how they never amount to anything because anarchists inherently do not want to engage with the public and have no hierarchy to form proper structure around.   So no I don’t think we need leftist platforms. As we are the minority it would be too easy to simply tune us out. We need organized and focused leftist groups who are willing to engage with the public and portray our message better.	1643387061.0	hulla9j	t3_se5hhg	t3_se5hhg	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/hulla9j/

It would all go straight to the bloated military budget… I understand in principal that more taxes to benefit the people would be great but in practice giving the US government more money is a recipe for disappointment	1643387417.0	hulm91a	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/hulm91a/

Also it’s important to note that number doesn’t take into account people who have stopped looking for work. They aren’t classified as unemployed and not included in that number.

lppyf	I'm curious about your first point: Everyone is unemployed. Here in the US, I'm not seeing that. Sure, it's hyperbole to make a point, but even then, it's not nearly accurate. Unemployment was 3.9% in December 2021, which is 0.3% higher than it was in December 2019, just before the pandemic came in.  I agree with all your other points and they're quite relevant, but what's happening with unemployment? Are people just taking jobs to have one, even though they hate it or it pays poorly?	1643388012.0	hulnve6	t3_sed5yw	t3_sed5yw	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hulnve6/

If, collectively as a society, we are okay with our neoliberal governance and privatization of economic wealth, then we will also support the continuation of these policies through securing natural resources (oil) to maintain the status quo despite the gruesome nature of it	1643388626.0	hulpjc2	t3_seqwxe	t1_huldda7	/r/socialism/comments/seqwxe/parenti_explains_why_us_has_been_at_war_for_225/hulpjc2/

8inx27jt	Honestly it doesn’t matter the form but participation in leftist organizations usually is the determinant factor.   MLK raises memberships by having massive church drives and evangelizing to the black population. By the time his protests started to gain traction he already had a large base. Ghandi was living in a time where everyone was either protesting or oppressed by the British so he simply recruited by offering the chance to protest without the added burden of arrest or death. Even now with the 24 hour news cycle we see Bernie Sanders going on fox and convincing the whole audience he was on their side by sticking to the healthcare issue.   See we are dismissible if we aren’t unified with direct convincing messaging. So we need to be able to advocate messages which everyone can get behind. That’s why antiwork was so successful as it was easy to join, had easy and open discourse about something most people agree upon, and didn’t discriminate. It is unfortunate that they didn’t also create a structure and work on messaging as with those factors we could have had a real movement with real power for change. But it can be a lesson for next time as we can add these factors and actually have collective power.	1643388690.0	hulppo8	t3_se5hhg	t1_huln23i	/r/socialism/comments/se5hhg/until_leftists_gain_their_own_media_platforms/hulppo8/

dqkf6paw	This is a good point, and kind of the issue: Socialism is so demonized that most people aren't even comfortable going out and saying they think maybe a capitalist system is bad.  It wasn't that long ago that you could get arrested in much of the western world for doing exactly that.  There are a LOT of us out there.  More than the fascists, by far.  We're just cowed into submission.  So I do think, as wimpy as it sounds...we're still in the stage of just *talking* about it.  So talk about it.  Do as much talking about it as you can.  You know that annoying person who never stops talking about the same thing, who seems to manage to link everything back to their own singular interest?  Be that person, with socialism.  Work?  Socialism.  Friends?  Socialism.  Strangers on the bus?  24/7 socialism.  It's sad, but, this does take bravery, and can be dangerous, and is also probably the most necessary thing to our movement right now.  We absolutely have to come out of the shadows and start talking to people, and normalize these beliefs.  Let them know that they're okay to have and not something to hide.	1643388883.0	hulq8j0	t3_sed5yw	t1_hul7vyp	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hulq8j0/

cpdq0	When the Islamic Revolution happened in Iran and the embassy staff was taken hostage I was 20 years old. At work several us around the same age all agreed that if they killed the embassy and we went to war over it we would all go down to the recruiting office and join together. My mother told me that if things went sideways it was arranged that I and my godparent's son would take a long vacation at their cottage in Ontario. I scoffed and told my mother that if things went sideways I would join the Army. She was justifiably horrified.   Years later I learned why the Iranians were so mad as us. I learned that the CIA overthrew their democratically elected leader 25 years previously and installed the Shah who brutally repressed any dissent. Had I known that history I would have my mother for directions to the cottage in Ontario.   A core component for the young flag waving patriotism as they fight for profit for the Empire is their youthful ignorance of history. The Empire depends on it. It might be why our education system never teaches the real history of this country.   When the war in Iraq was engineered by the criminal Bush regime and young men eagerly signed up to go fight (my son among them but couldn't join due to a peanut allergy) all I could think of was what poor, sad expendable fools.	1643389001.0	hulqkb7	t3_seqwxe	t1_hul7vr8	/r/socialism/comments/seqwxe/parenti_explains_why_us_has_been_at_war_for_225/hulqkb7/

a2qr27uk	I can think of 6 extremely successful socialist countries operating today. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, & Oman.  The tax rate for these citizens is zero.  Yes, ZERO.  Because the government owns the natural resources (oil), they keep a small percentage for their countries needs and sell the rest on the world's market.  Except Bahrain.  They don't drill their own but do refine the product for the other 5.  Armed with this money, belonging to the citizens in the same way the natural resources do, the government build and pays for the roads, schools, military, hospitals, health care, etc.  There are some hotel taxes but that is designed to get foreign visitors to chip in.  They also enjoy massive subsidies on their energy needs whether it's cooling your home or filling up your car.  Roughly .55 per gallon last time I checked.  I find that the greatest misunderstand lies in the fact that most make the mistake of conflating government and economic systems.  Anything other than democracy is autocratic.  It's autocratic regimes that do the damage (usually).  I don't want to live in any of the countries listed above due to racism and extremism, especially towards women.  I just make sure to never confuse that with their economic system.	1643389910.0	hult0pp	t3_sebvj3	t3_sebvj3	/r/socialism/comments/sebvj3/to_say_socialism_has_never_worked_is_just_as/hult0pp/

In the sense of a violent revolution i don't think it would be viable ever, we live in such a complex and interconnected society that we cannot afford to stop change the system and restart. We will need to work hard on gradual changes.  Honestly i think a peaceful transition to a fully socialist economy without doing anything drastic is farely easy the only issue is getting enough support so that the government and the corporations are forced to start to negotiate.	1643390174.0	hultpy0	t3_sed5yw	t3_sed5yw	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hultpy0/

Anything I distributed would almost immediately be taken down.  Of course it was an employer who only employed "at will", which means you can be fired at any time with no recourse for any reason...in fact they don't even have to give you one.  All of that is directed against individual employees in trying to form a simple union.  Now, when your talking about attempting to reform the whole of society ie. business, politics, laws, then you have the entire apparatus of the State potentially crushing you if you make any real waves that threaten the status quo.	1643390213.0	hulttq9	t3_sed5yw	t1_hukc128	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/hulttq9/

What incentivizes people to actually work and do important things when you punish them so hard like this? Were all born into this world and responsible for ourselves. Your lot in life is directly proportional to the effort you choose to put in for most.   Your ideal utopia goes against human nature and instinct. This working in a few dozen hippie commune does not mean it will work at scale. 70% of my hard earned work goes towards lazy entitled little people so they can stay at home doing art, blogs, and musing about philosophy?  Fools. Look at anyone who escaped Cuba or Venezuela. They all say the same thing, its a bad place. Dont care what things look like on paper.

6fu96kn3	If a business is unable to provide its employee(s) with a living, sustainable wage, then that business should not exist. A business that is unable, or unwilling, to provide the bare necessities for the workers and pays a minimum wage exists for one single reason: profit for the employer. Regardless of a massive billionaire corporation, or joes hardware around the corner (petite bourgeoisie) there should be no exception made. Remember, its essentially not the owner making this distinction, its capitalism enabling this system that prioritizes (and encourages) profit over human lives. Socialism would allow the employee(s) of a small business to understand the profit margins and have a say in the distribution of wealth/profits, instead of the profits going directly to the owner. If the employee(s) saw the vision and direction of the small business, they could choose to work there, even with less pay. Socialism would provide them with access to healthcare, education, transportation, and UBI to make up the difference. Therefore, it would be the employees choice to work for the small business, regardless of pay, and they would not have to sacrifice quality of life.	1643393385.0	hum2gq6	t3_sev1p6	t3_sev1p6	/r/socialism/comments/sev1p6/the_biggest_unseen_enemy_of_the_left/hum2gq6/

Or one can advocate for a form of community ownership, either on a micro (people surrounding a club has shared ownership of that club, but everyone has shared ownership of the governing body) or macro (everyone has shared ownership of every club and the governing body) scale.

7hfya	I think that message can get misinterpreted, especially by liberals. I somewhat disagree that those issues have a more immediate impact, solely because they continue to persist because we cant solve them.  Also I don't think the slogan is trying to separate those issues from class, it's trying to portray that all those social issues are problems for the same working class, and we shouldn't be killing each over them. Not to mention we can work on multiple things as a country without lessening some issues.   But they are also often intertwined. Solve the class problem and you solve a lot of related issues to the culture wars (which is most D vs R social issues). Especially systemic racism, which will never end under a system that takes necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few (views that MLK Jr and BLM shared). There's also another point to that, that I won't get deep into, that it's probably harder to make racist whites stop being racist. But if you raise minorities to the same level economically as everyone else many things that they use to affirm their racist views such as "they commit more crimes", "don't have stable families", "are prone to violence", "are uneducated", would all begin to end.  Then imagine if most Americans saw each other as one overall group (working class), and didnt "other" those who have differing opinions on these problems, marking them as literal enemies. We might actually be able to have civil debate and solve these problems, instead of devolving into insults and violence, which for those most directly affected makes their problems never ending.	1643393918.0	hum3vw3	t3_sdwtyt	t1_huk4xlt	/r/socialism/comments/sdwtyt/they_got_you_fighting_a_culture_war_to_stop_you/hum3vw3/

For example, if 2 workers do the same job buy one is better the other not because of process or technique but just because of laziness, what would you do to make it fair? Would someone own more of the money or get more as a compensation which would bring make it lean more on capitalism side.

10l3oh	I wish I had more to add aside from the idea that like someone else noted, the left broadly sees the petty bourgeois as enemies if not at minimum a neutral party for people that believe that socialism can work with small businesses. But as you mention, sentiment is very favorable to small businesses in the US by no accident. It is the "realistic" version of anyone can be a millionaire, the idea being anyone could open up their own business and be successful. Sad truth is this isn't true, and can never be true. But as long as you can convince people of this, you can keep workers voting against their own interests. I suspect that outside the US attitudes are more down to earth. After all, while many people within the US seemed to have ascribes the police to the red soldiers in Squid Game, to people abroad who I've talked to, they're seen as an allegory for the middle class/the petty bourgeois. These are people that are still being exploited often in many ways similarly to the working class as a whole, but their position in the hierarchy is still broadly speaking preferable, and so the petty bourgeois will happily align itself with the ruling class while often having interests more closely aligned to the proletariat.	1643397637.0	humdupo	t3_sev1p6	t3_sev1p6	/r/socialism/comments/sev1p6/the_biggest_unseen_enemy_of_the_left/humdupo/

cw3y6h1b	Everyone deciding to stop working, and stop paying off their debts is it's own form of revolution, it doesn't need to be violent.  The states reaction to this now, may require a lot of millennials and Gen Zs to start educating themselves about firearms.	1643399343.0	humieds	t3_sed5yw	t1_hum1gpd	/r/socialism/comments/sed5yw/does_anyone_else_feel_like_its_time_for_some_type/humieds/

5elsg	Socialism is not just “workers control the means of production”. That’s an incredibly unscientific and overly reductive view. In Capital, Marx didn’t just describe how capitalists exploited labor. He also described capital accumulation and the law of value as the regulating factor in the economy. Market “socialism” retains both of these important aspects of capitalism, essentially guaranteeing that capitalist relations of production would quickly be restored when a new bourgeoisie forms in the market “socialist” economy.	1643399708.0	humjd4w	t3_sexd6o	t3_sexd6o	/r/socialism/comments/sexd6o/my_response_to_socialism_has_failed_every_time/humjd4w/

6x29j5am	I think your basic idea is good. It depends a lot on the atmosphere and context. Sometimes leaving the discussion vague and open can be good, sometimes it can be detrimental. It depends a lot on how outgoing people are. It can help people who are shy or uncertain (a fact which is often related to gender and class) to discuss in smaller groups rather than step up and talk in front of everyone. Jokes can be good to lighten the mood, but like with all things social it depends on the situation. It's nice to be visionary in the first meetings, but also to find something concrete to do right away. That can be really hard, but getting people to work right away is really important.	1643399824.0	humjo8j	t3_sdlcwm	t1_humdd1x	/r/socialism/comments/sdlcwm/starting_a_socialist_club_at_my_high_school/humjo8j/

6an5xrkl	Lol “socialism bad, look at all the socialist countries that failed. Socialism bad, they tax my bajillion dollars so I’m only left with a million. Socialism bad, RICH people from around the world come to USA to get healthcare. Socialism BAD, America is the world police dedicated to saving the lives of every other country cause the only way to do that is through capitalism. Just look at wwII, we fuckin owned Germany and in turn, socialism OWNED.”  I love how there’s never any real points people can use besides propaganda takes that have been churned out since the Cold War.	1643400184.0	humkm3e	t3_sdyfo5	t3_sdyfo5	/r/socialism/comments/sdyfo5/this_is_how_you_go_on_fox_news/humkm3e/

68bt497d	American propaganda is so good that it managed to take the song "Fortunate Son" which is exactly about rich people getting a pass while the poor get sent to fight and die, and turned it into a war anthem.  You are absolutely correct about war being about money. I was in the Airforce myself during the GWOT years and saw it first hand. War is simply opportunity to funnel taxpayer dollars into defense contractor companies hands. We go to war to feed capitalism. The idea that we go to war to defend the country or for "freedom" is a total lie.	1643400354.0	huml1zu	t3_seqwxe	t1_hulw7q1	/r/socialism/comments/seqwxe/parenti_explains_why_us_has_been_at_war_for_225/huml1zu/

The left wing is constantly splitting everything, dividing everything, between Troskies and Stalinist, radicals and moderates, Bernie Sanders supporters and Biden supporters, etc. The right wing more often united.	1643389558.0	huls2sj	t3_sev1p6	t3_sev1p6	/r/socialism/comments/sev1p6/the_biggest_unseen_enemy_of_the_left/huls2sj/
