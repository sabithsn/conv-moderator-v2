This isn't going anywhere else.  *Edit to answer many comments defending the rioters: I understand that we have achieved nothing peacefully, everything has been losses for decades. It's painful, honestly. But if this doesn't start a war, and we win it, it will just hurt right wingers. And I don't see a war happening, nor I want one. A great man once said: "but what can we do? Get together, get working and inspire other people like yourself". That's the way to win imo. Being the best, and inspiring others to follow us. This won't inspire anyone. I'll be glad to read your thoughts.  *Edit 2: Thank you so much for the award!	1609969598.0	gicmnym	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gicmnym/

2zkgg0	I'm curious about what other conservatives think of the videos recorded at Capitol Hill that show two things:  1. Capitol security pushing barricades out of the way, with no pushback to rioters, thereby giving the rioters access to the building  2. Once inside, the rioters chatting nonchalantly with Capitol police and one rioter even taking a selfie with one  None of that makes a lick of sense, especially given the violence that erupted after. It's the U.S. Capitol, a historic site where (sometimes) important work is done for this country. You would think it would be heavily guarded and with great effort with a protest in process. Yet, it seems the people guarding it weren't doing their job not only to the best of their ability, but AT ALL.	1610097648.0	giixpip	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/giixpip/

15of7uqn	This really set us back. A bunch of young hot heads just screwed us over. Senators and representatives that were going to object to the shady electors totally reversed stance after this happened. These morons just couldn’t sit tight and see how the process went before they lost their cool. And, now, nothing at all will be done to address the issue or secure future elections.   It’s pretty unfair. The left has been burning and looting and vandalizing cities all year and those in power didn’t care to do anything about it and the powers that be and the media even claimed it was justified. Both Biden and Harris made statements supporting the riots. But, this is now the biggest calamity to ever hit America. And, that kind of one sided crap is wrong.   But, the world isn’t fair. Sometimes you have to deal with unfair, stay calm, and work to achieve your goals. If you’re not on the left, you simply can’t hope to go off halfcocked and think it’s all going to be ok.  The one thing the right had going for it was that, although we are deplorables and racists and fascists, we didn’t go around busting crap up. We were rational and law abiding people.   Now, we are all going to be condemned by the actions of a small portion of the people that went down for the protest. And, since we aren’t the left, no one will say it was justified or mostly peaceful ( although, it mostly was; especially composted to what went on all year).  I’m pretty pissed at these people for screwing us up because they just couldn’t keep their cool and stay the course long enough to see if congress was actually going to do anything about election security or not. I hope they’re happy knowing they threw us to the wolves	1610006166.0	gielku3	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gielku3/

N/A	The best perspective in regards to this I found from /r/GoldandBlack:  ____________________________________  The most startling thing about the commentary surrounding this is the lamentation of scaring elected officials and damaging a government building as if that's the cornerstone of what makes America great. By comparison, it was a fringe, unacceptable position this summer to condemn the destruction of small businesses which **literally are** what makes America great - enterprising people who support themselves and their families by serving their communities.  And of course by "over the summer" I mean in regards to BLM protests. That's not even beginning to touch on the government response to the pandemic. That's a similar scary parallel where it has been viewed as virtuous to rat on your neighbors for trying to make a living or having a party, closing others' businesses via threat of force is the status quo, and a non-elected government official who outright lies to the American people was celebrated as a hero.	1609991242.0	gidy1iy	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gidy1iy/

If you want my honest opinion, I think the left is a little jealous at how powerful and strong we are. Their “political revolution” does nothing but fill Bernie’s pockets.  They shouldn’t have fought with police and god bless the woman that was unfairly shot and killed.

f719l2	Seems pretty clear to me that many of the people that made it inside love America and didn’t really know what they were doing.  You see a lot of the people inside clearly just wandering around aimlessly and taking pictures.  Definitely some exceptions though.  You can see their conversations with the capitol police as well.  Surprisingly tame.  If they were antifa the statues would have been destroyed and the building would have been torn to shreds and burnt to the ground.  The should be prosecuted, but I think the law will come down on most of them harder than it should.  This is a public building that they own as citizens and should generally have a right to.  Those that didn’t destroy any property shouldn’t get much more than a slap on the wrist.	1610002682.0	giehahn	t3_krxl6t	t3_krxl6t	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/giehahn/

I look at these people and I see people that have been slighted and disenfranchised by the government. Business owners who have nothing left to lose after government shutdowns and riots have reduced them to nothing. Voters who see that there is no hope once a fraudulent election is allowed.   It might not have been Boston, but it is much more than laying down and taking beating after beating, having our rights restricted day after day. These are regular joes, who feel as if they have nothing left to lose.

When is law and order not corrupt anymore. It amazes me, that the press wont put Our President on T.V., for his White House Updates. Yet, will literally stay shit he didn't say. I'm sick of the lies!!!!  How do you make a change without the protests? Democrats did this for months and told everyone through the press' mouth to hurt each other.

870xw	What I think is a legitimate complaint is how these protesters were treated vs how the protesters this summer were treated.   I think DC cops were used to Trump supporters being legitimately peaceful and expected another "rah rah Trump!" march like the previous ones.   This summer the BLM and anti-Trump protesters never would have been allowed anywhere close where they got today. It would have been rubber bullets and tear gas as soon as they approached the doors. DC metro police would have had them zip-tied and in vans, before they could even think about sitting at McConnel's desk with their feet up.   For all the complaints about how the media is on the side of the left, law enforcement is very much on the side of the right the majority of the time.

14acbl	This has been a long time coming, a 10-year crawl of the culture war that has led to this moment. Every institution is in the control of the left-wing, and it has rigged the game against the right-wing. There is only so much people can take.  Watching leftist get away with murder in the press while the right smeared relentlessly. *Actual* peaceful protests over violating the constitution were frown upon back in March, but burning down small businesses, tearing down historical statues and sieging federal buildings were classified as "peaceful protests", except when the right sieges federal buildings, then it's 9/11 and Pearl Harbour wrapped into one. The media outright ignores any scandal from the Democrats, like Obamagate and Hunter Biden's laptop, yet they will drag Trump through the mud on *absolutely anything*, and have no shame in taking things out of context or using "anonymous sources familiar with the president's thinking". Academia is teaching God knows what manner of crazy, bigoted, divisive, and lunatic ideology on college campuses, and it is now leaking into schools, into corporations, into government programs, and if you speak up against it you are socially exiled and have your life ruined. Leftist are trying to repeal the Civil Right's legislature in California, allowing the state the discriminate against people based on their race, and propose equality of outcome based on race, yet the *right* are considered the racist ones. Blatantly calling for "peace and unity" only now the Democrats are in power, after four years of some of the despicable treatment in history. Rational and level-headed propositions are made suggesting that maybe locking down the country, crashing the economy, violating the constitution and causing untold misery is maybe not a sustainable method to fight such a mild virus, and instead, they are called selfish conspiracy theorists and banned from social media for spreading "dangerous misinformation". Having their country and their primary cultural identity (from a patriot's perspective), one of the best countries in the world for equality, a country that has always been at the forefront of human rights and progress, one of the first countries in the world to ban the practice of slavery, and even fought their own countrymen in a war over it because it was that important to them, a country where minorities and immigrants have no better place in the world to have a chance of a better life - that country is constantly being dragged through the mud as one of the most racist places on Earth, built on slavery and filled with nothing but systemic and institutional racism, and where objecting to any of these notions get you labelled a racist since you only reaffirm their beliefs as you try to "maintain the status quo" of benefiting from the system with your "white privilege", regardless of how hard your own life is.  On top that, it's years of targeted censorship from social media for having such innocuous mainstream opinions, having things listed as "hate speech" and "conspiracy theories". Now we have the 2020 election, and people are frustrated because they aren't having their problems addressed. The vast majority of the lawsuits have been dismissed simply on legal standing, they aren't addressing the merit of the cases so no one gets any closure. Instead, it's nothing but "nothing to see here, don't look behind the curtain! It's the most secure election in US history, even only four years after the election was supposedly rigged by Russia!". It had the highest rate of mail-in ballots in history, a method which is known to be rife with fraud so much so that other sane nations have banned it. There are God knows how many fishy instances of statistical anomalies, observers being barred entry, ballots dumps with insane ratios, *state constitutions being broken*, etc., and no one wants to do anything about it, let alone even talk about.  This isn't just over an election, it's over 10 years of a relentless uphill battle and having legal avenues stripped away from them, especially over something so important. It's the final straw that has broken the camel's back. It would be absolutely demoralising and frustrating for anyone. Leftists have the same claim in some regard, especially now that Biden has won and the Democrat machine is rearing up to dispose of the "useful idiots" that voted for them. For example, after months of support from Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, now that the election is over, he is finally coming out condemning the rioters and calling in the National Guard, even though he called Trump a fascist a couple of months ago for offering to do the exact same thing. The left has served their purpose and they are being tossed aside. The Democrats won't give them what they want, even with the House, Senate and Presidency. I would be upset in their shoes too.  >"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable." -John F. Kennedy.   Ignoring and censoring the right is making a peaceful revolution impossible. Chief Justice Roberts supposedly didn't hear the Texas lawsuit because he was worried about the ensuing riot, but what did he think would happen? Ignore their concerns over the election being stolen and they would just forget about it? If anything it makes them more concerned, it emboldens their worries over the culture war.   Look at the maim Trump supporter who stormed the Capitol Hill, the Viking guy, what was he equipped with? He had red, white and blue war paint, an American flag, and a megaphone. That perfectly encapsulates the problem they are facing. These are patriots who want to uphold the constitution, they love their country, but they are not being heard.  Now the government decided to *not* object to the electoral vote as a response to the siege of Capitol Hill. Will the right finally let it lie and forget about it now? Will it finally calm them down? Place your bets on that one... Everything they are doing is making the situation worse, these people cannot continue to be treated like this forever. 74 million people feel like the government doesn't hear them, like the government is ignoring them, like the government isn't fit for purpose, and the response from the government and the establishment is to double down on that feeling. The media and every other institution are against them, and all options are being exhausted. Eventually, they will break. How is that not a real reason for revolution? It's the exact same thing as the Tea Party - both feel like they are not being represented.  Seriously, the only way forward I can see is secession. It might not be the right move in the eyes of the people right now, but all revolutionary acts are perceived that way at first, and it takes brave men to enact them. What do you think King George III thought when he heard that the American colony was throwing the British out? What do you think the majority of Americans thought at the time? Abraham Lincoln flagrantly violated the constitution during the Civil War, yet he is perceived as one of the greatest presidents in history. All it takes is political willpower and confidence in the system. Maybe Trump isn't the guy for the job, maybe he is, but something revolutionary needs to happen soon because things cannot continue this way. Who knows, maybe history look back on this in 2020 as the start of a step forward towards a better era for America? Maybe Trump instituting martial law will be looked back on as a great move? Or maybe it will be a disaster?

cwzgs	If you never criticized the vandalism of small businesses during the BLM protests then you are a hypocrite, I agree.   What I disagree with in this comment is the second half. There’s a lot with the pandemic: people have to make a living, the effectiveness of masks, etc but imo the whole covid crisis and how to deal with it should have never become so political in the first place.   Nobody wants the economy to crash or for people to lose their livelihoods. It is an unprecedented situation. People have the right to support themselves. But also, hospitals are getting overwhelmed because of the contagiousness of this virus. The government’s job in this case is to find an agreeable solution and telegraph that to the general public. They have failed to do so. And they have failed to support people struggling to make it through with the restrictions that have been put into place.	1609992154.0	gidzuya	t3_krxl6t	t1_gidy1iy	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gidzuya/

N/A	So a civil war to end slavery in a system of government that allows and provides for peaceful change is unacceptable to you?  I'm not trying to condone violence, but the government is clearly not listening to a large percentage of people who have no faith in the electoral process.  Maybe not  a majority, but we are bordering on near 40% now.  Mainly republicans and independents but 17% Democrat mistrust as well.  There is a line that should not be crossed, by either side, but at some point violence becomes the only answer.  It's good that people writ large are very very reluctant to cross that line, but if the government keeps on the current course, there will be that powder keg moment, and that will spark a point of no return.	1609975087.0	gicz7lr	t3_krxl6t	t1_gicm4da	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gicz7lr/

6jz7m	I disagree. The blm and antifa protests involved looting and vandalizing private and public property, scorn and disdain for law enforcement. and defacement and destruction of government buildings and statues.  These protests involved no vandalism or looting, no defacement of the building or the many many many statues inside (there is a statue for every state, plus many more), and relatively respectful treatment of law enforcement. They are protesting against the people inside the Capitol building and that's where they took their protest. They broke windows and moved some furniture, perhaps even took the furniture. They sat in the chairs and put their feet on the desks to show their disdain for the people in power who had been ignoring them for years.   This is not a blm protest. I don't condone what they did but this is nowhere near the same thing as the bullshit that happened this past summer.	1609976621.0	gid2kj7	t3_krxl6t	t1_gicmhu6	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gid2kj7/

If it helps you any, [calls to every secretary of state in the country indicate that there are no signs of widespread vote fraud in any state](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html) according to the respective republican and democrat secretaries of state, and sources from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-election-ballot-massachuset-idUSKBN26N2AF) to [France 24 bear out the only suspicious activity being asking for a specifically winning amount of votes instead of just accurate counts.](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210103-trump-presses-top-georgia-election-official-to-find-votes-for-him-in-recorded-phone-call)  When [Trump's own lawyers tell judges there is no evidence of mass vote fraud](https://mobile.twitter.com/marceelias/status/1326345253360635904) then we might want to listen.

The reason the second amendment exists is not only to ensure the public has access to the same weapons as the government (and we can see that didn’t happen), but to keep the government accountable to us. They aren’t accountable to us anymore. They’re more afraid of their corporate overlords than they are of us.

mry08	I mean if they marched in, in unison, and made some point in a speech, then dispersed I would actually still call that a protest. If you break nothing and don't block others it's still a protest.

2970s2nc	Antifa and blm have organization, direction, money and the explicit support of academia, big tech, and legacy media. That allowed them to run rampant and cause $2 billion in damages, kill 33 people, and injure thousands more during their riots. Portland is STILL rioting 7 months later. The media just ignores it or calls it "protest".   A well organized right wing version of antifa is a nightmare scenario. Of course unlike antifa, the government will clamp down HARD on anything like that that might spring up. This will only fuel more anger.   It's hard to not think we're witnessing the beginning of dystopia. Militant critical race theory has infected social media, academia, legacy media, the government, and even corporate America. They are openly hostile to free speech, equal protection under the law, the family, capitalism, and rationality itself. No, really. Go look up what "the master's tools" are to these radicals. It was no accident that the SMITHSONIAN put out a document claiming rationality, hard work, and the scientific method were examples of "white supremacy culture".	1610006893.0	giemetr	t3_krxl6t	t1_gidckx8	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/giemetr/

53xy07d3	Its what happens when you elect someone who has no interest in being a career politician and instead acts as an entertainer. It leads to a person who's amazing at exciting his base but can't give you a direction or lead.  This encapsulates all the worst part of trumps presidency, It had a shit ton of good in it and I REALLY hope the GOP learns from it but God damn trump nuked his legacy so fucking hard. He'll be remembered for this disaster not bringing peace to the middle east or creating a great economy.

2970s2nc	Yup. His leadership style works great for some things that require a heavy hand but this was a fucking disaster.   That said I think Michael Malice had an excellent point. There is a raging river of anti establishment anger in this country today. The left thinks trump is the river, but in reality trump was the dam holding back the river. He actually listened to them. Bernie did too on the other side. Once he's gone there will be nothing holding them back. They will have been completely abandoned by government, big tech, academia, legacy media, and Hollywood and made destitute by authoritarian lockdowns. If you think today was bad imagine what's going to happen when they try to remove trump from office.   Their anger is only going to get worse with Joe Biden in office. It's hard to not think we will see a right wing antifa soon.   Of course the fucking lockdowns amplified their anger and blm/antifa anger to a fever pitch. China is laughing at us right now. They couldn't have planned this better. Lockdowns have torn this country to shreds. We will be paying for them economically and spiritually for many decades.	1610006578.0	giem1yp	t3_krxl6t	t1_gicyem4	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/giem1yp/

14acbl	Edit: I've had some time at work to rationalise my thoughts a bit better, and I can keep the rant going! Part II, because of the word limit.  When Antifa took over six blocks of Seattle, kicking out the police and leading to ungodly numbers of rape, theft, and even murder, were they labelled as insurrectionists? No, but when the right sieges Capitol Hill, *that's* insurrection. When BLM invaded Lafayette Square, fought with police and even set fire to the historic federal government St. John's church, were they labelled as domestic terrorists? No, but when the right breaks a few windows, *that's* domestic terrorism. Did Trump get praise for stopping those terrorists? No, he was labelled a fascist for violating the rights of the people for a photo-op. When leftists broke into Capitol Hill in 2018 during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, were they labelled as traitors to the Republic? No, but when the right breaks into Capitol Hill, *that's* traitorous to the Republic. Did any of the Democrats get the blame for "inciting violence" as they *outright lied* over Brett Kavanaugh? No, but Trump gets blamed for "inciting violence" because he wanted to clarify the results of the election. When Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer violated the constitution with her lockdown order in March, even after having been confirmed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Michigan, and she decided to ignore them and circumvent the law anyway, was she labelled a fascist for violating the constitution? No, but when Trump decides to pursue legal avenues to contest the results of the election, as he is legally right to, he is barked at for violating the constitution. When the Democrats called the 2016 election illegitimate for three long years, even though we know how, after several investigations, there is absolutely nothing substantial to their claims and they outright lied about it to the people, did they have articles of impeachment drawn up for them? No, but Trump asks questions regarding the 2020 election he is banned from Twitter and is possibly facing his second impeachment for doing so.  If you haven't gotten the message yet, the Democrats and the left have been singing happily to the tune of "rules for thee but not for me" for the past 10 years or so, and it is demoralising a lot of the right. In violence, the left wins. In peace, the left wins. In legal proceedings, the left wins. In illegal proceedings, the left wins. The right is fighting a constant uphill battle where the left gets away with so much because they are protected by the media establishment, and the right can't do anything about it.  >"When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty." -Thomas Jefferson.  The left will flagrantly violate the constitution when it comes to COVID lockdowns, restricting people's right to assemble and practice their religion, and no one says anything. The media actually demonising the few governors who are upholding the constitution. The left flagrantly violates the constitution by changing the rules of the election to increase their odds of success without going through the proper legal proceedings, and they get rewarded for it with an election victory. The media will smear any questions over the election as conspiracy theorists and ignore any legitimate questions. At what point will people feel the need to fight back? They have no voice in politics anymore. The Democrats and the media will justify the George Floyd riots as "voices of the unheard", but when the right is the unheard faction *because* of the left's censorship, they do not care.  I've been entrenched in this culture war for years now, even before Gamergate first started, and I have watched this thing slowly building and escalating as the years have gone by. This insane and evil leftist ideology went from silly Tumblr Blogs to internet and gaming culture, to universities and workplaces, and is now burrowing its tendrils into every institution possible, and *no one* is able to stop it. I am not a die-hard Trump supporter, I recognise he had his flaws, but he is fighting the good fight. I have come to call him "the right politician, but the wrong man". People really do not realise the utmost importance of banning Critical Race Theory. But now Biden has said he will bring it back, and after everything that has happened, I am really feeling weary of it all. Nothing we can do is right because the game is rigged against us. I don't know what the answer is, but apparently, some of the people on the right feel more hopeless than I do to the point where they felt the need to express their frustrations by sieging Capitol Hill and interrupting the electoral process. I disavow violence, but that number will only continue to increase if no one takes actions to prevent it, and the left and the Democrat seemingly do not care because they keep throwing fuel on the fire. It will come back to bite them one day soon.	1610098210.0	giiy9wt	t3_krxl6t	t1_gif94du	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/giiy9wt/

This is the far right’s doing, and the media is going to make one incident on one afternoon in midwinter look worse than an entire summer’s worth of leftist violence.

But also, hospitals are getting overwhelmed because of the contagiousness of this virus. The government’s job in this case is to find an agreeable solution and telegraph that to the general public. They have failed to do so. And they have failed to support people struggling to make it through with the restrictions that have been put into place.  Okay, but this hypothetical solution of yours can't compromise the liberty of the individual.   It's NOT the job of people in certain industries to suffer, for the social restrictions of people who want to just live their life and enjoy this precious time on earth we're gifted with to have that stripped from them, for authoritarian policies to be enabled BECAUSE some people chose to eat many cheese burgers and drink too much soda and go outside.

It was very peaceful for the most part and the worst was them getting into the Capitol building and the few acts of violence there. It’s sad to see everyone here giving up suddenly on everything when it really is not something insanely major.

Saw one post showing that one guy who was covered in viking gear had been seen at many BLM protests. Another frontline breaker had a sickle and hammer tattooed on his wrist. Perhaps all of this would have just turned into an occupation around the capital building if Antifa/BLM hadnt interjected rather than an uncoordinated takeover.

3ecer1wo	The majority of Americans saying Democracy has played out? IF it is a majority of Americans claiming that, the margins are thin. No matter what, at least, you still have 40% of the country thinking there was some sort of fraud. Yet there was no investigation or audit proving those claims to be true or false. They had to put up with “Trump colluded with Russia” for 3 years, only to find out that the original evidence warranting the investigation was doctored. We are not a democracy, we are a Constitutional Republic. 26 states voted for Trump, over 70 million total people. They believe there was mass voter fraud throughout the election. And no matter what, in some states, the states legislation was skipped and voter rules were made by non elected officials and the courts. The people in the capital feel cheated by the system. I feel cheated by the system. If there was a proper investigation/audit, this would have been avoided.

There is even a well documented election where one candidate cheated to win, and only won because the other candidate didn't cheat as well.

Amazing how many times I've had to sit and watch the process of the elections being completely stolen whenever a republican gets into power, and then they are pure as the driven snow whenever a democrat is elected.

cwzgs	I agree with you, but I think at this point it’s a bit more complicated in terms of who’s perspective you are looking at.   The state government at the very least has a duty to protect the health and safety of the public, and actually has the right by law to enforce certain regulations. Of course-only if a crisis is deemed significant enough. Nearly 4,000 Americans are reported to be dying daily from covid related causes. People are losing family members, friends, and coworkers. Most importantly, from the perspective of the state, hospitals are getting incapacitated, and people who actually need treatment **unrelated to covid** are becoming jeopardized.  Individual rights shouldn’t be infringed upon. But enforcing temporary regulations on the general public in response to a crisis isn’t unprescedented in the country’s history. Just my two cents.

nvj2j	Welp I guess that discounts all the videos of them bringing in boxes of ballots and adding hundreds of thousands of votes to Biden in the middle of the night after saying they were done counting. I guess that means that the poll watchers not being allowed to examine the legitimacy of the count suddenly didn't happen. That they didn't kick them out of the building and them put bristol boards over the windows.  Like it or not this election was stolen.

3ecer1wo	the lawsuits were to audit. i should’ve been more clear. Have you listened to statisticians talk about it? The way the votes were counted, it’s damn near impossible that Biden would have won. Also when a precinct says “we are done counting for the night, we will pick it up tomorrow” and votes continue to be counted, that’s suspect. If there’s no voter fraud, you wouldn’t have a problem with an audit. If Biden won after an audit, i would accept it. So would the vast majority of Republicans. Sadly, even after the Russian hoax wasted 3 years, we can’t get an audit of ballots.  And even if you don’t personally see it, 70 million Americans think there some form of voter fraud. If you really want “unity,” and have nothing to hide, an audit will discover the truth only make everyone accept it.	1609977713.0	gid4yn4	t3_krxl6t	t1_gid26y0	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gid4yn4/

N/A	Pathetic fucking excuses, how do you live with this bullshit? So just to go down the list your counterarguments for each of this are   1. It's the Tennessee Star. Well they're just covering the story, it's literally just quoting Georgia officials who say they don't have the records.   2. Uh no it's the law, they should not defy literal court orders for subpoenas. If the subpoenas were a tool of harassment they can actually argue against that, this is straight up ignoring the order.  3. Is there a substantive argument here? You're basically just saying "wahhh that's bullshit". This was sealed and clearly a judge thought it was good enough to be released to the public.    I have no problem with someone wanting high standards for evidence, but you're dismissing each of these with no actual argument, it's only news you don't like. Do you see the problem here when you do that and simultaneously claim there's no evidence?  If a report that was approved in court that proves audit logs were deleted or people actually violating the law to delay the release of records is not a problem, what is? If you're tired of hearing about the election the no one's gonna blame you for checking out, but don't drag the rest of us down with it and deny the evidence that exists.	1609998353.0	gieb2zm	t3_krxl6t	t1_giea1e7	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gieb2zm/

Point to me where the guy talked about chain of custody. The SOS is a fucking clown who admitted to lying about poll monitors, citing him is comical.   2. Alright I guess we'll see.  3. Well you are trying to argue, by saying that a expert report can be faked so the report I cited is not valid. This could be applied to any evidence whatsoever, and it shows you are not arguing in good faith. What is the point of saying that there's a possibility it can be faked, does it change the substance or that a judge unsealed it?   Again you can choose to ignore this stuff, but then lying and saying non-sequiturs because you don't want other people to talk about it anymore is really low.	1610034835.0	gifoasb	t3_krxl6t	t1_giecj4y	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gifoasb/

N/A	1. Nope the concern generated because election officials admitted on their own that they couldn't provide it. The video is not related and they didn't mention chain of custody in the call, stop lying.   2. Again not an argument. How can you say there's no evidence and then just dismiss anything you don't like because it could possibly be faked?   Looking through your posts, you actually did seem to be interested in election fraud early on, now you're saying nothing ever happened and coming up with the most pathetic excuses. It's okay dude the election is over, you don't have to pretend to make false claims and non-sequitur arguments so you can get others to stop talking about the election.	1610076063.0	gii3oei	t3_krxl6t	t1_gigw82i	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gii3oei/
4r70zms1	You're the one with the problem, a signifigant portion of the population demands an investigation and all calls for it are suppressed and dismissed as a waste of time, they're putting more effort into dismissing the claims than actually acting as public servants and giving people a right to make their own opinions, they don't even let Trump claim election fraud without first spending 5 minuets "debunking" it, or putting a notification by his post or yes even questioning the "ethics" of allowing him to give his opinion, its insane.  If it was as fair as they claim, why can't they just let Trump make his claims, why can't there be an investigation? If there was no fraud then that would benefit Trump's opponents and make him look like an idiot, instead they are fighting very hard to shut this down, Hell they want to impeach Trump tonight even though his term ends in 2 weeks, there is an irrational and blind hatred of him and his supporters, no one can deny this, I don't consider myself the biggest Trump fan, and I am more anti-Biden than Pro-Trump, but facts are facts.	1609990486.0	gidwj5p	t3_krxl6t	t1_gidvq3c	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gidwj5p/

13nqwt5d	Nothing baseless about it. The proof is very much right in front of our faces. The moment your thought process is challenged you automatically revert to the information your continually subject yourself to. I watched the videos and I can say that was the most embarrassed I’ve even been as an American. 10 months of blm riots didn’t make me feel that way because that’s what I’ve expect from that side. Since day one conservatives have held the moral high ground in the sense that we’ve always maintained we protest peacefully. We make our voices heard the right way. every single word of that went out the window on 1/6. All of our proclamations went null and void and Donald trump reinforced himself as an incompetent asshole	1610145451.0	gilcdc7	t3_krxl6t	t1_gil4tk1	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gilcdc7/

N/A	Bro, I donated to (I'd gladly PM you the receipt) and voted for Trump bc I support his policies and I found his rhetoric amusing until he began peddling mass election fraud claims. I'm telling you Trump is 100% bullshitting on mass election fraud. Sure, the MSM, Hollywood, and big tech was unfair to conservatives, and some states modified election processes that raised some eyebrows, but there are no evidence of mass fraud.	1609992843.0	gie16ac	t3_krxl6t	t1_gie040p	/r/Conservative/comments/krxl6t/for_those_of_you_comparing_these_protests_to/gie16ac/

I was impressed with the 90% of protestors who did not cross the barriers outside. Did you see that video?  I was also impressed with the huge number of protestors helping the capital police hold back the violent (Antifa/blm) thugs.

N/A	Either you're being misleading on purpose or just dumb as a bag of bricks, chain of custody of ballots from each country is not the same thing as ballots in this specific video supposedly following chain of custody.

N/A	I see a lot of posts in other subs saying “I can’t believe so many people would vote for a racist” or some version of that statement. If Republicans/conservatives have not figured it out already, this argument will not end with Donald trump. If you remember the Romney campaign, it was flooded with racist accusations and false claims. It does not matter the person, a democrat inherently views any republican policy as being racist, there for any republican politician is racist. I think republicans and their supporters need to continue to break this trope and can even take away a couple learning from Donald trump. Don’t bow to the woke mob, don’t apologize for slights that a normal person would not find offensive.

55tana35	The media can’t call the election. People can get as excited or angry as they want to, but President Trump has filed a legal protest with the Federal Elections Commission regarding the election process- just as Al Gore did in 2000.   The election isn’t over until due process regarding Trump’s legal filing is resolved in Court and The Federal Election Commission declares a winner.   In 2000 it was finalized on December 14th.  This is just irresponsible behavior by the media. It’s unfortunate honestly, because it could lead to unnecessary rioting and violence against innocent people.  If you believe Biden won or Trump won, let the system do it’s job and remain calm in the confidence that your candidate will be declared President. Live your life and let others who have contrary political views go about their business until a decision is reached. That’s how the system is supposed to work and should work. At the end of the day we’re not Republicans or Democrats. We’re Americans. The world is watching.

bd7qe	Reading Biden's speech with subtitles in a sports bar.  Some things worth objecting too, but by and large, it's a reasonable theme and explains whatever appeal he actually has.  His theme of unity, of treating his opponents as Americans, of healing, certainly won't persuade me to ever be a democrat, but I wish to Christ it had been Trump's message for four years.  The themes of this speech should have been Trump's since January 2017, and if you can't see that, you can't see how Biden could have possibly won this election legitimately.  His use of the Bible verses on everything having a season was brilliant.    Trump had some stupid stupid advisors out the gate, Bannon is a doofus, and he easily could have given his version of this type of speech.  Yeah, Left would have rejected it, so what.  This election shows the center almost always wins.   Be reasonable.    Now, Biden's gonna have a problem, because the progressives ain't having any of this.  It will be interesting how his battle with the Left.  In my lifetime, two Democrats have won the presidency in 1992 and 2008, and now 2020.  In both 92 and 08, the GOP took the house and senate two years later.    The American people doesn't want the Left.   But they don't want divisive personalities either, whether Hillary or Trump.  Take that to heart, and adjust accordingly moving forward.  Trump taught republicans how to fight, now the time is to fight with wisdom, long term strategy, and decency.	1604800705.0	gbj8xhd	t3_jpu2rx	t3_jpu2rx	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbj8xhd/

6diz9bji	Ok guys how about this.  Biden cannot run a 2nd term but could finish the first.  Kamala is too selfish to let go of a potential presidential run so she’s the democratic candidate 2024.  Any white Republican candidate the media will paint as a racist.  Male they will paint as sexist and mansplaining like the shut they said about pence.  We need a woman to run against her.  Tulsi isn’t awful.  Some Democrats like her.  Republicans know she’s better than any democrat.  She has enough common sense policies.  And she fucking neutered Kamala on stage in front of everyone like a poised professional.  So, republicans should invite tulsi to run on their platform.  Give her a strong conservative VP.  She will annihilate Kamala.  We retake the presidency.  And use a conservative cabinet to keep her honest.  Groom the VP for his run.

3f06m3y2	Interesting that they would call the election when there seems to be evidence of tampering, glitches,  ballot destruction/loss/theft/harvesting, and still uncounted ballots...  Is this the media's attempt to influence Trump not to keep fighting? Even Fox called it for Biden...  I hope Trump does fight this...they have already shown that the "fixed glitch" has reversed thousands if votes back to Trump....and that there are a multitude of counties that could have this same glitch since they use the same software.... and....  there are USPS and ballot station workers coming forward to talk about ballot manipulation....  Is that not enough evidence to encourage Trump and his campaign to continue to press the fight...??  Keep fighting Mr. President....keep showing that you are not just fighting to remain POTUS, but rather fighting for the integrity, trustworthiness,  and confidence in our election process...so that WE THE PEOPLE will always know that our vote counts....if you stop, will we ever be able to say that again, that our vote counts?   If you truly lose the election fairly, then so be it...but make it honest, fair, and trustworthy that Biden did truly win and not some corrupt upper class millionaire/billionaire just hated you that much they are willing to jeopardize the integrity of the US.....

807a8	Trump went the distance, turned the Supreme Court to the right, got the highest Black and Latino turnout for a Republican Presidential candidate in decades, made peace deals, started no new wars, raised our pre-Covid economy, and saw a record number of GOP women run and win office under his administration. Given time, his attitude will be forgotten, but his achievements will stand.  Now, the onus is on the left. President Biden will lead a divided country, with his party potentially in charge of both houses of Congress. If they can't perform, the nation will only have them to blame. If the far left doesn't stop rioting, the nation will only have them to blame. And if the left doesn't stop injecting every area of escapism with social and political messaging, the nation will only have them to blame. In 2024, Biden will be 80. The GOP should take this time to consolidate and spread their message. They'll have another chance soon enough.	1604768319.0	gbgusv4	t3_jpu2rx	t3_jpu2rx	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbgusv4/

They were busy with their lives and only cared about the policy he passed.   Unfortunately, there are people who do hear the president everyday and turn to the president to lead and set an example and for a lot of the people who voted against him, his rhetoric, tone, and demeanor is what turned them away.

N/A	My predication... the US heads into a depression due to lockdowns from repeated events to control the virus. Republicans get both the house and the senate majority in 2022. Biden has a medical complication a few months after the results and is no longer fit to serve. Kamala becomes President and all of the left screams “We have a female African American President, the country is finally saved!” as our national debt exponentially increases and the stock market collapses. Red wave in 2024, electing the first Latino president in US history.	1604775393.0	gbh6njc	t3_jpu2rx	t3_jpu2rx	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh6njc/

Just because the corrupt media decided to coordinate and call the election all at once, *coincidentally* right before the big Trump campaign press conference - does not mean the election is over.  1. Trump just got significantly closer in Arizona and has a solid chance of winning it. 2. Georgia is being recounted. 3. Pennsylvania has been rife with corruption, there’s tons of evidence, and it will be going to the Supreme Court. Justice Alito has already commented on this.  This election is still weeks away from being decided. Don’t submit to the fake news media’s narrative.  Remember, these are the same people who constructed the Russia hoax, the impeachment hoax, Kavanaugh, feeding the koi fish in Japan, the Covington kids, the pee tape, the dossier, and countless other hoaxes.

7s9uj	I will apply leftist math to show how Biden destroyed Trump.  Out of the 245.5 million Americans of voting age, only 71 million people voted for Trump. That means Trump only has support of 29% of Americans.  Meanwhile, Biden's 75 million votes puts him at a little over 50% of the votes cast, which means Biden has more than 50% of the country supporting him.  Biden: 50.6%  Trump: 28.9%  Checkmate, conservatives  /s  Edit: In case y'all missed it, I did include the /s to indicate this was a sarcastic joke. This is the math they used to somehow claim that Trump had less than 30% support, while Hillary had about 50%, by adjusting how they calculated each candidates votes.	1604778894.0	gbhgbcv	t3_jpu2rx	t3_jpu2rx	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhgbcv/

npxgjn4	Trumps loss was due to his character. Which is evidenced by the fact that nearly 50% of people still voted for him amongst record voter turnout.  He did some great things and was an extremely productive president; another 4 years would have been very interesting to watch.  But unfortunately he lost because he couldn’t keep his divisive, insulting, arrogant mouth shut, and pushed away a lot of people of conscience who otherwise liked his policies. I speak for myself and I’m sure many others.	1604783754.0	gbhuzbm	t3_jpu2rx	t3_jpu2rx	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhuzbm/

Hopefully the country can limp forward to a clean election in 2024 and I desperately hope this 2020 election isn't a sign of what's to come in future elections.

Keep wasting your money funding a chinese agent  Edit3: 1800 kids die a year from cancer. 16000 kids are diagnosed every year. Instead of messaging threats and telling me "I wish you die of cancer"... help a kid live to see Biden as President. You guys have shown your colors today.  Edit4: More babies have died in the US than those from Covid. Dont punish a child and their parents because they were responsible and got hit with bad luck. 600k abortions a year.  Edit5: shout out to these guys for not donating to Child Cancer research but electing to troll instead. I wanna recognize you!  Incredible... the awards are now anonymous lmfao  Edit6: r/Conservative adhered to reddits TOS and removed the post for including the names of harrassing award donors.

6i9b128f	You haven't paid a god damn bit of attention if you're this naive.   When he criticized the rioting, he went after the alt right and proud boys, who had nothing to do with the riots.  He absolutely refused to call out Antifa and BLM, and he supported multiple people (George Floyd & the rapist with a knife) against the police, for political gain.   Biden played against black people when it was politically convenient and now he's playing to them; he has no morals and is perfectly fine with creating more hatred despite the facts of each situation.

14id8b	One of their next blame and shame campaigns will be over legal gun ownership. It will again be tied to race, so if you're against their gun control measures then that will automatically designate you as a racist (which will threaten your possibility for employment, etc.). We've already seen a hint at the plan from the mayor of Chicago, blaming some Republican areas of the South for the influx of guns into Chicago (and the horrible black on black violent crime numbers in that city). The media will report it as follows: If those conservative areas don't enact more strict gun control laws, then young black men will continue to be murdered. Using race in this manner will be their strategy. The left have essentially ignored the black on black crime issue in inner cities (because it didn't further their agenda), but I think that's going to change.  The chipping away of the first and second amendments will be big priorities for the Democrats.	1604781607.0	gbhoc0j	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbh7tq3	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhoc0j/

People can't even see their own bias anymore and care more about "Decency" and "Face" than about policy and actual work.  The right to vote is an individual one, I won't condemn anyone for voting for who they wanna vote --- Its just disappointing that people exercised such a right with such an undeniable bias or on the basis "I just can't stand him." --- and can't see how unfair it would be if such bias were applied to themselves by others.	1604781745.0	gbhoq24	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbh3v13	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhoq24/

8s7u4dx1	Too many on r/politics are delusional AF and need a civics course.  Every presidential candidate makes promises they know they can't keep because they know they have no real control over it.  People shouldn't worry about Biden's tax plan for example. It's not up to him to write it, and it's not up to him to pass it. It would have to move a very divided and obstructed congress for that to happen. However, reddit eats that stuff up. They can't wait for their fantasy worlds to come true. They are fools, nobody has learned anything. Government has been gridlocked since I was born in the 80s.  If you try to talk reality into some of those awarded comments, it's kind talking to brick wall. The shit they come up with over there is just as crazy as any QAnon conspiracy I've read.  They are delusional and hyperbolic. I've seen so many comments on there about how the world is ending and everyone associated with Trump will be jailed, etc. It's nuts and they complain about far right conservatives, y'all do the same thing just a few things switched around. So much exaggerating and fear mongering.  This is what Disney culture has done to us. Liberals are convinced the conservatives are the Empire, Conservatives think it opposite. Meanwhile Disney spoon feeds kids into thinking breaking laws is ok if they don't like them. They teach it's ok to steal from a shop owner because they can't afford to buy something. They teach them that all evil people are actually former good people who had something bad happen to them and now you should feel bad for them. Let's just gloss over the fact that anakin killed a bunch of kids and kylo ren killed a bunch of poor immigrants, now they root for them because they were told to do so. This is what Disney does in their movies and that's what they do with ABC News.	1604794278.0	gbiqhu1	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgtjjj	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbiqhu1/

N/A	I’m waiting also. If Biden won legitimately the country as a whole spoke. I will go about my everyday tasks like usual. I believe many things will change for the worse, but life will go on.  But I don’t believe it in the slightest. I have never seen so much enthusiasm for any president in my 50+ years. Boat galas all over the country, car parades all over, seeing different vehicles flying American and Trump flags  every day, Trump rallies that overflow with 1,000’s of people, and so on. And you’re telling me that Biden had more votes? A man that has trouble completing a sentence? It’s ridiculous. And I think it will be determined in the courts when all the evidence gets out.   A co-worker was speaking yesterday with a good customer of his and she stated she voted for Biden. He told her she voted for someone she probably wouldn’t like if she knew what all the Dems stand for. The only thing he brought up was abortions and how they want it legal to abort up to birth. She started crying, said she didn’t realize they wanted that, and she immediately regretted her vote. And he didn’t even go into Hunter’s laptop, the evidence of Joe being in the pocket of China, or into all the GOOD Trump has done for the country the last 4 years while being dogged on all sides every single day. She has never seen or heard any of that I’m sure because everything is filtered. Liberals that only follow the MSM or parrot what other liberals say have no idea how much good Trump has accomplished for EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. (EVERY RACE, EVERY SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AND BOTH MALE AND FEMALE)  The left, politicians AND the MSM, has won the propaganda war with all their lies and deceptions, and the liberal voters believe every lie that they tell, but I have to believe we will eventually win with truth and facts.   Liberals downvote me all you want to, I couldn’t care less.	1604772375.0	gbh006c	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgtbtu	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh006c/

Wonder what our mods are up to. I've talked to them a few times and they seem like intelligent, reasonable people.

2vg0cwei	I really hope they learn from this and try to shift away from populism and rethink some of their positions. It’s been hard for me to support the Republican Party as of late, and Trump’s administration only made it harder. He definitely did some good things and there’s no denying that, but he’s also not what they need. Hopefully they’ll do some reflecting and start to come back towards the small government ideals they claim to support.  But with Trump’s massive popularity and cult following, I fear they’ll only double down and we’ll start seeing more Trump-like politicians.	1604768356.0	gbguw07	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgt6q3	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbguw07/

36znk	I will accept Biden as president.  However, the fact that Trump almost won with the most hostile media in history and continual misquoting and lies from the press is amazing. If there would have been anything resembling an objective press Trump would have won with a huge margin.  The press and DNC managed to convince people that a very real tax cut raised their taxes and benefited the rich, when in reality due to the loss of SALT deductions the rich were hurt the most. Any good economic news always had a "but". The press is corrupt and complicit.   And, if it was Republicans kicking out Democrat watchers and blocking windows and the other stuff going on with the counts, the press would be screaming it's collective heads off and calling for investigations.   Also, if Trump had Biden's history of totally verified plagiarism, sniffing women and girls, inappropriate touching he would have never gotten far as the press would have done their jobs.   Remember that John Edwards using campaign funds for his pregnant mistress was revealed by the National Enquirer since the mainstream press was unwilling to do their job with the pretty boy sweet talking sleazeball. The press has not changed much in 20 years.	1604772758.0	gbh0qax	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgtin2	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh0qax/
fsq7n	Honestly it could almost not have worked out better in my mind. Biden was a slap in the face to Bernie supporters and radicals on the left. The senate is going to stay R because Biden isn't that popular. It showed the many Republicans don't like Trump but are still conservative. I know his supporters are going to be pissed, but I thought we were going to have a Dem super majority in the senate and have them owning the house ant the presidency to boot. This seems like as good of an outcome as I could have hoped for.	1604770271.0	gbgxgal	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgtin2	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbgxgal/

I watched them all when it was posted but I haven't tried the links again today. Democrat leadership in cities across the country (including my city) rejected Trump's offer for National Guard presence time and time again, instead *deliberately allowing* their cities and civilians livelihoods to burn before their eyes. Trump didn't do this. Democrats did.	1604774421.0	gbh4h67	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbh1f02	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh4h67/

ibf4x	I was actually a moderate liberal back in 2016 and I wrote Trump an email stating that I wished him luck and prosperity for the country. Then I slowly saw how terrible Democratic policies were and jumped ship. But I still hope the same for Biden and Harris.	1604770135.0	gbgxaq6	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgtqhm	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbgxaq6/
55xlf	Well, the best would be for many of his policies to go nowhere and for him to be hamstrung in his efforts to undo Trump's work.   I hope for an improvement on coronavirus, but otherwise, I hope Joe doesn't get to do anything. Except maybe quietly go about repeating some of the work Trump did and then not get criticized for it at all. That actually does seem possible.	1604773112.0	gbh1hko	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgtqhm	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh1hko/

7cxxsjwo	Agreed. I genuinely pray he meant what he said about uniting together. It's what we've wanted the last 4 years as it. I have a feeling we're going to see Kamala become the first female president before 4 years is up, but I seriously hope things go better than that. As long as the system's checks and balances work, the new SCOTUS protects the constitution, and Congress gets off their buns and does their job, we should see the bad things mostly rejected, see some decent and hopefully very good things, and as long as he doesn't start kissing ass to china we can still see through.   Here's hoping he carries us through okay to the next election. But just in case...hang on tight.	1604773080.0	gbh1f3i	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgttt0	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh1f3i/

N/A	Conservatives being hypocritical? I am shocked! Shocked I tell you!  Lmao, 4 hours ago, Trump was "what the GOP needed" because he lit a fire under their asses and implemented what many consider to be far-right policies, these were the type of comments that garnered a massive amount of upvotes, but now, Trump is a stain on the party and was never supported (with the exception of about 70 million votes after he was proven to be a failure of a president).

j9efs	You're right, that "wouldn't change the outcome" part of my comment does make assumptions. That's why I said "looks like" (based on the specific numbers that we have credible accusations for).   It COULD be tens, or hundreds of thousands, or millions of fraudulent votes in favor of Biden.  But barring actual evidence, I was going by the order of magnitude of stuff the fraud accusers have already found or alleged. Stuff like 6k votes switched in Michigan due to a glitch, or 21k deceased people on Pennsylvania voter rolls, of whom some portion may have voted for Biden.   So technically you're right, I am making some assumptions on the "looks like it wouldn't have changed it" comment, but it is based on what's been alleged and/or found so far. Investigations could always find more, I'm for continuing to investigate to make sure.	1604774112.0	gbh3r4x	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbh0n1v	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh3r4x/

pyjfw	I’m sorry man but you can’t tell other people what they feel when they hear someone speak and say certain things. You can disagree, but what they feel is just as valid as what you feel.   I’ve watched unedited speeches trump has made at rallies, I’ve read his tweets, and I absolutely agree with the left that 45’s tone was divisive, abrasive, and not fit for the presidency.   I agree the MSM has twisted certain things he’s said for the worse, but the president of the United States, the highest office in the land, should not be saying things on a daily basis that have to be deciphered by people with English doctorates in order to get his point. Words do matter to people and if you can’t be an effective communicator, you cannot be an effective leader. Anyone who has actually lead in real life understands this.	1604770628.0	gbgxvvw	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgwxhq	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbgxvvw/

Pelosi's talk about a "[25th Amendment Commission](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-introduces-bill-create-commission-presidential-capacity-under-25th-amendment-n1242717)" was a ploy designed to keep Biden in line with the Pelosi/Harris agenda (Harris' politics are more aligned with Pelosi than with Biden); a de facto (blackmail scheme.  Without Senate control, the full implementation of the Pelosi/Harris agenda isn't nearly as easy and the Commission loses a lot of potency as a weapon.  I think Biden still steps down before the end of the first term, but it will be later than sooner (probably after midterms).	1604784524.0	gbhxcqv	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbhhoyr	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhxcqv/

55xlf	Yes, but they'll take any single isolated actor who commits crimes in protest of the Left/Biden as indicative of a widespread insurgent movement and then use that as justification for further purging of social media and public demonization of the Right.  So yeah, no one's going to riot and it'll be credited to Biden (instead of the passivity of conservatives), but they will still find excuses to further silence those conservative voices.  Thankfully, I think Biden will be 1 term and I suspect/hope we'll get another successful hard ass Republican candidate in 2024. We'll need one, because demographic changes are going to eradicate the GOP within a few decades unless someone actually fights back (in a peaceful, legal way of course).	1604776467.0	gbh9gjg	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbh7l0r	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh9gjg/

N/A	Sure I can’t tell them how to feel but I can Determine they’re dumb and sheep. He is not devise and any of what you say. It’s the excuse the lest and media have been using to slander trump and to excuse their behavior. The first three years of trump I didn’t follow his presidency and had no clue what was happening besides the twitter crying and headlines. I saw clips and was like wow this guy isn’t great. But eventually I grew a brian and looked into it all. And I realized it’s all bullshit. Most people don’t actually listen to him and listen to the fake narrative. Again I won’t deny he isn’t the best but it’s not that bad. He’s certainly better than a globalists elite backed president once again.   And speaking of speaking ability. Biden can’t even talk so don’t give me the speaking bullshit.	1604771234.0	gbgyglv	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbgxvvw	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbgyglv/
j1il2	Running your mouth is running your mouth whether it’s on Twitter or on camera.  Joe Biden called a man fat, challenged him to a push-up contest, and wanted to fight him when they asked him about Hunter in Iowa earlier this year.  That’s not counting his treasure trove of gaffes (many of which were racist) every time he left his basement this summer.

N/A	All the more reason he's a fool. if everyone is against you, that's all the more reason to not give them ammunition. Trump inspired hatred of himself not seen for any other republican. the American people could see with their own eyes that he was a morally vacuous narcissist. America is made up of between a quarter to a third of people who are independent/moderate and as such less likely to be biased. To get  true picture of trump, you only have to think of how you would feel if there was a president Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris who behaved exactly like him. I am sure you would be turned off, media or not. And that's the picture independents saw. You only need to listen to his own plain words/tweets to get the idea of the kind of person he is .

6ihtn	It sounds like we *do* align on a lot of issues.   My reasoning for being opposed to abortion, though, is not actually based in religion but in my personal morality. I believe that a human life is a human life and should not be ended by another *without both parties' consent* and when *both* are of sound mind to make that decision. Yes, that means I am in favor of physician-assisted suicide; I adopted that belief after watching my mother suffer for 3 years with terminal cancer when she just wanted it to be over.   I digress. I think that at some point a newly-concieved child becomes a human. The nature of human law is such that there MUST be an arbitrary point at which that is defined. The nature of reality is that arbitrary points rarely apply. So, it is my opinion that the safest way to preserve human lives is to say that life begins at conception. This is not necessarily rooted in a belief that GOD sees it that way (since I cannot and would not claim to know what God wants) but rather that it is the surest way to ensure we are not inadvertently committing moral atrocities.   Law is inherently flawed, because we are trying to impose order on a system of such complexity that we could never hope to cover all of our bases with the limits imposed by human language and understanding. The best we can do is err on the side of caution.   I agree though that the BEST solution to this problem is to make it easy and affordable for people to prevent conception in the first place. It is incontrovertible that abstinence has the highest success rate on that front ***but*** it is naïve to think that human beings will just *not have sex.* So, let's find ways to reduce the risks involved as much as we possibly can.   Regardless, there will always be risk, and it is necessary for adults to accept that risk *and* the consequences that arise in the event that the gamble goes badly. The cost of paying for that risk should not be the destruction of a life either for the parents or for the unborn child.   Just my two cents. Other than that, I agree with basically everything you said -- with perhaps a few minor differences of opinion in the details.   All of that is to say that I'm ***very*** glad to have met someone who is on the "other side" that is as reasonable as you. So, thank you.	1604865418.0	gbn8s9e	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbij5id	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbn8s9e/

4rk091av	I meant exactly what I said. I didn't think they would pack the courts. That is a pretty radical move that wouldn't have had support amongst enough Democrats to make that move. No fucking way! Lol. It would be a horrible political move to play, because the wide support is not there amongst their voter base. So, many senators and congressmen in swing districts and states wouldn't vote in favor of that. They couldn't. They (the DNC establishment) would've already have known this, or figured it out not too long.   So they wouldn't have jumped to that extreme. Not with a slim majority. And I wasn't worried about a slaughter in the Senate or house for them to have a major majority. The country is not that radical. The left is. They are starting to see this now.	1604782670.0	gbhrmvv	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbhk398	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhrmvv/

You'll be surprised I'm sure to find out that The US does not consist solely or even mostly of conservatives.

j9efs	I wouldn't say I HATE him - he's done a lot of great stuff. Cutting regulation, a lot of his middle east policies, he's made immigration security a serious national issue, tough stance on China, tons of conservative judges that will have a lasting impact, I could list more. I think those are all unique things that only Trump could have accomplished and I give him a lot of credit for that.   The ideological stuff like 2A protection, anti-abortion, etc., I don't think we would have seen much of a different outcome under a different Republican leader - Trump protected us on those, but I don't think in an especially unique way.   As far as stuff I DON'T like about him, there's two main things:   One, I think a lot of his solutions are short-term wins at the cost of the long-term. For example, the massive deficit increases we've seen (even before covid spending). I think that's a big result of his tax cuts - which is USUALLY great, but maybe not when the economy is booming and you have massive debt to take care of. I also disagree on America's role in the world - and this one's just about striking the right balance. I'm all for America FIRST, but I think his stance leans a little too much towards America ONLY.   Second, I think a lot of his personality traits are double-edged swords that are great in the business world, but maybe not great for a President. Like he's a natural fighter and a great marketer and he'll win at all costs - that's something I REALLY admire about him. But I think that can make for a really bad combination of traits for a democratically elected president. I've got a lot of thoughts on why, and this is already a long comment so I won't type the whole book out here unless you REALLY want to know. :)   So those are my biggest general criticisms - but none of that is arguing that Dems are a better option, I've got a whole different crate of complaints about them. I just wish we had someone better representing us. My dream ticket would be Crenshaw/Haley.   The only reason I'm not more upset that Biden won is because I don't think him or Kamala are actually going to do much against our core values (all the 2A, pro life, etc. stuff) as long as we can hold the senate.	1604781012.0	gbhmhgq	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbhcv4l	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbhmhgq/
N/A	>My fear is that nobody else will be brave enough to challenge what has always been done because who could hold up to the kind of hatred and vitriol spewed at trump  Anyone not as toxic, selfish and childish as trump could expect to not even see that level of vitriol in the first instance.

It’s a bummer to me, but I hope I’m wrong.  One would think or hope that a president who cares about his movement and doesn't want a life long politician like Biden to win would not turn off the very independent/moderate voters he needs to ensure that by his toxicity.	1604774243.0	gbh42o9	t3_jpu2rx	t1_gbh3ath	/r/Conservative/comments/jpu2rx/ap_has_called_the_election_for_joe_biden/gbh42o9/

The money will not be supplied however if their military is controlled by terrorists, it clarifies. * a bit over $6 billion in taxpayer money will be for financing foreign militaries, but by law, at least $3.3 billion of that will have to be for Israel. * If you skip about about 1000 pages from the Jordanian border security funding section of the US government budget, you'll find that "not less than" $1.65 billon is for Jordan's government overall, but they're required to use $425,000,000 of the American dollars for military. * Toward the beginning of the Omnibus spending bill at page 415 and 416 is a quarter billion dollars for "enhanced border security" for the nations of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman. Not less than $150,000,000 of it shall be for Jordan though.	1608670299.0	ggq88vf	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggq88vf/

6isvbzmb	Like the first CARES act, the lion’s share will go to the monied interests who’ve bought our government. However, the package also includes extensions of unemployment benefits, PPP loans and other provisions which will benefit “Main Street.”  My point is that just as our government should be run for the benefit of all Americans, all Americans need to start having a more informed understanding of policy and its effects. Our ignorance and the ease with which we can be manipulated is a significant part of how those with money can steer the country with advertising and PR campaigns.	1608675098.0	ggqhwl7	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqhwl7/

N/A	32 million Americans are receiving unemployment. Expanded unemployment is 300/week, so 1200/month for 3 months, that's $3600.  32 million x $3600 is **155.2 Billion**.  155.2 Billion Unemployment + 196.8 Billion = **352 Billion** (>1/3 the total package goes to individuals)  **20** Billion for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.  **25** Billion in emergency rent assistance  **82** Billion to upfit schools and universities for covid safety.  **10** Billion for child care assistance.  **13** Billion in increased food stamps to feed the hungry.  **7** Billion to increase broadband access to get more people online.  So that's another (20+25+82+10+13+7=157) **157 Billion** for the people. (\~1/6 of the package goes to support for students, the poor, handling the pandemic)  352 + 157 = **509 Billion so far (\~55% of the package goes to individuals and services and relief for individuals)**  27 Billion for transit, like roads and Amtrak, infrastructure that we need yet lacks funding due to reduced travel.  22 Billion for state and local governments to cover the obvious unemployment benefits, reduced tax revenue, and other costly aspects of the pandemic, etc.  284 Billion is for PPP loans, and PPP loan forgiveness, as well as expanding PPP to smaller businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations.  So there's **333 Billion** for businesses and infrastructure, so the economy doesn't tank, and we still have jobs coming out of this. (The alternative is, for example, that all the airlines tank, the biggest and most powerful of the airlines buys the rest, and now you  may only fly on Supermegacorp airlines. The banks all die as well, so you may only do your banking at Supermegacorp banking. Oh, and all your local stores are gone, so you will also have to buy all of your groceries from Supermegacorp. Welcome to the plandemic, enjoy the monopolies.)  **508 Billion + 333 Billion = 841 Billion (goes to individuals, relief and support for individuals, and infrastructure related to the strain caused by the pandemic.)**  "Guess who's getting that other 6% of the stimulus bill? That's right, whoever I say is the bad guy is in my financially illiterate memes..." \*smug all knowing look\*	1608669186.0	ggq5so2	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggq5so2/

ysmc0	I’m not sure where to start with this post.  It’s laid out IN THE BILL where the money is going.  There’s no mystery.  And you don’t get back proportional your what you paid in because the logic is that those who paid nothing need the most assistance.  Churches and other non profits now qualify for the additional $300bn in PPP loans.  Additional unemployment benefits of $300 / week for 10 weeks.  $15bn for entertainment venues and museums.  $12bn for very small businesses.  Eviction moratorium.  $25bn in emergency assistance to renters.  $51bn for vaccine distribution and testing.  $82bn for schools.  $36bn for farmers, nutrition, and childcare.  $45bn fir transportation.  $7bn for broadband subsidies.   Sure, it would be GREAT if we could all get our taxes back.  It would be a heck of a lot more than $600 per person.  But the reality is the hardest hit by this pandemic were those who didn’t pay taxes in the first place.    So seriously, who is getting the money in some undeserving fashion?  Why are you entitled to get YOUR taxes back but others who are jobless / facing eviction / going hungry not entitled to life-saving help?!?  There’s a lot to be frustrated by in government.  There’s a lot to be angry about right now.  Complaining you didn’t get “your fair share” because you didn’t get your allocation of taxes is embarrassing.  How about this?  Let’s just give the money out proportionally to what people paid in?  Oh wait...  because that’s not how recovery programs work.    I’d love to have back my thousands from last year in taxes.  On the other hand, at least I was LUCKY enough to have to PAY TAXES.	1608677095.0	ggqlzuq	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqlzuq/

mbwyqoj	Here's a breakdown of the spending.  [https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/what-is-in-the-usd900-billion-covid-second-stimulus-package.html](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/what-is-in-the-usd900-billion-covid-second-stimulus-package.html)  I'm NOT saying I like this bill, but there's been some misinformation going around about where the stimulus money is heading.   To summarize:  $286 billion in direct aid. That's the $600 checks and the $300 unemployment bump.  $325 billion in small business aid. Most of this is going to forgiveable loans like the PPP.   $82 billion for schools.  $69 billion for public health including vaccination and spending.  $45 billion to transportation.  $25 billion in rental assistance.  $13 billion in added SNAP benefits.  The suggestion in the OP tweet that \~$700 billion was going to mysterious and terrible "you know who" is unfounded in a way that it's hard to think of as anything but intetionally misleading.  I'm certain that SOME amount of this money, perhaps a very large amount of this money will be grabbed up by people and compaines who don't really need it, or who aren't the supposedly intended recipients, just like the first round of PPP. I'm sure that much of this spending can be put in a category where people may have legitimate philosophical differences about whether they're deserving, needed or appropriate.  But to cast the bill as \~200 billion for the people and 700 billion for a nefarious something else is inaccurate.	1608751337.0	ggtoqkr	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggtoqkr/

am35y	Back to business as usual in Washington. Take a crisis and use it to spend literally trillions of dollars the government does not have.   In order to vote against such a spending bill (which does have a portion dedicated to COVID relief, needed because the government has shut down the economy...) a legislator must have courage, intelligence, and confidence that their stance will be appropriately communicated to their constituents.   Given the death of journalism (no need to keep an eye out for government overreach...) and the censorship of content by private companies, communication of truth/facts to constituents is undoubtedly harder now then it has been in decades.   So if you are a career politician focused on re-election and beholden to your donors, lobbyists, Party, and much much much lower on the list your constituents, what choice do you have? Until we the people decide that legislators should primarily be beholden to their constituents and the issues we believe are important to the country, these are the bills we will see. And given the code that's been cracked to allow the will of the people to be ignored via voting fraud, what we the people want is likely to become even less important moving forward.	1608675065.0	ggqhu1v	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqhu1v/

I remember conservatives being pissed off at the pork barrel spending and at the earmarks and all this back door jackassery that's screwed out the common taxpayer. Once upon a time we wanted smaller simpler bills in plain language, not these 5000 page Omnibus spending monstrosities! If you recall Republicans were pissed off at the 2000 page Obamacare bill. Seriously I don't care what state you live in or what your political party is, you need to call every one of your representatives and you need to tell them that you will be holding them to accountability.	1608678833.0	ggqp7ok	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqp7ok/

Instead, they tax you more and then give your money away to other people around the world, and you don't even have a say in it.  Fuck the government, dude. They have the audacity to shut down the economy, make it so that you financially struggle while taxing you at the same rate, then give your money to garbage programs in other countries, all while they're getting paid all the same.   Exhibit A of why big government sucks. They pull this crap all the time, and I'm glad that people are finally pissed and realize it.

53knmhf4	Yeah...no. That's not how it works.  Now I haven't read the bill so I don't know what's *specifically* in it - and it wouldn't surprise me one bit to find that it has some fuckery tacked onto it, because that's politics - but to assume that everything that isn't direct, $600 payments to individuals = free handouts to the rich is just ignorant.  Take [the previous, $2 trillion relief act](https://2oqz471sa19h3vbwa53m33yj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/anatomy-of-covid-19-stimulus-package-3.jpg) as an example, the one that contained stimulus payments of $1,200. Look at what was not given to individuals and notice how much of it goes to *places that also need money to stay afloat, that end up giving that money to individuals anyway, e.g. in wages*.  The problem with that act - which may also turn out to be a problem with this bill - is that many large corporations took that stimulus money and just banked it, or used it to finance stock purchases. That was shitty. **But that was their fault**. And many didn't do that. Many used that money for what it was supposed to be for: paying wages and other operational costs. And you'd better believe that small businesses used every penny of those loans to try to keep themselves from going under, which again is exactly what the legislation was for.  So stop making dumb assumptions like the one in the pic and point the finger at the people doing the actual, identifiably shitty things. There's nothing wrong and everything right with [businesses in general] getting [tax money] so that it doesn't have to shut down. That's exactly what government *should* be doing in unprecedented times like these.	1608681949.0	ggqurye	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqurye/

ijg5w	Feel like this is probably gonna be buried but since I didn't see anything too close to top mentioning it already some things to note:  While the $900 billion COVID stimulus bill is woefully inadequate in providing the needed stimulus and support, that bill as a whole isn't too terrible if it hasn't changed much from the latest revisions.  About $200 billion directly to the US people in form of the $600 checks.   Previously it had around $400-$500 billion in aid given to States which is good if you're State is going to handle that money well. I feel most people in this sub can agree that you'd rather have your State government dictating where money is going than Federal. So if you're concerned about that, keep track of how your State is handling it.  Remainder is mostly for "small business support" (won't comment on how appropriately that will be handled as it sounded like the first round for them wasn't all that great). There's also some that should be going to schools and universities, though not sure if the BS provision for most of the funds allocated there being only for schools meeting in person.  As a whole, the actual COVID stimulus package is just woefully inadequate and grievously late. The real atrocity is the $1.2 trillion or so additional BS they tacked onto it at the last minute that included ridiculous things like several hundred billion for foreign nations, military spending, and totally unrelated crap like the questionably worded streaming provision that might make a lot of Twitch streamers felons and a similarly poorly written law making it ambiguous whether or not sharing memes on reddit could land you a $30,000 fine.   Congress was able to bicker over a total of $900 billion stimulus package for months on end but was able to quickly slide in over a trillion dollars worth of extra bullshit at the last minute, only giving lawmakers a handful of hours to vote on the now over 5000 page bill.	1608682198.0	ggqv7ds	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqv7ds/

If they are, they aren't going to hire me because I'll require some training.   $1800/8 months is $7.5/day (if you assume 30 days in a month, obviously not true).

It's been almost a year that we've shut our businesses down and struggled with the disaster that is unemployment, and $1800 is what we've been given to survive on. I understand we're in a pandemic, but this is absolutely unacceptable.

g3fyw	If all of the money went to the taxpayers directly, like $600 per week through Feb 2021, it would create more economic activity, increase consumer confidence scores and maintain credit scores of a great many people.  People in large numbers tend to be smarter than government gives them credit for.    I also believe that if the populace is assured that UI benefits, stimulus checks and other programs are to continue, this may spur the entrepreneurial spirit alive in every American.  Knowing I don't have to worry about paying rent will enable me to spend more time developing a small business.  Knowing if lockdowns will continue will allow businesses to adapt, improvise and overcome.  Not knowing these things will pull the rug right from under us, and send the final nail into the small business coffin.	1608688676.0	ggr76yt	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr76yt/

2ivnjubi	Solution?: GENERAL STRIKE  If the entirety of the United States refused to go to work until our cowardly representatives start to actually represent us - instead of representing the greedy corporations that have made them pets, maybe they would finally care about us. They want to insult us by throwing $600 of our own tax money in our faces? That’s $600 to cover 32 weeks.  That’ $2.68 a day. PEOPLE SHOULD BE OUTRAGED.  Meanwhile, while we starve, lose our homes and die of illness, the wealthy elite line their pockets ONCE AGAIN with our tax money. We continue to pay taxes while the elite pay nothing. Not only do many of the elite pay nothing (or next to nothing), THEY CONSTANTLY PILFER the money the good people in this country pay each year to support the systems put in place to help each other out.  Each year, our military spends an UNGODLY amount of that tax money while most of the men and women protecting us in our military live on food stamps. Our soldiers get next to nothing while filthy rich government contract companies steal all the money in the budget.  Each year billionaires step around the velvet rope of paying taxes while the rest of us are cutting corners to feed ourselves, pay our utilities and keep a roof over our heads while we pay our fair share.  Each year, more and more young people are fed the lie of a college degree being the only way to be successful in life while many (most?) of them will go into debt for a lifetime - all so campuses can get another giant fountain, or an administrator can buy another $100k Mercedes.  Each year the people of the United States pay FAR more for our healthcare services than anywhere else in the world just to be told we need to wait months to be seen, or that our insurances won’t cover that medication, or that ambulance ride to the emergency room is going to put you into debt into your retirement because of bad luck.  Each year millions of Americans - black, white, gay, straight, atheist, christian, jewish, muslim, and everything in between work ourselves to the bone, aid our neighbors when they need help, we volunteer, we vote, we hope, we pray and we wait for a government that will represent us. We wait and have waited for decades - maybe longer.  The unfortunate realization this pandemic has made clear is our government does not represent us. Our leaders do not care about anyone who does not line their pockets.   About 250 years ago Americans joined forces and decided the people that governed them didn’t care about them. They didn’t accept the way they were being treated and they weren’t going to accept being second class citizens any longer. I implore every American reading this to ask yourself if you think your government gives a single thought about you, or any other of the 99 percent of us who aren’t obscenely wealthy.  Just because you, or me, or our neighbors are not billionaires does not mean we do not deserve to be treated like human beings. The only difference that truly matters in the United States is wealth. If we put aside all of our other differences, it’s possible for all of us to be treated with respect. It is for that reason I believe all other faces of division are constantly being thrown in our faces everyday.    We work. We pay taxes and we should be proud of ourselves, our friends and neighbors - when despite having next to nothing ourselves, we still try to give what we can to help each other.   When I was 18, I was paralyzed in a car crash. People I’ve never met came out of nowhere to offer help for no reason and no personal gain. The support given to me and my family by complete strangers has made me believe that most of us are rooting for everyone to succeed. Success is not a finite resource. Success is not and should not be reserved for only the wealthy or the well connected.  We can all be successful and we can all strive to be happy and fulfilled.  We do not need to fight each other for success. We need to fight WITH each other for success.  I believe if the entire nation refused to go to work until a more fair and just stimulus is given to the American people to help us all get back on our feet, I am positive we can work together to force a change that benefits everyone. Not just the people who own our representatives in government.	1608689128.0	ggr7zoa	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr7zoa/

uldj5ih	This is so simplified that its obviously in bad faith. Theres $87 Billion ear marked for k-12 education (which has already allowed my district to postpone furlough fridays). Theres Billions for covid vaccine, Billions for unemployment, money (not sure how much) for increase in SNAP benefits.  I hate when people look at the $1200 or $600  and yell "THATS IT?" Well either you didn't loose your job and the $1800 should be pretty helpful or you did lose your job and you got an extra $600 a week on top of state benefits, that got renewed at a rate of an extra $300 a week after that. That unemployment payout was so good that it actually reduced poverty in the US. Also many states used CARE act funds to help with rent payments and childcare.     The main issue I have is with the PPP loans. They are where the scammers and grifters come in.	1608689279.0	ggr89bm	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr89bm/

3jw61yox	What we need is an extreme response. It's obvious the Congress feels zero need to actually represent their actual constituents. I suggest the following:  1. We vote out every single person that either voted for this or abstained when they come up for reelection, regardless of Party.  2. We blacklist those same people. What do I mean by blacklist? A. They never get voted into office ever again. B. If any politician appoints or hires them for any public office or campaign that person is added to the blacklist. C. If any private company hires them they are immediately boycotted until that person is fired.  3. We insist that congress pass legislation stating that any bill may only include legislation and/or spending for it's stated purpose. This bill was for US citizen pandemic relief. 10 million for gender studies in Pakistan, 3.3 billion for Isreal, and 4 billion for missile defense are obviously not 'pandemic relief'.  4. We insist that legislation be passed stating that once the House of Representatives passes a bill and presents it to the Senate, it either can not be changed or if it IS changed, the House of Representatives must pass it again before it can be passed on to the President.  5. We as Americans need to wake up and realise that the Republicans and Democrats are two wings of the same bird. Republicans are Red, Democrats are Blue, neither one cares about you. Start voting for Libertarians and Greens. I'll note that the person that tweeted this was the Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee.	1608693936.0	ggrgez3	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrgez3/

I believe that you had to be a taxpayer to be eligible for the payment in the first round, and I assume it will be no different in the second round. About 63 million taxpayers made under 100K, with 50 million of those making 75K or less.  Taking all of that into account, the payout total is about 38 billion. I don’t know if having children increases the payout, but if each child was eligible for a full payout, then the total would rise to about 73 billion.	1608696219.0	ggrk954	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrk954/

50w89q9j	I'm liberal and I agree - this is pure bullshit. No one *needs* a new Smithsonian, a tax cut for racehorses or billions in foreign aid right now. We need to help struggling Americans FIRST then see what's left in the budget to allocate. I've been working on the books since I was 14 and this year is the first time I've asked for anything from the government. It wasn't MY choice to close my industry nationwide. I heard Congress gave themselves a pay raise too - wtf???   I'm so hoping people realize this isn't about liberal vs conservative right now. It's ALL of us who work for a living against some very rich people and mega companies that bought our government. It's time for A LOT of politicians on both sides to retire. (And time for us to remind them they work for the people.)	1608697396.0	ggrm6rp	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrm6rp/

Most of the money is going to small businesses and individuals under 75k/yr last year. I agree that $600 isn’t much especially when you live in cities with significantly higher costs of living than most of the US.   Why don’t people like this bill? Is $600 just not enough and that’s all, or are people unhappy with the other provisions?   Side note: why the fuck did this take so long to get done?

ehg5c6	On top of the $600 direct payment there's $300 PER WEEK additional unemployment benefits (on top of regular unemployment) and the paycheck protection program for small businesses that lets employers keep people on payroll by covering their wages. The 3 measures combined are over 500B, just so we have the facts straight... There's a breakdown of the various other bits and bobs here: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/20/details-stimulus-package-omnibus-bill-449499	1608716417.0	ggs8llg	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs8llg/
5z692lat	If they gave every individual their share of the total relief spending instead of giving it to corporations, every American would have received over $20,000.   The only reason they didn't do that was fear people would quit their jobs because they didn't have to work since they got a 20k payout.  The only people quitting their jobs over a payout of that size are people who work jobs where the pay is absolute crap.   They needed the low pay essential workers working to maintain supply chain infrastructure even in high risk sectors, they didn't want to risk a mass walkout even with millions unemployed and losing their jobs.  Having that 20k could have given low wage workers across the nation leverage to get wage gains equal to profit gains in the major growth industries. It would have been like providing people strike money even if they weren't unionized.  But again, only people in the worst paying jobs would leave their job for 20k, for anyone with a decent salary, that isn't more than a few months' pay.  If they had given the money to the people, corporations could have been forced to earn it back - people would have been flush with money to spend, jobs wouldn't have needed to be cut because there would have been lots of people with disposable income.   The whole thing was designed so that low wage workers would have to keep working and being productive but billion dollar corporations could stay afloat without doing anything.	1608716637.0	ggs8spq	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs8spq/

It's better to be poor, without work, without home, and unable to feed our children than it is to be a filthy **SOCIALIST**. Do we WANT America to become Venezuela?!  Us Americans are strong enough we don't need any help, ever. Let the government have all the stimulus money, the population at large will be unhappy, but they will thank us later when capitalism is still in tact. Better dead than red.

a89ab	This is a dangerously uneducated post. The relief bill is outlined [Here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-in-the-900-billion-covid-19-aid-bill-11608557531) for those that want to check the math, and [Here is the official bill summary](https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/89c1f304-ee67-43a4-94cd-a92b5300cc97/note/82ef320c-ffd8-40ed-8eaa-0b43367f8191.#page=1) for those who don't trust wsj? It is true that giving each household $600 only amounts to 166 billion, but that wasn't the only purpose of the bill. The bill is a comprehensive relief package for the nation, including $325 billion set aside specifically for small businesses, another $12 billion for small community banks, aid to postal service, train service, and public schools. There is much more in the bill, but you get the picture. Money isn't missing. Liberals won't take us seriously if we can't learn to fact check.   The vast majority of the money is going to help small businesses. That is a win right?	1608747165.0	ggtgphu	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggtgphu/

x3dk7	You know, if Americans were supported the right way from the start, we could have been way more successful at containing this thing. If small businesses got the relief they need from the get go, people wouldn’t have worried about losing their businesses and if the people didn’t have to worry about paying rent, bills, and putting food on the table, they would have been more understanding of mask mandates.   Instead our representatives decided to play with American lives and livelihoods while they sat back and got paid their full salaries and argued like petulant children while millions of Americans suffered and died. Then have the audacity to say “$600 is a lot of most families”.   They made the pandemic political when it never should have been political and failed to protect the American people meanwhile they made rules for thee and not me.   I’m sick of it.

7j4tg14f	This is not just a stimulus bill. It’s also the usual end-of-year omnibus bill, which contains military spending and funding to keep the government open. You can debate the merits of these types of bills, but at the end of the day Trump is letting Americans starve by not signing this particular bill, and I would submit that ignoring a bill like this or vetoing it during a pandemic is literally the opposite of what is needed at this point.  Donald Trump is possibly the worst president of all time, and literally every single screw-up is consciously self-inflicted. I have never seen a president in my entire life whose every instinct whilst governing is exactly wrong.	1609080340.0	gh6scy6	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/gh6scy6/
6y5tf	I’m not defending this 8,000+ secretive “Care” package.  Want to be clear.   There is a need for small business support which is regulated to ensure it maintains payrolls which is part of this bill. But we need oversight and transparency to ensure this round doesn’t go to primarily large corporations (like last time).   It is encouraging to see this on /r/conservative. This really is bipartisan. As a small business owner with employees and a partner who is an experienced corporate attorney, we were able to get relief in the last relief program. It was a complex process that very few small businesses Could reasonable do. So, must of the funds went to corporations that could afford a legal accounting team to get it done.  And the oversight was non existent.   In the next four year, dems are in control of the house and White House, maybe the senate depending on GA. My hope for the country is that conservatives can be vocal about their concerns and policy positions while trying to create change instead of supporting Mitch and his clear agenda to be obstructionist. Supporting conservative policy does not require demonizing the opposition. Term limits, transparency, bipartisan relief and rebuilding the economy, there are clear issues where common ground can be found if both sides demand it. The opposition politics only really serves the career politicians who don’t want to have to work (at least out in the open).	1609098437.0	gh7oovl	t3_kibtqm	t3_kibtqm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/gh7oovl/

Some to pharma to develop the vaccines.  Some for PPE.  Some to manufacture shit like ventilators.

The answer was yes.   So, as a politician, despite a clear and present conflict of interest, it is NOT ILLEGAL to vote on that legislation.   The amount of money that flows into the bank accounts of politicians for towing the party line is fucking ridiculous.  They literally benefit from making people's lives financially harder.

3cjbruja	The fear of 'class warfare' is exactly why politicians get to wage class warfare on us unstopped. It's like how any government program rich people don't like they just label socialism, regardless of any real connection to a socialist design.  Here's Mike Pence today: "[Democrats] want to make rich people poorer, and poor people more comfortable."  Does making poor people more comfortable sound like something that's actually a bad ideal? Which side of the fence do you come down on, fellow redditor? Are you on the rich side or the poor side? Because this so called representative just declared war on one of those sides and it's the side that helped elect him in the first place.   What happened to the promise that we'd get a new healthcare plan that would cover everyone and be better than obamacare? That was a campaign promise. What happened to Trump saying he wanted a stimulus even bigger than the $3 trillion stimulus proposed by democrats? These people aren't for small government. They're for very big government and mostly as a tool to extract wealth from the majority and give it to the very small rich minority.

I’m just trying to understand what I am seeing in this comment section.

Y’all literally vote for people that don’t even try and hide their favoritism of the ultra wealthy over the working class, so seeing y’all be upset about this issue is just really wild to me. Also I see that many people are also upset at Israel getting all that money. Y’all should really research the politicians you vote for, bc this reality is a direct result of how y’all vote.

Once elected (upon lies told by them, and believed by us), they rig the system in their favor to get re-elected by polling which counties / jurisdictions which will guarantee them a win again. And then set up the demographics in their favor. And reject any legislature that puts term limits on their position. The system is rigged and until we change it by force, it will stay the same. It's called war. Revolution.  I'm down, but most aren't. All it would take is 20-30 officials being killed for the rest to flop and do the right thing.

Imagine if they kept both of those parts.  I'm a Berniecrat and think this bill is horseshit. You either use tax money to help the people who need it or you don't collect it.

You've been used, mistreated, deceived, abused, lied to, manipulated and left for dead..  isn't it about time to give up this team worship of an ideology and help us shut down the folks that made the world a slice of hell for us all?  The Republicans are not of your party anymore.  They haven't been for years.  They are the friend you think you knew holding the dagger behind their back. Socialism is actually the only way to heal the nation.  Reduce the wealth gap and get us back on track to be a successful and free nation that you all wanted originally.  You can argue profits and capitalism later.. right now those you think are successful are really just the ones willing to trade you and the soul of this nation for a quick buck.  Siding with them is going to destroy this country quicker than you'd believe.  We don't have to be friends.

7s619	I’m not a conservative, I come here to read and I tend to find things/comments I agree with most every visit. There are plenty of things I disagree with in this sub, but once the Trump cultism nonsense is out of the way, I tend to find a lot more valid points from people I would consider “true conservatives”.   With that said, I don’t understand the brigading and downvotes. Reddit is definitely left leaning and I would be considered far left by many in this sub but I don’t auto downvote things just because I’m in this sub. I really don’t downvote anything at all because it makes no sense to enter a sub that you don’t necessarily align with, just to downvote everything.  It would help if more folks took the time to listen to other perspectives. I think we’d find that we’re all equally displeased with our government and if we harnessed that anger, as a group, we could make major changes. But, that means people need to be willing to compromise and we are (Americans in general) simply unwilling to make concessions, for the sake of making progress, at the moment.   We should all be angry with our government, it’s failing all of us, they don’t care what political party you align with, infighting is a distraction from the rape, pillage and plunder of the American people by the government and wealthy elite. The more I read, the more I focus on classism as the issue.

(Not positive on the number but 75k after taxes is more like 45k take home. That $600 wouldn’t even pay for a motel for 1 month. Plus they are giving it to people who didn’t even lose their jobs. It’s like a treat for allowing the government to keep everything shut down.

6nijl1hv	I have to say, this $600 payment is not even close to the only stimulus money being given to Americans. The issue here is that in addition to the $900B covid stimulus package, congress ALSO passed an omnibus spending package to fund the government through 2021. THAT package has tons of funding for other countries and nonsense that has nothing to do with covid or Americans at all. Which is fucked given the timing, but Cohens argument here doesn’t make any sense. You can look up all the stuff in the covid bill, from the $600 checks to unemployment extensions, PPP funding etc, etc. We need to make sure we’re arguing against the right things here, and Cohen isn’t.	1608676209.0	ggqkafl	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq0w95	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqkafl/

Like this is scary scummy how our government is in such a fucked up state of disarray where instead of fucking worrying about the people struggling they want to make them struggle more and half of them are still trying to prove that the president-elect isn't the fucking president-elect.	1608687752.0	ggr5j9k	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq0w95	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr5j9k/

What incentive is there to be responsible and save money for 1) to get through hard times and/or 2) buy out a struggling business that wasn't as responsible, if the government is just going to give away money and keep the successful businesses from buying up the ones that failed by propping them up.

People aren't traveling as much, and airline companies can't afford to do scheduled maintenance and other such things, on aircraft that aren't flying.	1608705969.0	ggry0j6	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq0gzj	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggry0j6/

3t2h1occ	The money going to other countries is called foreign aid. It's not a part of the COVID relief bill, it's a part of the omnibus federal funding bill the Democrats were forced to attach the COVID relief bill to since Republicans don't want to help.  USAID busts their ass off and has to justify each program's economic and geopolitical value to the US before getting approval and their funding is only 1% of the budget. The biggest program Trump whined about (military aid for Egypt) is only 0.1% of the total omnibus bill. Most of their programs make more money for the US than we give in increased trade and improved bilateral ties, yet mouth-breathing racists love to pretend it's people in Pakistan's fault the GOP wants them to stay homeless.

N/A	What are you talking about?  A large portion of us don't want *any* bailouts, particularly when it's all borrowed money from our future selves... or more to the point, from whoever is unlucky enough to be elected in a couple years.  Should the federal government collect and redistribute money to various localities?  Sure.  Should they invent money to do it?  Not so sure.    $15billion for the entertainment industry?  Oh, you mean the *essential* industry that's received all kinds of waivers and exceptions during even the worst of the pandemic?  The guys filming movies and sitcoms at the same time I'm not allowed to see my family?  That industry?  $45billion for the transportation industry?  Would that be the same one who got $25billion already, and still laid everyone off?  That one?  Expanding rural broadband is great.  How about we actually pay for it and not sneak it in here?  82billion for schools... are property taxes going unpaid?  In my narrow experience, they will be collected, either in dollars (from the current owner or the next) or via seizure.    $10billion for childcare, except it's "$10billion for childcare *providers.*"  I wouldn't argue that their businesses haven't suffered.  I'm just not too keen on throwing money at the people who A. charge people 2x the already exorbitant amount they charged last fall, and B. who cancelled this, cancelled that, cancelled the other thing, cancelled almost everything - all with no refunds - leaving people to then find *someone else* to pay to watch their kids.  But forget all of that.  The outrage comes from hearing "we're going to save *you,*" then having everything *but* done.	1608671341.0	ggqaau5	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq12to	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqaau5/

The Social Security piece you speak to actually gets split up into many, many helpful grants and services for people, including pregnant women and children. It’s a block grant given to each state, and that state has to match $3 to every $4 received each year to continue to be funded.   But I don’t disagree with you, it’s confusing and there’s a lot of funds that I’m unsure how or why they were allocated...

go3sk	A populist movement is when people with different ideologies come together on issues that regular people on both sides think is bullshit.          If we can work together to drain the swamp of these political hacks, we can go back to our normal programming of arguing about how much we pay in taxes and what Social programs we want to support or fight over.          The sad thing is Donald Trump is the populist leader. He's not a conservative, he likes spending money. He's definitely not a Democrat. But most on both sides could agree on things he was doing like getting out of wars, creating peace in the middle east, and strengthening our economy.         Unfortunately the media shoved Russia hoaxes and impeachment hearings down our throats for 4 years, distracting everyone. What a shame.

yjlvrg8	I think its double-sided. Sure, who doesnt want more free money? But i think its more about where exactly the *rest* of the money is going. Sending 10mil to pakistan for example isnt something im pleased with. A stimulus package should be directed at helping the American people. Sounds selfish i know. But our government pisses money away like its nothing. I would like to see them piss it away on our own citizens at the very least.

I do agree however it seems like the more beholden politicians are to winning a reelection the more they are trying to get corporate backing lobbyists backing donor backing etc.  The problem is you want them to be accountable so you make them when a reelection but then they just pander to corporate interests and big donor interests.    In my opinion you need some kind of system where they can be replaced easily and quickly for doing stupid stuff. It sounds silly but something like electing two people and having one be in the acting position then at the end of every year have some kind of performance review or both of confidence.

deyd9	I find it suspicious. There have been many worse cases of blatant handouts to the ultrarich from the average citizens just the past year. Like one trillion dollar or thereabouts of reduced taxation on ultrarich, or the first covid bailout that was predominantly used to give funds to the billionaire class.  I mean, I am happy as anyone else to see that American underclass is not completely brainwashed yet, but it makes ya wonder, what made this one so special out of all the other times Americans have had less fortunate citizens financially abused, or even just plain killed to help billionaires get a couple million more.  No idea, just wondering out loud. I figure I'll read the reason in the news in a month or so but for now, it's an intriguing mystery.	1608679980.0	ggqrafo	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqf8ph	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqrafo/

dc7rj	This happened at the end of the Bush administration. Both sides had united under a single angry banner.  Then Obama took power - and the country lost it's shit over identity politics for 12 years (The right and the left).  Meanwhile all the same problems persisted. The rich in this country sat back and laughed while they used their media machines to intensify these stupid conflicts. Republicans voted for an absolute shit bag who personified all of the worst aspects of the things the left feared and offered no solutions to the underlying problems that caused these people to vote for an outsider in the first place - further dividing the country.  Now we are witnessing a scenario that a good leader would have had prepared for and implemented solutions for, but instead we had no leadership, leading to "both sides" trying to pick up the pieces in congress and the senate in an environment struck by the divisiveness they advocated and intensified because they thought it would gain them votes - and only led to an ineffective government.   We deserve this.  But seeing both sides come together - AGAIN - would be great... as long as we don't find ourselves turned against one another by the powers that be, again.   Looking at how people are calling Biden a Chinese communist sympathizer rather than an empty vessel, corporate shill - only fuels my doubt.	1608700517.0	ggrqymd	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqf8ph	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrqymd/

4yj8w91g	I'm about to send some very strongly-worded emails as well. Next would be to call, which I think might get their attention a bit faster. I'm angry and beyond outraged, and I only take solace in that outrage over this issue is pretty uniform across the board, so at least I don't feel like my reaction is unjustified.  The audacity to think $600 is enough after months of no action is beyond me. What problem are they trying to solve exactly with this $600 "stimulus" check? Buying a family food for a month? What about the other months we were left jobless and stranded? What about rent and utilities? You'd think the bill didn't have enough money to cover more, but **they could've sent $600/mo for 6 months to all working Americans (approx. 165 million) and still had $180 billion left over**.  And by the way, why is the norm to be nice and respectful to your representatives? I'm not talking about breaking common sense and basic human decency (please don't threaten or hurt anyone), but when I mess up at work my boss let's me know in no uncertain terms that I fucked up. Do these fuckers not work for us any more? I'm leaving no room for interpretation in my messages.  For the sake of full disclosure, I'm not a conservative... I'm more of a left-leaning centrist if anything. But Conservatives, I'm 100% with you and I stand by you. And for the record, my emails (and calls) are going to my (R) House rep as well as my (D) Senators. This isn't a right v. left issue; this is an abhorrent, disrespectful slap in the face to all working Americans.

30om7qlq	I agree, the 2 party system is dumb and causes way too many problems. Thing is, it's also a natural consequence of our simple majority elections.  The win condition in American politics is getting 50%+1 (usually). If that's the case, all of the significant political groups are going to fuse into 2 big groups.  In the US we have 2 political labels that both cover a broad range of different ideas, 'progressives' and 'conservatives,' Democrat and Republican. Though members of each party agree on some general issues, there are still different 'factions' within each group (the Freedom Caucas, the more liberal democrats, Black, Hispanic caucases, etc.) If all of these factions decided "Screw this, we're gonna make our own party," no one would ever win 50%+1 of the vote on their own. For example, even if you're a Marxist who hates capitalism with all their being, it would be more politically sensible to support the most liberal candidate that also has enough support to win an election. They may not destroy the capitalist system, but they'll probably be more sympathetic to your ideas than a Republican.   The 2 party system is clunky, stupid, and helps create an illusion of extreme disagreement and partisanship in America (not that it doesn't exist, but the 2 party system definitely doesn't help. It completely ignores the political diversity of the US by turning the political spectrum into a binary. But the rules kind of force everyone to join either side.   A lot of countries with parliaments use proportional representation: to oversimplify, if you get X% of the vote, you get X% of seats in parliament. You see way more distinct political parties in those countries. But even then you start to see 2 major parties form, though they're not as stable as the US's 2 parties. Also, the party that ends up winning the most seats, but doesn't get 50%+1, have to negotiate with other parties to create a coalition. So if one party wins 40% of all seats in parliament, they would have to negotiate with other parties to get that additional 10%+1 if they want to pass any legislation.

14eywgy2	I have been saying this (that it's an illusion and most of us are closer together than the media tries to portray) for years. If you haven't already, check out the 9axes political quiz. I'm moderate on most issues (so I'm not exactly "liberal" or "conservative".. it varies depending on the issue), and it was eye opening. There's just so much more to politics than "left vs right." At the end of the day, we are all Americans in this country, and we need to make decisions based on facts and what we rationally believe is best for the country. We need to discuss issues rather than attacking each other. Point out when ideas are stupid rather than when people are stupid. Pressure your chosen political party with emails and phone calls. Make your voice heard. Simply choosing teams and then never contacting a representative is a major part of what's wrong with our country.	1608684280.0	ggqz380	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqdp8p	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqz380/

Our country isn’t about GOP vs Dems, left vs right, etc. At this point I truly feel like it’s us (the American people) vs them (the entire government). I feel like it’s all some sick scripted WWE wrestling match to keep us divided. They slap as many labels on people as they can (black, white, brown, gay, Christian, Muslim, trans etc.) and then use the MSM/social media to cause division and hate towards one another while they carry on doing whatever they want with our country. It’s time for Americans to start showing some love to one another and accept that differences are ok , and start focusing our attention on what our government is doing.

8derj	for about 15 years (i am 34) when talking politics and mention american "democracy" being fake, i earned a lot of weird responses for the first 4-5 years, but step by step these responses almost stopped, at least here in europe.  Especially the amount of people still beliving in america bringing freedom and democracy to other places got pretty upset.  but as information is more and more available to anyone, i see the this shifting towards reality and people start to realize. even a lot of those beliving in america as world police (mostly older folks that had 30 years of cold war burned into their brains) start to see how those wars are just about money / power / resources.  It seems now also americans start to wake up.   The western world needs america to be a real functioning democracy. so please americans - DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!!!   Please get freaking healthcare, get rid of lobbyist and tax your rich people properly.  Basically you just needed sanders to get on track, but your media did a good job of constantly discrediting him, same as done to the pirate party in germany for example like 10-15 years ago.   Turn of the TV, start using your brain, i am sure you can do it!  Maybe you have the chance to be as you so proudly state the greatest country on this planet, but dont make the mistake to think you still are, you are from it.   Right now all i see is a war mongering nation with people to stupid to realize how they are getting abused by their own system.

5pev93mj	This is what is getting me. I have been so screwed over both times now. My daughter (F21) was a dependent on my taxes last year while in college. She moved into her own place late February. The pandemic hit and the $1200 was based on the 2019 taxes when she was still a dependent even though she was working part time. But 2020 she is NOT a dependent. She had her hours cut because of the pandemic so I gave her the $1200 since she did not qualify to her her own.   I also have a son who is 17 and is in his senior year of high school. I get nothing for him either check, yet he lives at home and is in high school?  I have not been able to work my second job due to the pandemic, but I don’t qualify for unemployment and we are hurting. Once again I will see zero because my daughter will not get one at all and my 17 year old does not count?   I don’t understand the concept of not including dependents? If they do not get their own and parents/caregivers don’t qualify that is quite a bit of money pocketed someplace else.	1608703629.0	ggrv7xi	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq9w61	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrv7xi/

7dwbe3ed	The vast majority of taxpayers don't even pay enough for the government to break even on them. The top 1% pays almost 40% of taxes, the next 9% pays about 30% of all taxes, and the bottom 90% pays around 30% of all income taxes. A couple making $150K or less is below the 90th percentile. *almost* everyone getting this bump is contributing less than they're taking out. I say *almost* because depending on 401k contributions and such you can have a much higher income and still get your AGI under 150k.  Of they make it too generous then some people who *can* work *won't*.  Also, I'm pretty sure it's meant to stick it to hgh tax states. In CA or NY why not pressure your state and local reps to drop programs and stop charging 10% rates? I moved from a high tax state to a lower tax state and got a HUGE raise once. It was nearly 10% of my income for moving fewer than 5 miles.

Im doing well but if I wasn't sure I can't get evicted but of every month $2k gets added to a bill to be due next year and I wasn't working them im still getting evicted just later. Because if someone isn't working how are they going to come up with 12k 6 months from now?  They should be covering all mortgage payments and in doing so also instruct courts to not take into account any past due balance for covid months.   They could make forgiven mortgage payments loans that are forgiven at a later time based on income. In other words if you use the program to get relief for your personal mortgage but tax returns show you worked the whole pandemic you need to pay the money back.	1608692623.0	ggre7cy	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq6wgm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggre7cy/

kuxrg	It just pisses me off.  I turned 24 this year, but was not eligible for CARES money because it was based on 2019 taxes and my parents claimed me in that year (even though I can prove I paid more than 50% of my expenses, I let them claim me to keep the peace while I finished my degree).  Since tax season, I've been laid off, unable to qualify for unemployment in my state due to not making enough in the first place (which was actually enough to pay for my food, car, bills, and tuition), and have received jack shit from these stimulus packages.  I expect to receive nothing from this either.  My savings have pretty much dried up.  $600 would buy me a couple more months.      I'll get over it, I just finished my degree after having decided to focus on getting decent grades instead of working, and am now looking for a job.  It's just incredibly annoying that the way to qualify for all these entitlement programs is to sit on your lazy ass and do nothing, while those who are actually trying to work things out get screwed.  I don't like entitlement programs as it is, but I hate the fact that I pay taxes that pay for them and I can't benefit from them if I get into a situation where I could use it.	1608679743.0	ggqquyx	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq2ckj	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqquyx/

N/A	I bought a house this year and moved out of my parents after 5 years of post college, full time work in my field of study (Finance). Because I was living under my parents roof last year they claimed me as a dependent...at 27 years old (I did see a good chunk of that cash but don't tell Uncle Sam).  Anyways, I didn't and won't get a stimulus check this year because of this.  Oh well, I'd rather it go to people in need anyways. I didn't need the $1,200, I don't need the $600 and I am forever fortunate and grateful to be in that position, but then again I pay thousands in taxes per year so shouldn't I be entitled to *something*? I've never been on unemployment, never taken SS, never enrolled in social programs or food stamps. What the hell am I paying for?  And don't tell me it's the roads I drive on, because the roads around here look like a fucking construction site that closed down operations about 25 years ago...	1608671849.0	ggqbak9	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq5vur	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqbak9/

Guys, we are in a recession, we aren't exactly on the same boat, fine, but we are really close to you.  Try to sell your stuff in a recession because you lost your job as well and can't find any. Either you won't find a buyer or you will have to basically sell for peanuts. And a recession like this isn't something of short term.  Thank God I'm also a money saver, i was ready to empty my 10 years old saving to cover loans (just a new car (the only huge useless expense) and a cheap house) without a job. (This is the only difference, we may, be able to survive a little longer)  I'm lucky enough to get another job that cover everything, now I'm trying to do what those with more money should do in such situations: spend their money in the community.	1608684244.0	ggqz0ce	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggq5vur	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqz0ce/

5nxle	If you're really interested, it's part of soft power in geopolitics. You provide aid to other countries to build goodwill so that you have greater leverage in global affairs.   It started with the Marshall Plan post WW2 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan#:~:text=The%20Marshall%20Plan%20(officially%20the,end%20of%20World%20War%20II.  You rebuild other countries and they grow in the image of America and support American interests globally. It is what allows America to intervene in global affairs and most nations to say, "eh, go ahead." Now, we haven't actually been good stewards of our soft power in recent years, part of having a reviled leader and all that, but it still has been useful. For instance, if we had better used our soft power in recent years, we may have been better able to put the squeeze on Russia and China.	1608687719.0	ggr5h53	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqlli6	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr5h53/

5bpqq	The entertainment industry is more than tv/film. It's also the music industry, theater, dance, sports, monster trucks,  etc. There's also a lot of cross over with conventions and trade shows. California did consider TV/film people "essential workers", but only if they followed protocols for social distancing. That said, TV/film companies aren't going to run a set (or a show) without covering their asses, as most insurance policies don't cover pandemics.          Sets (and drive-ins) figured out how to operate by taking on the huge expense of being compatible with Covid procedures - hiring Covid Compliance Supervisors staff, spending tons on PPE and sanitizers, routinely testing all their staff, making them sign waivers, risking call-outs, etc. Only big companies can afford that cost.  And there's [a limit to how much sets can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIuFBdwWKsI).    The concert industry and festival industry is particularly fucked, because large gatherings aren't allowed. You can't socially distance a show. You can't run concerts at 20% capacity, it's just not designed that way. 10-12 million people in live events got furloughed or laid off. Not every venue has the capacity to run a drive-in outside in their parking lot. Independent venues, independent entertainment companies, small businesses, etc, are all hurting. I think Texas has lost nine small venues so far? Portland, OR, is projected to lose 90% of their independent venues. These businesses have no money coming in, but still have expenses.       Basically, it sucks. It sucks a lot. Supporting entertainment -especially independent companies - keeps it on life support to prevent more loss, allowing businesses to endure longer. This will in the end will retain more jobs, retain wages, and get people off unemployment faster. And, it will hopefully get the entertainment industry up running sooner. Kind of hard to do when all the companies and staff you relied on are gone.	1608715477.0	ggs7qqq	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqaau5	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs7qqq/

Cities have invested tons into the theaters and they're part of the city infistrucure. You let all these companies fall you can say goodbye to a lot of live entertainment when all this is over.

This bill isn't just intended to be COVID aid but also gov funding, since congress once again has failed to pass a timely annual federal budget.   Like I work for one of the agencies he listed (NASA) and if that part wasn't included in the funding package, me and everyone else at NASA would be immediately out of a job, and would also fall behind on Trump's moon landing plans, amongst many other critical missions that are going on. And then there's all the other agencies that would also be affected if they weren't funded.

I suppose we could say that facing an emergency we have decided to cut our foreign aid spending to focus on domestic needs. I think that's a reasonable discussion to have.

I'll bet Monopoly Air will be a great ride, what with there being no competition and all. And did we expect average american individuals to have bootstrap savings? An American who became unemployed in March this year due to the pandemic so far is entitled to: $1200 Stimulus check, 600/week expanded unemployment for three months ($7200, in addition to state unemployment), an additional 300/week unemployment per Trump executive order($900), a second $600 stimulus check, and another three months expanded unemployment at 300/week ($3600).

4a9gew1x	Hope I don’t come off as rude but you seem to be parroting talking points that in reality don’t make sense. It’s gonna be a long comment so stay with me,  1. First “defund the police” is an activist slogan not a democrat party slogan. Second Republicans have defunded police when they refused to fund [local governments ](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/how-mitch-mcconnell-defunding-police/612856/). Instead of putting that defunded  money in the hands of mental health or crisis training like “the left” wants the Republican senate has used it as a tax break to the wealthy   2.I’m trying to figure out why you think universal healthcare is bad during a pandemic especially ? A lot of people have lost their jobs and therefore their healthcare. So if they’re going back to work they’re probably going to a low paying job/ part time work considered essential with high risk of exposure and if they do end up in the hospital due to the pandemic their families will have ridiculous medical bills....That doesn’t affect one specific demographic that affects everyone.   3. Poor uneducated unskilled immigrants pick all of our produce and food....and most of them paid more US taxes than the President. We are the most wealthy country on earth and dems know there is tons of money to go around but we’re funneling that money to rich people and the military bc of people like McConnell. Frankly you’re pointing your finger in the wrong direction if you’re feeling like there isn’t enough to go around.   4. BLM: Black people want equal protection under the law. That’s it.   Let’s round out that point....Most politicians over the age of 65 ( a huge portion) went to segregated schools. They’re making the rules. what type of world outlook do you have if you’ve never interacted with someone who doesn’t look related to you? What type of laws would you write if you’ve never heard of the [Tulsa Massacre](https://www.tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/) and others like it, or the thousands of domestic terrorism events that took place during many people’s who are still alive lifetimes with lynching. If that wasn’t and still isn’t in your history books. That wasn’t that long ago. You can twist it all you want and say you don’t like the methods they’re using but what options do you have when you’re a minority voting block who are unable to control the narrative that comes across the media? For perspective MLK was NOT liked when he was alive. The person who shot him thought he was doing everyone a favor. A lot of what he did angered moderates.   Maybe you’re nice person and have a hard time imagining this. But a lot of people go through the 6 weeks of training to become a police officer so they can harass people and have a power trip. Think about what type of person that profession attracts. You’re not getting paid a lot, you may not have a college degree so you might not be the brightest in your class but it’s a well enough respected profession. So you’re either a public servant who likes helping your community or you’re someone who thinks it’s like many of the tv shows with bad guys every week and you’re the hero when in actuality you’re just harassing specific people consciously or subconsciously based off the media you consume who says who or who isn’t a criminal.... You may think that’s ridiculous but a lot of the officers in these national cases have been fired/ moved around/  complaints of them using excessive force prior to the big one. They are the hero in their story. Besides why should they police themselves? No other industry serving the general public does.  Anyway I hope this offered some perspective to you on why the left has the positions it has.	1608723792.0	ggsfgg1	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggs3fl3	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggsfgg1/

6zumx9k1	True, if our system (broadly speaking) in the USA was capitalism, per se, then you'd be right. I think I was pointing to the fact that our system here is not capitalism, but rather a warped form of capitalism in which government, the public treasury, and the markets are so inextricably intertwined resulting in deeply embedded corruption and influence-peddling. So, the outcomes are also "warped" -- one example being large sums of public funds going to enrich politically connected companies and other organizations. It's so embedded now that the system is continued and empowered by both liberals and conservatives and both D's and R's. The most common phrase that might come to mind is "The Military-Industrial Complex" and it points to just one manifestation of the corruption.  A lot of smart folks out there (political scientists and the like) are saying we are better described now as a Plutocracy and kleptocracy as opposed to a capitalist democratic-republic. I think I agree with that assessment at this point, sadly.	1608836078.0	ggx6geh	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrk04f	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggx6geh/

j1u0b	[Here’s a list](https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/02/rapequotes.jpg) of things that (at the time) prominent Republicans have said regarding rape. Some of them are arguably just ignorant claims regarding rape, pregnancy and abortion. But numbers 1, 3 and 6 are simply repugnant; 6 essentially tries to justify sexual assault. [Here](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/personal-foul/) is the fact checking on Snopes confirming that they did say these things.  Before you make the (technically accurate) remark that the politicians said these things, not the voters, no one on the right ever called them out and rebuked them. Silence signals agreement, or at best indifference.  I don’t think that’s a majority opinion on the right. But there are people in your number who are open with their opinions that rape is sometimes justifiable. Even if caveats apply. And the rest of you have a tendency to ignore them instead of shutting them down.  You also voted for a president who admitted, on recording, to sexual assault. So there’s that.	1608716554.0	ggs8q12	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggs7z3b	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs8q12/

pwyy1	Modern tanks?  Seriously?  What the hell does a “modern” tank do — shoot off 105mm shells of American $100 bills to weaken the underpinnings of insurgency?  What are tanks even used for anymore?  I’m sure they have a purpose still, but considering our last two longterm engagements have been basically counterinsurgency campaigns they’re starting to look as much like relics from a bygone era as mounted cavalry did a century ago.    The enormous engagements of massive conventional, sovereign state armies isn’t a prime national security motivator anymore; we’ve meaningfully fought *one* of those in the last fifty years and it was a total rout.  Continuing to plan for that kind of warfare is planning for the future based on the past, and that *never* works well long-term in warfare.	1609472998.0	gho8poi	t3_kibtqm	t1_ghmmjsd	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/gho8poi/

yxbu9	Californian here, term limits are terrible. Politicians have no oversight and pass bills without regard to any down stream impact. Then when the bills cause issues they aren’t in office anymore to be held accountable. Further, they’re always campaigning for their next job and really don’t give a damn about the needs of constituents. Not that this is soo different from what congressional members do but if you want to see the poster child for why term limits are a bad idea, just check out California	1609688083.0	ghyl3qd	t3_kibtqm	t1_ghsi9vr	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ghyl3qd/

21gkgujy	Unfortunately I'm not surprised, you'd have to be an absolute moron to not be cognizant of how bad people have been shit talking Democrats for "blocking aid bills", if they blocked this one too they'd be beyond demonized, they'd be chased off the hill with pitch forks and torches, even if this bill still had some unsavory chapters tucked in there.    Their biggest argument point for not letting the past ones in was the immunity for employers who risk their employees, and the Republicans went ahead and agreed on a version without that this time. Without that major moral point to disagree with, it would be career suicide to not agree to pass this one, unfortunately. Not so much for the Republican side, but especially so for the Democrat side.    Don't get me wrong, at this point both sides are equally nothing but corporate shills, and I find them close to being equally repugnant, but the votes for or against this bill are pretty predictable at this point in time. Very nearly all of the bill *is* going for something directly useful to the country and it's economy, and maybe 100b or less, maybe closer to 50b or less, could arguably be for the rich cronies and donors, which by the standards of past stimulus bills is shockingly altruistic.	1608681540.0	ggqu2dz	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqf2qk	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqu2dz/

4dl0xlk9	Some are unhappy about Government spending money it doesn’t have.  Some are mad that its a 5,000+ page $900 billion BS bill with PLENTY of unrelated items beyond COVID relief.  Some are mad that it only offers $600/person in direct payments and is seen as another wealth transfer to the rich.  Tough to get a consensus.  I personally do not agree with much Government intervention (small gov’t and all) but situations like a national pandemic warrant direct payments to citizens (and direct payments only).  I would be okay spending $900 billion (or 1.8t) to send to American citizens.  The fact that government is so powerful allows for situations like this (corporate welfare disguised as covid relief) to occur in the first place	1608687384.0	ggr4vmn	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqykui	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr4vmn/

People deserve a chance for real representation, not just a choice between one of two massive propaganda machines that represents nothing but one or a handful of each person's actual beliefs.  Two parties nationally is just ridiculous and doesn't represent most of us, and I think has been radicalizing people on both sides, when most Americans, outside of external influences and during private conversations with friends would be able to understand each other.

McConnell will really determine if this passes because if he puts it up for a vote it’s suicide to vote against it for some Republicans.

36jlio8w	They're not "leftist" at all. Leftism means opposition to capitalism. Saying "leftist corporation" is like calling someone a "communist republican".  What actually happens is that people who feel powerless in the political sphere, i.e. minority groups and their allies, turn their attention to policing culture where they feel like they can at least make a dent. Then corporations try to reflect this in their brand identity, marketing etc. out of simple profit motive and risk aversion. Instead of meaningful change we get ceos tweeting about blm and pride month at hyundai. Believe me, the left rolls their eyes about this too.

Overall, yeah Democrats are fucking corporate whores as well. But in this specific instance, regarding the main issue, it was conservatives who were licking corporate boots.     I suggest you actually look into the bills put forth by the House and Senate respectively and decide which is more friendly to the average person.	1608675693.0	ggqj6ew	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqbrf0	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqj6ew/

That right there is a major problem and a sign of societal stratification that is tearing us apart.  The second thing is obviously the lack of col adjustment is meant to target the rural red areas.

Our tax rate is not that high, especially for [someone making 75k.](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator#dTxI00mjh9)  However, completely agree. 75k is peanuts in California. We need a shutdown with legitimate help for the people. They can just tax everyone on the backend if someone took more than they needed.

6qtz2	> Oh well, I'd rather it go to people in need anyways. I didn't need the $1,200, I don't need the $600 and I am forever fortunate and grateful to be in that position, but then again I pay thousands in taxes per year so shouldn't I be entitled to something? I've never been on unemployment, never taken SS, never enrolled in social programs or food stamps. What the hell am I paying for?  Show me the factual evidence that the reason people who make above the income cutoff can't get it is because there's not enough money to go around. I'm as fiscally conservative as it comes, the guy always blabbing about the national debt, etc, but even I can understand it's not a "We don't have the ability to spend another $X billion for everyone to get a stimulus check". American's on both sides are hardwired to think that it's a zero sum game, if everyone got $1200 or $600, and say that a total of $300 billion was to pay people making over $75k, there will be someone who makes less than that thinking "that guy makes $75k a year, he doesn't need the money as much as I do, if we didn't give him $1200 then I would have gotten more".   The president literally offered to sign this exact stimulus bill up to $1.8 trillion and republicans would have basically just got in line, but in this case a small handful of politicans on the left decided it would be more politically beneficial to wait and then make it smaller because they likely want to give Biden a big "Accomplishment" by passing another similar sized stimulus his first days in office. GOP does the same shit working against programs that would clearly help american's less on the lines of it being an actually bad program, but more because they don't want the Dem. in the white house to get credit for stuff, but don't for a second tell me that they couldn't have made this package larger, given more people stimulus, or shit keep the income caps but give people $2,000 instead of $1200 the first time, fuck give them $10,000, at this point the size of these stimulus bills going up or down a hundred billion or so is just a rounding error.  > What the hell am I paying for?  and people wonder why Trump's "drain the swamp" message resonated with a lot of working class people, despite him being a brash, childish, billionaire from NYC?	1608681342.0	ggqtpvs	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqbak9	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqtpvs/

452mbl8x	Are you talking in this bill? Because I’m talking about in this bill.   Also, the Kennedy Center is literally a part of the federal government, one of the few that generates its own profits. Keeping it open will actually *save* the government money. Why do you have to be like this, why can’t you be honest?  Edit: While I don’t support adding so many provisions to this bill, especially so late they could never be noticed before this bill was passed, I do happen to support the gender programs in Pakistan and military funding for Egypt after reading more about what this money is for. On Pakistan, Lindsay Graham put it succinctly:  > "Pakistan is a place I really worry about. Eighty-five countries a woman can't open up a bank account without her husband's signature. She can't inherit property. If you're a young girl in Pakistan life is pretty tough. So we're trying to make life better for women throughout the world”  On military funding for Egypt, I will quote Robert McFarlane, national security adviser to President Reagan:  > “It is not too much to say that by nurturing the success of the government of Egypt we will nurture stability in the Middle East, with all the attendant benefits for American interests that implies.”  U.S.-Egypt relations are a strategic partnership out of mutual self-interest to maintain stability in the region.	1608677519.0	ggqmsdi	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqm4gn	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqmsdi/

N/A	I just don't understand what _most_ conservatives actually want. I mean there are some on here that didn't want any fiscal stimulus. That's at least a logically consistent point. I think it's deeply flawed, but at least I can follow the logic. I don't understand the conservatives who are lashing out at Mitch McConnell. This is literally exactly what you're voting for. For about 26 years, but really more like 56, conservatives have operated under the principle that conservatism can't fail. It can only be failed. If the economy didn't recover fast enough, it was because of too much government, not a lack of government intervention, for example. Now for the first time really any any living person's memory, a force far greater than political ideology brought the country to its knees. Maybe some conservatives will see the light that rigid ideology can actually fail. It doesn't mean you need to go out and vote for progressives, but you should really be questioning why you vote for someone like Mitch McConnell (you in general, not you u/cpm17 in particular). I used to spend a lot of time on right wing forums and it's not like conservatives are stupid, or less informed than progressives.

But you say he ‘filled with friends and family’ - what the hell do you expect him to do?  All the important positions were promotions from the swamp and they just covered for their predecessors.  Who else does he look to?  They put anyone who had worked with Trump in jail or in peril, scaring everyone away. And it’s taken four years to clear all these peoples names and the media refuses to report on how the cases against them were entirely fabricated.

But it is almost nothing unless you're a single dude renting a room somewhere.   Also on airlines... your comment implies that airlines and airports are public entity when they aren't. I agree that they basically are in practice... but then why are they private corporations with billionaire CEOs and boards?  Side note.. airlines aren't hurting, yet receiving bailouts. Airports are as crowded as ever and their earnings reports for the last 2 quarters have been great, stellar even.  I think there is more to the 900bn than the 100bn the people are getting. But I do think most of that 800bn will never benefit the people or small business.

N/A	Right.. I don't understand what point you're trying to make. In Canada you get 2k per month in either unemployment or relief. In the US you get your regular UI benefits, plus the earlier $1200 stimulus of free money, plus the $600 new stimulus, plus $300/week added onto your UI benefits. When you add it all up it actually adds up to more than what you'd get in Canada. Forbes did a calculation. My friend is currently laid off right now (in the US) and he's getting around 3k after taxes per month.	1608718785.0	ggsaq1d	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrzvyc	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggsaq1d/
5xavyixb	He can use a pocket veto. the bill is still in the enrollment phase and has not made it to the White House yet. Due to is 5,600 page length, it's unlikely it will make it to his desk until dec 24th at the earliest. The president by law can hold on to legislation for up to 10 days. He can just not sign it before the legislative session ends which would kill the legislation, and also cause a government shut down because the spending bill is attached. He holds all the cards here. Mitch and the other Senate Republicans have to go along with it or they are going to a) cause a government shut down, and b) piss off everyone in the country, democrat, republican, and independent. In all reality trump is out in January. He really has nothing to lose and a lot of popularity to gain for a 2024 run with this move.

Pelosi has since said she agrees and is calling what's known as unanimous consent which will change the stimulus to 2k or 4k unless a member of the senate verbally objects, which they almost certainly will. But if they do, and trump stands by his word, the government funding bill doesnt get passed and no more funding or covid relief will happen until biden is sworn in which is a LONG time from now.

yjlvrg8	??? Bruh thats the weirdest thing anyone has ever said to me. I wanted stimulus package to be given directly citizens this whole time. Not a small amount like we were given. But either steady checks(like other countries) or a large lump sum at once. Maybe around 10k. Most Americans would spend blow a chunk of their 10k on silly shit. Which is kind of the whole point of a stimulus...to stimulate the economy. And as much as it bothered me to see huge corporations get massive government bailouts, I get the reason for it. Though i disagree with it mostly. You don't need to give money to companies if you give enough to the people. People will spend their money at A company, then voila, company doesn't need to be bailed out. With maybe a few exceptions for services that aren't getting used during the pandemic. My work life wasn't affected by covid, but I am not unsympathetic towards those who have been affected.     >I sincerely hope you view your fellow Americans as human beings who deserve to live and thrive    Yeah this is a wierd ass thing to say. Who the fuck wants others to suffer and die? Fellow American or not, I would like everyone in the world to live and thrive. But when we are dealing with limited money in a stimulus package, I wanted to the funds to be focused and concentrated where it can help the most. If I thought our country could support every last person the the USA perfectly through the pandemic and was already doing so, then I wouldn't be so opposed to sending money to other countries to help out. But watching them send millions overseas when our own peiple are suffering is fucking frustrating	1608727615.0	ggsjjyd	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrixzh	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggsjjyd/

yv4l0	Not all 600, but the federal taxes that you see getting taken out on your pay stubs is partially what is paying for it. Aka, the federal government is taking the money you give to it, to take care of the people of the US, giving back a fraction to the people, and spending the rest bailing out corporations directly. Which is bullshit because if the American people had more money to spend, they would spend on the corporations anyways. The greedy corporate fucks just want money quicker, and more of it guaranteed to drop into their metaphorical pockets.	1608692879.0	ggremxk	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggre0fm	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggremxk/
8dghrwtk	Great take. Our defense money should be spent on DEFENSE, ie make investments in our actual human troops and don't send them to war unless we are directly attacked by a foreign nation state. Instead our money goes into pointless wars meant to advance the interests of american multinational business. The major defense contractors have cynically created jobs in as many constituencies as possible, so when something like a 9 billion dollar tank or a jet, which is probably marked up like %1000, and which we DON'T NEED, comes on the table, everyone supports it because they all have constituents that are making money off this twisted process. Meanwhile the troops, who we ask to fight and die so some american company can do business in a foreign nation (how'd that work in Iraq by the way?) are forced to buy their own gear?!? But the worst part is how we treat them when they get back. Millions of men and women, most of them young, come back from service to a society that has largely forgotten about the troops totally. Look at the national hypocrisy that is the VA. Congress refuses time and time again to generously fund it, so vets wind up unable to get the treatment they really need, making it harder for them to find a role in society post-service (let me make clear, the VA is an organization full of people who mostly really love vets and work hard to make things better for them, often people who could be making more money, or doing something more high profile, but choose to help our service members out of a sense of duty. But even the most vet-loving doctor in the world cannot move mountains without resources, which in this day and age means federal money. Since congress will not appropriate enough, these good people are forced to make hard choices - to ask vets to wait for care, or especially common now, to fob them off with drugs instead of addressing the root cause of suffering, often PTSD). You'd think people would jump at the chance to hire vets, but they don't, often because they don't want to deal with the problems, real or imagined, that vets suffer from. You would think that all these politicians saying "I'm from a military family! I love the troops!" would actually want to spend money on those brave Americans instead of on fancy tanks and stealth fighters to be used in agressive hegemonic wars so American business can profit from violence, suffering and death. But I guess those soldiers are just suckers for trusting the promises politicians. They only put their lives on the line, which obviously is not enough, you also have to donate millions to the politicians' campaigns if you even want to get in the door. The hypocrisy you see on both sides makes me sick.	1609776448.0	gi2tu1c	t3_kibtqm	t1_gho8poi	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/gi2tu1c/

8fmqe26w	Right here. You’re spot on.  I think they saw the potential back then but were pleasantly surprised at how that all ended so quickly and quietly. Pandemic has brought a LOT of the inequality right out in the open. No more pretending to live the good life behind the Fb facade. No more pretty filtered insta lives. We have all been comparing ourselves to our neighbors and either feeling up on top or feeling really low about our personal situations and the pandemic has shown that unless you’re super wealthy (not just rich, but wealthy) you’re in a precarious position. I hope the gop ready for this bc this, to me, is that karma that someone posted about yesterday.   ‘Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand Workin' in the dark against your fellow man But as sure as God made black and white What's down in the dark will be brought to the light You can run on for a long time Run on for a long time Run on for a long time Sooner or later God'll cut you down Sooner or later God'll cut you down Go tell that long tongue liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down’  -Johnny Cash  (I don’t believe in god, but still a good quote, I think)	1608733036.0	ggsqxaj	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqla8q	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggsqxaj/
k8nde	Yeah I hate that it died out. That movement had way more tangible goals than something like Black Lives Matter, which as a sentiment is something that anybody who isn’t an actual racist agrees with. But there aren’t any tangible goals of the movement. It’s just meant to divide us. I’ve met most of America, and my experience is that the vast majority of us already aren’t racist. We should’ve had corrupt bankers against the wall when we overwhelmingly voted for Obama 12 years ago.

They think ideas are more important than facts and reality.   Trust me, I grew up in the super-Left. I'm well aware of what's taught and what it's all about. The issue is that they don't tell you about all the evidence that doesn't support the claims they make - you don't know what you don't know.

1321qc	I’d be curious to see how this spending bill stacks up against previous spending bills from the past decade. Does anyone have a link to show this comparison? My searches are coming up empty handed.  Evidently the vast majority of the 2021 spending bill is a direct correlation of what President Trump asked for in February 2020 (before COVID-19 reached American soil in ). My question is why hasn’t this bill been amended to make up for this. Everything has changed as a result of the pandemic, why hasn’t the bill?

u7pwz	I've read enough of it. It's the omnibus spending bill that they do every year. The stimulus package was added to it and is Division M and N in the bill. And there's other bills added after that. Divisions A-L are the appropriations for the various government departments for the fiscal year ending September 30. This is where you'll find money going to other countries. There's no money going to foreign countries in Divisions M or N.	1608696919.0	ggrlf2x	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggraq9d	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrlf2x/

You can see from the table of contents all of the various departments that are being appropriated funds. The stimulus package is after all those in   DIVISION  M—CORONAVIRUS  RESPONSE  AND  RELIEF  SUPPLEMENTAL  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT,  2021   and  DIVISION  N—ADDITIONAL  CORONAVIRUS  RESPONSE  AND  RELIEF    and there's more bills added on after that.

Feel free to go through those particular pages and try to find where we're giving away money to other countries.  >The entire 5k+ pages is an amendment to another act which is $1.4T  No, it's not.

N/A	Realistically, and I hope we are both on the same page, the bill wasn’t just Covid relief it was also just a spending bill mixed in with Covid relief. I get that. But $600 after months and months and months of no help is a fucking spit in the face. They could have doubled it to $1200, made some sort of actual difference to people, and barely raised the price tag of this bill when they had no issue giving 1.5 trillion in tax cuts to their friends. We all know that if you give low and middle class people money, they spend it. That’s how you stimulate the economy- don’t make businesses fight each other for hand outs, give us the money and we will save the companies that deserve to be saved. That’s capitalism.

6qtz2	I know multiple business owners who only still have a business and employees they pay because of the PPP program. They aren't selling their home, using their kid's college fund and blowing through their entire retirement to pay employees and overhead during a period where they legally couldn't operate.... Even still many of them have poured large amounts of personal money back into the business that they smartly separated and saved over time, many took advantage of the two year tax deferral and no early withdrawal penalty 401k/ira funds hoping they will be able to fund it all back in the next two years.  I'd agree that the PPP has been an incredibly successful program even with it's hiccups and inefficiencies. It's disgusting that the only headlines we see about it are the anecdotal examples of some billionaire taking a PPP loan or some mega church getting one, or some large publicly traded company that has franchises. Or headlines about how some ultra wealthy person pulled out 7 figures of qualified money tax free to speculate in the markets without paying any penalty or tax and then put it back in... For every one example you find like that of someone who's clearly using it against how it was intended, there are a hundred people who literally still have a roof over their head because of temproary tax law changes like that.	1608680531.0	ggqs9ty	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqiqqi	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqs9ty/

bvses	Introduce ranked choice voting or proportional representation and third parties can start to matter. But for presidential elections, you only need to abolish the electoral college and do popular voting for third parties to matter and remove a large part of the spoiler effect.   Obviously that will never happen because that would mean that both Democrats and Republicans give up their duopoly on power. As it is right now you do not have a choice.	1608715981.0	ggs8793	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqu8o4	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs8793/

39360tds	I voted libertarian for the first time in my life this election.  I dislike Biden because I feel like he's a sneaky snake that waves shiny things over here while doing shit where no one is watching, I dislike trump because he just pulls shit out of his ass and says shit that's ill informed however at least what he says you get and is upfront with it.   I actually researched instead of picking a painted trash can and picked a candidate while I don't agree with 100% everything of what they're saying, I can morally align with and neutrally agree to disagree in our differences. I knew that libertarian wouldn't win, but these other parties aren't going to gain momentum until people start voting for who they actually like instead of voting against who they don't like.   And just to be clear I'm in this subreddit because I like to be informed on ALL fronts.

ufcit	This is the answer. That bill was FILLED to the brim with bullshit just like this one. I don’t understand why republicans (rightfully) rejected this shit last time, but voted for it this time around..  And to be clear, I think we should have passed a skinny bill SOLELY focused on COVID relief for citizens. $500 unemployment per week + $1,200 checks. And maybe some system to incentivize people to return to work without penalizing those unable to.  Would have been a hell of a lot cheaper, and been more helpful for us the people  And we have a major problem with the way this country works. None of these politicians will be held accountable. People will forget by election time, or be distracted by the next news story.. or not vote.

exuad	Why single out conservatism?  What you said is true for any ideology.  This has been known for at least a few hundred years, the earliest work I know of being *The Prince* by Machiavelli.  Most of us *can't* vote for, or against, Mitch McConnell.  No one member of Congress should have the level of power that he has.  Congress itself is broken.  It doesn't function the way that the founders intended, and it doesn't function in a way that benefits the American people.  It needs a complete overhaul.  I can't speak for everyone, but I lash out at McConnell for abusing this power.  Want my opinion?  We spent so much time being opulent, without scarcity, and with no real problems, that we don't know what to do once a real problem arises.  Half the country denies it's a crisis at all and the other half is having a panic attack.

So we should just let all these companies collapse? probably have to sell all their assets, then hope someone has the funds and drive to start another one years down the road? While those who are trained in these jobs have to struggle to find other work to provide for their families. And that is just fine despite this being a problem that our government chose not to handle well.  You see countries that had a comprehensive response doing much better now.  Still struggling but not in this state.  So all the businesses should suffer because of this massive failure? Trump sure has turned this economy around! But hey a good controlled burn can be good for a forest. And I'm sure people will rise up to the occasion if need be.  But I don't think there is much control going on.	1608740394.0	ggt3owk	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggsiabo	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggt3owk/

N/A	I wouldn't say I ever think the government makes perfect decisions, but I think a small, targeted stimulus was the right way to go. And I think smaller stimulus checks, and expanded unemployment was a good decision also. I think everyone needs to understand that the stimulus check isn't for the desperate unemployed people. Those people are getting the unemployment checks. The stimulus check goes to everyone who makes less than 75,000/year. So you can be someone who makes 50,000 a year, didn't lose your job, you're working from home eating delivery sushi, and they give you a free $600 and say, "go buy some more delivery sushi, to help out those struggling restaurants." It's stimulus money, not welfare or unemployment. For the unemployed, we've given out 1200stim + 7200 Unemployment + 900 Trump Unemployment + 600 2nd Stim + 3600 2nd Unemployment = 13,500. That's a lot. And I think the GOP was right to point out, that there are some people who won't want to go back to work if they're getting 2400/month in expanded unemployment. But it's complicated. This is also a lot of debt. There are also a lot of in-between people who are working, but less, or at least making less money. If I thought the government was more competent I would say something like, "Do what you can to make everything back to normal as soon as possible." I don't think the government is competent enough to do that efficiently. In the absence of that, I think this works. Get the schools open safely. Help the small businesses. Keep the trains going. Give the unemployed some relief. Get people spending money. And we revisit this in the near future and see how it's going, hopefully things more or less get to normal on their own.	1608689398.0	ggr8gui	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr4o8f	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr8gui/

N/A	I'm not understanding your reasoning here. I am a gainfully employed person who can work from home, and I just got a 600 check from the government. Not because I'm poor, unemployed, or I need it, but just because everybody gets one.   My wife is actually unemployed right now, and she has been getting unemployment benefits. Our state pays about 300/week. So March-July, she got 900/week total, or 3600/month. Then she got total 600/week from the Trump executive order for three weeks. Since then, it's 300/week. So she's gotten almost 18,000 this year for being unemployed for 9 months. If she remains unemployed for the next three months, at 600/week, it will be \~$25,000 for a year of unemployment.   Why do you think this is insufficient? What else are they supposed to do, wipe her ass? She's sitting at home looking for jobs, making 25,000 a year. Who the F was getting that in the 1950s? Compare apples to apples. If you were unemployed in the 1950's, you could go eat at a soup kitchen and live in a box.	1608690124.0	ggr9tik	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr59ba	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr9tik/
N/A	Well you have to remember that the states pay unemployment. My state pays a maximum of ~300/week for example. My wife has been out of work since March, she's gotten ~18,000 total in unemployment benefits for the nine months she's been out of work. 2,000/month is pretty nice for sitting at home. And we're not in one of those states where the unemployment is higher than average. The whole "the government only gave the people $600," is just a disingenuous talking point. They gave me, a totally employed person working from home, $1200 and then $600. That's stimulus money. They want me to spend that to keep the economy moving. They want me to buy delivery food and christmas presents with that, to keep people working. They gave my struggling wife $1200, $600, and $18,000, because she's out of work, it's hard to find a job, and it's not her fault. As for corporate bailouts, yeah, it's complicated, but I think it's a greater good scenario. I don't like corporate welfare as a concept, and I agree that it gets abused. But I don't want to see something like what happened with the banks after 2008. If you just kill a whole industry overnight, the big fish eat the little fish. That's how you get the equivalent of a town where all the stores closed but Walmart.	1608690756.0	ggraxnv	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggra0ai	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggraxnv/
4a9gew1x	Imma be honest.....It’s hard for me to take your comment in good faith when your first point is about rich people paying their fair share of taxes (you claim 26.9%) when they own [40% of the country’s wealth](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/06/the-richest-1-percent-now-owns-more-of-the-countrys-wealth-than-at-any-time-in-the-past-50-years/%3FoutputType%3Damp).  Those numbers are unacceptable to me. That bottom 50% number you’re parroting? It’s misleading. That 50% includes retired people, students, not to mention just straight up people making poverty wages. Oh and the bottom 50% only hold 1.6% of the country’s wealth.  They’re over paying in taxes considering their wealth. Thanks for replying to my comment I’m sure you think you’re still right. But really if we’re not starting from the same basis of reality for any of these topics these types of conversations are pointless. Until our realities converge on these type of convos will be unproductive.	1608786685.0	ggvfn88	t3_kibtqm	t1_gguxbzi	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggvfn88/

6aq8okpq	Gosh, this is extremely sad, pathetic, and laughable.   It’s sad that our government doesn’t see the struggle that the American people are going through. $600, while it is better than nothing, it can get you maybe 2 months of food (for a family of 5) or a full month rent.   Pathetic because they are just so fucking oblivious to the cries for help from the people. People are STILL being evicted for late pay and people are also going hungry while solely relying on food banks because they have little.   And this laughable because this bill is giving money to other countries. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE IN NEED OF HELP, YET THEY ARE GIVING TO OTHER FUCKING COUNTRIES. Help yourself before you help others, that’s what I have always been told by my grandmother and it really applies to this situation. The rich don’t care about us, they never have.   So, to wrap this all up...

N/A	I disagree, perhaps it's a minimalistic way of saying that those that don't feel that the government should not assist those that are low income and require it or that are displaced due to the pandemic are likely nothing if not malicious in their nature and considering that the Republican and Democratic side both determine that this is a problem a majority of people do not feel similarly to them and as such their opinion will not be noted generally speaking.

11hkmh	I’m certain that there are other people on the left side of the aisle that totally disagree with me, but as far as I can tell gender pronouns are just a respect thing. If I told you I like to be called Mr. Dickus instead of just Original, you’d probably do it just cause like, why not right? If you wanted to be called Mr Games instead of King, that’s what I’d call you. But if you told me that and I just decided to call you King JUST to be an asshole cause I knew you didn’t like it, I’d be an asshole. Similarly, if I slipped up and called you King cause that’s what I’d been calling you for a while, and you flipped out and insulted me for not exclusively calling you Mr. Games, you’d be the asshole.   Everyone who asks to be called something should have that wish respected, and people who don’t just to dig at them are assholes. Those who find any excuse to be insulted for an accident in address are also assholes.   Jesus that was too long.

Plus, these two things are happening, despite the BEST efforts of Google, FB, Twit, etc.  Even though Americans are very divided, I think maybe we are beginning to notice that the division what is WANTED from the denizens of DC.

And to top it off, the issue is exacerbated by reductions in revenue by cutting taxes at the same time.  I don’t think that part was part of the founding principles.  The government is horribly inefficient with spending.  Most of that is due to it being a giant jobs program (like building the f-35 when the f-22 is still leaps ahead of the competition).	1608694613.0	ggrhjte	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrgp52	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrhjte/

But the abusive totalitarianism, when it occurs, is a perversion of the communist or socialist systems. They’re malfunctions in the systems Whereas “crony capitalism” Is the capitalist system working exactly as it’s intended. Nepotism and inherited wealth are in the bones of the system. The widening rich-poor gap isn’t the system breaking down do to abuses, it’s a return to normalcy for the system after the disruptions caused by the worker uprisings of the 1920s.

72k5p	She is not against medicare for all. She is against expending all of her, currently minimal, political capital on something that will obviously fail and create a backlash against progressives in congress. Withholding a vote for pelosi as House speaker until a floor vote is held on M4A sounds good but there are other and arguably better ways to use their vote, ie in order to get her onto the energy and commerce committee that oversees bills like the Green New Deal would have been a much better use. Primarying conservative Democrats is the reason she was blocked from the committee and using the vote to pressure Pelosi would only compound the issue. I'm not entirely sure she is right or Kulinski is right (personally I think Dore is too emotional) but to say she is against M4A would follow a longstanding precedent of the left eating itself for naive purity reasons when it is time for the progressives to coalesce, regain some political capital, and form a united front against the moderates that gave us this new "stimulus".	1608684105.0	ggqypwr	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqvqf0	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqypwr/

Granted there are probably a few big line items that eat up over half the bill, but those are the items I think we should be most mad about! Focusing on the 10M makes me think we're going to miss the big picture and let the big crooks get away.  The more I think about it the more I'm annoyed that foreign aid is in a stimulus bill. But I still feel like focusing on a 10M appropriation in a 900,000M bill is the sort of thing that lets us miss what's really going on here.

N/A	Bailouts are the result of effective lobby spending. It's capitalism at its core, spend a little to gain a lot in any way possible. Concentrated capital inevitably leads to monopoly, and to enforcement of that monopoly. The means of enforcement change faces, but it's all the same thing, whether couched in terms of monarchy, serf/lord, state communism, fascism, 'democracy', the current US oligarchy or any other branding.  Those who gain inordinate power seek more power, when capital is power, they seek more capital, and they protect the inequality with whatever excuse is most palatable.  This is the reason the UK tried to tax tea, and also the reason that a few rich dudes threw a tea party.  This is the reason slaves were kept, races were divided, cathedrals were built, armies were raised, plantations were formed.  Rich assholes want to be richer.  No doubt in the current US system, both main parties are at fault, but there's a clear process to this which is visible over and over. The GOP pushes oligarchy and the democrats 'give in'.	1608675535.0	ggqiti7	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqe97a	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqiti7/

4a31u	Indeed. I dont think perfect equality is desirable but it's fair to say both libertarians and progressives idealize a society where the differences between the poorest and the richest are minimized. Libertarians feel that sound money leads to that outcome and progressives like to use concepts like mmt.

I did it with my parents when they still attempted to claim me despite being 100% on my own.

N/A	It's true of most ideologies for sure, but at this moment in history, it's a uniquely conservative problem because of the power McConnell wields. I think you would have to go back to 1793-94 to find a radical left wing movement as powerful but also as rigid as American conservatism today. I'm under no illusions that someone like Chuck Schumer actually cares about me or you, but the democratic platform centers on leveraging government in moments like this to build safety nets. The true believers want to help me and you avoid getting sick and avoid bankruptcy and eviction. Schumer and Pelosi understand this and have worked on legislation to this end. Conservative ideology dictates that we shouldn't be leveraging government resources to protect people. A business model that can't survive an economic shut down necessarily needs to be pruned from the branch of the free market. Amazon and Zoom aren't struggling, so why should we bail out Jimbo's Big Seafood Shack? It's his dumbass fault for opening up a restaurant.   I really don't think conservatives are bad people. I just don't understand...this is the exact logical conclusion of conservatism. McConnell fought tooth and nail to prevent the government from floating a low interest loan to the American people, and killed any legislation that tried to hold corporations responsible for risky work environments. AKA McConnell fought for limited government intervention and business protections, and conservatives are mad at him, and all of these statements were true on November 3rd but Republicans overwhelmingly voted for the McConnell brand while rejecting the Trump brand, if you consider the discrepancy between the presidential vote and the down ballot races.   As to congress being broken, it was broken by the likes of Newt Gingrich and Dennis Hastert, and ironically now McConnell carrying out their legacy. It wasn't broken in the 1980s even though these ideological divides existed (whether or not the results were better is highly debatable though).  I largely agree with your last paragraph though. I think if we were in a neutral environment, we could build out a broad consensus on what things need to be fixed. Coincidentally one of my favorite recent books is The Coddling of the American Mind by Jonathan Haidt, which based on your last paragraph I think you'd enjoy.	1608693922.0	ggrge43	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr71fl	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrge43/

8zcu512q	Well, considering my first comment said, “politicians”, I think you can answer your own question. What I see, as an Independent/Leftist is, Conservatives finally, noticing their choices affect them- in ways they can quantify with elementary school math. “Both sides”, is bologna. They are the same side, though I suppose, one is at least, trying to pander to actual humans.	1608739945.0	ggt2v0a	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggt1bke	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggt2v0a/
4dlw2j9q	First off, I know this guy is filing his taxes as single. Head of household or joint he would get his coveted handout. Second, I don't give a shit. This guy has a higher household income than the median NJ household, and he is single. He doesn't need a tax payer handout.   And if you have a problem supporting a family on 90k+ a year, then I would suggest to you that your problem isn't being able to support your family, but instead a problem supporting your standard of living that you imagine you deserve. To you 600 isn't a lot, but tell that to people who are barely scrapping by. You just sound like an entiled pompous ass at a time when tens of millions of americans are out of work and actually worried about being able to pay the mortgage or feed their kids.	1608742134.0	ggt6zw4	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggsnorg	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggt6zw4/
8zcu512q	“Democrats and ‘leftists in general’”  😆 Stop right there. I think the word you were looking for was, “liberals”, not “leftists”. Democrats are much more Conservative than “leftists in general”. Classic Conservatism is the blowhard making three times the average family, bitching about not getting a heftier, additional tax return in the middle of a pandemic. GOP has sat on their damn hands this entire pandemic, now their voters want to be mad? They can go straight to Hell, frankly.	1608743140.0	ggt8xqx	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggt51nj	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggt8xqx/
4swpdrmz	Okay. Public funding of non-profit arts is fine if the public approve that kind of spending - when you said entertainment industry I was thinking more of things like corporate theater chains such as AMC, or Hollywood movie productions, who all I think should be fully responsible for finding their own investors. I wonder if this bill will make any distinction!	1608694221.0	ggrgwap	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrezwv	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrgwap/
4swpdrmz	True but then I think the ethical way to address this is, in those states where government ordered business closures, or government policies strangled consumer demand, the businesses should sue the government for appropriate damages. Not buy and bully national-level politicians into blanket aid for industries.  I might reconsider my view if by some miracle these companies all just collapsed and were taken over by their workers, or purchased by the government.	1608750516.0	ggtn5sg	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggt9lct	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggtn5sg/
5im3e	It would be awesome if the bill said exactly that it went to small businesses exclusively but I doubt it or it would have been made obvious and would be a talking point.  I think the wording looks like PPP loans for small businesses and larger loans for bigger companies.  I'm not saying theaters don't need the help, they do.  I think they are getting the short end of the stick while big named theaters and football fields are getting the meat of it.	1608684293.0	ggqz46h	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqx1ld	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqz46h/

N/A	The amount of UI benefits you get currently depends on what salary you made before you got on UI. That's always been the case. Of course there are people who will get less on UI and others who will get the max allowed on UI. I'm not saying this system is fair during a pandemic or whether the amount of money you get is enough. My main point is that everyone (like just look at the original tweet) keeps saying that the $600 stimulus is ALL there is for unemployed Americans in the last couple months (and then comparing it with other countries' UI benefits) when that's not the case. $600 is what you get \*on top\* of your existing UI benefits, which they also added +$300/week to with the latest package. Furthermore, there is money in this 900 billion package that is allocated toward struggling small businesses and a whole bunch of other places, if it's not going to the unemployed it doesn't mean it automatically just goes to rich people. Yes there is money going to rich people, but people need to actually read the contents of the bill and see how the $900 billion is being allocated before they post their fake maths.	1608749230.0	ggtkp1e	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggthb1x	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggtkp1e/

ozj2d	I’m not saying it doesn’t. I just wanted to make sure I’m accurately understanding what you were saying. I chose the words in that question pretty carefully so I can ask follow up questions with as little confusion as possible.  If the government handles less money, because handling large amounts is a breeding ground for corruption, then can we presume anyone who’s in control of large amounts of money will not only have the potential to be corrupted but also have the financial power to try and prevent others from stopping them (I think you might see where I’m going with this)? If so, then we should also be worried about the controlling members of business entities that generate massive amount of money.  Does your plan to reduce government oversight include a way to strongly keep corporations from avoiding their financial responsibilities? How can we possibly imagine them to be trustable when they currently buy our government representatives right now, wherever possible? I find it confusing that people first think of the government as the problem and not powerful people who influence them. There must be strong government oversight to prevent the privately rich citizens from ruling everything and tilting the scales unfairly in their favor. The real question seems to be how do we create a better system of checks and balances to prevent our representation from not only allegedly pocketing tax money, but being bought and paid for (which seems like the bigger threat)?	1608686461.0	ggr36th	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqqr7u	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr36th/

At the core of it we all want to feel appreciated and loved and we want our loved ones to be safe.  We probably don‘t agree with how to implement empathy and humanitarian values in a government, but that is not so important right now. Right now, it is important that all the lower and middle class people, all the workers across the damn planet, band together ro reform the political elite.

Lobbyists/interest groups/“the rich”are assholes for exploiting the fact that the government can be bought off, but ultimately the government is who’s fucking us.	1608686854.0	ggr3wms	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr2cd5	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr3wms/

4h26i	No, it’s less taxes for the poor and more for the rich. It’s policies that enable if not direct wealth transfer, then better support for those without means. It’s levelling up to ensure that people don’t have to go into debt to save their own lives or to improve their education. It’s making sure that poor life decisions when young at school, or that get you thrown into prison don’t have to define your entire future.  A corporation is not working class. The people that work for it are.

8yxlpjyj	Wrong. The vast majority of all new wealth created since the 80s has gone to the top 1%. It's fueled entirely by decades of tax cuts and gifts to the rich. To think otherwise is trying to argue with objective numbers. Wealth equality has steadily gotten worse, and will continue to get worse. The problem is simply rolling back tax cuts for the rich is labeled as a 'tax increase' when it's just going back to what it was.

Instead of helping the American people, they are bloating a bill with hundreds of billions of dollars of riders.  Of a $900 billion bill, a mere fraction of that was actually going to people in need (600x328 million = $197 billion). And that is IF every single American from birth until 110 years old got $600 and that is far from the case. Prior to veto, hundreds of billions was going to absolute nonsense in a bill exactly zero law makers read.  This bill is a massive waste of tax payer money and I am not seeing a dime of it.

So anyone who could’ve been laid off 3 months into this year may not qualify based on that data with the IRS. Hours being reduced, lay offs, furloughed employees, parents not having access to childcare when their kids are now doing virtual homeschooling, the list goes on. No two financial scenarios are exactly the same.   And yes please go ahead - tell the people who are barely scrapping by that they get $600 to pay their credit card bills, prescriptions, food, cell phone bill, car insurance, student loans, etc that it’s a lot of money. $600 is bullshit regardless of where you live in the US. As we know the stimulus is given to do exactly as it implies - stimulate. And what better way to stimulate the economy than paying down accrued interest on all of the bills you put on your credit card for the last 8 months! Please.

N/A	First show me the paper trail of this money. Second, we operate the government how we CHOOSE to. We dont need to pay Egypt, they have no operational value to our strategic forces. They also, won't purchase from us or any of our strong allies. They, as they've said, will purchase from Russia with the money we give them. At a time of crisis in our own country, it is OKAY to do something a little different and focus on prosperity of your own nation, because if you let that fail, you have broken the operational capabilities of your own government.

4a9gew1x	Hmmm I wonder who decided to tax everyone in income instead of wealth knowing they’d be able to dodge taxes? Why is a billionaire who decides to “pay themselves” $100k taxed the same as someone who’s salary is that number? Trump apparently apparently decided to pay himself poverty wages so he’d only pay $750 in federal taxes. That should be ridiculous for everyone on either end of the spectrum.    Us liberals come here every once in a while to figure out why you’re surprised by some of the things your reps do when they told you exactly who they are.	1608810831.0	ggw4c9s	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggvjga1	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggw4c9s/
4mzwukq4	But for real... YOUR worldview is the definition of infantile. You think everything must stay exactly as it is, because that's how it's been. Foreign people scare you and the idea of helping your neighbor is somehow offensive (?!) to you. You should read more, travel more, and share your opinion much, much less. You'll find the world isn't nearly as dark and scary as you've been led to believe, that people only accomplish anything by helping one another, and that you've been lied to about a lot of things by the people you think understand the world.   I say this because I was raised the same way. I made it all the way through college saying ignorant jackassery like the wall of text that started this very civilized discussion. It took a lot of listening, keeping my mouth shut, and self-reflection to understand that I was wrong about damn near everything I thought I knew. I hope one day you (and all the other actual people on this sub) can see that as well.

fp275	I think that feeling is largely due to the Republican party version of American Conservatism and the US political circus. You have people form other countries comparing their often toned down conservatism to American conservatism, not recognizing they are different things. You don't have the same level of vitriol slung around my country vs in the states.  We also have issues here, I was not allowed to be flared because I am not an American Conservative, though I have voted for the conservatives in my own country multiple times. I don't get to take part because the mods don't like my stand on American conservatism which I think is silly if this is a Conservative sub. The mods went as far to explain this sub is about the Conservative ideology, then immediately asked me who I voted for and why I am not more pro American? I asked why that matters, I am a card carrying conservative member, happy to say who I voted for and asked why I am being compared to a specific stream of conservatism. Nothing in response.  That's the silliness that exists on the conservative side and hurts us all.	1608675844.0	ggqji7e	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqgdm9	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqji7e/

6wixxkxi	"Support big business and cut taxes on the rich" has traditionally been a conservative stance.  I think it's just easy to put "bail out corporations" into that category because it's always felt like conservatives tend to support mega corporations.  Most of your policies you support are policies that specifically benefit them.  You've historically opposed unions and workers rights, you've opposed minimum wage, you've opposed health care being provided by your job, etc.  On top of that, you guys keep voting for Mitch McConnel, who has historically been the biggest opponent of campaign reform and lobbying reform.  The democrats have their faults, and corporate bailouts were just as unacceptable when Obama did it...but overall, it definitely feels to me like conservatives are the ones wanting to protect the elite class.	1608681162.0	ggqted2	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqgdm9	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqted2/

N/A	The government exists in the form it exists *because* of the movement of capital.  Dudes didn't want to pay taxes to an external body, in this case a monarch. They made a governing system whereby they get to set the rules. They convinced or paid people of lower station to fight the war for them. Competing monarchs helped them to gain advantage against the enemy monarch.  It wasn't some massive fight for freedom and equality, it was a transaction.  Why do State governments these days minimise the role of monarchy? Because debts owed by a monarch die with the monarch. Debts owed by a state are carried by generations of government.  It's all capital, whether it be money, power or favors owed, and to ignore the way capital influences the structure of government is facetious when anyone here will go on about how communism is a failed system. Sure, all communist states so far are pretty much failures. They were also continually sabotaged by capitalist states.  The fact they could not survive sabotage by capital and corruption from within is how they failed, not secondary to their failure.  The fact that almost all governments right now prop up capital is by design, and is not a failure of capital but the end result of capital.  Money is not a thing in itself beyond an easier way to count favors owed, favors paid, power held. It is the method in which we transact these things.  If power is more easily enforced by a gun, power is enforced by a gun. Slavery is an end result of capitalism, just like it is the end result of many other systems because it is efficient. Those with no power have no negotiating position.  The point, for us, should not be to create the most efficient system. The point should be to create a fair system. Unchecked capital is not fair.  Stop treating capitalism like some golden ideal and start treating it as what it is. A method of organising and transacting on a wide scale, that is wholly divorced from ideals, morals, or any other qualitative metric. Capitalism is a vehicle, just like communism, and is being used to ferry more power into the hands of the upper classes. If they feel they can get away with it and if it is more efficient, they will dispense with elections and capital and return to lord / serf or generational monarchy.	1608682141.0	ggqv3sv	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqs1g7	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqv3sv/
N/A	Capitalism is a system and monopoly is a feature of that system. Monopoly comes in many forms, resource, structural, legal, etc.  Government is the pretense of monopoly of force. Nothing more. Laws exist and are enforced because they *can* be. Because it is the most efficient use of capital in that capitalist system.  Unchecked competition can include competition on price (transactive), on resource monopoly, on product differentiation (limited monopoly), on legal differentiation like patent (enforced monopoly), and in combative ways like sabotage, libel and espionage. In legal frameworks, this takes the form of patent trolling, regulatory capture, bribery, etc.  At its most basic, the cheapest way to win a competition is to kill your competitor.   The victor of capitalism in any form it takes is simply government. Once you've won, you set the rules and enforce your position.  Tricking people into believing in your system and propping it up for free is just good business sense.  The most efficient path is not always the best path.	1608682805.0	ggqw9qf	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqr9jc	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqw9qf/

And how does 10 million solve a cultural problem? Are they going to undergo cultural re-education? Didn’t *we* as Americans internally fight for that same equality? Why are we playing God and “gifting” them the graciousness of equality, if 10 million solves that.   A “drop in the bucket” as far as percentage in this bill; but during this economic crisis, any penny of the tax-dollars WE, collectively, allot the government to use on our behalf, spent *not* for the economic well-being of our citizens, is treasonous.

boej4	I’m doubting your story about being a green card immigrant for years that you can’t accurately remember, and about it being easy to become a citizen.   I have worked with multiple people who have struggled to get their citizenship for *years*. One man that I work with currently (and have for the last 5 years) has been trying for citizenship for longer than I’ve known him. He’s in his 50s, he’s been paying taxes and a contractor for my company for much longer than I’ve been around. Two of his adult children are citizens (by birthright, that’s how long he’s been here). He’s often taking off a day (once every couple months or so?) to go to my state’s capital to meet with someone about his pending citizenship. I don’t buy that it’s an easy process, and that just anyone can do it if they want it.

N/A	Well it’s social democracy philosophy, a statist form of socialism. One of the tenets of a social democracy is having safety nets funded through tax payer money. This is what’s happening now. Everyone’s tax money pooling and being evenly split. You aren’t just getting your money back, the government is also giving it to people who didn’t pay taxes but still filed or payed much less than what they are receiving back.   This is what conservatives stand against, any social welfare state or program. It’s is always considered socialism, but this one instance where you guys actually need it, then it’s not at all.

But waiting it out is bankrupting the smallest players.  I hoped the stimulus would go to helping them the most.  I doubt I will have time to go through the entire 6000 pages or so of the bill myself to be sure but I have to ask myself why the hell is it so convoluted?  It's clear who should be getting aid and shouldn't take 6000 pages to make it's case.	1608685960.0	ggr29qg	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr0sxi	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr29qg/

N/A	I don't know dude. Every state is different. There are definitely people here as well who are making more on UI benefits + stimulus than when they were working. You can't paint everyone here with a one broad brush. If you're low-income but employed, then you probably don't qualify for UI benefits (because you're literally not unemployed) but you probably qualify for the $1800 stimulus. If you're low-income \*and then\* you became unemployed because of COVID, you probably qualify for your regular UI benefits + the extra $300/week assistance + the $1800 stimulus but it's probably still doesn't add up to what you were making before (though in some cases I've seen it add up to more than what people were making before). Every situation is different, I can't speak for all.

Certain states--particularly those who have screamed *for decades* that they are UNDERrepresented--are *actually* OVERrepresented.  There are more people **in my county** than EITHER Dakota.  We have a couple of Representatives, most we share with other counties, while they have THREE people in DC **all for them**.    Pisses me the hell off.    Representatives in the House need to have pro-rata voting power, based on the national district with the smallest population.  There would be distinct advantages to this:   - It would provide more-accurate representation in the House, which was *supposed to be* population-based.   - It wouldn't require hundreds more Representatives, which means no extra offices, seats, etc, and all the associated costs.   - It would *greatly encourage* ACCURATE census counting.	1608756504.0	ggtyg3o	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggtbdou	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggtyg3o/

Look at the last election a sizeable amount of ppl didn't like either candidates. Voting is too hard and at the same time how many voters are genuinely educated about policies that impact them.   If politicians genuinely cared about the future and the ppl there would be a significant push for education and transparency. Instead politicians find it much easier to manipulate ppl thru the media and emotional topics. They don't actually care about future, but their salaries at their cozy government jobs (the ppl high up at least).

45r52q6u	I don't think you read my comment. I didn't say capitalism was an ideal, and that it had it's own pros and cons.   I simply said that the government, having the power it has, invites bribes and lobbying and so forth. There isn't a fix to this, unless you've got dictatorship or unchanging government, the former being too risky in regards to corruption and the latter not being able to adapt to change.   But the government getting involved in finances causes long term issues that wouldn't occur in the free market. Universities get money from government schemes and the debt gets passed to the consumer. If the government wasn't involved and people actually had to pay out of pocket, then the universities would have to be competitive and a part of that would be lowering prices.  I understand that the universities like the current arrangement, and may have actively played a capitalist-allowed role in making it happen, but if the government had less power in certain areas and things were left to the free market then we'd be closer to "true capitalism" and it would solve some of our problems.  It would come with it's own problems though. There's no solution that works well. My personal takeaway is that we should be advancing technology to solve issues that politics fails to address.	1608717888.0	ggs9wzf	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqv3sv	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs9wzf/

There are 14 million green card holders in the US, and in aggregate they could exert a not insignificant influence. As citizens, we have nowhere else to go. The green card holders can just go home if America becomes a place where you wouldn't want to live. We have a stake in its future, green card holders don't.   Green card holders already have a government that represents their interests - their home government.   They come here and they know the deal - they work, they pay taxes, they don't get to vote or participate in society to the same extent as citizens. I expected nothing more from the host nation when I lived abroad.	1608680282.0	ggqrtv8	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggqiqtx	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggqrtv8/

No I don't need $600 from the government to survive. What I am saying is that its a paltry sum compared to what I pay them every year, which is tens of thousands of dollars.

360s2zg8	Actually I have. I am a very experienced day trader and reading financial documents is a must.   I am aware that some companies sit on piles of cash. Apple is a huge one.   But this is not the case for lots of companies.   If I lose my job or take a huge pay cut I have to trim my spending way back. Companies do this to an extent of course. Lay offs and reducing services. But at the end of they day if the government took care of the people they would not have to bail out big businesses.  Give that nearly trillion dollars to poor people and watch some serious stimulus lol. They love spending money. Nike's and Xboxes would be sold out for years. Give that same money to big businesses and it does not get spent in the same way. We need that money to enter back into the economic cycle. Not get stuck on some companies books some where.   Sure they will spend some of it. But there needs to be lots of strings attached. If a company takes any government money they should not be able to do ANY stock buy backs until every cent is paid back. High level executives should have their income capped at 10 times their lowest paid employee amount.   Or... Put the money into the people's hands and let the market decide who lives and dies.	1608750411.0	ggtmyp8	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggszoxf	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggtmyp8/

N/A	And while I agree with you that reducing government intervention in a number of areas would be preferable, the point I'm making is that saying 'make it more capitalist' does not mean anything or solve anything.  Capitalism is efficient in the way slime mold is efficient or machine learning is efficient.  Power grabs are efficient. Subsidies are efficient. Social welfare is efficient. Tax reductions on the rich are efficient.   They are efficient because it cost these groups less in resources than they gained from their lobby. It's a transaction. It's capitalism. It is literally market capitalism with the barest degree of settled structure.  It is efficient because the goal is achieved. These people have made a profit.  If you want things to improve for people in general, capitalism can be a method, but capitalism can never be a goal in itself.  You need to introduce inefficiencies, like paying for enforcement of regulations that ban and curtail significant monetary lobbying, gerrymandering, and tax evasion. You need to pay means to educate people so that they are less easy to take advantage of. You need to pay for defense to prevent attacks from outside. You need to pay for independent investigative bodies to prevent internal corruption. All of this requires a government structure. If you don't build such a structure, someone else will do it for you and they may not be as selfless.  Stick a mold in a petri dish and it will find an efficient path. You need to put down walls it can't pass, so it looks elsewhere for efficiency.  Corruption is the most efficient form of capitalism because it provides the greatest profit to the corrupt. You need to introduce inefficiencies to make that too costly. Hell, you're already doing it if you ascribe to the idea of decentralized government. Apply the same thought to other areas.	1608723628.0	ggsfak2	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggs9wzf	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggsfak2/

Stripped down, far as I can tell, the partisan split on stimulus broadly is one side wants to give 1 million people $1000, and the other side would rather give Bill Gates $1 billion. Both gets $1 billion out the door in stimulus but with vastly different impacts. And it’s an ideological decision which way to go.   This even ignores the political reality that a shitty economy damages the president and their party, irrespective of circumstances. And the political reality that the system is structured to return incumbents to power no matter what they do.   I remember 2008-09.

45r52q6u	I agree government has a role, I just think that role is too large right now.   Like placing too many walls in the petri dish so the mold struggles - if it struggles because the walls are insurmountable where they shouldn't be, that doesn't indicate that the mold has issues.   Capitalism isn't about how much wealth one person can amass, it's about how much value society can amass. If someone was corrupt and made massive profits, and nobody else could create a business to undercut them/whatever else would lead them to being less corrupt, then the government/business/whatever isn't allowing the free market to operate.   It's a fantasy that can't be realised, but the theory is that the government and laws and such give the free market, well, freedom, while simultaneously not allowing entities to cut that freedom off from others when they're successful (like you describe).   Capitalism is definitely not the goal. It's just saying people should be able to buy what they want. If people want the environment to be better, they'll pay for products, research, etc that improves our impact on the environment. If people prefer paying for things that harm the environment, yeah it's worse for society, but society has said it wants that.   Society with a free market is like an individual that has taken responsibility for it's own health, and said "I'd rather not be healthy for X reason".   It's not the government's job to step in as a parent and use authority to undermine that decision - especially because the government is also made up of people, and if society (majority) are happy to be unhealthy, then the government will be happy with that too, since the government is just a subset of that society.  Again, I don't even think this is the solution, as it has it's own massive cons. My solution would be to out-engineer the problems that politics can't seem to solve. Eg: If electric cars were cheaper, cooler, safer, more feature-rich, and more appealing in every way, then they'd replace other cars. If lab grown meat has tons of incentive over normal meat, it'll replace it. And so on.	1608728794.0	ggskzal	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggsfak2	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggskzal/

6apnqcze	That could very well be the case- but do remember that premiums will naturally go up as you get older, and the growth isn’t exactly linear, so placing the blame on the ACA might be a bit disingenuous.

But yeah, I'm not FOR the Democrats I just recognize that they pose less of a threat to the average persons every day life and are trying to implement policies so less people are forced to struggle unnecessarily. They're corrupt, but can you even outline the conservative agenda going forward beyond "stop any and all changes the Democrats are pushing for".

5oxbtfmy	So its tough to answer because the answer changes depending on if you are asking someone on the left leaning side or the right leaning side. Seems like conservatives think she's a hyperleftist, socialist queen with baby murder on her heart. (I dont know what conservatives think. I am making a very obvious overzealous joke here.)  I identify more with the left. I think Nancy is not clear enough with how she sees things. I think she lacks substance and does a lot of political performance, which I cannot stand. She chooses battles carefully, and I dont think she chooses the right ones. Ultimately she blames progressive politics for the failures of the left, with seemingly no comprehension of what "The People"tm want. She called the $600 relief "significant" and though I'm assuming she doesn't like the way the pill passed, she still let it happen. I hope this satisfies your question. Like I said. The reasons vary, these are some of my current gripes.	1608686280.0	ggr2uxm	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr1fna	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr2uxm/

N/A	And for what it's worth, I agree with you, but I see other issues with unchecked capital beyond just a case of people making decisions that are not in their own best interest.  At its most basic we are talking about game theory, and to use a game as an example, imagine we are playing age of empires 2. Imagine that you've decided to focus on economy growth with your limited resources, and I've decided to be more militaristic. I can disrupt your economy advantage and gain a lead by sending troops to kill your villagers and cause inefficiencies. You can prevent this by building defensive walls in the early game but it means taking people off economy to do it. How things play out in an otherwise totally efficient build order depends on timing, planning and risk appetite.  What I'm trying to point out is that disruptive action that is inefficient in the reference frame of the world economy can be very efficient in local economy. Manufacturing is moved abroad to take advantage of inefficiencies, and like with banana republics, local efficiencies are sabotaged to maintain that inequality and move capital in favor of other localised markets.  The rich are localised market, the poor are another. The rich pay limited capital to maintain inequity between these markets as net capital flows in their direction. To them, it is efficient.  This isn't a matter of inefficiency that engineering opportunity will fix. Those with advantage seek more advantage.   If things get to the point where unused labor becomes prevalent such as automation gains, the result is not an equal amount of jobs managing automation. The result is a smaller, leaner workforce, and economic famine for those not needed.  Take the Irish famine as an example. Food existed that could have been used to feed all 8 million people. Instead, people died to maintain supply lines out of the country. Other countries were disincentivized from helping by the local oligarchs (in this case monarch) who didn't want their power disrupted by being seen as less charitable than the ottoman monarchs.   The result is that our population was cut in half and we're still not back to the same level today.  Do not trust in automation to solve the problem of lack of jobs, because lack of jobs is not a capital problem. If less workers is more efficient than more workers, people are left to die.  In fact, with automation becoming so prevalent and automated security systems and AI becoming so prevalent, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a cull at some point in the next hundred years and if some nations move back to lord / serf.   Capitalism will still exist then and still be efficient, because capital value has nothing to do with qualitative questions of merit, morals and ethics and everything to do with quantitative negotiating position. The most efficient seller market in the world right now is probably amazon and the most efficient sellers on amazon go out of business when amazon itself enforces monopoly position by turning their market into an amazon basics product.	1608730278.0	ggsmxan	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggskzal	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggsmxan/

k7b8e	I wouldn’t agree that any of those are good summaries.   The core of libertarian ideology isn’t “make everything legal” it’s the non-aggression principle which is that you can’t force anyone to do anything against their will. No one can. So within libertarian ideology there’s plenty of room for prohibitive laws it’s not complete anarchy. And there’s no trusting that everyone will be good there’s being responsible.  Democrats are trying to solve real problems, yes, but when they’re trying to do it with bad solutions that’s, IMO, worse. Inequality is a real problem. There are many places Democrats and libertarians agree. Marijuana should be legal, rape should be illegal, homosexuals should have as many rights as anyone else, there should be enough time for politicians to read the damn bills they’re voting on. They shouldn’t stuff obscene amounts of arguably bad ideas into omnibus spending bills.  Republicans aren’t blanket trying to keep anything from changing in fact they’ve changed plenty. They’re the party I see protecting freedom of speech and our right to bear arms which are things even extreme progressives leaned into during this godawful year even though their party rhetoric still bashes both ideals. For all the arguments from the left about how bad Trump’s tax scheme was for the average American I’m a small business owner, small enough to get full Covid relief checks, and those tax cuts helped me. Republicans are also typically anti-abortion as a sticking point which was a lot of what the recent Supreme Court fights have been about. I don’t agree there but they definitely really solidified a hold on the Court. They’re also the only party trying to hold China accountable for massive intellectual property theft among other acts of international aggression.   Yet both Democrats and Republicans’ main job, like their actual job - the reason they get a paycheck, is campaigning for reelection and that costs money which is a big part of why most of them are completely beholden to lobbyists. And both parties contain crooks who are personally enriching themselves at the expense of the average American. That Libertarian ideology gets in the way of both of those things is both why I think they’re no more insane than what we’ve currently got going on AND why they’ll never get anywhere near powerful enough to matter.	1608700732.0	ggrr9x1	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrp4lc	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrr9x1/

I'll give him credit where credit is due on those issues. Like criminal justice reform. But you can't deny he is a divider. His campaign was one of fear, and during a time where things were getting much better in American after the recession in 2008. His rhetoric on immigrants and on police brutality for years has only made this country turn on itself more. His tax plan has made the rich richer and  many of them are only getting richer during covid while the poorest in this country are struggling to get by. His belittlement of women is offensive and sends a terrible message to young people. He has actively turned back regulations that protect the environment while denying climate change. He took away protections for Healthcare for Trans people in the middle of a damn pandemic. He also completely bungled the response to Covid and has turned our best method of slowing the spread into a measure of a man's dick. And now he's talking about attempting a coup because he doesn't have evidence that there was fraud in the election. I just don't see the appeal.

How rich does a person have to be to not deserve a government check?  And I realize that it should be tied to 2020 income, but the federal government does not have a system in place to know how much a person makes as the year progresses. They do know what your previous years income was if you filed taxes. Imperfect system, but there is no better method to quickly get checks sent out to people.  Your suggestion that I'm a hypocrite because the IRS is going to direct deposit a check into my account is frankly childish. Make a real argument.

N/A	Can confirm.  I have a suspicion she views herself like royalty, like a descedent of JFKs royal family.     The populist right tends not to want the details, they just want everything to feel normal.    For example theyll appreciate a stimulus check from a trump administration, they just don't want to hear about socialism and tax brackets.   They like mundane stuff and not having normalcy disturbed, and will vote for someone who has their back and sounds sincere without talking too much shop.   The populist left wants to details and doesn't seem all that interested in considering anything normal.  They generally have some contact or are themselves dispossessed and tend to want to know novel information, and value the info above the practicality.   That's the appeal of AOC, sanders, etc.  They're gonna fix your broken existence, and will prove it with data and arguments.   Pelosi gives barely any details on her thinking and it's usually not appealing to either.   On top of that, her ideas match her results and they don't deliver in a way that satisfies either practical needs or rational understanding.	1608696704.0	ggrl2al	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr2dka	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrl2al/

See you're trying to turn Conservative into a four letter word rather than just call these liberals what they are - hypocrites. I'm sorry my friend, but it's  not going to happen.

Hypocritical liberals say they're pro-union/worker and condemn those who aren't while having anti-union practices in their businesses.

N/A	I wasnt referring to whether she's right or wrong,  only that left leaning people are dispositionally more interested in novel scientific data and ideas.  People who are dispositionally like that are drawn to the left whether or not the ideas they end up believing are right, wrong, good, or bad.    So when she says she has a plan for single paying and posts charts and studies, she's appealing to her partys disposition of first wanting single payer and second wanting novel data to support that conclusion, which is much more effectively than Nancy Pelosi saying it's pie in the sky and political poison, but here's a halfway measure that nobody wants and no data.   She's from a bygone age before digital media where that might fly for the left leaning public.  Now social media has heightened the necessity of delivering the meat and potatoes of what gives your voting base their kicks.   There are certainly exceptions where subgroups of the right love their data.   But we're talking about the broad category of right and left, where the split is really big on certain psychological elements.   Another example is that right leaning people are much more traditionally minded and not open to change.   You will get farther with right leaning voters by appealing to emotions related to trust, tradition, and sentimentality.   Left leaning people can't stand things staying the same, because they crave change and new things.   You will get farther with them by showing them charts that suggest the world isn't as it should be.  Of course, these aren't hard rules for each individual, but they are very large statistical differences.   People are more unique than two categories, for example a paternalist conservative vs. a libertarian conservative are similiar in some distinct ways, and in other ways couldnt be more different.   Libertarians are not so averse to change, for example, while paternalist are.   One is  minimal government and one is big government.     In that sense I'm somewhat confused what you mean because the "facts don't care about your feelings" meme has always struck me as not only a cruel thing to say, but not meant for the left. Its meant for the right and is not really good to say because the feelings of right leaning people do have value. For example, their feelings about their families, traditions, and culture.  Left leaning people couldn't care any less about those feelings if it doesn't fit into their calculations. A better insult for the left is to call them cold and calculated in both their cynicism and idealism, and who think the end justifies any means.  Ps, I can provide you the large scale psychological  studies if you're interested, but as they point out they're generally a lot more interesting to left wing people.	1608709788.0	ggs26bt	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggro4j8	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs26bt/
jbdn2uh	LMAO!!! I don't know what you're smoking but it must be good!!  I mean it's basic High School level knowledge that liberals/democrats are very pro-union, social government programs, and having a more heavily involved government in our businesses to make sure everything is on the up and up.   Geez, kid. I graduated from a reputable U.C. not so long ago and as liberal as those classes tended to be, they sure didn't spew that brainwashed nonsense you just did 🤣! What tinfoil hat wearing 'progressive' are you getting your info from?  As someone who lives in the land of liberals, let me correct you. They are FAR from economic Conservatives. Liberals like unions, ridiculously high minimum wage, burdensome/superfluous regulations, etc. - the opposite of what Conservatives want. However, there are liberal businesses that are hypocrites and they want to see others impose that crazy but not themselves because they're job/buisness killers. You're thinking of libertarians who typically want the government to stay out of their business and their 'buisness'.	1608698507.0	ggrnx80	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr0o59	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrnx80/

If your Dems are really so pro-union, pro minimum wage and pro social programs, then why does America score so poorly on social policy? Where is your Medicare, your union driven politics or your liveable minimum wage?  Dems were bought out, just like your Repubs and Libertarians. Your liberals are no more progressive than the Liberal Parties of Australia and Europe.	1608699280.0	ggrp402	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggrnx80	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggrp402/

Obama turned  the economy around after Busg but many innocent people died in Drone strikes who should be alive today.

N/A	I don't think mainstream conservativism is actually that interested in the data on FTM trans athletes, they're concerned about sports and trans  stuff because they care about their cultural traditions. The data isn't what drew them to the issue, even if they bring it up.  It's also not the data itself, but rather the argument from authority stamp on their position, which is very very very important to right leaning people.  Data is also not as effective for convincing them as appealing to their sense of tradition and normalcy.   More than anything what drew them to the issue is that trans stuff is such a massive departure from what they know and understand.  Like with many things the fear is that new things have come to take away the good things they have.   That's also why despite the vast majority of people being conservatively predisposed, they can't consolidate a vote because of ideological drift with each new generation.  They all have different version of conservativism based on their ideas of normal.   Hence younger conservatives not really caring much about homosexuality as much as older conservatives.  Its not talked about much because it'll split the vote.   The left is interesting in trans stuff regardless of how it effects sports because they are drawn to minorities subjugated by the status quo, and they love data on how that is the case.   They couldn't care less how it effects sports, traditional conceptions of sex, or people who care about either.	1608712093.0	ggs4jq0	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggs2y6p	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggs4jq0/
gqigp	Maybe you didn't read the Wall Street Journal article.  The tariffs were on Chinese goods, made by Chinese companies.  That money went to the treasury.  "U.S. Collected $63 Billion in Tariffs.  Mr. Trump’s decision to raise levies on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. "  "The U.S. is now on a pace to generate $72 billion in tariffs annually, and could well hit the $100 billion mark Mr. Trump has touted if new 10% tariffs on $300 billion in untaxed imports take effect on Sept. 1, as threatened."	1608687055.0	ggr4a59	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr2hsf	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr4a59/

io7kq	If you believe a country is only great because of 1 person in that country, you’re clearly mistaken. And if that particular individual spends everyday of their time in office complaining about America, calling half of Americans enemies, he didn’t make it great. But you, a regular person, can make all the difference. It’s how you treat people. This country is great when we respect ourselves and each other. Even when we disagree. You can do this. Don’t listen to the men and women who want you to be mad at everything and everyone daily. That’s not reality, they’re trying to use you. I don’t like seeing us Americans at the bottom pitted against one another, and it’s truly disheartening when their terrible rhetoric works on us.

ash9t	You’re not getting it tho. A tariff is a tax. A charge the buyer pays on top of the price the seller sells it at. China sold the US $100 of crap. There is a 10% tariff. The US firm pays $110 to acquire the product. The Chinese firm still gets their $100. The treasury Dept collects the $10 surcharge from the US firm.   The reasons for tariffs are to make Chinese goods less favorable relative to a competitor. If Mexico can sell the same product for $105 the US firm will buy Chinese @ $100. A 10% tariff on Chinese goods means the US firm will go to the next lowest price for a comparable product. A tariff affects purchasing behavior. But the money collected from the tariff comes directly from the local population.	1608687991.0	ggr5yni	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr4a59	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr5yni/
90lw0o1	Yes, the tariffs are collected by the customs department. Then they go to the treasury.   Yet like I have already said, the tariff goes on Chinese made products. That doesnt mean said chinese company who made the product is paying for the tariff. It means US firms and US companies pay for the tariff when they purchase said product for resale in the US. So its US money that is being generated by the tariffs. Not foreign money. None of the money being collected has been in chinese hands. Only american.	1608688092.0	ggr65b4	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggr4a59	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggr65b4/

N/A	It's not your point, because my point is there's a difference in how much value is placed on novel scientific data.   Left leaning people value science and data more in its own right while right leaning people give more weight to other values and principles that are also very important.    What you're saying is the left and right both use scientific data to practice eristics (to win arguments rather than find truth) in equal proportion to one and other.  It's simply not true.   What I'm NOT saying is that science is the only valuable form of truth.   Im not here to talk smack, I want to reassure you of that.  What that means is you can change a left leaning person's mind more easily or get them on board with something with novel scientific data.   Right leaning people are much less responsive to it, and in other studies are shown to not have as good an eye for if it was fabricated.    Right leaning people are far more responsive to emotional appeals related to things that already understand like their own jobs, families, traditions and culture, put in concrete and simple terms rather than sociological jargon.   You can see this in action with the types of speeches presidents of either party usually give to their broadest demographic.   Republicans talk about hard work and earning a living, patriotism, Christianity, etc. While democrats talk about what percentage of the country owns what percentage of the wealth, the tax rates on different economic brackets, the percentage of xyz minority group who have experienced some collection of bad things and how that's changed over the last however many years, etc.	1608721043.0	ggscsz1	t3_kibtqm	t1_ggs5877	/r/Conservative/comments/kibtqm/i_want_my_taxes_back/ggscsz1/

gbcbz4	This is actually an important issue that goes beyond party lines (ignoring McConnell for now as he's a piece of shit only caring for himself).  If the Dems push for an impeachment of Trump it's not something you should be for or against based on him being a GOP member, as it's effects will be felt for a long time. Potentially decades.  MAGA and the GOP aren't really the same thing, they are just working together put of convenience atm (and this isn't about supporting one or the other in this post). If Trump is impeached it pushes MAGA out of the GOP and allows them to move away from his more hard line beliefs. If MAGA is not impeached, and Trump is supported by the GOP it sees the GOP largely embrace that view and it will shift politically quite quickly. Trump will have a voice, his supporters will remain in the mix and will be highly influential.  If you don't want Trump and MAGA to become the path of the GOP then support the impeachment. It will hurt for a while. But it will mend in time, and bring the party together.   If you support MAGA then oppose the impeachment, because keeping Trump will unify the party quicker but almost certainly it will be on MAGA terms and with a Trump-esque candidate (if not Trump himself).   So this isn't about the GOP standing together, it's about where do you stand on what the GOP represents. Supporting blindly is a big thing in US politics and it is fucking terrible, especially when it's a 2 party system as that just forces everyone into that "with us or against us" mentality.   Even better support voting reform. From removing electoral colleges, to multiple parties and representative voting.  That wouldn't just split the GOP and maga, it would split the dems and Bernie-esque candidates too.  It would actually make it fairer for everyone.	1610513532.0	gj2zajz	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2zajz/

6g6lt2rd	I think GOP would be very wise to aggressively distance themselves from Trump as soon as possible. I have no doubt that vast majority of GOP congressmen and senators hate his guts, just like they always did, they just were not public about it after 2016.  The intense support for Trump from much of GOP base boggles my mind. With all the fine conservative thinkers why choose someone of so deeply flawed character? It's not like he's great orator. Seems like the lowest common denominator, this definitely doesn't reflect well on the GOP base...  I applaud Mitch and other GOP politicians to finally take a stand. Way too late, but at least something. Hopefully we see a period of de-Trumpification in the GOP so that the party can finally go back to normalcy.   Trump was already considered the worst US president by historians only halfway through his presidency. By inciting insurrection he galvanized this shameful spot so that it can never (hopefully!) be taken.	1610498447.0	gj28575	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj28575/

16tpp4	Ok, this same story broke in the NYT with references that were just as vague.  Anonymous he said-she said and no response from Trump.  This has red flags all over it.  On the one hand, I wouldn’t put something like this beyond a career politician like McConnell.  On the other hand, I don’t think he’s quite that dumb as far as what the results of his doing that would be.  Donations might talk, but that’s largely because they equate to staying in office.  There wouldn’t be much of a Party left if he did something like that.  Of course, I do remember Grietens across the river from me in MO.  The *only* rationale that would make sense where the party is concerned would be if he thought he could fast track another not-guilty or even dismiss it in the Senate.	1610553221.0	gj4f5ve	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj4f5ve/

zl9ry	Everyone should read this, and understand how the media can really spin things, making you think one thing, while it could very well be another:  [https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/politics/mcconnell-impeachment-trump-capitol-riot/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/politics/mcconnell-impeachment-trump-capitol-riot/index.html)  \*\*Washington (CNN)\*\*Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he believes that impeaching President Donald Trump will make it easier to get rid of the President and Trumpism from the Republican Party, according to a source with knowledge of the matter (1).  Another person with direct knowledge (2) told CNN there's a reason McConnell has been silent on impeachment as other Republicans have pushed back: he's furious about last week's attack on the US Capitol by the President's supporters, even more so that Trump has shown no contrition. His silence has been deliberate as he leaves open the option of supporting impeachment.McConnell has made no commitments on voting to convict Trump, and wants to see the article itself before voting. It's a stark contrast to the President's first impeachment, when McConnell repeatedly spoke out against Democratic intentions to hold Trump accountable for a pressure campaign on the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden and his family.  *(1) "according to a source with knowledge of the matter. lol. Here we go. Another anonymous source. By now, you don't have to be anonymous, so this is probably BULLSHIT.*  *(2) "another person with direct knowledge..." LOLOLOL! I swear, you can't make this shit up. Oh wait. They are. Citing another anonymous source as IF a 2nd anonymous source, instead of one, would make this more believable. lol.*  So, yes, McConnell is only about protecting himself and the GOP. We know this by now. We know Mitch is about Mitch, and could not care less about Americans. The stimulus denial should have been fucking obvious to any holdouts on the subject.  However....I'm sure he realizes the GOP with wither away by almost 50% if he supports the impeachment of Trump. My guess, McConnell will create at atmosphere were Trump will not get impeached...but it will also look like McConnell wasn't that helpful, either. In other words, playing a snake and being on the fence.  The article, which is NOT AN OP-ED piece by the way, was written by several sources:  By [Manu Raju](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/manu-raju), [Phil Mattingly](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/phil-mattingliy-profile), [Jeff Zeleny](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jeff-zeleny-profile), [Jim Acosta](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/jim-acosta-profile) and [Kaitlan Collins](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/kaitlan-collins), CNN  McConnell might be stupid enough to vote for impeachment. I'm not saying he won't be. But I'm pretty sure he's also looking at what this will do the GOP. If he really thinks it won't have any effect, that's scary to believe that, and also insulting to people like myself. Because that means he really thinks Trump won't have support out of office.  If McConnell does support impeachment...MAGA better leave the GOP (should have gone by now, really).	1610555720.0	gj4kk41	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj4kk41/

8ir4m	I think both left and right are sick of their representation and the status quo of politics... one of the most direct actions I've been aware of to change DC for the better is to support ranked choice voting.   This voting method leads to less hyper-partisan politics and also allows for more than two parties to represent the American people. It's insane to think that the infinite spectrum of human expression can be distilled down into two opposing poles.   “I am, at the Fed level, libertarian;   at the state level, Republican;   at the local level, Democrat;   and at the family and friends level, a socialist.   If that saying doesn’t convince you of the fatuousness of left vs. right labels, nothing will.”  \-Nassim Nicholas Taleb  Republicans and Democrats are no longer useful descriptors because they describe tribes more than actual political beliefs. There are values and beliefs both from the left and the right that are valuable and needed in our society but they've seemingly been branded and claimed by one political affiliation or the other.   Political parties have been able to hide their dirty shit behind the 2-sides/theyre all the same/one party issue voters for too long. Break it open. Support Ranked Choice Voting.	1610504862.0	gj2k212	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2k212/

wv4xd	This is the exact opposite of what healing and unity is all about. If the R’s concede on this, it will doom the party. The entirety of the Trump base will disavow both D’s and R’s for at least some time - most likely an election cycle or two at the least.   If D’s wanted to actually unite this country, they’d drop this. Leave it be, charge the people who broke into the Capitol and move on.   If they don’t they will rift this country apart. There is a segment of the population that feels personally represented by Trump. If you do this and rip him out of office, and charge him with crimes you will unleash these people.   One of the greatest things Trump has received 0 credit for is that he wrangled back the far-right. The extremists exist on both sides of the aisle, but Trump could effectively pull them back and get them back in line when needed. If you divorce Trump from office in *this* manner, they will disentangle themselves from being believers in Trump and that will push them back into the dark recesses, where they will hide and fester until they reach critical mass.   When that bops off there’s no going back.   I’m praying this doesn’t come to pass, but more and more I see people discussing Trump and impeachment, it just reinforces that things are **not** going to get better any time soon.	1610520179.0	gj38an3	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj38an3/

N/A	It is very wild how many federal judges he got y'all and now he is trash. We might disagree on how to get america great but I guess at least we are learning politicians care about themselves more than us.   I have to ask regarding the election objections. To my understanding, the Texas governor also changed voting laws (and not the legislature) by extending early voting time. Doesnt anyone feel there is a little bit of intellectual dishonesty by not objecting to Texas's results as well? I feel by not also objecting to TX really undercuts my ability to do anything more than minimal entertainment of the argument.	1610509875.0	gj2t8e9	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2t8e9/

132471	I'm so glad to be able to finally comment on here!!! I think we can all agree Mitch McConnell is trash, and that he's only doing this for money from his corporate buddies. I'm a Muslim and I lean conservative but consider myself an independent. I think the system we have is trash, and this election showed it. Hell, the pandemic showed us that our government has no interest in the safety or welfare of its people. I'm disgusted by the two-party system that literally does nothing but oppress the people.	1610522499.0	gj3aydy	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3aydy/
N/A	Is there any proof that all that could lead Trump to being impeached?

N/A	The GOP needs to rip off this bandaid and just oust this guy. How else can there be any repair anytime soon?   If Trump is the leader of the GOP in a few months from now, many moderates are gone and plenty of others not voting single issue will stay home. Any battleground is in serious jeopardy. And there’s no end in sight until post 2024 election either way.   On the other hand if they oust Trump they piss off the far right. You run no jeopardy of chasing them to the other side only of keeping them home during elections. Which is better than the alternative.

2v766hax	If both you and Hitler arrive at the conclusion that 2+2=4, it doesn’t mean you support Hitler. In this case Mitch’s interests and advocacy for the GOP interests and the party’s longevity happens to align with the Democrats’ interests.  Mitch is clearly not a creature of conscience or this would’ve happened much sooner. He got what he wanted for the courts and he leveraged Trump’s popularity to get there.  Now Trump’s popularity is waning, and his power is diminishing. Trump was a utility for the party. Trump got his little time in the spotlight, crony deals, and ego trip, and Mitch got his USSC appointments. Anyone who ever thought they were truly allied was delusional.  The only thing that probably wasn’t predicted was how much Mitch would have to damage the party to get to his goal.  And to be clear, sometimes there is no “right move”, since you’ll always piss *someone* off. It’s just a matter of doing the calculus of “which option can we recover from the quickest and which has the best long term outcome”. That’s about where Mitch is now.	1610527566.0	gj3g7uz	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3g7uz/

oj5ar1	Was I wrong about the two parties? Is the Republican party going to self-destruct leaving it the party of Trump that it has so desperately clung to the last 4 years. While the sensible people bail and run to the Democratic party and the other lesser parties. The D party then being so overloaded with people and bifurcating into a new moderate American party? Man, I hope so. I have yet to be met with the vitriol and hatred of the Trumpers on this sub. It just seems like... Americans.  McConnell and the loons need to go though. Even though I agree with him on this. I agreed with this sentiment when Trump was impeached. Too bad McConnell and dozens of boot-licking morons in office still saw some use for them for Trump.   Accountability needs to be dished out retroactively across this great nation. I hear you "that sets a scary precedent" but that precedent is following the laws of this land and morality. Sounds like a good precedent to set. Another good one is getting money out of politics. Pelosi and family should not be so filthy stinking rich after years of public service making $174,000 /yr or less. McConnell should not be nearly as rich as he is off of (more than due to his Senate maj. ldr. status) $174k/yr while his state went further down the ranks in wage disparity, education and many other metrics while he held office there for so long.	1610532126.0	gj3knzf	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3knzf/

Have we, for all this time, mocked articles that cite "anonymous sources" or "sources familiar with persona x, y or z's thinking," only to accept this NY times article that used both?  That is what this is. It's an adapted NY Times article, based entirely on conjecture, and designed to drive a wedge in the Republican Party. Mitch McConnell is savvier than this, and has made absolutely no statement. He knows that to go against Trump means the death of the party, and that to go with Trump means to fall into the same pit that Trump is currently in.  If impeachment reaches the Senate, I would expect McConnell to kill it on procedural and time based grounds. Regardless, this is a baseless article that uses anonymous sources, who don't even claim to have a direct quote.

tgqfk	These GOP conservatives are a joke. They promise a shit ton, get into power, and do jack shit. While doing nothing is appreciated when it comes to the government as a whole, versus making government bigger, they aren't changing things for the better either.   When Democrats get into power, they run down the laundry lists of to-do, and ram it through.   In this case, modern day GOP are simply road blocks of do nothings, while ok, but not maximizing their ability while in power.  Trump actually got shit done. Things he said he would do, and actually have the populist vote.  Time for a new political party, so the old crooks of GOP can team up with the Democrats as they've always been doing.	1610512391.0	gj2xhgi	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xhgi/

dct05	As a Canadian Conservative I really have to wonder how in the world you guys can seriously shut your eyes to what Trump did.  It’s honestly stuns me.    Look I really don’t like BLM, I don’t like Antifa either.  It is possible to condemn both of them and still hold true to your conservative beliefs.  If any democratic president had ever held a rally where they encouraged their voters to fight and March on the captial to contest an election where every single court case had been chucked out for not having standing.  If that was the situation how would you all be discussing this?  Would you really not be for impeachment?  This sets such a terrifying precedent for America that is possible for a political leader to whip their followers into a mob and that mob ends up storming the capital.  That not even considering all the other info coming out about the threats to hang members of Congress, specifically looking for members of Congress, the weapons, bombs, brought to the capital.  That this appears to have been planned in advance according to leaked details from Parlour.  As a Canadian who has always viewed America as that shining hill in the darkness holding back some of worst forces the world has to offer I am honestly in disbelief.    You do not need to support Trump to be conservatives.  Yes he holds tremendous sway over the party and voters atm, but seriously consider if those actions taken that day would have been impeachment worthy under a democrat.  Sweeping this under the rug will come back to bite America in the ass in the long term.  You can condemn Trump, BLM, antifa, the fascist thugs that stormed your capital and all the extremist shit heads stirring the pot at the same time.  America has a wealth of talent among its population.  You could pick a name out of a hat and find a better person to president than Trump.  Probably more electable than Biden as well.  And for the record.  I am pro gun, pro military, pro cop, pro western. Help moderate a sub with the goal of pulling together America’s Canzuk allies into a stronger ally to stand by America/rest of the western world.  The west really needs America to wake the fuck up.  We got major trouble coming over the horizon and it looks like you guys are falling asleep at the wheel.  Where is the America that fought a two front world war helping to crush the Nazis and Japan?	1610523461.0	gj3bzwo	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3bzwo/

Since Trump Jr already declared war on GOP a few days ago and the GOP is trying to purge the trump sentiment from the party.

N/A	Of course he does, McConnel is bought by the CCP. Keeping Trump out of office means china wins. All of these old idiots are. Theyve occupied a seat for so long due to no term limits (which is ridiculous), of course they're going to develop some shady dealings. Pelosi was practically begging people to come down to china town, to aid china into spreading the usa to ruin our lives, and then somehow it gets blamed on trump. Everything gets blamed on trump, its ridiculous. Trump had nothing to do with these goons (who I still believe were disguised antifa/blm, despite seeing reports of otherwise) and he said specifically before and after that he wanted peace.

8wpsgp9j	So does this mean the GOP split is a fact. I am assuming the 70 million that voted for Trump can be divided into two categories.  1. Those that vote GOP because that's what they always have done, regardless of the GOP candidate.   2. Those that have voted both DNC and  GOP before but are now in team Trump and will for the rest of their lives vote only for Trump or members of his family.  That would effectively mean that if Trump or members of his family run in 2024, that 20 - 30 million of the 70 million votes would go third party.	1610503844.0	gj2i5ar	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2i5ar/

Yes the dems and media have been terrible to him and yes many many double standards but the dude brings a lot of this one himself with his constant ego stroking, his lies, and his shady tactics.  If we want a shot to win again this cancer needs to be removed.  One day I hope all the Trumpers sober up and see how bad this dude has been and how very little he accomplished.  The only thing I can say positive about him is he did an amazing job with the Supreme Court but that’s about it.

4dhakrv6	Someone correct me if I'm reading the room wrong here (I'm simply an observer from Canada), but there seems to be a lot of agreement on this sub between liberals and conservatives (term limits, donations, McConnell generally being a douche, etc).  Could Donald Trump's final month as president have been a direct cause to the opening of real dialogue between the two sides (among citizens, not politicians)?  And if so, could this mean the electorate will have a much louder voice in general going forward by not being so far apart?  Or am I being waaaaaaaay too optimistic here...	1610521738.0	gj3a3gp	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3a3gp/

They don't remember that just a week ago they were calling for McConnell's head over it because people can't wait for this relief.

3wnlg6r8	I don't see conservatives here. I see impersonators and flaky ass people. I never saw one order, tweet or request from trump for people to do what happened at the capitol. In fact, I saw the opposite. Saying we won't go down without a fight and stand up for ourselves is not code for "riot, loot, and storm the capitol". Stop twisting words and playing semantics.   This is people not happy with our corrupt system. This is people not liking this sly attempt at a communistic takeover. And leftwing radical democrats and antifa were present going berserk disguised as trump supporters to make them look bad.  I'm not a trump supporter. I'm am independent thinker who just happens to have conservative tendencies.  Mitch is a sellout rat who will do whatever he can to get richer. And so are the majority of the other gop folk. We need term limits. We need reasonable salaries for our government officials. Lobbyists and special interests should be illegal. The governing should not be able to control us if they aren't governed themselves. If the law applies to us, it applies to them.

q5slm	This could be some 5 dimension backgammon.  Support the impeachment and get it from the house.  Then in the Senate there is a LONG trial with hundreds or thousands of witnesses, most of which would be brought by the defense (The Presidents lawyer).    The first 6 months is when a new President has the most power to get things done before the next election season starts.  If you have a trial every day for a month or two that is time the Senate is not doing anything else.  DC can't multitask.  Not only that, but after he is out of office people are going to get really annoyed that every day is the trump show and not working for the American people.  Public support will lower.  There is nothing to say they have to convict, but it could be a nice road block.  People think he's Ratfucking Trump, he's not.  He's Ratfucking Biden.  Moreover New York won't be able to do their case while the Senate is doing the trial.  As public support for the impeachment falls as it wastes more and more time New York will have the incentive to back off.  Kind of a good move.	1610507725.0	gj2pfy6	t3_kw2lq8	t3_kw2lq8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2pfy6/

kbpxk	Yup, I agree. Mitch got what he wanted from Trump (judges) and now has cover to remove him from the GOP. The real question is the degree to which the Trump wing of the party will hurt it as a result of being ejected. If it's like the tea-party then they will simply pull the extreme wing with them, either further to the extreme of the party or potentially, though unlikely, into a new party. If the GOP wants to fight it then it needs to start reconnecting with the centre ground and start being a part of positive change for their constituents, rather than playing political games.	1610530636.0	gj3j7us	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2dpi2	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3j7us/

1r4gqxye	This is absolutely the answer.  Each party has enjoyed simultaneous control of both the presidency and the houses of congress in the last 15 years.  Neither have cleaned this shit up.  I don't know you u/mick_2nv, but if you, random internet guy, knows the answer (which you do), then the politicians know the answer too.  Yet they still don't do anything about it.  Looking to a D or R to fix things seems like a misplaced hope.	1610531299.0	gj3jv0h	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2pj2c	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3jv0h/

4da0tyyy	As a generally-left voter, I agree.     I think one of the best things we can do is get rid of cross-state congressional donations. Whether republican or Democrat, why should an individual in another state be allowed to make financial contributions to someone running to represent an entirely different state? Blows my mind.      Same token, I don’t think nationwide corporations should be able to contribute to multiple races. I think they should have a voice. But maybe they should be restricted to the states where they do the most business.     In any case, the virtual mobility of capital is a problem, and I am glad to see those on the opposing side of the spectrum agree on some core issues. The term limit proposition is also a no-brainer to me.	1610520057.0	gj385ef	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2pj2c	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj385ef/

1doo8470	Terms limits are a bad idea. They are just a band aid to mask the real problems. The real problems are gerrymandering and people viewing all of Congress as being corrupt except, of course, the people they vote for.  Impose term limits and all that will happen is the real power will be delegated to non-elected government officials. Then the entrenched interests will just buy off the non-elected officials and there is not much the voters can do.  The solutions are to eliminate gerrymandering by creating non-partisan election commissions and by voters actually voting out their own corrupt members of Congress instead of viewing them as 'good for the district'.	1610521242.0	gj39j2s	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2pj2c	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj39j2s/

6giv1	Wasn't that part of Trump's platform? Didn't work out well, it won't under Biden either... Bernie was the only dem who stood a chance and had the actual motivation to wipe out the corruption but so many dems were wishy washy and thought he couldn't win against Trump (maybe maybe maybe).  And now we have a wishy wishy president who'll get almost nothing done even with two years of controlling all three houses. Also you may hate her identity politics, I get that, but I strongly believe AoC cares about people and isn't corrupt, hopefully stays that way.  Trump sucked, Biden will maybe suck less but still isn't gonna help out the average Joe.

mwtn8	Term limits would make lobbyists and special interests more powerful. The job of legislating is not an easy one. Term limits would send legislators home just as they learn how to do the job they were sent to do, and replaces them with a new crop of novices easily manipulated by those whose special interests we want to curtail.  It's understandable why people think term limits will help. They see politicians that clearly should be sent out to pasture.

cdv8u	In 1867 republicans voted to impeach and almost to convict (1 vote short) Andrew Johnson because of the Tenure act (which deemed it unconstitutional for the president to remove appointed officials), which Johnson vetoed. He was then impeached for ignoring the act and removing his Secretary of War. 20 years later it was repealed and eventually the law itself was eventually deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.   Just another example of a time republicans voted party over policy (and almost convicted a president for it). And it’s for something trump has used repeatedly and takes for granted lol.

13ckh6	The issue with term limits is that it artificially produces less competent congressmen due to them having less experience. During the latter half of the 19th century, congressmen on average served only 1-2 terms, meaning that many of them were just placeholders for special interests rather stalwarts of the public interest. And of course, Congress and the parties were as corrupt as they are today.  We need to do what worked back then: proper investigative journalism (not hack journalism that is abundant these days). Really, there's no solution of just passing one or two laws, but instead what we really need is constant public engagement. Otherwise, once you've let your eyes off the ball, you allow the elites to corrupt the system for their benefit. I find term limits to be a shortcut that doesn't really solve the problem.  &#x200B;  You might object, saying that term limits destroys career politicians, but it certainly does not stop kickbacks that occur post-congressional career. They could be given benefits in exchange for their "support" once they return to civilian life.  &#x200B;  Really, the public is going to need to play an active role in politics, not a passive one.	1610508008.0	gj2pxxz	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj1vaq7	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2pxxz/

Idk maybe 6 terms, so 12 years. If we did this we'd have to put in something about total time, because otherwise people could go to a new State and run there after their 3 terms.

If the whole event just would have been a live Trump rally outside the Capital, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But when you've got a group of knuckleheads that stormed Congress, that defeats everything. Those clowns gave the Dems everything. McConnell did cost the two GA Senate seats by not going forward with the extra $1400 relief, but the events of last week have done serious damage to the party.   The thing is, if we held on to the Senate, since we also had the courts, we could have been fine. Instead we ended up ceding control of everything to the Dems. At some point you need to regroup, which is what the party should have been focusing on. Instead We've now got a fractured party, that has extremely limited control on how the government moves forward for at least the next two years.	1610508206.0	gj2qb03	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj23kn4	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2qb03/
3zhs1yg	Hi... liberal New Zealander here...   I have always been very confused, in the last five years - if there was one thing, I felt the left and the right could come together on, it is that Donald Trump is a bad person, who should not be running the country. Like if there is one thing we can agree on, its that the guy running the country - whether we like their politics or not has to be a straight up, honest, empathetic, well intentioned, compassionate person who is selflessly working in our interest.  And Donald Trump is clearly none of those things. I don't believe anyone, aside from the most misguided of Trump supports could make an intelligent arguable case that Donald Trump is honest, or compassionate. If murdering 1000 conservatives would get him a second term, and he could get away with it, he would do it without a second thought.  So we have this opportunity now - because the right is starting to come around, and agree that this guy is dangerous, and bad for democracy, and bad for the world in general - its a moment to stand together, and say 'We don't support what you did, and you need to pay for it.' And that I see is a very healing moment. If we can't agree that it is bad that a President structures an incursion against his own capital, then we are further apart than I feared.  So I guess my question (which will probably go unanswered because I am not allowed to post in this forum) - my question is people on the right like Cheney, McConnell etc who are starting to come around, some more people on the right are angry, and attacking them. Why? Surely there can't be that many people that still support Trump, after everything he has said and done? Honest question.	1610512248.0	gj2x989	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj23kn4	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2x989/

12fe5x	Mitch is definitely not trying to kiss Biden’s ass. He’s realized that having Trump in the party is more of a liability than an asset after the Georgia senate elections which he blames Trump for.  He want trump out of the party because he’s too unpredictable and doesn’t fall in line when he needs to. Now that he doesn’t need Trump to win elections he wants control over his party again.	1610515168.0	gj31q8a	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj23kn4	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj31q8a/
6862a12s	Doubtful he is going to be kissing the ass of Biden especially if Bernie is getting Biden's approval to push his progressive agenda.

Imagine an America where instead of two parties you have a party for small gov fiscal conservatives, a party for pro-life social conservatives, a small woke democratic party, a green Dem party, etc. A patchwork of small parties of 7 or 8 senators and in order to get stuff done the libertarians would ally with 2A senators, and sometimes the green Dems ally with infrastructure conservatives, etc. And every person could finally have a party just for them instead of having to make concessions and trick themselves into believing they're for something just because they feel like they're supposed to.	1610507681.0	gj2pd45	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj1vuk3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2pd45/

3yeoatrq	Progressive here....absolutely not trying to stir up shit, but was curious how “the other side” thinks. Do you feel like there is already a huge fracture/divide in the Republican Party? I do blue collar construction work and I know so many conservatives that begrudgingly voted for Trump both times because he is a “republican”. And they are certainly not proud of it. First of all, as a student of history, I think his claim to conservatism is a sham. It deeply upsets me that he capitalizes on conservatives’ propensity toward Christianity. This man is not a Christian....not in spirit or action. I was raised catholic and while I no longer practice (and have quite a few problems with Catholicism/Christianity as an organization) I still have deep respect for self-ascribed Christians who adhere to the teachings of Christ. And it baffles me that any of them consider Trump a suitable candidate or even a redeemable human being. And circling back around I wonder if his brand of “conservatism” hasn’t already DEEPLY divided the Republican Party. Anyway, please don’t beat me up....I really do just want to hear some thoughtful input from “the other side”. Peace my American brothers and sisters.	1610507401.0	gj2oumh	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj1vuk3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2oumh/

Why will people not condemn this domestic terrorism?  Vote republican all you like but those who supported this have got to go.

kuxrg	He's resistant to the change Trump has tried to bring to the GOP.  Like it or not, Trump has brought a lot of people in to the party that otherwise would not be there.  He's given a voice to the middle class that is no longer represented by the Democrats.  Trump is a 90s Dem, back when Dems weren't batshit crazy.      There's things I like about Trump and things I don't.  But it is impossible to ignore that he's been in the White House working for Americans instead of working for the establishment and corporate donors.  The Republican party should be more accepting of MAGA, not to the full letter but take seriously the idea that people want a government that works for them.  I think this is an ideal that conservatives want too.  I would prefer the government to shrink, which Trump is definitely not in favor of, but I am glad that I have been able to feel like the dude in the White House actually gave it shit about me for the past four years.      And this impeachment is the absolute worst thing that could be done in our incredibly divided America right now.	1610503773.0	gj2i0ex	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj24vyg	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2i0ex/

N/A	At the end of the day, people are responsible for their own actions. The day we're excusing bombers at the US capitol is the day we excuse other acts of terror like 9/11.

If you believe it was stolen, where is the evidence, and why have 40-50 odd court cases been thrown out?  And remember, as far as censorship goes, the left isn't Twitter or other social media.

Even when Trump did rallies in Georgia,  he focused 90% of his time on himself, and not on Perdue and Loeffler.

11qe74	If he was impeached by the house and convicted by the Senate, then no, he won’t be able to run. Convicted felons can’t run for the Presidency.   But even once out of office, Trump is going to face a legal gauntlet. The NY AG is deep into the Trump foundation, and now the DC prosecutors are looking at bringing charges of inciting a riot.   However, the easiest and most plausible way to put him, behind bars is the call to Raffensberger. That call was pretty blatantly election fraud by both state and federal statute, so if he doesn’t try to self-pardon, he will almost certainly be prosecuted for that unless Biden specifically directs the DOJ not to. I’m guessing the GA AG won’t press charges at the state level, given that he’s a Republican.	1610511959.0	gj2wryo	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2ogz3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2wryo/

29w79f21	I like this perspective... I think you are correct about what this is about...   Dems don’t understand that Right wingers if they are treated poorly enough for long enough... will do something very drastic...  Their view of Right wingers is just as a bunch of weakass white guys who never fight back...   What they don’t realize is is that Right wingers are going to fight back all at once... not one at a time... in a coordinated effort to eliminate a valid threat... you can’t attack your neighbors forever without consequences...  Dems believe that there are no consequences and are behaving like there are no consequences... there are.  But the Dems are so rabid I truly believe that they don’t have control of themselves at all... which is why I believe that conflict is inevitable...  And for good reason! Who wants a 1 party system where the 1 party in power that has all the control... is effectively crazy and has no actual control over how oppressive they will get...  No ground floor in hell... just keeps going down... and Right wingers know this... when they finally do decide on a course of action to protect themselves and the country... let’s just say this:   There won’t be any going back to “the way things were before”... all hell will literally break loose and the Right won’t stop until they consider the threat eliminated or they are all dead...	1610523460.0	gj3bzv8	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj38an3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3bzv8/
j8m54	>One of the greatest things Trump has received 0 credit for is that he wrangled back the far-right. The extremists exist on both sides of the aisle, but Trump could effectively pull them back and get them back in line when needed. If you divorce Trump from office in *this* manner, they will disentangle themselves from being believers in Trump and that will push them back into the dark recesses, where they will hide and fester until they reach critical mass.  Nah, Trump's rhetoric clearly radicalized a lot of otherwise average conservative Americans. Whether they want to hear it or not he was our version of a radical Imam whipping normal muslims into a jihadists frenzy. No doubt they balk at the comparison but normal people in other first world countries that are watching this all go down definitely see them that way. And if the common denominator is that everyone else thinks you're the asshole, then the smart play would be to at least consider the possibility that you're not actually living in the plot from a Tom Clancy novel, and you really are just an asshole.  Its like the lady today at Schumer's conference saying how she got sexually aroused watching the capitol riot. If you act crazy, then people are gonna think you're crazy. Trump supporters only have themselves to blame for that.  The Republican Party used to be a party of serious, down to earth people. Realists. A party that could be relied on to be strong on important things like Homeland Security. Then it got hijacked by an ex-democrat reality tv star. Which is why after the worst breach of national security since 9/11 just happened, (of which our enemies abroad were no doubt taking copious notes) the only thing anyone can talk about is freaking twitter.  I'll be glad to see Trump gone so this party can get back to being a serious force for leadership in this country and America can get back being a serious force for leadership around the globe.	1610524152.0	gj3cqn2	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj38an3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3cqn2/

f2lpi	I think it's much much simpler...keep Trump busy for six months to not be impeached or leave Trump with six months of doing nothing but proving vote fraud after it cannot help him in 2024 since he was officially removed from office.  Mitch is not pushing impeachment for himself.  I think the big donors whose money comes from China are bribing Mitch to push impeachment so they get a lot more campaign money for the 2022 midterms.  The Republican party won't exist if they lose any more seats and/or a new party is built around Trump.  I don't think New York factors in...the suspicious election night fiasco has made the public relations cost of them doing any REAL punishment to Trump too high.  What New York wants to do is drag it out as long as possible and then turn him loose with no criminal or civil consequences.	1610515987.0	gj32vyr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2pfy6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj32vyr/

6odi2	Lobbying is freedom of speech. When you call your Senator to try to convince him to vote for something you agree on, that's lobbying.  Every organization you support, lobbies congress and other elected officials for their issues.  This is the dumbest idea anyone could come up with.  Let's fucking repeal Citizens United, put limits on how much corporations can spend, create a public fund so campaigns are publicly funded, and institute a fucking ranked choice voting system. Those are just a good start, there is so much more we can do, and banning lobbying or term limits are the two ideas that are absolutely trash.	1610520913.0	gj395il	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2q1ms	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj395il/
hogx0	Well, I’m with you on the part about separating money from politics, but lobbying doesn’t necessarily entail money...when I was in High School I learned about what lobbying was from my grandmother who is an attorney with experience as a lobbyist. The way she described lobbying to me didn’t once involve money. She had taught me because at the time I was doing a bit of “lobbying” (with a school group I was part of) to try to persuade representatives to change the laws that would have closed my High School due to low performance on standardized tests.  Tl;dr So in short, lobbying isn’t inherently bad, however involving money is.   At least from my personal experience.  P.S. And the school didn’t end up getting closed, so some high school kids (without money) trying to make a change seemed to work on it’s own...	1610516825.0	gj3412v	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2q1ms	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3412v/

16g58e	I’m glad both left and right can agree on this. While money is in politics, the US lawmakers will never have the true interests of the people at heart.  However, I feel it should be noted that there have been a bunch of bills proposed in recent history to shine a light on campaign finance abuse such as making donors reveal who they are instead of hiding behind shady made-up companies (otherwise known as dark money).  While I know Dems are likely as much to blame, every time bills like this reach the floor, Republicans kill it.   Some examples:  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-congress/house-votes-to-protect-dark-money-political-donors-idUSKCN0Z02PO  https://www.krwg.org/post/republicans-block-campaign-finance-reform  The only way this problem can be fixed is if the general public is aware of who is blocking these reforms and why, and then vote their asses out.	1610522420.0	gj3av5l	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2q1ms	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3av5l/

rp6vg	Multi-party system would help too. With a two party system even ranked choice doesn't help much. You're still going to end up with either a Dem or Rep majority (although I admit, House and Senate can go different ways by that just leads to gridlock).  A multi-party system can allow for better representation. I'm Canadian so we have this but as an example, someone might agree with Dems on some policy and Reps on others, but no party covers the majority of their opinions. With multi-party, you may end up with better representation.  You can also end up with coalition governments/minority government, which I view as a good thing as it involves compromise and working together to make progress. I understand that (in America especially) there are issues people refuse to compromise on, but there are also many issues that people *would* compromise on that would make your country a better place to live.	1610522218.0	gj3an11	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2neko	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3an11/
3gqg1	Preferential voting like in aus. You number who you want and as your preferred smaller party gets knocked out your vote then goes to your next preference and so on till there is a winner.  While our house of reps is more or less two party, our senate has a bunch of independents who need to be appeased in order to get things through and these indipendants are far more accountable to their constituents.   I like it because you have flavours of both sides of the spectrum which in my opinion shouldn't just be liberal or conservative. Left or right. Its much more complex than that and this stupid black and white line that has polarised everyone  needs to go get fucked.	1610529628.0	gj3i8vp	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2neko	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3i8vp/

All I remember the GOP for is:   * Going to war with a bunch of countries (Bush Jr, McCain was a warhawk) * Infringing on personal freedoms in the name of security or "protecting you from yourself" (patriot act, war on drugs) * Saying they'd cut govt spending, but consistently voting for increased govt spending.	1610519936.0	gj3805l	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2paph	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3805l/

8yxbzy25	Incumbents win re-election at something like a 90%+ clip.  I will check and send an edit.  The system is inherently skewed towards incumbents.   Almost Certain to Keep Their Jobs Incumbent members of the House seeking re-election are all but assured re-election. The re-election rate among all 435 members of the House has been as high as 98 percent in modern history, and it's rarely dipped below 90 percent.   The late Washington Post political columnist David Broder referred to this phenomenon as "incumbent lock" and blamed gerrymandered congressional districts for eliminating any notion of competition in general elections.   But there are other reasons the re-election rate for members of Congress is so high. "With wide name recognition, and usually an insurmountable advantage in campaign cash, House incumbents typically have little trouble holding onto their seats," explains the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington.  In addition, there are other built-in protections for congressional incumbents: the ability to regularly mail flattering newsletters to constituents at taxpayer expense under the guise of "constituent outreach" and to earmark money for pet projects in their districts. Members of Congress who raise money for their colleagues are also rewarded with large amounts of campaign money for their own campaigns, making even more difficult to unseat incumbents.	1610511455.0	gj2vxe9	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hrk0	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2vxe9/

sgtb1	You're being downvoted but you make a good point. I used to fervently support term limits until I read some very convincing argument against them. It would likely lead to a revolving door of inexperienced legislators trying their best to please their corporate sponsors in their short time in office.

Term limits are a great place to start, but I doubt we will even get that, as, again, they are the ones who vote on it, not us.   The only real power we have, at this point, is if we all band together and refuse to pay taxes until they implement term limits, as it's a lot harder for corporations to buy off new people than it is to keep paying the same folks they already know whose votes can be paid for	1610515691.0	gj32gzj	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2dj26	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj32gzj/

fdbd7	Yeah the left and right have a lot in common. They want much of the same things, stability, safety, possibilities, etc., and they also have in common the fact that many of their elected officials don’t represent them/act in good faith once in office. If leaders actually helped the people, ensured there were good jobs out there, eliminated/ameliorated the burden of health care, spent more money domestically (infrastructure etc) rather than abroad, enacted policies that empower workers, etc, there would be much less of a divide between the two. At the end of the day you basically want the same things in slighty different flavors, but the political system has turned you into enemies of each other.	1610517829.0	gj35dh4	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2dj26	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj35dh4/

hrsox	Thank you :) Context is important. Trump lied and lied and lied about the results of the election, refused to speak out against hate groups, and then held a rally where he whipped up the anger and gave explicit instructions to march to the Capitol.  His behavior predictably led to the events of last week. It doesn’t matter if he said the words, ‘I am starting an insurrection and I would like you all to be violent.’ Taken as a whole, his desire was crystal clear: he demanded four more years, riled the mob, lit the flame, and applauded the efforts of traitors to overthrow the results of a legitimate election.  People are turning on him because his rhetoric and actions are a threat to our democracy. Continuing to support him is unconscionable, even for people who would stand to _benefit_ from four-plus more years of Trump.  To put it in perspective: he wanted one man (Mike Pence) to overthrow the results of a legitimate election. How is that democracy? Who really wants Mike Pence, alone, picking the next president? Gosh.	1610504108.0	gj2in5u	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2d9o6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2in5u/

z4q6g	I think that violence that took place last week is abhorrent.  With that said, Trump will be in office for less than 10 days.  While McConnell may believe he is doing what is good for Republican Party, this will assure Democratic victories for at least next two elections.  Even if most of Republican voter base accepts his reasoning, I would venture a guess that a third of their electorate will stay home next few elections. As Democrats outnumber Republicans, good luck winning elections.  There is a large portion of populace that believes (wrongly or not) that there were shenanigans in last election.  No move at all occurred to reassure America it will or has been looked at.  This is potentially fatal for our democracy and this will not help.	1610503394.0	gj2havj	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2d9o6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2havj/

dq17n	Oooh a George Carlin quote. Here are some of my other favorite quotes from him:  "Conservatives say if you don't give the rich more money, they will lose their incentive to invest. As for the poor, they tell us they've lost all incentive because we've given them too much money."  "Have you ever wondered why Republicans are so interested in encouraging people to volunteer in their communities? It’s because volunteers work for no pay. Republicans have been trying to get people to work for no pay for a long time."  "Boy, these conservatives are really something, aren't they? They're all in favor of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you're born, you're on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don't want to know about you. They don't want to hear from you. No nothing. No neonatal care, no daycare, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you're preborn, you're fine; if you're preschool, you're f**ked."  "Once you leave the womb, conservatives don't care about you until you reach military age. Then you’re just what they’re looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers."	1610512318.0	gj2xd72	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2okq7	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xd72/

2v3kghxy	They would have done this anyway. The angry people at the Capitol was the sexiest excuse. If the people had waited outside, they'd say they were still terrorists. If no one showed up, they'd attack Trump for contesting the "results" in the first place. And if Trump hadn't even done that, they make up some other bullshit excuse like they always do.  Trump was too big of a middle finger to the establishment than they could handle. No career politician ever wants an outsider like Trump to win again or even come close. He has to be made an example of in their eyes.	1610522757.0	gj3b8n1	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2qb03	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3b8n1/
i3haos	I'm sure it's already been said, but it absolutely bares worth repeating.  The Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol was nothing more than another nail in the coffin, albeit a very, very large nail.  Between Trump, McConnell, Whack-a-mole Republicans *(Rick Scott, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, Kelly Loeffler and the like)* and the sociopathic upstarts that scream for attention like Roy Moore, Alex Jones, Kent Hovind and his son Eric and Pastors like Greg Locke, the damage has been stacking up.  Every one of these Lunatics opens people's eyes that much more. The more they pop up, the more people that learn who they are and what they represent, the more ground Republicans are going to lose.  In fact, It's pretty safe to argue that the only reason that the GOP hasn't been put in to this position sooner is that Liberal Voters are complacent. We like to think that the danger subsides once we stop hearing about the crazy people. We like to think that our individual votes aren't important because *surely* there are enough sensible people who see these clowns and will do something. We like to think that either we don't matter or we're not needed.  The real question is whether or not we all forget about the danger posed and presented by this absurd presidency and go back to normal in 2022 and 2024. If we do, then you have nothing to worry about.  If we don't, there's a great chance that the Republican party won't just be on the backslide and will legitimately begin to lose power.  It all comes down to whether or not Liberals keep the momentum and whether or not this "FrAuDuLeNt EleEcTiOn" inspires an onslaught of more delusional red hats.	1610522958.0	gj3bghp	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2qb03	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3bghp/

z1tlm	You seems to misunderstand just how effective screaming "fake news" is when the media says something you dont like.   When your support base is excited that youre a business man and gonna run the country like a business (but ignore all your failed businesses) its not going to be hard to point them in a direction and make them go.  Im not pro trump by any means, and i wish he hadnt been elected, but when he was i REALLY hoped he would do some good. Then he went and ran the country like a business as he said he would. The only problem is he ran it like one of his own businesses.	1610513435.0	gj2z55r	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2x989	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2z55r/

tgnqw4e	Because they stormed the capitol for the wrong reason.  Conservatives largely support the 2A which protects the means to overthrow the government when they do bad things.  Trump lost the election with and without fraudulent votes helping Biden.  People should have stormed the capitol over the Iraq WMD lie to start a multi-decade war in the Middle East or when Snowden revealed the massive, unwarranted surveillance state.	1610509503.0	gj2skyh	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2fx6b	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2skyh/
378bxev4	> Just curious, why is this sub so defensive of Trump for what happened on Jan 6?  Because most of the left overstates his actual blame for what happened. He made some stupid remarks about the election that made the rioters angry, but he never called for violence. In my book, if someone never explicitly called for violence, then they’re not responsible for that violence. I apply the same standard for either side, so I don’t blame Bernie for the Congressional baseball shooter, nor do I blame any Democrat for any violent BLM riots. If people were actually fair and honest about his role, I’m sure we’d be happy to join in wholeheartedly with the condemnation.  > Both were flown inside the capital on Jan 6, thanks to Trump and his base.  Thanks to *part* of his base. I do not blame Trump for what flags parts of his base choose to fly, no more than I blame Democrats for [their supporters burning an American flag inside the capital.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/dc-protesters-burn-american-flag-chant-america-was-never-great-on-july-4th/2352266/)  > Why will people not call this what it is - an attempted coup?  If the left is willing to call CHAZ an attempted coup, I’ll call this an attempted coup. As long as the standards are equal.  > Why will people not condemn this domestic terrorism?  As soon as the left calls the summer riots domestic terrorism and stops trying to justify the violence, I’ll do the same for the DC riots. But I’m not going to apply a standard that the prominent voices on the other side refuse to hold.  > Vote republican all you like but those who supported this have got to go.  Agreed. Everybody who stormed the Capitol deserves their just punishment, and anyone who outright supports it doesn’t deserve to be in the party. But I’ve seen no politician on our side who supported the violence, so I know of nobody who actually needs to be voted out. Perhaps the left will apply the same standard to their people as well (I doubt it).  > Can you imagine if in 2012, had Obama lost, his followers stormed the capital? He’d have been in jail within a week.  Maybe. It didn’t happen so I can’t say either way. But what I can say is that such an arrest would be unjust, and should be opposed by people on both sides. (Also, Trump very well could end up arrested over this, so your point may end up being moot.)  If Trump turned up the heat (which I believe he did), then censure him. I’m pretty sure the House has censured him in the past, and unlike the previous time(s), doing so now would actually be warranted and I’d support it. But what many people are advocating for is a punishment for Trump that doesn’t fit any “crime” that he committed, and I’m naturally going to oppose this double standard, and this attempt to blame him for more than he’s responsible for.	1610516836.0	gj341lk	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2fx6b	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj341lk/
4f7ua	I was there in DC that day.  It was more of a "mostly peaceful protest" than any of the violent BLM protests we've had this past summer.  Don't get me wrong breakimg into the Capitol is illegal and I condemn all political violence.  I'm actually more upset at this one than your average leftist BLM riot because we're supposed to be better than that, but out of what seemed like maybe 200 thousand plus people a hundred or so got carried away and forced their way into the capital building. Everyone else milled about town and on the steps waving flags. To call this a coup attempt is blatant propaganda.  If it was an actual coup attempt the mob would have been heavily armed and the politicians would all be dead.  There was nothing really to stop them from burning the capital to the ground.  Instead most of them took selfies and acted like idiots from the internet.  Do you really think that Trump couldn't have equipped a private armed force with machine guns and explosives if a coup was his actual goal?  Trump did nothing to invite violence.  His speech was the same jokes he's been giving for months.  Kamala Harris encouraged BLM protests after many federal buildings had been damaged and burned and many more had already died in them.  Any idiot knows that she means the peaceful side of the demonstrations and not the violence.  It's a blatant double standard.  Leftists protests have done far worse, they just have the media on their side.	1610515047.0	gj31jxp	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2fx6b	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj31jxp/

8en7g	Because Trump is not responsible for the riot. He's responsibile for raising the temperature. He did not directly tell the people to invade the capital. This is not an impeachable offense.   Just as obama is not responsible for the death of those cops in Dallas and Bernie is not responsible for the congressional baseball game shooting.	1610508985.0	gj2rohv	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2fx6b	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2rohv/

If they were trying to actually dona coup they would have had weapons and wouldn't have just run inside then gone "and now what!?!". It was a group of stupid people doing a stupid thing.  >Why will people not condemn this domestic terrorism?  People are condeming what happened. Why are you acting like we arent? I wouldnt call it domestic terrorism unless you want to label every single liberal for 6+ months of BLM and creating their own country in Seattle.  >Vote republican all you like but those who supported this have got to go.  I can very easily say the same to you. The liberals making this out to be some massive thing need to leave. That doesnt help shit.  >Can you imagine if in 2012, had Obama lost, his followers stormed the capital? He’d have been in jail within a week.  No he wouldn't unless he explicitly started it. He actually did something very much like this and people died but he didn't explicitly say kill people so no one blames him. You can blame Trump for increasing the temp but you can't blame him for what they did. Also Obama should be in jail for many many other reasons.

7aylywsp	You vote Democratic.  Well, specifically moderate dems like Biden who are objectively more in line with old school conservatism than the vast majority of the Republican Party.  Ideally  the GOP dies the death it deserves and the Democratic party splits in two   You get the liberal party that has your bernies warrens and people slightly to the right and anything to the left.  And you get the Democratic Party that holds anything centrist and what used to be considered right of the center. Including people like Romney and the always badass Schwarzenegger .   The far right becomes a fringe group with your trumps, your palins, your Mitch, your Cruz’s, and your Jeff sessions types.   They still won’t have any actual standing in a two party system.      Fiscal conservatism is dead and 60+% of the GOP lie about the lefts policy while objectively being worst about spending and budgeting.      They are the part of social conservatism and liberal economic policy.    The split would have the liberal party being socially liberal and economically left of center (gotta get votes somehow)  And the Democratic Party will be more or less socially liberal and full on economic conservative (since they don’t have to pander to/compete for particular demographics anymore)   Edit: there’s be a lot more of the republican party  than the two i listed, but honestly i dont know about the honest remnants in the state legislatures.	1610525750.0	gj3eeb1	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2vk2c	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3eeb1/

Monopolies are rampaging unchecked in our society, censoring whoever the hell they want.    The merging of state and corporation will be complete with the Biden administration.  Monopolies should not exist in a true capitalistic society.  They are the antithesis of capitalism.  Small businesses, competition, and freedom are what we need.  That is impossible when companies like Amazon can bribe our politicians and drown out any competition through sheer power and censorship.    Republicans let it happen because they are either weak or just as heavily invested as Democrats.  There really are no Democrats vs. Republicans.

Regardless of the corporate donations, if the 75-80 Million people band together, raise the money for these candidates as a grassroots campaign, then not a single one of the establishment Republicans will never see another term. Do not forgive. Do not forget, And vote them out in 2 years, then I'm sure with the support and endorsement of Trump (assuming he won't/can't run again) elect a MAGA president in 2024.

9rjwpv3z	Everyone is acting crazy. EVERYONE.  There's no nuance. Now would be the time for someone with a spine to say, "No, we're not going to impeach the President because it would set forth a precedent that would require the removal of several sitting members of congress and the impeachment future Vice President for her incitement."  How is what AOC or Harris less incitement, encouragement and (even worse) approval than Trump?  Additionally, Conservativism and Republicanism is about personal agency and by impeaching the President you're showing that the people on 1/6 don't have personal agency to make decisions but BLM riots do. Doing so would mean your platform should be thrown out and your party should be closed.	1610499564.0	gj2a7uj	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj263yj	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2a7uj/

Libertarian looks like it would more closely align with your views as the republican party has a record of doing things such as bringing religion into government and restricting abortion. Although, thanks to stupid party loyalty, but this might not apply where you are if you live in a libertarian region, running as a third party means that you have to run against the Republican and Democrat candidate, and party loyalty may mean that many people don't vote for you even if they agree with you.  Tldr, from my view Libertarian seems best for you ideologically but Republican gives you the best shot at winning	1610524728.0	gj3dc9j	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hx9i	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3dc9j/

ewzxw7w	Divisive to who though? We can all agree the President's role/rhetoric can't be ignored when it comes to what happened at the Capitol that day. He is not without blame. Those individuals were purely fueled by the Trump "they stole the election" team. We can have valid discussions on his language, specifically, and his belief that those individuals wouldn't actually attack the Capitol (and even others who have previously incited violence from their roles in political leadership, let's hold them accountable too if their actions led to or justified terroristic actions). But as President, the standard of his style of leadership has to be challenged for its flaws (especially given what happened that day) or we set a very bad precedent for future presidents.	1610515734.0	gj32j3f	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2ugp5	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj32j3f/
16k47l60	Hypothetical scenario:  A mobster is talking to a detective investigating him and says "Detective, I hear you have a lovely wife and a little girl. I'd sure hate if anything were to happen to them."  What is the hidden implication of that statement?  Let's continue:  The detective leaves and the mobsters' two henchmen enter the room. He says to them "It would sure be a shame if that detectives family happened to suffer a terrible accident. Why, I hear that there has been a recent spate of fires in the homes of our brave boys in blue and you never know which one will go next."  What is the implication in that statement? What do you think that the two henchmen are going to do?

5fw801iq	Really worth considering the possibility that Trump was playing 4D chess behind the scenes and lost.   Seems like a crazy coincidence that the guy who claimed, falsely, that the election was a fraud, that he had an overwhelming victory, that he wasn't going to step down, that he 'deserved' another term, just so happened to have one of his rallies turn into a totally random freak assault on congress, the very first since 1814! What really are the odds here that the guy who has loudly and repetitively undermining the election results would just happen to have an opportunity to unilaterally seize control of the US government handed to him on a platter?  The following outlines clear connections between republican operatives, rally planners, and on-the-ground terrorists who led the assault.

Our NATO alliance is weaker while Russia and China are gaining influence. His travel ban? His regulatory capture with cabinet members? His fuking partially built wall?

(which they can't) and it gets all the base's jimmies in a rustle to go vote. All the while those same voters ignore the fact they are also voting for huge tax cuts for the mega rich, decreased access and affordability of healthcare, and policies that hurt them moreso than anyone -- ie. no direct relief from covid, just money for businesses.

237d7pk	I don't think it has to be Trump or nothing changes. Republicans voted for Trump in primaries because they wanted change. They could see that the swamp needs to be drained. Things are sucky for most poor & lower middle class Americans, and they've watched things get worse and worse under 'business-as-usual' politicians. So they got behind an outsider that wanted to change things.  Now a lot of Trump supporters feel let down by him. He didn't do what he said he was going to.  That just means Trump was the wrong person, not that the things those voters wanted was wrong. Dem voters have been getting popular outsiders into their party.  Hell, AOC beat a 10 term incumbent. You think the mainstream party lifers like Pelosi & Schumer were happy about people like Omar, Tlaib or the rest of the squad?  There's no reason Republicans can't do the same. Just cause Trump is ousted, it doesn't mean you have to vote for the candidate endorsed by McTurtle and Graham. You weren't wrong for wanting an outsider. So do it again	1610510704.0	gj2unnb	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj29qaw	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2unnb/
N/A	>Trump polled at over 90% among Republican voters. The party needs to understand why that was  I mean, it's pretty simple: the country is divided af down party lines, and a vast majority of Republicans will vote for any R (as a vast majority of democrats will vote for any D). I mean, look at Biden. Democrats were largely lukewarm on the guy, but he had a legendary voting push and record-breaking turnout.   The days of people switching parties to choose a candidate they like better, personally, are largely over. Strategists have succeeded in making each side think the other side is the devil, so we focus on our minor differences and ignore what the big corps and lobbyists are doing.   I'd be willing to wager that 90% of Republicans would've supported some boring, mainstream conservative, as well. I think it's a mistake to look at polls and conclude that all Republicans love Trumpism.	1610500820.0	gj2cjd0	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj25udr	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2cjd0/
czgh0	> But these "Suburban Moms" were completely unaffected by the months of violent democrat protests? They decided to vote FOR the party that instigated and fed billions in damage across the country?  Look, I’m not going to pretend to understand why, but yes. That’s exactly what happened. My own suburban parents are nominally independents but had never voted for a Democrat for President their entire lives until this year. It’s been stunning to see how dramatically their social views have shifted to the left in the past four years, with this past year accelerating the process above all. I don’t know why, I don’t know how, but to me it’s clear from observing them that Trump has changed the way middle aged, middle class white suburban Americans think about race, and the change hasn’t been in his favor.	1610506520.0	gj2n71x	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj25udr	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2n71x/

winr5	Yes, lots of people are to blame, including the crazy Q crowd, but Mitch has a very large share. Whether fiscal conservatives like it or not, blocking the $2000 checks was foolish. It was extremely popular and at a time when a lot of the voters who didn't turn out needed it.  And hey, they're passing it anyways under Biden so it achieved nothing blocking it.  Just my view.

13agsq	Why is it so hard to realize that Trump committed impeachable offenses and if he never got into office, this never would have happened? He's a malignant narcissist. This wasn't very difficult to extrapolate from the beginning. It's perfectly fine to accept the election was not, in **fact**, rigged, and that Trump created this base of brainwashed lunatics. Directly inciting violence or not, this is on his hands and he has been the very antithesis of presidential. He's a cancer to this country. And it's funny how people are saying those who support him and went to the capitol are the true patriots, when the actual patriots denounced trump today.

4ivo5z7	It was a culmination of 2 month's worth of misinformation by the Trump team, and Trump telling the mob to march on the Capitol building -- shortly after Giuliani called for a "trial by combat" -- that is responsible for what happened.   Trump then went back to the Oval Office where he watched the destruction of the Capitol building and seemed to relish in the destruction. He didn't call on the National Guard, instead he locked himself up in the Oval Office and attacked Pence, David Perdue, and Kelly Loeffler for not *doing enough to defend him*. [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html)  Per several other news outlets, Trump withdrew himself from White House aides as the riots continued, isolating himself in the Oval Office and Presidential dining room while aides such as Mark Meadows were trying to reach him.  It wasn't until Pence stepped in that the National Guard was mobilized.   -  The President failed and put the lives of other American's at risk. Some lost their lives. And since Trump thinks he did nothing wrong, he needs to be punished. This is why I support impeachment.	1610544016.0	gj3y1gr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2w2j3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3y1gr/
1lii5tgv	I think we have a big problem of either being pro-Trump and throwing the entire rest of the GOP under the bus, abandoning the party unless it bows down to Trump’s every desire, or being like McConnell who completely refuses to stick up for Trump and, by extension, his 74 million voters.  I was attracted to Trump’s policies and how he appealed to us middle class people. But I’m not giving up on the GOP, especially when they’re far better than the alternative, even with all their flaws. Doesn’t mean I would support McConnell himself, but the GOP still has good members. It’s true I wish they’d do a LOT more, but even if it takes them 2 years to do something I want, it would take 2 months for a Democrat supermajority to do the OPPOSITE of what I wanted.  In other words, if we take a “Trump GOP or no GOP at all” stance, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.	1610503488.0	gj2hh67	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2bu8d	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2hh67/

rm4vh	I obviously don't want a civil war to occur as it will have severe repercussions on all americans not just the left or the right; however if it is 'inevitable with zero chance to stop it' then I beleive republicans should ensure to distance ourselves from the radical elements within our mids. If we lost history would be written in such a way as to place us alongside the holocaust.  The issue I find is how the media covers these events. Its mostly peacfull but fiery if perpetrated by left extremists and a coup if perpetrated by the right extremists. A lot can change if we simply change this and start treating events with the same degree of scrutiny inatead of "my side good u bad, no mine good you bad".  Im 100% for rhe 2nd ammendment but I dont think they will attempt to actually take peoples guns by force, both sides of the political spectrum have to know that it won't end well.  Lets just hope biden doesnt "become unfit for duty" (as planned by kamala) and then we have Kamala as President, cause that would be horrible.

If it weren’t for the Georgia races this would be a fantastic midterm result for the Republicans, and even with the Georgia races in mind I don’t think it’s as bad as a lot of the doomsayers are saying. Trump also got far more votes this time around and his performance from minority voters is a head turner for the Republican Party.  On the other hand Mitch sank the stimulus bill, which even Republican voters wanted, for no apparent good reason and is now trying to return the GOP to what it was before 2016, the GOP that was soundly rejected by the voter base in 2016. The fact that Trump was even a viable candidate in the first place is testament to how disliked the GOP old guard has become.  Trump did not break the party, the party broke itself by refusing to adapt, and if it doesn’t recover its on people like Mitch and Romney for doubling down on a failing model.	1610528763.0	gj3hetr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3gwmu	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3hetr/

After that they have to be on the presidents cabinet, VP, or POTUS. Change their benefits so they aren’t lifetime benefits. Make them have to put money into a retirement fund similar to a state employee retirement fund like teachers and highway workers.	1610516687.0	gj33u9x	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3213t	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj33u9x/
N/A	This is exactly right.  Our legislators cannot be experts on the many, many topics they are called to make decisions about.  Lobbyists are industry experts who are able to assist legislators by educating or advising them.  The problem is that lobbyist inherently have an interest in mind, and those interests are frequently at odds with the American people. If there were a way to disconnect lobbying and fundraising, then it might help prevent the rich and powerful from having easier access to our Representatives.	1610547453.0	gj43pja	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj349uj	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj43pja/

gskxb	rank choice voting is a scam to allow hate groups obtain elected office. it allows a plurality of votes to win an election which means a candidate with well less than the majority of the votes can win the election. if an election have 10 candidates and all of them got the same number of votes, one candidate will eventually win. if one of those candidate is a nazi, then he or she will have a chance to win.   a 2 party system actually helps prevents fringe groups from obtaining elected offices as it's very unlikely that such a group will gain close to half the votes needed to win an election.  the working class will always outnumber the inheritor class. only the stupid and naive working class people would go away from system that favors the majority and go with a system that benefits the minority.   then national popular vote will do away with the electoral college and is on the verge of being ratified.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National\_Popular\_Vote\_Interstate\_Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact)  the democratic party is the only party that supports worker's union and they are always getting sabotaged to the republicans always being the saboteurs. working class people voting republicans are like people who are timing the stock market without inside information. might as well be buying lottery tickets.	1610518131.0	gj35rjo	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2pcxo	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj35rjo/

xm9umvg	I'm onboard 100% with gerrymandering reform but I have some severe reservations about ranked choice. We just concluded an election, where a major party candidate saw nothing but corruption and malfeasance to the point, it incited actual violence against the capital building. I see a nothing  but holes for conspiracies, poor education, confusing logic to spew forth, making it it easier for candidates to claim fraud and other shenanigans and sow more doubt into out elections.   The first round of voting is essentially what we have now, RVC is going to add more rounds of voting, voting that will depend on a computer algorithm that will take votes from a loosing candidates and assign them to another candidate  The electorate must have complete faith in the computer systems that will be counting and redistributing votes and I just don't see us getting there.	1610512552.0	gj2xqnp	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2o1xs	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xqnp/

I'm not trying to be snarky, these are just legitimately the only policies I can remember Trump talking about and pushing through.   I guess he also could keep permanently separating children from their parents at the border. Or escalate his trade war with China and impose more tarriffs on Canada, one of our closest allies. He could have campaigned on continuing to flaunt professional advice on handling covid, which has killed ~1 in 90 Americans, but that's more a policy to have no policy, really...  Oh I've got it! He could have promised war with Iran, like he's been clamouring for.

N/A	I disagree, it takes a long time to build up the institutional knowledge in an organization like the Senate.  Usually 1st term senators won't do much of anything at the beginning, it will take a few years to get on any committees, and then a few more terms to cycle through enough of them to get a grasp of what's even happening in the country.   You do not want to be caught in the middle of a war or a major terror attack or natural disaster with half your legislature still needing help to find their seats.  Can you imagine if the military swapped out their officer corps every 12 years, what a disaster that would be for organization?  So how many terms is too many?  Maybe not 2, how about 4 or 5?  Well that's 24 or 30 years, you'll still end up with the same problems as today.  We both agree that there are some senators who stay well beyond their best by date, maybe we should make it easier to dislodge them, rather than throw out all experienced senators good or bad	1610504762.0	gj2jvcx	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hm4f	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2jvcx/

h6gij	Based on what I was taught in school, I am a Conservative (less government spending and interference, hence the term), but for every election I've been able to vote, there hasn't been a major Conservative candidate actually wanting to be Conservative. They're all about larger military budgets, private insurance (which costs the gov more), and making sure things like weed stay illegal so we can't tax it and pay for people to go to prison.  We don't need the world's largest military if we stay friendly with a bunch of people. I'd much rather make friends with a bunch of people that could help me beat up a threat, than have no friends and spend a fortune on guns so I can take out the threat myself.  And WEED IS JUST FREE TAXES! It doesn't kill people, and right now is just fueling "crime" and putting people in prison which again costs us money. I'd much rather be able to buy some bud legally and pay taxes to fix infrastructure as opposed to money coming out of my paycheck to house and feed people that got caught with their weed. And while we're at it, get rid of private prisons. They're there to make money off the gov, as opposed to paying prisons just the amount that they need. They aren't run by a millionaire getting rich off the gov, they are the gov.  I want Conservative politicians to start being Conservatives again, right now they might as well be a Capitalist 3rd party.	1610505602.0	gj2lgke	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hrp6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2lgke/

9ub6z	As a former conservative who has over time become more socially liberal, I used to think the same thing. Now I know better. You’d think conservatism is the philosophy that favors maximizing personal freedoms, it is not. Modern conservatism has become about maximizing profits and giving rights to corporations that supersede the rights of individuals. All while convincing conservatives it’s about “freedom,” while they slowly strip those freedoms away.	1610509036.0	gj2rrp3	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hrp6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2rrp3/

Having a government actually full of people wanting to help their fellow countryman and not rack up millions in campaign donations. Having career politicians who are there because they believe in the issues they support and not whatever their donors want would be incredible.

3byijeud	The thing is it should be no ones view point. Taking money from corporation is just bribery with extra steps. How the fuck is a politician suppose to be impartial on raising taxes on big corporations when a majority of their money comes from corporations. To be transparent I voted for Bernie in the primaries and Biden in the election. I am very sympathetic to libertarian ideas but before we can even think of trying it we have to have a system that work for everybody. I also want to say to all conservatives out there that I want to talk. I have been watching this sub for a while and a lot of the times it’s flair only users. I don’t down vote or up vote anything that I can’t comment on so I have not been brigading to be clear. Now some of y’all to be fair seem a little batshit but that is the minority. For those that would like to talk actual politics then feel free to do so.	1610512312.0	gj2xcvx	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hrp6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xcvx/

14raot	Democratic socialists, at least like me, have a lot of conservative values actually. Why do I want single payer healthcare? Because what we're doing now is wasteful. Why do I want to help the environment? Conservation. Social security? Respect for my elders. UBI? I'm actually against is except maybe as a band-aid for wealth inequality, but I worry about all the rampant consumerism using up resources.  I'm not sure, but that all feels very financially conservative.	1610515203.0	gj31rz9	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hrp6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj31rz9/

Personally, I think a donation should only be “free speech” if the company is 100% employee-owned, or something - or maybe require unanimous agreement of the owners.   They shouldn’t get to claim it’s “speech” without saying whose speech. As in, specifically which human people, not corporation-“people”.	1610517366.0	gj34rmq	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2idrl	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj34rmq/

13vg83	I personally think and believe that many people actually think this way. It is just that the more vocal people are also likely more extreme or appalled by the other side thus more likely to express their opinions. The issue seems that this vocality is what drives conversation.  A fight is always more interesting than a civil conversation. O better said is more catchy.	1610508655.0	gj2r3jp	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2j65y	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2r3jp/
38ucnp17	The issue is the extreme elements on the far ends of both sides. The reality is there's really 3 or 4 parties within the the 2 parties. Far right, populous right, populous left and the far left. You could argue that populous left and populous right could be one party cuz the difference between the two are so minor, it's basically like the difference between 2 people within the same party.  Personally, I think some of the best things they could do, would be to ban politicians from using social media in an official manner all together. Not even to campaign. Get rid of the R and D next to everyone's name on the ballot so all these uninformed voters can't just go in and vote down a certain party line just because some turd from some news organization pumped their head full of spewtum...speaking of which, something needs to be done about the media. I'm sick of major news outlets trying push opinions as facts. Their job is to show me what everyone said and did and let me make up my own damn mind, instead we have a little bit of news sadly twisted and spun in a way to fit a narrative surrounded by an overwhelming amount of op eds designed to get you worked up and pissed off. 5% misrepresented news and 95% bullshit.	1610529402.0	gj3i0yy	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2j65y	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3i0yy/

6kmxl	Yep, politics has been really testing on many relationships over the past few years (I lean left) and all because the powers at be fuel this artificial divide that isn't there. All of us who aren't loaded really have a million more things in common than those that actually dictate the way we live our lives.   There shouldn't be sides in politics. At the end of the day, we just want to live decent lives and for the country to be run well and our taxes spent in a way that benefits all of society.   Hulk Hogan was ridiculed once when he was asked whether or not he was left or right wing. He said something to the degree of 'I'm somewhere down the middle'. People ate that statement alive. But why? Think about that properly for a second. He agrees with views across the spectrum. There shouldn't be these great stone walls between us. Politics should be a spectrum. There are tonne of right wing ideals that I agree with and a tonne of left wing ideals that I think are stupid as fuck.

4a1ohxti	Yes, and that’s why the DNC got behind Biden and all the candidates fell in line with support for Biden while Bernie was killing it out the gate. Same reason supposed left wing media like CNN and msnbc lost their shit when Bernie was the front runner. Our corporate overlords are terrified of the man. He truly is a statesman that works for the common man and doesn’t abuse his power and take corporate donations. He’s consistent and honest, whether you agree or disagree with his policies.	1610523260.0	gj3bs6f	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2nrk3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3bs6f/

13vg83	Talking about fallacies. Generalization is not going to prove your point. You imply that all Republicans are either willfully ignorant or willfully ignoring these situations. The same way some Dems don't represent liberal views of certain people, same happens to Republicans.

13vg83	There is always the state path. Not all legislation have to be federal. States can and put national pressure by passing certain legislation. It is easier to vote state senator, district representatives. I agree that the status quo is a big force to reckon with. Even so we cannot stop voting. Whether you think it is rigged or not, the moment we stop playing we let other people make choices for us ( I know they already are, but all influence is lost).	1610508353.0	gj2qkiz	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2j8z2	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2qkiz/

baythvu	The allegation is that he meant the exact opposite of what he said. Sort of like the mob guy, who is not really all that concerned that "something might happen to that nice place you got there". Or an excellent chess player who laments "OH NO, MY QUEEN!" after playing a move that obviously left the piece exposed.  It is a literary or rethoric device called "antiphrasis", and is often used with sarcasm. And just as sarcasm is very hard to detect in a transcript alone, this also requires every bit of nuance and context to recognise.  I watched excerpts of it, and they did amp up the crowd by constantlt thowing around terms like "fighting for" "taking back" "Showing strength". At some point Mr. Giuliani actually suggested using "trial by combat". But you know, a peaceful trial by combat, as they probably said in the disclamer. "This is not a substitute for medical advice. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health care provider with any questions you may have regarding trial by combat"  But whether it actually constitutes incitement will likely be up to legal scholars.	1610505190.0	gj2kod8	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2fvst	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2kod8/
aipkc	> There is a large portion of populace that believes (wrongly or not) that there were shenanigans in last election.   It went to court around 50 times and lost, and in most (all?)of the disputed states the elections were run by Republicans.  Georgia did not just an audit, but a full audit, re-examining every ballot.  Every state in dispute with electronic voting had moved to a system printed receipts.    Trump claimed fraud in the 2016 primaries against other Republicans when he lost some early states, claimed over 5 million fraudulent votes in the 2016 general, and announced again and again over the course of months leading to the 2020 general that there was going to be fraud.  Him claiming fraud adds no new information, because he was going to claim it no matter what.  Even on election night before the votes were counted he claimed it, when he could not have known, and gave no, specific details.  In the end the best he came up with was the Kraken lady who had done interviews with Q-anon podcasts and just spouted really crazy conspiracy theories.	1610508853.0	gj2rg2d	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2havj	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2rg2d/

(A couple hours later, he was filmed cheering Spazzo on as he broke the Capitol window, and was among the first to climb through into the building.) Biggs is heard giving military-style orders to his troop of plain-clothed Proud Boys, telling them to “Tighten up,” “Hold,” or turn. In the past, he’s bragged that Proud Boys events are a tightly run ship.   >“When we set out to do an event, we go, OK, what is our main objective? That’s the first thing we discuss. We take three months to plan an event,” Biggs said on a podcast last month. “It’s like, you’re literally planning to go into a combat zone.

1j0wef2f	I agree that there isn't compelling evidence that he incited violence (the crime most likely in question) to convict in a criminal court, that isn't how an impeachment works. you don't have to commit any crime to be impeached. It's a political tool. The phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" pointed to in the constitution is really vague. High crimes according to what definition and against who? Misdemeanors as in a crime punishable by less than 12 months in jail, like running a stop sign? Or Misdemeanor as in rude conduct towards another person? (most likely the latter since i don't think misdemeanors were codified yet).	1610505855.0	gj2lxun	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2gov4	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2lxun/

N/A	These are a great example of how Carlin wasn’t half as smart as he gets credit for  First he is/you are pretending that it’s only republicans who give the rich free money. Were you in a coma during Obama’s presidency or just in preschool? Have you never questioned why literally every corporation serves the democrats? Time to grow up and stop pretending only republicans are con artists. The dems are just as awful. None of the good stuff they do is for good reasons. They basically just pour miracle grow on poor people because the more poor people there are the more job security they have  Then his abortion argument is retarded. There’s a huge difference between *not murdering someone* and *forcing other people to give them money*. The conservative stance on this is perfectly consistent: they want parents to be responsible for themselves and their kids. See? Was that so hard?   Then the part about war goes right back to pretending it’s only the republicans who are pro war. This shit is juvenile. Are you trapped in the year 2000?

7asov	Oh I'm aware. The Dems were playing games with the relief package before the general election, (See 60 Minutes interview with Pelosi.) Trump gave the GOP a chance to flip it on them, and instead the GOP came off as the bad guy. It literally was a campaign message after that point that was used against the GA senators. The Senate could have easily put together a clean bill for the extra 1400 and either the house would have to sign off on it, or kill it. By not moving on it, the GOP in the Senate got out maneuvered.   I wouldn't have gotten it, so it's not like I'm fighting for it for myself. But generally there was wide support for the change among both parties. Mitch needed to help out the seats in GA after the demoralizing impact of the post election rhetoric. The momentum was in the GOP legislature's favor with the number of seats that they picked up in the House. instead it was squandered.	1610512364.0	gj2xfw6	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2vhsj	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xfw6/

42osx2ip	Thank god! You scared me for a moment. Yeah the problem is if their opinion on trump isn’t based in reality, nothing from reality can convince them to change it. It’s fool proof. It’s populism. Short sound bites. Meaningless legislation and blaming everything on everyone else.  The election was rigged, the democrats are to blame, the GOP are traitors, news is fake.  Literally everyone is wrong except trump and I don’t know how to combat that because truth and facts mean nothing to them.  The real weird thing that I really want to see some science about is that a bunch of staunch democrats fell for trump as well. But I think people are suddenly starting to realise that riding this wave of populism is dangerous. I for one can’t wait for GOP to leave that lot behind. I don’t think they realised what was happening when they rode the wave of trumps populism. Suddenly I think they realise that being the party in power just isn’t worth the risk and the damage the is trump.  We’re just lucky he was an idiot, imagine what a smart trump could do.	1610516765.0	gj33y5l	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2qet3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj33y5l/
67kgmjax	But they have found pretty strong evidence that trump purposefully and intentionally orchestrated the attack as well as the soft response. Ill also point out that he did specifically tell them to go to the capitol and "fight", right after Giuliani told them to enact "trial by combat" - just bc they didnt explicitly say "kill the congressmen" doesnt mean that's not exactly what he was communicating and he knew it. He refused to answer the calls to bring in the national guard, ignored the calls from key officials, and just weeks ago set up the Pentagon with unqualified individuals in top positions, who were also conveniently unavailable or unwilling to act during the attack.   Also there is strong implications that republican representatives colluded with the rioters. One, Lauren Boebert, live tweeted the movements of the speaker (pelosi) after being explicitly told not to reveal anyone's location not even to family. Paul Gosar was whipping up the trump base into a frenzy in the weeks before the attack. The organizers of the riot even admitted to being in consistent contact with, and to be coordinating with, several congressmen (as of yet unnamed but I'm sure that will come out soon).   Anyone still defending trump is just closing their eyes, plugging their ears, and employing wishful thinking at this point. The writing on the wall is quite damning	1610518746.0	gj36jk8	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj341lk	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36jk8/
N/A	I think it’s deliberately naive to say that Trump didn’t know exactly what he was doing just because he didn’t outright call for violence.   I think it’s also highly dangerous to allow that sort of behaviour to go unchecked.  And when you say “part” of his base - where are the rest of the base coming out to condemn the minority? All I see are excuses and “oh what about this thing the left did.” When Muslim extremists blow up a building there is so much outrage that the broader Muslim community doesn’t do more to weed out these “bad apples” so why not hold Americans to the same standard? Get rid of these unhinged pricks.  Nowhere have I condoned anything done by the left, so I think we can say we more or less (or as close as it gets) agree on your counter points (CHAZ, baseball shooter, BLM riots going too far).  All I will say is that I see Jan 6 as far more significant given how close the terrorists (I see no better word to describe them) actually got to those in power.   As far as politicians outright supporting what happened, you know as well as I do that none of them are stupid enough to say that publicly.   But I think anybody with half a brain can see that some, such as Boebert, Brooks, Hawley, Cruz, Trump (just off the top of my head) and others were all for it.   I’m not saying arrest Trump for a crime that he didn’t commit in a way that’s prove-able in court. I am saying that he is a danger and his base need to call this shit out at an absolute bare minimum.	1610517705.0	gj357oz	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj341lk	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj357oz/
14fba8	> Leftists have done far worse  What about what about...  That’s not the issue here.  The POTUS gave a speech calling his supporters to fight for their country, and minutes later they were savagely beating a policeman with an American flag pole while shouting GO USA and singing the national anthem, then waving a Nazi flag inside the Capitol building and hunting for representatives and senators on both sides.  They went to disrupt the vote, exactly what the POTUS asked for.   This is beyond the pale.	1610518621.0	gj36dxf	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj31jxp	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36dxf/
N/A	I don’t think left wing protests have done worse.  I don’t condone the BLM protests, but this was worse.  Just think about the significance of the ideologies that were the driving force behind the insurrection.   The Nazi flag. The Confederate flag. Bold symbols of hatred that represent everything that the US is supposed to stand against, being waved inside the capital for the first time in history, side by side with Trump flags, with death threats being chanted towards elected leaders.  Sure, most protesters outside were peaceful. But so far, the vast majority of them are making excuses for what happened by saying “oh sorry a few of them got carried away.”  I don’t buy that. People took time off work, bought plane tickets, drove interstate, dressed up in military gear and talked online for weeks about literally storming the capital. This was not a “moment” for these people, it was premeditated and it isn’t over.  The rest of the crowd enabled this through being passive and now making excuses for the minority.  It’s mind blowing that this is being minimised and excused by so many conservative Americans.  As far as Trump goes, part of me doesn’t think he could have organised anything more than this without somebody in the military catching wind. His best bet was rolling the dice by riling up the masses to maintain plausible deniability.	1610516197.0	gj336bs	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj31jxp	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj336bs/
67kgmjax	The fact they broke in is less alarming than the fact that the police helped them do it and then let them walk out with no consequences. Not all the police did, some did their jobs - and they died for it. The situation was intentionally set up to allow this to happen, by drastically reducing the quality of security and their equipment in comparison to similar events. This in addition to trumps purposeful inaction when asked to bring in the national guard, imho proves this was intentional. They knew for months that people were planning this, FBI told capitol police and the White House and they actively chose to reduce security and underarm them.	1610519346.0	gj37a8k	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj31jxp	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj37a8k/

So many ‘conservative’ Americans seem to be all too eager to justify the fucking NAZI FLAG being flown in the nation’s heart.   What on earth is going on???

1779vv	He held a rally for an already pissed off crowd next to the capitol building and riled them up more when pence certified the vote. He then sat back and watched as they stormed the capitol and did NOTHING to stop it. Fuck, he took more of a serious tone when Kaepernick took a knee than when insurrectionists stormed the capitol with Trump flags, Nazi gear, guns, zip ties, Molotov cocktails, and confederate flags. He then sat by as they beat a police officer to death and then tweeted out that he loved them.   He has stirred this pot and turned the temperature up for months by not conceding and instead knowingly spreading lies about election fraud even though 60+ court cases got laughed away by judges and the SCOTUS. He knew this was his last attempt at holding onto power and he is a huge reason this happened in the first place.   A lot of these people wouldn’t be there if it weren’t for his “stop the steal” rally and his vitriol rhetoric. He is absolutely to blame for this.

3tpag	That Obama quote is taken completely out of context and you have reversed the meaning. He was giving a speech in Europe. Here's what he said:  &nbsp;   And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution -- that a particular set of ideals began to emerge: The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose. The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.  And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men -- and women -- are created equal. But those ideals have also been tested -- here in Europe and around the world.  Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. **This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign.**	1610514895.0	gj31bz1	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj302wl	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj31bz1/

62vp9	Thank god for that. Unregulated capitalism had kids working coal mines. You can't just totally let loose that economic system, it values profits above human quality of life.  Social capitalism is the way to go, I have to imagine everyone on this sub pretty much agrees with that. We might just disagree on what the tax brackets should be and what should fall under the umbrella of the "social" part of social capitalism.  Bernie Sanders is a social capitalist. Ronald Reagan is a social capitalist. The "Libertarian Party" are social capitalists. The Green Party are social capitalists.  What Americans rail against as "socialism" is hilarious. It's literally just the same old social capitalism with slightly more taxes on the most wealthy and things like healthcare and higher education added to the "social" bit.	1610514934.0	gj31e0c	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj309fp	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj31e0c/

6jmdp	You're right. And the thing that would terrify them the most is if any political leader developed enough of a cult of personality that he could feasibly command his followers to overthrow the checks and balances and his followers would dutifully acquiesce.   So you've just described why Donald Trump, regardless of what he wanted to achieve on 1/6, is terrifying. Because he could've told those idiots to actually create a revolution at the capitol and they would've done it, no question. That power is terrifying to the founders. All the checks and balances they put in don't matter if some maniac can brainwash enough people into thinking that doing his bidding is more important than the constitution.   Again, Trump's intentions don't matter here. It's the fact that he assembled thousands of his followers for his purposes and *could've* chosen to unleash them in a much more violent way, if he cared to do so, and all of them would've obeyed, that's the exact kind of personality and power that the founders would've been scared of.	1610502444.0	gj2fj14	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj28l0w	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2fj14/

Thomas Jefferson once said "if I could not go to heaven but with a party I would not go there at all"  speaking of heaven, this risk of abundance of power is likely also where they were going with the separation of church and state. wouldnt their great grandparents /ish be the generation of the protestant reformation? so it had to be somewhat fresh in their minds that mixing monotheism with government poses an enormous risk in abuse of power, and autocracy if a bad actor were to successfully become a prominent voice of faith	1610532535.0	gj3l23c	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj28l0w	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3l23c/

hgmlo	Its pretty irrelevant saying peacefully when you've loaded everyone's gun.  POTUS spent months concentrating only on Stop the Steal. People were getting things like 13 emails a day from the campaign alone calling for help to 'save their country' and other verbatim, that's before all the twitter 'evidence', much of what was being repeated had already been through and found incorrect in court. Every day for months full on doomer about Communism! Fraud! Stolen! Your country needs you! We must fight! Don't let them steal your country! RINO! The pre storm rally POTUS mentioned 'fight' or 'fighting' 20 or so times...  It's not particularly prophetic that after telling people not to consume dissenting media and bombarding them with 'End of America' type stuff for months that a group would actually do something about it.

kuxrg	I'm not wealthy.  I make about $35k.  I pay much less in taxes under Trump's tax plan than I did previously.  He brought relief to the heavily regulated energy sector.  He's helped rejuvenate the auto industry and has taken steps to support the manufacturing of products stateside that could previously only be made in China, which large corporations, including Big Pharma, don't like because it interferes with their ability to use Chinese slave labor.  What about his travel ban?  His 450 miles of wall exists, unlike what wasn't there four years ago.  Arizona and Texas have seen much less illegal immigration, human trafficking, and controlled substances coming over the border.      You may not believe it, but he likes holding roundtable meetings with common folks to hear their ideas.  He takes time out of his schedule to call people he knows who are sick, lost a loved one, or experienced some other difficulty.  He's cleared tons of regulatory blocks that prevented people from achieving things that they now can.  If you don't know about any of this, that means you've been spending too much time consuming false narratives.	1610532199.0	gj3kqh9	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3jnyw	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3kqh9/

12ukuw	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_United_States_racial_unrest  > Further unrest quickly spread throughout the United States, sometimes including rioting, looting, and arson. By early June, at least 200 American cities had imposed curfews, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C, had activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel in response to unrest.[13][14][15] By the end of June, at least 14,000 people had been arrested at protests.[16][17][18] Polls have estimated that between 15 million and 26 million people had participated at some point in the demonstrations in the United States, making them the largest protests in United States history.[19][20][21] It was also estimated that between May 26 and August 22, around 93% of protests were "peaceful and nondestructive".[22][23] According to several studies and analysis, protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, with police and counter-protesters sometimes starting violence.[24][25][26] According to a September 2020 estimate, arson, vandalism and looting caused about $1–2 billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8, making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history.[8][27]	1610501430.0	gj2do1k	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj29f3u	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2do1k/

jae6zwt	Well they spend time that could be spent passing and discussing legislation, and that's time that can never be recuperated. However, if fully impeached, it will mean he (and his family) will no longer maintain a secret service after his term. Saves man-power from being utterly wasted on someone who blatantly stoked the flames of sedition and seeded massive doubts in our election security despite being proven utterly wrong around every corner.  Regardless, it's entirely possible his impeachment flops because he spoke in ways where he heavily implied he wants to take America by force, but also leaving it entirely up to interpretation.  Shamelessly doubting our elections though was way over the fucking line for me, especially with a horrendously awful 0 cases ruled in his favor following Election Day (and still going on about it being stolen.)	1610519025.0	gj36w4k	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3590n	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36w4k/

Long term and short term it's a huge mistake to oppose it and I will never understand why he did. It's not like it was out of the blue, it was a direct response to a nationwide catastrophe.

hs3ca	There is no "going back". Mitch has been pushing his same neocon agenda this whole time.   I think Mitch always viewed Trump as a necessary evil to get what he wanted, which was to transform the courts for generations.  It seems like Trump thought he was appointing lackeys to the courts that would do his bidding for him, but he was actually selecting from a list picked by McConnell and his friends who are much more aligned with McConnell's ideology than Trump's.	1610501381.0	gj2dkrr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj268rm	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2dkrr/

14fba8	Resigning might convince a lot of R’s and even some D’s that we should all just move on, which might be enough to avoid conviction.

leirbsk	I mean what I think a bout it is that the GOP is dead (after both Mitch, Romny, or pretty much the RINOS). Trumps ideas and plans I honestly think is what got him in but is personality (in witch I will admit I'm not pleased with) is what got him out. But really who is left at this point? Do we just roll over and die? Because the RINOS just side with the dems all the time or completely 360 their dissensions. From what I could think of we have Ted Cruze but IDK. And yes the left at this point is just a CCP puppet, or CPA if you will. But as far as I'm concerned, there will never, ever be another Republican president. I think the Libertarian party may have more of a chance (finally) then any Republican at this point.	1610512920.0	gj2yc64	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2t2w6	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2yc64/

rzte6	The republicans have plenty to gain out of stopping him from running again. 4 years from now Trump may not be in good enough health to run but he can campaign and make noise that he will from the second he is out of office forcing any would be republican to address him. Taking away his ability to run at all allows them to more completely ignore him, someone else or more likely multiple people will try to court the Trumpers but they would lack an obvious candidate. That's my take.	1610504604.0	gj2jkff	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2cpbc	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2jkff/

uo4sg	I don’t like Trump, but had he told people to wear red MAGA facial masks in February, the economy would be better, he would have made a fortune and the election would have been a landslide victory for him.  Point being, there were enough voters to give him the highest ever amount of Republican voters, and he only lost because more people went out to vote against him due to... him not understanding the value of shutting up and listening to the experts once in a while.  So theoretically, Trump can run in four years and actually stand a chance at winning again. And it wouldn’t even be a long shot, depending on how much Biden fucks up when leading the country.	1610504178.0	gj2irta	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2cpbc	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2irta/

62vp9	Clearly the correct ones? This isn't a hypothetical here. An insurrection of the US Capitol happened directly following speeches from Trump, Jr, and Giuliani.  He and his team drew a crowd to the DC Mall on Jan 6th, they told these people their democracy was under attack, that the election was stolen, that they need to fight or lose their country forever, that evil was about to prevail. Giuliani talked about trial by combat. Don Jr even said some crazy shit like how they'd be taking notes on which people there were cowards and he'd show up in their backyards (the fuck?). Trump had Tweets saying things were going to get wild.  People in the crowd had zip ties and weapons. They built gallows on the Capitol steps to "hang Mike Pence". They beat police to death.  Let me ask you this I guess. If Trump and Co hadn't spent the last weeks lying to their supporters that Biden stole the election, coordinated them all to be in DC to try and interrupt Pence and the Senate from confirming the vote, fired them up with all kinds of crazy langue, AND even pointed them at the Capitol and told them to march with Trump...would there have been violence at the Capitol that day? The answer is obviously no.  Trump also has a pattern of issuing presidential pardons to anyone committing crimes on his behalf. That's the kind of shit that emboldens these people even more. Like...he pardoned literal war criminals who murdered children. Pretty safe bet he'll pardon you for whatever you do to overturn the US election for him.	1610519640.0	gj37n6u	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2c08i	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj37n6u/

hupkt	The democrats are fairly neoliberal, which in the rest of the world is a centre-right wing ideology. The only outlier I can see is Bernie Sanders, who has repeatedly failed to attract majority support from within the party for being too progressive  The only reason they're considered 'the left' in the US is because your right wing party holds views considered too extreme by conservatives in other first world countries.  I know more than a few conservatives who support abortion rights and universal healthcare, this doesn't make them progressive, these policies have just been around for far longer and are valued systems of our society, systems that those people want to conserve and protect. The US has never had these policies on a national scale so they're not considered 'traditional'  much of the backlash against universal healthcare in the US is about how much it'll cost but only $400 of my yearly tax goes towards healthcare, its so cheap that no one really cares, I still pay fuck all in taxes anyway compared to what I earn  Say what you will about this but our political landscape is far less divisive because there is more equal ground for both sides.	1610500723.0	gj2cct5	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2717u	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2cct5/

565j8qpv	Yes, civil wars can be nasty and the NASTIER they are, they then can create animosities that last decades and generations even.  Many people are the 'go along to get along' types in America -  who get 'sold a bill of goods' (lies) by progressives who really only want opportunities to seize power AND those ordinary folk wont balk much at returning to what was 'normal' before the leftist's "transformation'".  Guns?  They prevent the tyrant-wannabees from the power they seek.  The People can say NO as long as they are armed - So disarming the population is the first priority of tyrants.  (The Founders were VERY Wise People to make provisions for this in THE LAW OF THE LAND).  I have no hopes, with the things biden has already said he would do, and the pressure the leftist radicals use when they make  demands,  and biden  is too weak to stop the things that even HE doesnt believe in.  .	1610533375.0	gj3lv3e	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3l67i	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3lv3e/

lfhob	I mean that I think the average low information voter who tends to just vote their party will, broadly speaking, continue to do so. Let's say Trump truly does intend to take on the GOP as a whole and becomes part of starting a new conservative political party. That could be bad news for the GOP. Trump has shown that he can draw in votes for himself, but he has in some cases had down-ballot races go against his preferred pick. In my opinion that suggests it's Trump on the ballot that mattered more to some people in those races than other factors.  In this hypothetical situation, a new conservative party with Trump headlining the ballot could indeed draw away a number of GOP voters and threaten the republican party. However, if Trump were unable to run for office, but still went on to take part in the formation of a new party, his "star power" would be missing from the ballot, and it may be less effective, and consequently less of a threat. Rank and file voters who just vote party line would likely continue to do so, and upstarts or agitators (in terms of candidates) within the GOP would be easier to clamp down on because their opportunity to find success outside the GOP political machine would be reduced. Consequently, the thinking could be that Trump would have much less power to threaten the GOP if he were unable to run.  I apologize for the slightly disjointed explanation as my thoughts are a bit all over the place, but I hope I was able to articulate it in a way that helped.	1610529911.0	gj3iivd	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3hetr	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3iivd/

Third year: Some stuff, not as much though. Reelection campaign begins in later half  Fourth year: Re-election full on. Nothing gets done.   With the current model, and a huge want for sitting Presidents to get re-elected, we’re lucky if we even get four years of work if they do, and only a year at least if they don’t.

16azfv	Ranked choice (or some variant), yes.  term limits, no.  With gerrymandered districts and first past the post voting, term limits just exchange the problem of bad long serving representatives with a series of ever-worsening short serving representatives.   New congressmen tend to be relatively incompetent. They're new! Everyone is terrible when they're new at something. Without experienced colleagues providing structure and guidance, fresh crops of congressmen are going to lean even harder on the expertise of lobbyists and their Ilk.

Then, for decades it was north vs south. For the past few decades it’s been rural vs urban. The urban demographic is increasing.

3p3rzi8p	That's adorable. You've omitted literally everything in the bill that has anything to do with what I said.  Exhibit A: "Of the funds appropriated under title III of the Act that are made available for assistance for Pakistan, not less than $15,000,000 shall be made available for democracy programs and not less than $10,000,000 shall be made available for gender programs." Yep. $10 million. For gender programs. In Pakistan.   Exhibit B: Funds for "Resource Study of Springfield (Illinois) Race Riot." That riot occurred in (checks notes) 1908.   Exhibit C: "Statement Of Policy Regarding The Succession Or Reincarnation Of The Dalai Lama." We'll just leave that one there.   Exhibit D: There's actually a commission tasked with educating "consumers about the dangers associated with using or storing portable fuel containers for flammable liquids near an open flame."    Exhibit E: Another $40 million will be allocated "for the necessary expenses for the operation, maintenance and security" of The Kennedy Center, which received $25 million in another COVID-19 relief bill earlier this year. Also in a related story, the Kennedy Center has been closed.   Exhibits F, G, H, I, J: $86 million for assistance to Cambodia; $130 million to Nepal, $135 million to Burma, $453 million to Ukraine, $700 million to Sudan.   Exhibit K: The bill creates a Women's History Museum and an American Latino Museum as part of the Smithsonian. Overall, the Smithsonian gets (checks notes again) $1 billion.  There's more, but that oughtta do it.	1610512758.0	gj2y2rx	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2vaps	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2y2rx/

i3haos	See, this is more of an issue of opposing worldviews than it is of Conservative/Liberal opinion.  It was fairly well explained in another post and I'm too lazy to hunt it down, but the TL;DR is as follows:  There are a certain number of idiosyncratic "pillars" when it comes to morals.  \-Loyalty: Faithfulness to those you surround yourself with  \-Purity: protection of that which is considered valuable.  \-Justice/Equality: Ensuring that fairness is achieved in all things.  \-Honesty: Truthfulness so that the system can function at it's peak.  People with a Liberal mindset value Justice/Equality and Honesty over Loyalty and Purity.  People with a Conservative mindset value Loyalty and Purity over Justice/Equality and Honesty.  I'm aware that this comes off as biased *(and I am very much liberal in that regard)*, but I'll explain in the not TL;DR section below.  Going in to more detail here:  The Liberal worldview is one that will happily forsake inherent loyalty and perceived purity if means creating a Free, Fair and Honest world to live in. Things like Religion, which is a paragon of Purity and Loyalty aren't relevant when taking in to consideration more important things like the welfare and safety of people. Higher taxes are simply the price to pay for improved living quality and standards.  It's a mindset of the ends justify the means and the sacrifices made along the way are just the price to pay for achieving the goal of a better society.  The Conservative worldview is one that will fight, tooth and nail, to ensure that Loyalty and Purity are preserved even if it's at the cost of inherent honesty and perceived Justice/Equality.  Conservatives have an insane amount of reverence for tradition and very often adhere to the adage of "If it's not broke, don't fix it." Loyalty among peers and Purity of Ideals *(I'm unsure if this is the right word to put here, but I'm going with it.)* are King in this world view. There's a constant struggle in the Conservative worldview of whether or not it's the right thing to do to betray your brothers and sisters for the sake of Honesty. The same goes for the idea of staining Purity for the sake Justice/Equality.  The Ideal is that the ends can never justify the means if you "forget where you came from" or if don't "Take care of your own."  The two worldviews, in their extremes, *(And that's what we have in America. Extreme American Conservatism in the GOP and Extreme American Liberalism in the DNC, both with the permissible outliers.)* are diametrically opposed. Conservatives value one half of the "pie" and are impartial to the other and Liberals value the other half and are impartial to the first.  You have a country that consists of people who have opposite beliefs on what is "The right thing to do."  Liberals want to cast way the anchor that holds us back and move on to a better future at any cost.  Conservatives will revere their history and carry it with them until the end of time, no matter what.  Both mindsets are convinced that to capitulate to the other is to invite catastrophe.  Even if we eliminate the Two Party system, the problem doesn't suddenly go away. Even if we introduce Ranked Voting, Tribalism is endemic to our politics.  I don't much like Biden. He feels, to me, like a half-assed choice that runs on the same "I'm not the other guy" campaign as Orange Man did. But he was right about one thing:  The country needs to heal.  Trouble is that we've got open wounds and there is not single treatment. America's divide goes back for centuries and it would take decades more to so much as close up, let alone even think about starting to scab over.  The damage done by the systemic indoctrination of our politics will take generations and that's only assuming that cooperation can be achieved.

10k29k	Can I argue with you for a second?  I have never understood this conservative logic. I don’t understand why anyone would trust mega Corp x over a public institution for anything. Mega Corp primary incentive is to make money at all costs be it at human, environment, or resource expense. Government incentive (tries to be- get mega Corp $ away from politics) is to make the lives of every citizen better and keep them safe. Sure mega Corp might be faster/efficient/cheaper but that comes at the cost of punishing human labor or environmental destruction to get there.   How does smaller government/less regulation/less taxes make my life better? How does turning over necessary functions that make my life better over to mega Corp Make my life better? All I have seen in my life is mega Corp take advantage of me or someone else at every turn to make profits for the select few powerful?  Mega Corp doesn’t exist to help people.

If that were the case, then given our voting system, conservatives would be hard pressed to win any federal office.   This unfortunate situation for the right could serve as leverage to finally get rid of our first past the post voting system and install ranked choice voting. That, in addition to campaign finance reform, would shatter the two party system and give parties like the Libertarian Party or the Green Party a fighting chance. It could easily be the end for the Democratic Party and the GOP.	1610522023.0	gj3af2b	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2lgke	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3af2b/

158ye3	Full disclosure, I'm a person who votes blue in general but would vote conservative more often if the efforts matched up with ideals. I'm ears and eyes open but only have two choices. That being said, here's my conservative take on your question:  The idea of a Republic only works if the elected officials can be trusted to successfully determine and represent the views of their constituents. Conservative ideals in general favor smaller government and sensible spending policies that empower local governments to function together, but with autonomy, and prioritize individual liberties, right? Where do massive subsidies and corporate tax breaks fit in? I'll expand a bit.   When big players enter the scene that make money off of the backs of people that may live in that district and believe in the values of the company *or* may not and simply need a job to pay for things, they are essentially using the production of those workers to further their own interests rather than the interests that the workers themselves may have vested that time and money into. And most of the people profiting off of the success of the company aren't interested in eating more beans or decreasing the price of a product, they probably aren't chicken product enthusiasts, they want their retirement fund to grow or make a living by trading their capital. Those aren't the people or products that are interested in the multitude of legislation that a politician will be involved with. It doesn't serve the local or state governments when hyperfocused but multinational interests get involved.     Big money doesn't fund a politician for free. They'll hand over legislature for them to pass, which falls in to what I've mentioned above but results in things like: more dollars for subsidies on things the public didn't ask for (high fructose corn syrup and E85, anyone?), paying private prisons per capita which makes sentencing more appealing which means more taxpayer money will have to pour in to the rest of the justice system and more arrests. Were conservative constituents the ones to insist that we need more cops, more Mega-Farms, less farmers, clean air and water? I don't think so, because I don't think Con-Agra, Monsanto, or the CCA speak for those people.   The Federal government should be doing what it does best, giving money out in the interest of the nation. My progressive mind thinks we can afford more, but conservatively, all states need roads, rails, communication, education and assistance if disaster strikes. That costs money, and usually if the big money donors don't want a payout, they don't want to pay in. The money has to come from somewhere, but if an official loses their campaign budget they can't reach the people they call their constituents to make sure they vote for them. So they might introduce legislature that gives everyone a tax break that expires after they've passed the election game, except for their true long-term supporters, or simply try to get away with loosening a few regulations that won't really hurt anyone until something explodes underground.   Nobody wants undrinkable water, increased likelihood of being arrested or getting cancer just for existing somewhere, missed opportunities for children, or high taxes with little to show in our daily lives but cracked roads and super sweetened everything.   > I think we all can agree that citizens united was a mistake	1610510389.0	gj2u4a4	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2igkz	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2u4a4/

He doesn't need to run to keep the votes in for blue, he could just stay in the senate and talk. However, in every one of his democratic debates he always talked about the flaws of the DNC and how they're also bought by the corporations.

7y7xhjz9	Populist and right-wing white-centric nationalism based around fighting the perceived enemy (the minority "elite") exploiting the rights of the lower middle class and around the idea that globalization and a changing world is bad. The constituents are easily swayed and have been indoctrinated, some by religious fanaticism, some by anti-liberal propaganda (not against actual liberal policy, just against the idea of a changing world) to the point that they'll call for their own party's Vice President to be executed for failing to do something he couldn't constitutionally do.  Trumpism was co-opted by conspiracy theories and false prophecies early on for political gain, and gives the movement an impervious armor against facts: once someone is deep enough in the rabbit hole, it's much easier to dig one step deeper ("well SCOTUS is deep state too!") than ever accept defeat or admit they were wrong.  *“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.” -* Jean-Paul Sartre  Not implying that all Trump supporters are antisemitic, but the same concept is at play. Evidence-based reasoning is considered a fallacy that can be thrown out on the slightest bit of perceived evidence to the contrary. "Antifa" false-flagging the Jan 6 riots even though actual Trump supporters had been planning to raid the capital building on Parler and TDW for weeks. Denying senior scientific experts' C-19 recommendations just because the God-Emperor said to. Turning on everyone who "backstabs" the president like a pack of rabid wolves, while the president is increasingly cornered and is running out of people to point at. First it's "RINOs", then Raffensperger/Kemp, then SCOTUS, then Romney, McConnell, Pence, Graham, Cruz, soon it'll be Pompeo after the DoS update today citing the transition to the incoming Biden admin.  If you're internally committed to the globalist Marxist anti-Trump conspiracy being true, anything and everything bad that happens to "your team" can be written off as "the enemy" just being even worse than you thought they were. At some point (about 2 weeks ago for anyone paying attention) they decided "the enemy" was too strong to defeat legally, so they started planning various forms of insurrections. Jan 6 was remarkably tame considering what's on Parler and TDW these days, and I doubt the days leading up to Biden's inauguration will be free of violence either. And it's all in the name of a coastal elite big-city conman who was a registered Democrat for most of his youth and has zero actual conservative values. I'll never understand it. It's peak tribal populism and I hope it dies in a fire.	1610502492.0	gj2fmbm	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2cc4w	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2fmbm/

N/A	Allowing people to more easily and safely vote during a worldwide pandemic somehow stacks the deck in Biden's favor?  Looking at PA specifically- The PA Supreme Court ruled that the changes made to election law in PA were constitutional, and I fail to see how you can argue that these changes were somehow unconstitutional when the highest authority on state constitutional law in PA, namely the PA SC, ruled otherwise. The USSC then refused to take up the case , affirming the decision of the PA Supreme Court.  That should have been the absolute end of it but a number of republicans still persisted and objected to the certification of the election, which sure, realistically only amounted to more debate and a waste of time, but I think you're missing the point that their objections further validated the reasoning and mindset of the mob that invaded the capitol- namely that the election was somehow rigged and therefore illegitimate, and so their cause was just. This is nothing like the protests that occured over the summer as there is no instance of any protestors or rioters trying to interfere with a constitutional process during that time. Protestors supporting Trump invading the capitol during the constitutionally mandated process of certification is exactly that- an attempt to disrupt and subvert a constitutional process, and is why the storming of the capitol can be labeled an insurrection or even sedition.	1610502957.0	gj2ghdd	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2dm95	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2ghdd/

go66o	I think Trump has pitched a story of fraud he was invariably going to pitch regardless of circumstance in what was a legitimate election, and I don't buy into the story of unconstitutional election fraud. It's nonsense. Given that Trump has damaged our image and hurt our Democracy. Dude has to go.   What we do now sets what we as a society find acceptable. Remember that if we don't remove him and Biden, or more likely and worse Kamala, cast doubt on the outcome on an election and seek to work with state government to secure it's overturn. You are setting your approval for that now. Choose wisely.	1610510145.0	gj2tpb3	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2dm95	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2tpb3/

z4q6g	I did not say that he is right and there was wide spread fraud (there was no proof presented of one).  I said that a large portion of the country believes there was.  This portion of the country is large enough where what is occurring now will be at the very least a reason to not vote for Republican Party that offers nothing for them.  I believe Biden won fairly, but I also believe that there were lots of, let’s call them “irregularities”.  I feel that COVID was used to loosen election laws to the point where faith in result of this election is lacking.  It almost doesn’t matter if election is 100 percent fair, if large portion of the country believes it wasn’t (I believe it was fair).  That is the main problem with this election.  Going after Trump and not addressing this lack of faith, will turn off many voters -  rightly or wrongly.  To me this is the real danger of the current situation.	1610511134.0	gj2vdqf	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2rg2d	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2vdqf/

2yqrwa5y	Y’all being played for fools. Both sides, people keep looking for reasons to hate the other side just because they don’t agree with them or refuse to see their point of view. The divide will keep growing and growing with this thinking.  Until it gets to the point where it can’t be fixed and America consumes itself in a frivolous civil war that could have been avoided if we just stop and think for ourselves, take qualified experts advice and form an opinion off of that. I don’t believe he directly incited violence, but by helping spread the divide he has indirectly assisted in it. That’s not to say the other side is free of guilt. Both sides need to work together with a compromise. That’s how democracy works, comprising so both sides get at least some of what they want. You abandon this philosophy and the system of representative democracy that we have all worked so hard to build and preserve will fall apart before our eyes. We need to relearn how to work together and see the other persons side, how they view the world. Almost everyone has something to share and their opinions should not be discarded unless it is one that attempts to harm another group that remains peaceful or mostly peaceful.	1610506072.0	gj2mckc	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2c4lj	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2mckc/

i3haos	You're...  You're so close.  You're so damn close that it hurts.  The reason that Trump won in 2020 isn't because "there was a shift in power" just the same as the reason Georgia went Blue isn't because of a "shift in power."  I'll say it again: Liberal Voters are complacent. In 2020, we voted in our normal capacity because "Surely no one is fucking stupid enough to vote a failed, psychopathic businessman who can't keep a story straight for 5 words in to office".   And when we realized that we were wrong and we expected too much out of our fellow Americans, we came out swinging in round two.  If we keep swinging again, the outcome is going to stay the same. Republican voters are older generations and, callous as it may sound, the more time that passes, the more of you that die off. Meanwhile the younger generations are growing more and more liberal. It's really only a matter of a handful of generations before the Republican party stops having enough voters to uphold influence. Mind you, we're talking like 3-5 which spans out more than a few decades but time is not on your side.   Anyway, Point is that if Liberals stay motivated and keep the current momentum (And I'm willing to admit that it's a coin toss on whether or not we do) Georgia's gonna stay blue and the GOP isn't going to recover as well as you seem to think it will.  If you want proof, look at the other 1st world countries. Even the UK Tories, the "Conservative Party" over there are only slightly less liberal than the Democrats.   It may be cliched to say, but Progress is inevitable and time marches on. The Republican party will either shift with the Overton window and adapt less and less conservative views to maintain their power or a group will splinter off and do it for them.	1610524291.0	gj3cvs7	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3c098	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3cvs7/

80onsxbr	It's just how parliamentary rules work. The senate doesn't allow for remote voting for some good and some not good reasons (hacking and unexpected emergencies are the top two that come to mind)  The senate takes attendance and so long as there is, I believe it's half + 1 for a quarum, they proceed with their agenda.   Fun fact, the senate changed the rules of the senate so that unless a roll call is called, they assume that there is a quorum. It's how the senate goes on recess without allowing recess appointments. They are technically only taking breaks 3 days at a time. Every 3 days the junior senator from Delaware stands at the front of an empty senate chamber and says basically the senate is session and calls for a 3 day break with unamious concent.  Oh and because as long as they don't miss too many days they assume their voters aren't paying attention enough to notice	1610522721.0	gj3b76u	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3aw1e	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3b76u/

And promising the world while achieving very little. But to a certain group of people that get sucked into it, he can do no wrong.   Genuine conservatives have political ideals that stand up to scrutiny. Democrats may choose to do things differently but both parties have a degree of reasoning behind their actions and opinions. Trump just makes an impulsive half arsed attempt and pretending to solve a problem, then says how brilliant he was and ignores the reality that ignoring advisors get you.

3iqes	The parties will split, but coalitions will form so that one side has about 50%+1, because that's the most assured way to get to national power. Then the other side will form a coalition that will challenge for that 50%+1. It's an artefact of the system that we're going to have two parties. It's just a case of which factions align with each other.   In 2016, the Democrats fractured - the middle America/working class couldn't find representation in the Hillary coalition of coastal elites, global bankers, and inner city single moms and recent Honduran immigrants.   The new litmus test is basically whether you benefit from open borders and international intervention or not. If you don't (because you don't need cheap labor, outsource manufacturing to China, are a defense contractor etc), then you ended up in the Trump camp this time. There's a lot of traditional Dem voters in that camp too.   If you benefit from international involvement, you ally with the minority/ID politics crew to form a coalition that's sufficient to beat the Trump/nationalist/isolationist coalition.	1610514149.0	gj3088i	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2zah8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3088i/
c2woa	I don't. Trumpism is un-conservative and anti-patriotic, and, what's more, it's the reason the GOP has done so bad. Who has a worse record than Trump in winning elections? A one termer, he lost the House the first time around, and actually received less votes than many of the Senate candidates and he was the cause of the losses in Georgia. The quicker this stain is ousted from the party, as well as the weird idolatrous cultists around him, the better.	1610503775.0	gj2i0kh	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hcwr	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2i0kh/

378bxev4	> But they have found pretty strong evidence that trump purposefully and intentionally orchestrated the attack as well as the soft response.  If that's what they've found, I'm sure it'll be presented in whatever House hearings end up happening over this. I'll judge it once the evidence has had its chance to be openly presented and properly scrutinized.  Also, in terms of the soft response, I've heard that Democrats are partially to blame for that. It was supposedly their decision for the police presence to be lighter than it should've been. That's not blaming these Democrats by any means, but if it's true that DC officials chose to have a light police presence, it's ludicrous to claim that Trump is completely at fault for the response to the rioters' push.  > Ill also point out that he did specifically tell them to go to the capitol and "fight", right after Giuliani told them to enact "trial by combat" - just bc they didnt explicitly say "kill the congressmen" doesnt mean that's not exactly what he was communicating and he knew it.  You're inserting your own meaning into those words. Democrats have been calling on their supporters to "fight against Trump's fascism" (or some similar variation) for 4 years now. Pelosi has said, "“When you’re in the arena, you have to be ready to take a punch and you have to be ready to throw a punch." Senator Jon Tester said that in order to take on Trump, you have to “punch him in the face". If you're going to take Trump and Guiliani's words literally, you'd better be prepared to take everyone's words literally.  > He refused to answer the calls to bring in the national guard, ignored the calls from key officials, and just weeks ago set up the Pentagon with unqualified individuals in top positions, who were also conveniently unavailable or unwilling to act during the attack.  I've seen some of these headlines, and iirc, some of them are from an "anonymous source". Which doesn't automatically make it false, but I'm hesitant to trust something when we're not told where it came from.  > Also there is strong implications that republican representatives colluded with the rioters. One, Lauren Boebert, live tweeted the movements of the speaker (pelosi) after being explicitly told not to reveal anyone's location not even to family. Paul Gosar was whipping up the trump base into a frenzy in the weeks before the attack. The organizers of the riot even admitted to being in consistent contact with, and to be coordinating with, several congressmen (as of yet unnamed but I'm sure that will come out soon).  If these strong implications add up to anything, I'll be happy to see these representatives properly punished for their actions. Until then, implications are just implications.  And I'm sure Lauren will (hopefully) be held accountable for her Tweeting, whether it ends up being plain stupidity or maliciously done (although it's a bit strange to me that she was even able to get away with such a thing).  > Anyone still defending trump is just closing their eyes, plugging their ears, and employing wishful thinking at this point. The writing on the wall is quite damning  If the writing on the wall is so damning, then Trump will be punished. But I haven't seen this writing as plainly as you seem to, and I'll judge it fully when it's actually presented in an official hearing.  People acted like the writing was on the wall for Russian collusion, and look where that ended up. It's definitely best to wait. I trust that all will be properly revealed in time.	1610522205.0	gj3amg6	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj36jk8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3amg6/
378bxev4	I’ve seen no evidence that any politicians were “all for it”. In fact, all I’ve seen is outrage from politicians on both sides over this. If you can provide a specific example, I’d love to see it.  As for Trump, I’ll call him out for being stupid. I’ll call him out for saying dumb things that, in hindsight, he shouldn’t have said. But I don’t see him as any more of a danger than many prominent people on both sides of the aisle are. Both he and many others seem to love to say inflammatory things to get their way. Do you really think his remarks about the election being stolen are somehow more dangerous than, say, comparing him and his supporters to Nazis, or comparing them to fascists, or calling him racist, or other such inflammatory attacks that are meant to rile people up against him? The reality is that all inflammatory remarks deserve to be called out, but it’s dishonest to treat him as some sort of unique danger when many prominent people act in a very similar way.  And as for his base, I’ve only seen condemnation from those in power against the violent ones. I don’t pay much attention to the statements of random conservatives because one statement doesn’t necessarily define what most of us believe, but in terms of those literally elected to represent us, I haven’t seen anyone who’s acting like those violent idiots are one of us or something. And from all of the Trump supporters that I personally know, none have tried to say that these wackos represent the majority of us, and most have outright said that they *don’t* represent us. So I’m sure that some people in his base see the rioters as one of them, but that’s not a position that I’ve seen very many take. (Heck, look at the threads on this sub when news of the riot first broke, they’re full of shock and horror and disgust at what those people did.)  Finally, I will mention one more thing. I’m a little bit appalled that you see Jan 6 as more significant because it threatened those in power. In my book, the safety of the common citizen should be seen as equally as important as the safety of the person presiding over them. I believe that the government is made to serve the people, and while violence against either government or citizen is rarely justified (it hasn’t been in any recent situations), I will take much more offense to government allowing violence against the citizen whom it’s meant to serve, than I do against a citizen lashing out against the government that’s meant to serve it. Any unnecessary violence is horrible, and I absolutely condemn all of it, but I will never, ever put those in power on some sort of protective pedestal. It’s equally outrageous no matter who it’s against, and violence against those in power should never be seen as worse than violence against a citizen simply due to the former’s power.	1610520926.0	gj39622	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj357oz	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj39622/

4f7ua	I personally didn't see any Nazi flags.  I think I saw three Confederate ones.  The other most offensive thing I saw were a few T Shirts saying "Biden Sucks Kamalla Swallows." A few nasty symbols aside, these things are covered under free speech.  I find them personally reprehensible, but freedom of speech is absolute.  Extremists among the left have been burning American flags and waving Communist symbols for years now.  Again the double standard is showing.    I'm surprises the between 20 and 30 dead (depending on the sources I read) in the BLM protests don't seem worse than 4 at the capital to you.  There objectively has been far more property damage, fires, looting, etc from the left this year.    Perhaps a few nutjobs in the crowd were out for bloody revolution.  Why are you so willing to heap that on the head of Trump whilst Democrat politicians get a pass for say, the Autonomous zone in Seattle?  Biden himself says Antifa is just an idea which is a demonstrable lie.  It's different rules for different sides here.  When the left has freakouts all year, the media says, "Of course we condemn the violence, but we should listen to their points." When the right has one in DC it's a white supremacists coup?  Get bent.  All the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Black protestors I personally saw beg to differ I'm sure.  BLM was shouting "Burn it down" in one of their DC protests just this past November.  They actually set fires near the White House in June and the First family was moved to the bunker for their safety this past June. While reprehensible and illegal, I didn't hear anyone say those events should be characterized as attempts to violently assasinated the President and an attempted overthrow of the government.  But somehow a weirdo in a buffalo headress taking selfies in the Capital building is a coup?  There is no excuse for the rioters behavior, but I'm not about to lose perspective or forget other far worse violence in the past.  Both sides should be condemning all violence, not using it for political theater.  It's frankly disgusting.	1610518271.0	gj35xyi	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj336bs	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj35xyi/
4f7ua	If we're entertaining conspiracy theories it would be just as if not moreso plausible to suppose that they were allowed to get so far so that the actions of the nuts could be spun against Trump.  Just like they are right now.    I thinking it's more reasonable to suppose that the police weren't expecting the crowd to be that rowdy, (conservative protestors are usually quite calm eg.Tea Party Rallies) and that law enforcement has just been accused of horrible poilice brutality and heard demands to defund them all year long.  I know they were specifically ordered not to use lethal force.    The idea that this was a serious coup attempt it was laughably bad.  Cops ordered to practically stand down and let them pass?  If that's the case why didn't they murder all the politicians and burn the place to the ground?  Where were all the fires and proper military grade weaponry? I saw no checkpoints or searches so they could have had all sorts of weapons.  You know those far right militia nuts would have been itching for any opportunity to break out their AR15s.  Where were they?  Their absence leads me to suspect that this wasn't a planned coup, but an illegal protest.  I'm sure we'll here more eventually but that's what I suspect.	1610520907.0	gj39595	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj37a8k	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj39595/

The government has way more power than it ever was intended to have, they're much more tyrannical than they ever should of bean, but they're still far FAR from as bad as a country 400 years ago.   The point is that many of the founding principles of the nation are being broken, the country IS interrupting our lives more, but it took at least 150 years for this to start and it took another 100 years to get the ball moving faster. Bad men have bean working for around a century now to undo the checks and balances and their progress still hasn't directly effected their citizens to catastrophically	1610507781.0	gj2pjit	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj29tzq	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2pjit/

The scaled is so skewed in the US, you guys dont even know which politician is in what group.  The dems are merely the conservatives by German standards(some of them would be even slightly right from center) and the GOP is far right with some parts (a huge sub group of MAGA) beeing almost in the zone of forbidden parties (we have some laws for human decency and 1 or 2 parties borderlining that and MAGA is like " Hold my beer".  Try to get your (i mean the US) political spectrum back on track or you guys will end in a thrid reich 2.0, we know how that started and how it went and its not the dems bringing you there (i mean they could oppese it more, but also they fear to lose voters )	1610529784.0	gj3ied1	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2z7nf	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3ied1/
emjfh	Making a list of Trump supporters? Can you source that for me? I'm not sure I buy it. I tried googling it but all I'm finding is Republicans clutching pearls about how the below tweet is "calling for Republicans to be put on a list."  > @AOC: Is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future? I foresee decent probability of many deleted Tweets, writings, photos in the future  Seems to me, she was saying we voters should remember their social media posts so they can't delete them and revise their own history.

bhgnw	I really tried to like the libertarian party, I really did.... I even voted for Gary Johnson in 2016, instead of Trump.  But honestly, I feel the further you look into their policies, the more they fall apart.  Even though I voted for him, mainly because I was hoping he'd get the 15% needed for inclusion in 2020 debates.... There are still things I find insane.  For instance, at least in 2016, their policy stance was to abolish the department of education, the department of transportation, etc....  I mean, I am all for small government, but I sure do appreciate having roads, and an educated populace.  My stance is If the government is to spend money, it better be for the benefit of everyone.  Utilitarianism.  But unfortunately, even though I have been registered a Republican my whole life, it honest-to-God, non-trolling, appears left-leaning moderates now days are the only groups of politicians that share that same perspective from a policy standpoint.	1610503441.0	gj2he2j	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2et58	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2he2j/

do74n	I mean Trump is basically a life long Democrat voter and donor. He's also not fiscally conservative, not committed to personal freedom, and not especially religious. If anything he's a "Republican in name only".  Like, it's literally the exact same they shit on the Democrats for when AOC calls Biden a conservative or some shit.  You also gotta realize that Trump is less libertarian than, say, a Romeny. He's far more authoritarian. Every actual, committed libertarian I've talked to despises Trump. Hell, Ran/Ron Paul both adamantly disavowed him in the 2016 primary for being just as much of an authoritarian as Bernie.	1610499971.0	gj2az19	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2amv2	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2az19/
do74n	It’s views will no longer be “reasonable” if we absorb populist, authoritarian, culture-war obsessed Trump refugees.  It’s not gate keeping. Trump is completely antithetical to the libertarian world view. He had Jeff fucking Session as his AG. He had a Sec Defense (one of what, like 10?) resign because he wanted to invoke the Insurrection Act.  His keystone policy was being anti-immigration. He withdrew from every notable trade deal. He passed $2T in un-funded tax cuts.   There’s literally nothing compatible besides maybe 2A and he banned bump stocks.	1610505717.0	gj2logy	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2iz63	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2logy/

i3bim	Sorry, but real conservatives value free speech.  And before you try to claim what Trump did isn't protected under the 1st amendment, I bet you can't link one single video of Trump telling people to riot, or encourage them to continue doing what they were doing (like Democrats did).  He specifically said to march peacefully, and then told them to stop and go home when it went South.  And it'd be one thing if you guys were also trying to equally hold responsible all the Democrats who incited much more violent and deadly riots for 4 months, but that's not what's happening.

5fw801iq	Worth pointing out here that in order to be charged with inciting a riot or insurrection, one doesn't need to say explicitly "Storm the Capital".  Not sure why you think that these are some magic words that need to be uttered in order for an obvious crime to be an obvious crime.  You know what Ted Lieu didn't do? He didn't send out robocalls to try and get as large a group as possible for a rally scheduled specifically to coincide with the counting of the EC votes. And Ted Lieu did not intentionally deny requests for National Guard backup prior to his rally because he intentionally wanted the capital to be as weakly defended as possible. And then during his rally Ted Lieu also didn't explicitly exclaim that the vote counting process was fraudulent, the election was fraudulent, and that the "Steal" needs to be "Stopped" somehow. And after that Ted Lieu absolutely did not attempt to call Sen. Tuberville to instruct him to protest the vote counting process for as long as possible in order to "buy some time" for some unspoken and nebulous reason.   How about instead of running your mouth you dig deep for the first time in your life and read the actual thread? There are a lot of concerning things Trump, and Trump allies in the Republican party did. Fuck, Trump's absolute failure to approve DC's request of the national guard alone is impeachable. Nevermind that the guy was a central figure behind planning this whole coup.

There was a TON of irregularity, Pennsylvania basically broke it's own Constitution with mail in balloting and then the court just Yolod the opinion that it was too late to do anything.    And I'm not even alleging the fraud, but the fact there was some due process made it sit quite a bit easier.    Also if Congress wants to strip SS protections I say they do it to any Pres with a net worth over 10 mil, its really welfare for millionaires at this point.

d6x1n	I pay way more than 2k in taxes per year and get way less out of it.  It would have been nice to have some of that money back this year and would have preferred he waste his political capital on the bloated omnibus bill, but he chose to hand the senate on a silver plate to the Democrats who have openly promised to turn American institutions inside out?  They air mailed the omnibus bill through congress.  Every single one of them got their pork.  Some of them paid their token objections but at the end of the day the beast had to be fed. the government got bigger and we send more and more of our dollars overseas to shit like gender studies programs in Pakistan while people are being forced out of their livelihoods (and into the waiting arms of tech and retail moguls) "for the public good".  It's not McConnell that's will be hurting when the economy inevitably crashes when the Biden administration taxes the ever loving shit out of everyone and everything in order to pay for their new utopia - it's gonna be me in the middle class.

bou4h	> Populism is a derogatory term for democracy by people who don't truly believe in democracy.  You're absolutely right: we *DON'T* believe in that kind of democracy.  We don't live in a true democracy, we live in a Constitutional Representative Republic, and for good reason.  True absolute democracies, the kind where you just take a vote on every law, every action, etc., don't last long.  People *don't* always know what good policy looks like.  We hire people we trust who are supposed to be well educated and well versed in the issues at hand, and we trust them to do a good job.  A populist politician just ignores his responsibility to be an elected leader and relies on just doing whatever the crowds cheer for in order to stay in office.  But that just returns the representative republic to the status of effective Total Democracy, which we aren't supposed to have, doesn't work, and don't believe in.	1610506696.0	gj2nj3l	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hzte	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2nj3l/
N/A	Yea, and communism is just a form of government where goods are owned by the populace, and dispensed as needed.  Populism is much like communism in that by just reading the webster dictionary definition you completely miss the far reaching implications, and impacts of trying to enforce, or push those doctrines on civilization, and the human mind.  I'm sure I don't have to spend any time of the dangers of communism that aren't inherently obvious to anyone familiar with the 20th century. Especially on a conservative subreddit.  But the dangers of populism seem to be missed by some that should also be learned from the 20th century.  Populism is just a means of distribution of ideas. A framing of political goals that's used all along the political spectrum. The heart of populism is the simplistic framing of an extremely complicated world, and set of issues as the struggle against the "elites" by "ordinary people".  This will always be an insidious framing no matter the perceived righteousness of the principles it claims to represent. What makes it always insidious is that it taps into that primal part of our brain of tribalism(which is why its so effective).

How about [this one in Arizona](https://azsos.gov/election/2020-general-election-hand-count-results)?  Why won't they do an audit?! What do they have to hide?! Given the impressive number of Republicans who won down-ticket all over the country, including freshman Trump-aligned candidates, they must've been part of the conspiracy to steal Trump's obvious landslide win, right? These down-ticket GOP conspirator RINOs along with the scumbag Trump-appointed judges in over 50 court cases and Trump's own Justice Department saying no credible evidence of voting fraud. They're all part of the conspiracy! Because Trump said he won in a landslide! Am I doing this right, guys?  All joking aside, while you and many people in this sub may not be aware of the above facts, Cruz, in his position in government, is entirely aware. But, he knows you're not, so he'll say what he needs to say to get your vote.

5njlt	>but had he told people to wear red MAGA facial masks in February, the economy would be better, he would have made a fortune and the election would have been a landslide victory for him.      Lmao dude just stfu. In February he was catching heat for trying to close the borders to China. Health experts were telling people not to wear masks at that point. Fauci went on camera and laughed at the thought that masks would stop the virus. But no matter what, you couldn't even buy a mask until June at the earliest...Either you've been living under a rock for the past year or dont shop for yourself, because there was no way to buy any medical supplies until the summer came around. The simple fact is that the media controls the narrative and could literally spin anything to make him look bad and the people they support look good. Gov. Cuomo's policies directly killed thousands of senior citizens, but the media made him a champion of covid. California is suffering right now despite useless tyrannical policies, but you'd not hear a single bad thing about Newsom.

3brzd	Eh Reagan just happened to be in charge when the USSR collapsed, he did not lead to that. The USSR collapsed because Glasnost and Perestroika opened up decades of horrible shit to the public and allowed people to start criticizing a system that was no longer capable of surviving that level of criticism and discontent. Couple that with a bunch of revitalized national independence movements, a stagnant struggling economy, a divided Communist party (hardliners vs reformers), widespread corruption, an attempted coup, and the massive fiasco that was Chernobyl and it becomes pretty obvious why the USSR collapsed on it's own. Reagan just happened to be off on one side shouting "down to the evil empire" right around the time said empire finally collapsed, then took credit for it.

dzd2j	The senate doesn't impeach anyone, and impeachment is definitely about a crime, not for being unfit in some other way. It's true that the Constitution is clear, though.  House, not senate, impeaches:  "The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment."  It is about a crime:  "The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."  The house impeaches, which only means that they think that a trial should take place. It's like officially charging the person. Then a trial is held in the senate, where the person is found guilty or not of a crime.	1610506680.0	gj2nhzb	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2fomb	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2nhzb/

10jhq8	I think it should be a good salary like $150k. Maybe have some function of their pay related to how americans are doing - weighted so that increasing the income of the lowest paid americans causes the greatest increase in their compensation. If they can demonstrate that their education or previous career would have earned them more than that they should be compensated in accordance with what they would reasonably make it private industry.  You still need to incentivize the best people to work in government plus give them enough so that they aren't so easily tempted by corruption.   Not showing up to work/votes should be deducted from their pay and be made public.	1610561624.0	gj4xupk	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj35irk	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj4xupk/

They can’t touch it for five years after leaving office and if they own stock in a company they did not found it must be sold and replaced with index funds.    It’s a steep price but I think the sacrifice is necessary if you want to be on of the few hundred people in charge of the nation.	1610520341.0	gj38hh0	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj34vyb	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj38hh0/

lmqcst	They shouldn’t be able to support someone actively working against people with no means to defend themselves. If we lived in a utopian society where people didn’t want to use literal slave labour (bezos, musk) then sure your argument might have weight. But the idea is to prohibit those people that do exist and will only act in their own self interests even if it leads to suffering and death for others. Government exists to serve the people not the highest bidder and it should be regulated that way. The current system just means that those with wealth, power, and influence can control the system against all others. It’s unhealthy and is already leading to mayhem and death.	1610532955.0	gj3lgmr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3l75s	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3lgmr/

Unless you are hand counting ballots for each round, there is a computer and there is an algorithm that take your vote for Candidate A and places it in the column for Candidate B. Now if you trust the system, there's no issue. If you don't trust the system, then you can spin all sorts of inane bullshit about how Venezuela interfered to shift votes from Candidates 3 & 4 to candidate A when those votes definitely picked Candidate B as thier second choice. It gets even more complicated the more rounds you have to go.   Don't tell m that it wouldn't happen cause look behind you.

pmama03	As a Libertarian, I appreciate that. If I’m not hurting someone else, then why should you care what I believe? I do disagree on the idea that religion has made the world worse.  Statistically the vast majority of charity is given by religious people, mostly Jew, Christian, and Muslim. Studies show that religious people are much more likely to give to charity.   The old notion that religion causes wars is nonsense. People get into wars, and they use things to justify their actions. War is almost universally due to a lust for power and wealth, or hatred and bigotry.   Religious people tend to be more happy on average, and deal with less depression and anxiety. Obviously not every religion can be truth, so there are billions of people who are following a belief system that is not true, yet it is making them live happier lives and be better people. I only see that as a positive, whether their religion is true or not.	1610519361.0	gj37ax9	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj36a08	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj37ax9/

i9h6h89	Writing it on a website is not what we are discussing. The pursuit of the adoption of the policy is the key and I almost never see or hear that from most GOP politicians. On the other hand, I can easily tell you the core policies of at least 10 prominent Democrats.  With that said, the discussion isn’t about agreement or disagreement with policies; it’s about whether or not the policies have been pursued - especially in good faith. Without even talking about democrats, I can’t say I’ve seen a good-faith pursuit of a policy from the more prominent GOP politicians. I don’t tune into one news source and I don’t take anything at face value. Still, however, I see more obstruction than anything else.  I don’t hate conservative viewpoints regardless of which way I lean. I find myself hating Republicans more every day, though, as I don’t necessarily equate the two groups. I look for their pursuit of policies in their actions and all I see is hate. Republicans, imo, don’t represent conservative politics.	1610515415.0	gj322vs	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj31gq0	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj322vs/

[Volume 2] explains that under long-standing department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional.  2. Dems would have let him slide?

The police of the world and the tyrant of the war there is many countries that look for it for protection/attack. So I believe the military oversize is a reaction to foreign politics. Better efficiency on how to spend budget on the military can be said for almost every government institution/entity.	1610507900.0	gj2pr4f	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2mh0g	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2pr4f/
dx3nw	I am a big supporter of the fight the world at once doctrine because I believe it had more benefits than the cost involves, but that doesn't mean I'm unfamiliar with the special ability of the government to make systems that devolved into just perpetuating their own existence.  Like the communist factory manager, who always has to underperform so he avoids budget loss but always has to show improvement to keep his job.  I'm curious what a solution would be, honestly. No doubt we're still over inflated but if some sort of fundamental restructuring of how the budget is decided for military spending could save even a bit it would go a long way. Maybe give defence a "credit" account where anything over is evaluated in worthiness next year and it's then determined to be "forgiven" (budget increase to accommodate) or not (comes out of future funds), which would maybe encourage more scrutiny?  Hell, I don't know. You'd need five pentagons and a thousand economists duking it out to find an actual solution to something on that scale.	1610529988.0	gj3illi	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2mh0g	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3illi/

160axj	Same here. I always considered myself conservative, voted a republican ticket, until I realized I just couldn't go along with the all or nothing mentality anymore. Things changed, life, community, family, etc. Some of what I thought were ideals turned out to be bias and ignorance and not consistent with my values. I didn't see many Republicans standing for conservative values that I cared about so much as just trying to win points with select donors. (Not new I suppose, and Democrats are guilty of this too) There's nothing wrong with compromise and mutual respect. Unfortunately the paradox of choice is a real thing and I don't see much opportunity for third parties outside the local level any time soon.	1610517312.0	gj34ozr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2wmk2	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj34ozr/
h6gij	Agreed, and I think it's stupid that we do that. We're basically the 4th grader on the playground taking a toy from a 1st grader. We *could* just pay a little more (we'd have to tolerate higher gas prices) and get gas from a nation we're more friendly with and don't need to fight a war to get, and then places like Iraq will have a lot less blood money coming in. I'm all for us paying other poorer countries to manufacture goods and whatnot and give them jobs, but when we need to use the army in order to guarantee the goods we want, that's when it's too far.	1610518973.0	gj36ttw	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj33fv9	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36ttw/
h6gij	I agree with you. I'm against private prisons and private healthcare and everything else. The argument against government provided healthcare is always "look at how long the lines are canada!" That's because people can afford to have their health issues looked at. They know if they get cancer that they won't die and leave their family half a million dollars in medical bills. Breaking Bad would've never happened in Canada.  People like Mitch make sure private prisons get a ton of money (all going to execs), who then lobby a little but of it to Mitch, who then wants to give them less restrictions and more money, so in turn they can pay him more in lobbying. Simply getting rid of lobbying (as long as there's no stupid loopholes) would help a ton.	1610518550.0	gj36anr	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj34uo9	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36anr/

N/A	Conservatism is a policy, not a party. You shouldn’t have loyalty to any party.   Consider also that demographics changing may also be the reason for election loss. Or the GOP essentially abandoning their philosophy for short term wins in votes means it maybe doesn’t stand for what it used to in some voters eyes.   Really though every person should be behind electoral reform because having to cram so many different ideologies into a single party sucks for EVERYONE.	1610503708.0	gj2hvz1	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2g8e3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2hvz1/
4djh5cbd	I think what he is trying to say that conservatives are not really conservatives and he is correct from the pov that what it was when it start to what is now has been completely perverted.  What is was was religion has zero place in politics or government. Government mostly had zero place in private business or personal rights.  What is now is highly religious, yes there are non religious conservatives. Then based on the subject today's conservatives either want more gov or less....see abortion, guns, religion is traditionally non religious setting.  I used to think it got changed to neoconservatives but I think it's just been entirely consumed by the new weird version.   This is why you also see guys like collin powell or the lincoln project looks completely different than the party of today.	1610504100.0	gj2imkz	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2g8e3	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2imkz/

7kyix	The left feel exactly the same way about the Democrats. The issue is that both parties feel reasonably secure about their flanks--their base isn't going to flip no matter what they do--so the main focus is on winning the narrow middle ground of independents.  This has a tendency to depress the enthusiasm of the base, and so modern politics is walking a tightrope between giving your base just enough to keep them engaged, while not enough to scare off those independents.  This election was a textbook example of a candidate falling too far one way--Trump energized the far right base unlike anyone in recent memory, but it came at the cost of scaring away the center--both independents and the most moderate Republicans.	1610510232.0	gj2tuoh	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2ikvk	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2tuoh/

It's still crazy that the GOP decided not to update the platform for 2020 and opt to simply reuse the 2016 platform for another 4 years.

But at this point, I think most folks realize M4A is likely to happen in the next 6-12 years, and that will really change the dynamic. Once it’s in place, that genie won’t go back in the bottle. The Republicans will adjust their platform to attract new voters, perhaps by improving some facet of our lives, as well as helping big corporations.

If you equate that with overthrowing Trump then what does that say about your perception of Trump’s platform?  Burning a Walmart is not the same as running through the capital literally trying to hunt down the nation’s leaders in an attempt to murder them.  Also, I have not condoned a BLM protest anywhere - I have simply highlighted the difference between a riot and a coup.  I think every single person who participated in the Jan 6 coup attempt is guilty of trying to void a citizen’s right to vote. The people of America spoke and these dickheads attempted to silence them by storming the capital. Classic projection on your part.

62vp9	Anyone who argues that just honestly hasn't thought things through.  I mean just look at things like the FDA and FAA. They keep us safe and confident in our ability to do such simple things we completely take for granted...like to go buy food or medication at the store, or travel in an airplane with full confidence.  Pure capitalism means people need to create some kind of monetized program that independently conducts tests and has some kind of verification program for every single product available for purchase in the country...except they wouldn't have a say as to whether or not something hits the shelves in the first place, all they could really do is warn you about it after it's already being purchased by folks.  It's just impossible for independent groups and individual consumers to be personally in charge of keeping track of every single company, every product, etc. That's just simply a case where you need a centralized regulatory body keeping shit in check, approving things for public consumption long before they're ever available in a store, and holding companies accountable.	1610517321.0	gj34pfk	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj33ozy	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj34pfk/
62vp9	Ultimately I do think it's the best governance system. Corporate oligarchy/monopoly is unfortunately the endgame of any capitalist system though, which is why I'd prefer a social capitalism model that's far more slanted towards regulation, quality of life, and worker's rights. The corporations will do just fine no matter what.  You'll notice that somehow magically McDonalds isn't struggling to do business in New Zealand where the minimum wage is $15/hr, where they have healthcare, 4wks vacation, 1yr maternity leave, and all sorts of other benefits that Americans don't get.  So we know all of this stuff is easily doable and doesn't actually stifle capitalism despite what the billionaires would have us believe. We just need the people (mostly conservatives) to get on board with it.	1610516137.0	gj333bb	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj32e8x	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj333bb/

James Madison wrote in reference to the forming of factions, "By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." He further went on to describe methods of both eliminating factions as well as eliminating the issues caused by them.

No Child Left Behind, a Bush Jr initiative, has resulted in less education in favor of more testing, with the final result being higher rates of childhood anxiety in addition to decreased learning.   Saying that we should disband a federal department doesn’t mean you don’t care about what they do. It means you care enough about what they do to understand the department is counterproductive and it is a matter better left to the states, counties, and cities of America.	1610540552.0	gj3tf6o	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2he2j	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3tf6o/
5p58l	I get your concern regarding libertarians wanting to get rid of those departments.  I can only speak for myself but i think they should be left up to each State.  Abolishing these departments wouldnt mean that kids wouldnt go to school or that the roads would be demolished.  The majority of the costs for these is already on each State which they obtain through taxes, fees, tolls, etc.  Being a libertarian doesnt mean you want zero government.  Other government entities at a smaller level (state or local level) have the means to better appropriate funds.  Not everything needs to be handled at the federal level IMHO.  Heck its even stated in the Bill of Rights.	1610513870.0	gj2zt4u	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2he2j	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2zt4u/
srdje	Thanks for the insight. After I posted that I started to think more and more about issues that could arise with libertarianism and another two I got stuck on were zoning laws and environment.   I would think true libertarianism would say build whatever you want wherever you want, but then, who wants a warehouse in a residential neighborhood. And with environment i’d think the stance is little to no regulations, but then if people start dumping waste and doing other destructive acts against the environment, they’re now affecting others which seems anti libertarian.

f3pp2	> and aren't just "no Trump"  You say, but they just passed what is both the most pointless and most overtly hypocritical impeachment in the history of the nation as their capstone to four years of accomplishing literally nothing save obstructing Trump.  The Democrats have no single vision, they have dozens of disparate and contradictory visions.  > Now not all of these made the official party platform but they've pushed for...  Funny; that's basically the steriotipical "vote D and they'll give you free shit."  > healthcare reform/singlepayer  Yeah, that's a party line, because they botched it so hard the first time.  Remember when they called people crazy for saying that they were working toward "single payer."  I imagine round two to have a larger, more invasive, and equally unread bill as round one.  > significant investment/regulations to fight climate change  The Democrats will accomplish exactly what they did under Obama; nothing positive to combat climate change, but a whole lot of money syncs designed to pad their allies' wallets.  > criminal justice reform  They say that's a goal, but all you need to do is look at Biden and Harris' records to see that reform led by those two couldn't possible be anything other than dystopic.  > breaking up monopolies like amazon, comcast and facebook and encouraging unions to name a few.  The democrats were the party of big business this time around. Trump didn't get the wall street dollars, and pretty much all of big tech (except maybe Microsoft) has been open in their support for the Democratic party.  It's beyond naive to think that the Democrats will cheer big tech censorship, happily pocket their donations, and then turn around and attack them.  The Democrats have big tech's support, and they've seen the power they hold, there's no incentive for them to try to break them up.  It's funny that you mention Comcast specifically; you really think the Democrats are gonna fight a news megacorp?  > Now we're probably gonna disagree on whether a lot of these things are good or bad but the Dems do have a vision and aren't just "no Trump"  No.  We probably agree that all of those things are important, but you're terminally naïve if you think the Democratic establishment does as well.  The Democrat vision begins and ends with winning, and if they solve any of those problems, then they won't have anything to campaign on.  We're in for a "dark winter," and the Democrats are going to blame Trump for it for decades.	1610681557.0	gjb2051	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2sqxr	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gjb2051/

nfn0b	> We don't want the violence that YOU are causing  That is an interesting take. If you want to blame social media in general, I’d understand, because it allows people to find like minded people and delve deeper and deeper into their beliefs. But going so far as to say the Left is responsible for the crazies who made the bomb is a bit of a stretch. They believed the election was stolen because their president said so. And honestly, if you believe he was speaking the truth, a literal revolution would sound reasonable to me. If we can’t trust our elections to follow the will of its electorate, then I don’t have any answers on what should be done. The issue was the president of the United States repeatedly said the election was stolen and his followers believed him and acted accordingly. If you don’t want crazies to make bombs, then don’t tell the crazies that the Radical Left stole the election from Trump. And if you believe the election was stolen, what would you have these people do instead?	1610513063.0	gj2ykc2	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2w00d	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2ykc2/

ntz9i	Do you not see the subtextual stoking of racial fear when Trump tweets that the "suburban housewife" supports him because he ended the program where "low-income housing would *invade* their neighborhood?" The clear implication is, *white woman will support me because I keep black people out of their neighborhood.*  Do you not see the thinly veiled attempt at racial disenfranchisement when Trump's efforts to throw out votes boil down to cities where large black populations live and vote? *Their votes don't count, because they are not the real Americans.*  Just because Trump stops short of saying "I hate black people", does not mean that his rhetoric isn't designed to invoke racial hostility.	1610514678.0	gj310nd	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2lqro	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj310nd/

Take a relatively straight forward problem to solve and make it political. ‘Defund the police’ never meant take all their money away, rather it was to reprioritize it.

8601k	Ok let me get this straight. Because you say that minorities wait longer in line to vote it tells you that their rights are violated on a regular basis in red states? Do you have any evidence to support your claim about longer lines? These people aren’t being turned away, it’s their right to vote even if the line is longer. Do you think it could have anything to do with minorities mostly living in densely populated areas or is it a grand conspiracy to steal their votes? Would you care to explain the record minority voter turnout in recent elections?	1610505193.0	gj2kok2	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2c5i5	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2kok2/

Shouldn’t I get more, I paid a lot more. That’s wealth redistribution. They should be paid out proportionately.   I don’t know what the downvotes are for, if they are coming from conservatives, then you should take off your flair because you aren’t one. If they are from the liberals, I don’t know why your mad, the least you could hope for is conservatives actually follow our own logic.   Finally, I could care less about this $2k, but it’s not what conservatives stand for, it’s magically what Trump suddenly stands for because he has no compass.	1610498730.0	gj28oc5	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj27gba	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj28oc5/
8xd08k1l	No, you are completely wrong. If the Republicans didn’t just follow along with every stupid thing Trump said, we wouldn’t be in this mess at all and would have a far better running economy during covid. Then we could have used the “stimulus” to help businesses implement the necessary precautions to keep the economy afloat. Something I could actually get behind.   If Trump didn’t say to make it $2k his base wouldn’t have cared at all. They follow him off every cliff plus on top of it his cabinet of people were telling people to not vote! Literally, don’t vote.

aeca9	Fucking thank you. It’s such a misunderstood idea. Populism is dangerous because it doesn’t consider anything more than “is this thing what I want right now?” Sure, it’s sometimes led to good things, but more often than not it leads to shortsighted policy. Think of the upcoming insolvencies of Medicare and Social Security, both populist policies. Think of the importance of having experts who understand all sides of certain issues help guide us ans make decisions. There’s a reason we are a representative democracy, not a true democracy. True democracy is for our small towns and communities (that’s what the New England part of my flair means, for the people below).	1610511328.0	gj2vpog	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2nj3l	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2vpog/

Us conservatives don’t get a lot of book learnin’ and all them words get me awful twisted up.  I will admit.  It is pretty convincing that the auditors got relatively close to the same vote counts as the machines when they checked them.  Good thing that screwed up machines are the only way to throw an election.  But how does that answer how many of those ballots came from voters no longer in the district?  Or how many came from illegal post office boxes?  How did those audits check the tens of thousands of people illegally claiming medical confinement in Wisconsin?  How did those audits check for an equal protection violation from Maricopa county setting their signature verification software to a lower confirmation standard than the rest of Arizona?  How did those counts audit whether it was proper for Pennsylvania to keep observers outside of a range where they could meaningfully observe while counters marked ballots with pencils “to make sure the machine could read the vote.”  I’m a simple girl, I don’t understand how all this works.

ghlha	The electoral college is outdated and makes one vote in Wisconsin count several times more than a vote in Texas. The Senate Filibuster has been used by both parties. The Supreme Court packing was backed by both Mitch McConnel and Lindsay "Use my words against me" Graham in an act that was insanely hypocritical, and Trump's idea of regulation reform was so random it's been held up in court at state-level in nearly every industry.   An incompetent government is not a "laissez faire" government so much as it's one easily exploited by people seizing PPP loans (see: Joel Osteen and Jared Kushner).

I'm talking about the repeated downplaying of Covid, even when he knew better, as well as the constant attacks on wearing fascial masks, even when there could have been enough for everyone to wear.  Expecting him to ramp up production in February might have been a tad ambitious, but him not even wearing a mask by himself until mid-July and continuing to downplay fascial masks well beyond that literally lost him the election.

If he were to come out and say "no matter what happens, do not become violent under any circumstances. We must accept whatever happens and try to move forward together" then maybe you could say he's trying to help the situation.  Instead we get two bit mob boss shit that's basically like "oh boy, I certainly wouldn't want to be those congressmen who might vote to impeach me. I don't think they deserve violence but who knows what'll happen to them. It's a very dangerous time to be a congressmen ill tell ya that"  I honestly don't get it.

wtx7d	I agree. I think campaigns need to be voter funded. This would force candidates to get out there and try and earn their money. You don’t follow up on promises ? Loose funding.

ajaxb	Liberal here, hell yes. Ever since I was a teenager I've hated how partisan politics are and they're only getting worse. We need to be able to vote for politicians who we agree with on policy, not just for our team or against the other team. Democracy thrives on disagreement and debate and compromise, and a cult of personality or "my color is better!" type debate just leads to division and power grabbing.       We're not that different! We can agree on what the problems are in this country and work together to compromise on how to solve them!	1610510495.0	gj2uaw1	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2qwxn	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2uaw1/
3ah9ul0y	It really bugs me that there are no good, accessible resources on the graph walk gerrymandering test. Because like... IT IS SO GOOD! But all the information about it on the web is exclusively in 10+ page postgrad/undergrad thesis mathematics papers.  (TL;DR at end)  This isn't to, like, counter CPG Grey or anything. There's a lot of ways to draw the lines, but unfortunately real life districts are stupid complicated, and the graph walk test is the only one I've heard if that can handle the crazy side cases (note that it does not build districts, just checks for fairness). Like, there's a state that votes 80/20 for congress, but one party wins all the slots. Turns out, if you break the state into the second smallest caucus measurement scale, and combined those into equal(ish)population chunks... There did not exist any possible way to get a seat for the 20% party. It's a state that looks and feels gerrymandered, but the districts were actually alright. It was an unfortunate case of the 20% party being mostly evenly spread, rather than there being "red" areas and "blue" areas, everywhere was a mostly uniform purple.   And it's important to note that not all wonky districts ARE "bad". Sometimes, those districts lead to fairer results. Chicago's infamous horseshoe district leads to a stronger latino voting power (...potentially, this is up for debate, and "stronger latino voting power" =/= fair, can't remember how it worked out).  ____________  TL;DR a algorithm/method to TEST for gerrymandering is more important than an algorithm to build districts, because real life is messy and shits wack, yo.	1610518797.0	gj36lx6	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2qwxn	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36lx6/

7p6pa	From the Reagan Foundation   ...at least since Ronald Reagan, the Republican Party has been philosophically inspired by free trade. President Reagan, in a 1988 Thanksgiving address, decried protectionism and said, “One of the key factors behind our nation’s great prosperity is the open trade policy that allows the American people to freely exchange goods and services with free people around the world.” Both Presidents Bush continued the embrace of free trade as an ideal, even as they oversaw policy exceptions.  One reason for this embrace was the intimate connection between free trade and three other pillars of a conservative approach: a market orientation, a commitment to limited government, and a belief in responsible internationalism. One need not argue the theoretical nature of such a linkage; one need only look at the experience of the Trump administration for a vivid empirical demonstration of how the policies interact.   https://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan-institute/centers/articles/is-the-gop-still-the-party-of-free-trade/      It’s a long read but I suggest you take the time. It outlines what a sharp departure Trump has created from longstanding Republican support of Free Trade. Here’s a few more worthwhile lines:      The effective abandonment of its free trade credentials sets the Republican Party on a perilous path. Perhaps as a reflection of the philosophical inconsistencies described above, the Trump administration has failed to describe an alternative vision to replace the goal of free trade. Sometimes, administration officials will argue that free trade is still the goal and that the protection simply serves as leverage to push other countries toward that goal. Other times, the president will exalt in the protection itself, reveling in tariff revenue and the benefits for protected industries.  Either excuse leads to trouble.      The very fact that, on a conservative sub, you are debating with me as to whether or not handing out tariffs like so much Halloween candy is in line with Republican principles just proves my point on how hard it is to even know what Republican principles are anymore.	1610516843.0	gj341yc	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj33698	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj341yc/

23y6tv6y	You’re ranting about the tax bill, which actually put more money into the pockets of every day citizens. The problem isnt the tax bill it’s that the government spends to much money and prints way to much. For example, why the fuck are we sending any money to Pakistan for gender diversity programs during a pandemic? It’s bulk like this that drives up our deficit, this will inevitably increase drastically under a complete dem admin (which is why I personally was hoping the reps would hold the senate). Currently I’m holding out hope that Biden makes it through his term, because if kamala is president then we will have another depression within the next 5 years to do a devaluation of the dollar among other things.

shoup61	> more of a commodity like gold.  No. It isn't. Because commodities have actual tangible uses. Like gold being used in semiconductors and electronics. It gives it inherent value because of a tangible use.   BTC has no tangible use.  The only use BTC has is to fleece newcomers in what is essentially a ponzi scheme. Everyone who "invests" in BTC and turns a profit, is at the direct loss of a newcomer to the "investment". Which is called a ponzi scheme.  BTC is not company that produces value, profit, and dividends. BTC is not a commodity needed in the production of goods. BTC is inherently without value, and has simply become a vehicle for whales to manipulate the market to fleece small investors.  The whole thing is a fucking sham, which is evident by every BTC investor cashing out into fiat. If people believed in BTC like they claim it is, they would spend BTC. But they don't, they all cash out into fiat. Because BTC is a vehicle for a ponzi scheme to fleece one person out of their fiat in order to pay back earlier investors.Which is by definition a ponzi scheme.	1610518763.0	gj36kaz	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2jqda	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36kaz/

bmqxr	Fair but honestly that was in part or whole due to Trump not having them on standby/authorizing them to come in. Also BLM kinda has a track record of burning shit down where Trump supporters generally don't.   If BLM had a track record of relatively peaceful protests that didn't involve burning a few cities down and came to DC I highly doubt they would be treated any different.   Clearly no one saw Rudy and the Trump's calling for open insurrection (my theory is he wanted them to get the ballot boxes) coming so no one really prepared past some basic fences.

It's unlikely that it would change votes, but if there was a vote and say a senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted with the Republicans or maybe a corporate bill and the senator from ~~mastercard~~ Delaware voted with the republicans no one would really bat an eye.

k6yxz4r	Are you down voting me as you respond?  I don't follow either party and often support one or the other depending on the candidate and issues I find important at the time.   I do believe the left is being a tad ridiculous here blaming Trump for everything considering the capitol building. BLM protests (extremely worthy cause) resulted in what can almost be stated as neighborhoods on fire. I think the left forgets. The capitol building riots were equally as troublesome but I dont find very many leftists condemning these BLM riots on nearly the same scale they condemn the riots. It is quite amazing the ability both sides have compartmentalized their positions on peaceful gatherings. For their ideas, quite okay. Against, "absolute insanity."  The left did condemn publicly but I hope you go through the forums and threads and read how the public encouraged it on. The people on these threads hoped for more destruction until "they saw change."  Worthy cause. I agree with the cause.   Now look at the right. Many of the people storming the capitol legitimately believe the election was rigged. The entire democratic process in their minds is at jeopardy. This is a worthy cause, protecting democracy. I again disagree with how it played out but protecting free election is important. The cause itself, as misguided as these people were, is a worthy one.   The left plays gymnastics with the publics minds just as much as the right does. The left is a more compassionate party on many issues, this allows the public who are democratic to feel superior. Picture yourself next to a Trump supporting republican who isn't an extremist, if you are able. Many on the left aren't. Do you feel superior? You will likely say no, and I hope that is true, but statistically I would say that is a lie.  I urge you to look through some history on Republicans and their voting and find something you agree with. Find something Republicans have done you are for, higher points for something controversial. Now find something on the left that you disagree with. Find something they have done you disagree with. Being as you are, leftist, more points for something less controversial. I implore you to not skip out on either half of these requests or the exercise is pointless.  If you find yourself struggling, there is a good chance you have been swayed by something, likely the media or social circles, into believing in something that isnt true. I find that quite sad and I hope it doesn't work out this way.  I ask this because the ones voting for the republican party love America just as much as you do. They aren't all racists, bigots, uneducated morons.   I read a statistic that more uneducated people voted for Trump. The narrative has become all Trump supporters are uneducated. This is so naive and a divisive maneuver by the left.   I hate the greed the right holds onto just as much as you do. And they are very guilty of this. Perhaps all politicians are guilty of this. We are voting based on issues but the candidates running are often only running for the perks they themselves receive. Left and right alike.  I'm sorry I wrote you an article. I just am so tired of this "youre wrong about everything and I am right" rhetoric. Both partys are pushing this country apart and it is high time the people realize that we are the ones who get fucked in all of this.

k6yxz4r	Lol nice.   If you watch Trump's speech, he specifically said they will peacefully protest in front of the capitol.  Charles Manson literally ordered them to go to a house and murder people. Write statements in blood, so on.   Granted, many seem to think Trump said that they will bust the doors of the capitol in, hold people hostage, and kill until he is declared winner. So I guess in that case, yes he should be arrested.  Fortunately for everyone, he didn't actually do that.	1610518680.0	gj36glv	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj347x8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj36glv/

Their actions show this to be true.  >If you equate that with overthrowing Trump then what does that say about your perception of Trump’s platform?  Don't even know what your asking. I actually agree with most of the things he said. He clearly said no violence and to go home multiple times. Do I think it was the appropriate time to bring up his election beliefs? Prob not but every bit his 1st amendment right.  >Burning a Walmart is not the same as running through the capital literally trying to hunt down the nation’s leaders in an attempt to murder them.  Its actually probably worse to attack random civilians. But they also attacked federal and public buildings so they are worse or the same in every way.  >Also, I have not condoned a BLM protest anywhere  Cool so you support an organization trying to overthrow a government. Neat.  >simply highlighted the difference between a riot and a coup  You prob need to learn what a coup is then  >I think every single person who participated in the Jan 6 coup attempt is guilty of trying to void a citizen’s right to vote.  I disagree. They have every right to protest. I agree they deserve to be charged with everything associated with breaking into the building but not treason.  >Classic projection on your part.  I'm not projecting.  >You guys are total fucking morons and it’s little wonder that Trump panders to the dumbest cunts in the country 😂  Coming from someone who votes on emotion with little to no actual background research or knowledge.

3kw3vh9h	The Department of Ed thing really gets me. My Libertarian friend tried to convince me, said "well, look at how terrible our education is now? Better to let private companies handle it!" Except when private institutions handled it before, only the rich and middle class were educated. I look at my rural, tiny town, and I wonder what kind of company would take the risk of trying to make a profit here on education? What would we sacrifice to get it? Would we have to go all online? What about kids like mine, with ADHD, who can't focus when having an electronic device in front of him. 100% the system right now is broken. It needs more funding, and it needs an overhaul from top to bottom. Putting it in the hands of private companies just doesn't seem like a good idea. Heck, we'd probably end up with a private religious school here, best case scenario. As a non-religious household, I'd really rather not have my kids indoctrinated in whatever denomination managed to open a school in our town (likely Missouri Synod Lutherans, or Methodists. They already have preschools, they could just extend them up.)	1610514065.0	gj303p7	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2ifxa	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj303p7/

Even with that said:  May 21: $1.2 billion in support for AstraZeneca and their trials.  April 16: $483 million to Moderna (Moderna did not make the vaccine, but they are the essential partner in taking the vaccine through trial and getting it to where it needs to go), later expanded with an additional $472 million in July.  July 22: The US Government made a commitment of up to $1.95 billion to Pfizer to assist with the trials and assist in increasing their manufacturing capacity.

1gs74zo2	I’ve been back and forth on if he had a chance of winning against McConnell, but he certainly would’ve faired better than McGrath. I live in Lexington, so I don’t have the best census on heavily rural conservatives here, but from what I’ve heard from friends and family who do is that many of them are looking for anyone to run against Mitch, though obviously they’d prefer it be a republican in the primaries.   But Booker was born and raised here, and had a great understanding of the opioid crisis as well as many of the other struggles Kentuckians have been dealing with for decades - things McConnell doesn’t seem desperately worried about. Though there is a part of me that thinks Booker’s platform may have been a little too far left to convince enough voters to jump ship from McConnell. But I’m not necessarily convinced of that.  At the end of the day, Kentuckians were just pawns in the political game - Both McConnell and McGrath received more than 90% of their campaign contributions from out-of-state donors. The same cannot be said for Booker.	1610517254.0	gj34m62	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj31yaq	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj34m62/

dzd2j	Just some quibbles here, in case anyone's reading this and is curious.  You say that it's optional for high income earners. Well, ok, it's optional for everyone, but if you make more than about the national average and DON'T have private health insurance, then you have to pay an extra tax.  That's 90K Australian. These people aren't rich. They're doing fine.  > the care you get is identical, private insurance just let's you select coverage for non-essentials like IVF  The care is identical, but not the timing, and it's not all about non-essentials. My son was listed as semi-urgent for having tonsils removed, and we couldn't even get an appointment to talk to the surgeon for 21 months. With private care, he had them out in about 6 weeks.	1610505851.0	gj2lxj7	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2jtgd	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2lxj7/
N/A	So single payer... but not at all like Bernie’s single payer. Bernie’s single payer outlaws any kind of additional insurance, that is what is meant by “single payer” in the US. With Bernie’s system, the only additional insurance you can get would be for aesthetic/cosmetic procedures such as nose jobs. It sounds like Australia has it right.	1610506296.0	gj2mrq6	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2jtgd	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2mrq6/

ob6rukh	I think the majority of people probably sit a little left of center, but I mean that in a strictly numbers way. I think it does still vary wildly depending on where in the country you take the pulse. Being from Ohio though, I've noticed over that past decade that it seems more and more people are arguing *for the same things*, or at least aren't aggressively opposed to the things the other 'side' enjoys as much as they think.  Every progressive I've met personally doesn't actually want *more* taxes, they think enough is in the system already and we just need to rearrange what we're doing to prioritize the people. Conversely, most conservatives I meet aren't trying to own a glorified fucking arsenal in their basement.   I definitely agree with your latter point, and I think it kind of feeds into what I'm saying above. Outside some extremists, most people I think land in the area of 'do what you want as long as it doesn't hurt me/anyone and don't just sit by while other Americans are murdered or starve'.   The internet has the tendency to give a megaphone to the vocal minority, so much so that it kind of gives me whiplash when I have *actual* conversations with people 'in real life', regardless of if I have a long history with them or just met them.	1610534036.0	gj3mhz6	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3lcu5	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3mhz6/

And as a country with large amounts of student and medical debt, it makes more sense to cut costs first (M4A, etc), or the money would end up in the pockets of the likes of insurance companies anyways.  And as for "why not do it all", this is a Congress that jerked rightwards after just Obamacare, obviously well short of M4A, so I'm not hopeful that an administration could pass multiple big ticket items.

College is way over priced and we're asking our kids to make a 100k gamble at 18 for a degree they "think" they want. I switched majors and had to do a fifth year  at a second rate state school.   I, and I'll probably get fucked for saying it, like bidens plan of covering community college expenses. Let the tax base pay for associate degrees because it's cheaper than having kids do 2 years at a university for 40k, flunk out, and have to pay that loan on a shit job.  I understand that 4 year colleges will increase their tuition rates to counter the 2 years of revenue collected vs 4, but they'll also get to let go overpaid, unnecessary admins handling the workload. They'll find jobs at the newly increased student volume in CCs, at the appropriate wage.	1610519336.0	gj379r8	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj36gjl	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj379r8/

And it wasn't just a few people like with the looting amidst those protests, it was almost everyone in the march decited to break windows and doors, and frankly more people should have gotten shot, that is not okey, putting up a noose infront of your own capital to hang someone... nothing is black and white, democrats did plenty of wrong in this term i am sure of it, but what aboutism doesn't work, you can't excuse your bad deeds by listing someone elses, if that was The case any murderer could go free by just yelling in court, WHAT ABOUT THE ZODIAC KILLER, it's just not how the world works.

7kyix	Because the middle, like it or not, cares about who "Sounds presidential", who looks and acts the part, who are civil and cordial.  If they had strong policy opinions, they wouldn't be 'moderates' or 'centrists'. They care more about how they feel about someone, who they could have a beer with, other stupid garbage.  And no, a lot of his policies were garbage that were anathema to conservative values... But look through this thread, and this sub--especially the flaired only threads, and especially before the election. Trump was their man, could do no wrong, and they "loved his policies".

I totally agree that both sides have zero tolerance for the other, and both sides severely lack the capacity for reflection on the actions of their own, and that this is an unhealthy dynamic.  I still believe that what happened on Jan 6 was far worse than anything we have seen in a long time and was not justified. Americans died in the 1940s to wipe out the Nazi flag and all it stands for, and these idiots killed a police officer on their way to waving it in the halls of the capital.  As far as your exercise goes:  Republican policy I agree with: The tough stance on China and the efforts to rein in their global trade dominance. I do find it hilarious that Trump has massive personal loans with Chinese banks though.   Democrat policy I disagree with: Wealth tax. I’ve seen it cause more harm than good in France. That said, the middle class in America is disappearing and the divide between top and bottom is increasing so something’s gotta give eventually.	1610518534.0	gj369wo	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj35b3b	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj369wo/

It's all pumping himself up and spreading lies and hate.  The fact that you heard or read all of that and think because he used the word "peaceful" in the middle that he wants purposely instigating his followers to do anything necessary to squash the enemy and "stop the steal" is a perfect example of why a majority of Americans (yes, it is the majority) think trump and his cult are batshit crazy and have been pointing it out for past 5 years (you probably call that part fake news)	1610517023.0	gj34aqg	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2o67y	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj34aqg/

nfn0b	My thing is that in the scenario where the election has been stolen, then the court system is completely compromised. Our election system is completely compromised. If Congress doesn’t cave under the pressure of the protest (which they didn’t), then they too are completely compromised. This then gives the presidency illegitimately meaning the executive branch is completely compromised. I  feel like violence is no longer an unreasonable leap at that point.   If Trump is wrong and the election was not stolen, he needs to quit peddling his lies because it is an incredibly serious and dangerous accusation that he is making. But if he continues to say it was stolen, I worry about what will happen when more of his supporters give up On being peaceful.	1610513783.0	gj2zodm	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2ywos	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2zodm/

My friends who all make $70k, well $2k is going to get them 1-2 months of help tops. Then what?   This isn’t a stimulus, it’s a handout. A stimulus is when the economy is functioning properly but something caused spending to decrease. Handing everyone money stimulates the economy because they will immediately spend it on a host of things.

7keuw	Again, I cannot speak to legal liability, but it doesn't really matter because impeachment is not a judicial process. Government officials have higher standards than criminal in order to retain office and powers.  I never said Republicans are a violent organization, but I think there is no denying anymore that Trump has a violent, somewhat organized base. Not everyone who walked to the Capitol participated in the insurrection, but there were a lot of people who did.   The comparison was not to equate ISIS and the insurrectionists, it was to find an example of someone with a passionate enough following.	1610506653.0	gj2ng5o	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2juea	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2ng5o/
7keuw	Here is the thing though. Could he do something about it? As the POTUS he could, and could have, increased security or even allow the National Guard to respond in a timely manner. As the, perhaps unwilling or unwitting, head of the cultists, he could just tell them to stand down.  He literally has the power to stop the mob, and therefore the violence is his choice and not simply "reality". If he attempted to do something to avoid violence, then it wouldn't be a threat - but implying that violence will occur if he doesn't get his way is definately a threat.	1610506016.0	gj2m8to	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2j6lm	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2m8to/

Don’t commit it!” We would never say “don’t like abortion? Don’t get one!” If one were to be personally against abortions but in favor of letting other people choose to get them, they’d be pro-choice. If you are pro-life, you say it shouldn’t BE an option.   Now, I recognize you don’t agree with that outlook on abortion, but you’re deliberately mischaracterizing it, and you know not a soul on this Earth is pro-life because they’re afraid of *mandatory* abortions.

hupkt	you make some good points but the MLS is there to ease the strain on the public healthcare sector by incentivising private insurance for those that can afford it, the 1-1.5% surcharge is pretty negligible and it means that private insurance is a net gain since you're paying it with what would have been tax anyway  it's 90k if you're single or 180k for families*, pretty reasonable I think, when I was earning enough to go over that threshold I was living comfortably enough for it to not be a worry, the average income is less than 60k though so you still have to earn 50% above average for it to come into effect  I sympathise with your situation, that seems absurdly long, but its also slightly anecdotal; when I got my tonsils out a few years ago it was only a 2 week wait on the public scheme, I was listed as urgent though.	1610516212.0	gj33723	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2lxj7	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj33723/

kbpxk	Yeah, I agree with your general point. I don't know enough to agree with where the US gen pop sit on the spectrum.   I think that for the most part there is far less separating the vast majority of people (say 1 or 2 standard deviations from the mean) then there are dividing them, save for there wedge issues. Like you say, no one wants to be taxed more, no one wants government waste or bloat.

I believe the majority and minority leaders along with many members of the intelligence committees get some pretty classified material so it adds levels of complication if they have to get that info across country or discuss it on a video call.

d2egy	This election cycle saw record numbers not because Biden is an excellent candidate but how much a majority of the country dislikes Trump. I’m talking both conservatives and democrats alike. It being a pandemic and increasing the viability of mail-in-voting also helped the total numbers, imo. Biden represents the old guard and that’s what people came out to the polls to choose over Trump’s chaotic populism. It’s really not surprising at all. Trump received the 2nd most votes ever.

The view of American leadership around the world is at an all time historic low since WW2. 375,000 dead and climbing at a rate of more than a 9/11 every day, while less wealthy countries have rates at less than 100 times that of ours. A significant portion of the electorate no longer believes we live in a fee democratic society despite all evidence showing that the election was more than fair. Growing joblessness with most people continuing to work for slave wages while he and his corporate cronies get fat on tax cuts. Encouraging the impunitive murder of minorities by authorities sewing divisions so wide that it will take generations to repair. Embezzling millions of dollars from the taxpayer including duping all of you fucking morons into donating millions more to a self described billionaire.

We now know that Saddam was helping out al-Qaeda, that he was trying to get WMDs, and that he was purposely trying to trick the world into thinking he had them. Regime change in Iraq was American policy since the Clinton administration, but the Democrats conveniently forgot that.

But I don't think that's him so much as the Democratic Party, with its crazy woke cultism, which people like John McWhorter have argued really does a disservice to Black people, because it treats them like passive victims. Also, all of the rioting and talk of defunding the police really alienated Black people and other minority groups.  If the Republican Party would play its cards right, it could get a commanding lead in these communities as the Democratic Party becomes a grouping of upper-middle-class white socialists.	1610509198.0	gj2s1rm	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2rasw	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2s1rm/

Why do you feel its necessary to brigade the sub and try to redefine the beliefs of the otherside that is acceptable to you.

8gukz	Sounds like typical rallying rhetoric that you see everywhere. How many times have democrats told their supporters to "take to the streets" "there needs to be unrest in the streets", "protestors should not let up", "there should be uprisings", etc. If you judge these quotes from prominent democrats then you either a) admit that democrats also are responsible for the destruction and loss of life due to the multitude of riots that occurred over the 2020 summer and should thus be removed from office as well... or b) admit that Trumps rhetoric wasn't an actual call to arms to stage an insurrection and it was just overzealous supporters engaged in illegal terrorism much like anarchists used the BLM protests to engage in violent and destructive actions. I don't really see any other option unless you want to specifically judge Trump by a different set of standards, but that's on you then.	1610514706.0	gj3124r	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2wis8	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3124r/

If AOC went out tomorrow and said we should beat up conservatives sarcastically, and then some of her followers actually beat up conservatives, it's not her fault, position of power or not. If you punish people for saying something like that when it turns sour, unless it was a direct and clear call to violence, you're the one who's unconstitutional. Because on some level, regardless of their power, you are disallowing or at very least disincentivizing free speech. And if the most powerful people of our society cannot speak freely, it sets a precedent that it is not necessary for less powerful people to have that right either.	1610502285.0	gj2f8km	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2enbe	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2f8km/

axg0n	The compromise is, conceptually, that there are significant public safety concerns with the fact that any dipshit will have an easier time acquiring a rifle and ammo than they would in getting a drivers permit and therefore a need to better regulate the process of acquiring and owning guns. So you add in restrictions that impact pretty much zero responsible gun owners, but make it harder for the irresponsible ones.   To get something in return would require the 2A fanatics to even consider the possibility, and then push for whatever they want. That may be guarantees on gun ownership rights to be secured more specifically to prevent that scary “compromise B” and so on scenario, but that’s up to the people engaging in those discussions and those they represent.

2z2wk	Re: “Lying” to general public that those in Congress who voted to discard the votes of every battleground state was an effort to overturn the election. (That’s what they were voting for. There were no audits up for vote. They were voting to count or throw out each state’s votes, and _only_ that. Voting for A but saying you’re voting for B is actually a lie.)  The sense among Senators is that everyone in the relatively small club of the Senate knows, due to the lawsuits and the recounts and the audits and testimonies of state officers, Republicans and Democrats alike, that the election was free and fair. If the Senators are operating with that knowledge, and in the context of the storming of the Capitol building due to many Americans, as you say, bearing the feeling that the election was massively rigged, any further effort to flame those emotions by furthering that false reality is ambition pointing a gun at the head of country.

Does Trump without the GOP still pose the kind of threat to the Democrats that they would need to counter his electoral run years ahead of time?

And with how insane and extremist Democrats became since Trump was elected, I definitely wouldn't put it past them.  They used literal Russian disinformation (aka the Steele dossier) as justification to spy on their political opposition.  And there's a reason they fought so hard to prevent an audit.  >It’s the same reason I don’t buy the DNC rigged the election against Bernie and that’s why he lost spiel.

c2woa	Yes, both parties have their conspiracy theories. The difference is that the Democrats, when they were in their whole collusion phase, were using Constitutional measures to pursue it. Trump, after making up the voter fraud stuff (even before it supposedly happened) started out with Constitutional measures - court cases, losing 59/60 elections - but then started moving onto blatantly un-Constitutional measures, like his phone call to the gentleman in Georgia and the uprising he led. There's a big difference between frivolous Russia hearings (and, according to Bolton, there was real stuff Trump did that was impeachable, but the Democratic circus was not looking in the right place) that are completely within the realm of legality and inciting and fomenting rebellion. One is dumb; the other is traitorous.

And also, trying to turn the Islamic Middle East into the West culturally is a recipe for DISASTER, not anything helpful. Iraq belongs to an entirely different civilization; Bush and his cohorts universalisms were utterly foolish, to say the least.  &#x200B;  Because of the Iraq War, Iran has expanded their sphere of influence to include Shiite Iraq. Because of the Iraq War, Isis was able to develop.

On the other hand Peronism also encourages strong unions and social plans that give free shit to everyone.

Washington DC has hosted thousands of marches and protests over many decades, why was this the first one that led to such an outcome?	1610521832.0	gj3a7aw	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3124r	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3a7aw/
ayjrx	I like how your argument is about a hypothetical where AOC sarcastically suggests violence, because you recognize that actually inciting violence is bad regardless of free speech.  If I shout fire in a theater, and people end up scared and trampling other people, should I be in trouble?

1pki	The answer to that is easy. International death under the military industrial complex is 'being a hero' and 'fighting for our freedom'. Trump on the other hand, has too many domestic crimes started before his presidency, and during.  Edit: He put a spotlight on himself when winning the presidency. Old shit will bubble up.	1610513349.0	gj2z0gp	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2y3sh	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2z0gp/
3waen	The only difference is they commutes these crimes in office. They are protected also because those would be federal crimes. A sitting DOJ never wants to set the precedent for charging a past President for crimes committed in office because the next president could do the same. Trumps crimes he’s being charged for were largely committed when he was out of office and also state crimes so it would be the DOJ charging him. However still unlikely he’ll see jail time, just more likely than bush or Obama for the example you gave.

2d19eyle	From my understanding, everybody I knew thought she came across as condescending. Her advertisements consistently tried to portray the stereotypical "veteran" candidate, that was also a mom, thinking it would immediately win her all the votes since they thought people would be like, "A veteran? By golly, I sure do love me some military and strong women!" So, lack of talking about policies combined with the Breonna Taylor riots (since it took place in Louisville, KY) made it almost impossible for her to win.	1610524349.0	gj3cxx3	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2n4v5	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3cxx3/

7keuw	Hey, if there are politicians acting as leader of some actively violent groups of BLM or Antifa individuals, using them to threaten people, they should face consequences. I try to poke out of my bubble pretty frequently, but maybe I just that. Even still, comparing public protests with insurrection is a pretty far reach.  > 65 million voters. Less than 1000 verified to have participated in said violence.  > There’s nothing wrong with being passionate if you don’t take it out on others.  True and true. I feel like we've lost the plot, or you are just throwing strawmans at me now.

If "my facts" are different than theirs, then I'm being lied to, the other team is so evil, end of discussion.        The real problem, I think, is that there's a good amount of people on both sides of the aisle who are only in power because of partisan politics. Because of fear mongering about the other team. Because of gerrymandering. And those people don't want to lose their power. Which means ranked choice (and fixing gerrymandering and everything else) is an uphill battle that requires average people on both sides to make it happen, not the government.	1610512033.0	gj2wweo	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2w6rn	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2wweo/

N/A	There are people in this country who wanted to limit illegal immigration and terrorist from entering the country.  The main stream media is very left leaning.   Trump stood up for all these things when no other politician would.  He stood for things that those voters who voted for him believe in.    We believe in America for Americans.  Not some neo conservative globalist thing like Bush.  Not giving everything away to the lowest in the world to raise them up but also lower us like Obama.  70+million Americans haven't changed their minds on what they love and want for the US.  I remember how inspiring I found Trumps inauguration speech and as soon as it was over how poorly the journalists reacted to it.  Calling it dark.

g19748k	At the end she also tried to basically just outright say “I’m a Republican haha” without saying it in an ad she ran, additionally Kentucky is INTENSELY Pro-Life and she had some very choice comments about non-intervention into the 9th month. She served in the armed forces but just overplayed her role, that’s why the veteran card got 0 points. Misrepresented her service. u/shamaze  Im still being downvoted lol despite the fact I included her performing worse than Allison. Keep in mind, Allison was generally disliked and She had less money as well. Amy was just that much more disliked, the amount of money pumped was insane. To put it into context, in 2008 Bruce Lunsford got 47% of the vote. Allison got 40 and I believe Amy got 38? All vs McConnell. The opinion above saying “Amy was the best” is just outright wrong.  I mean let’s just think about it. She first appeared in 2018 running for the 6th District 51% to 48% in the district that included Lexington a ~400k pop city that leans 50/50 R/D. She couldn’t win the district that included Lexington, one of our two main urban areas. What’s going through anyone’s mind when they put her up to win any of Eastern Kentucky, or just anywhere lol?

I agree that it has to start at a grassroots level, but for me the grassroots level is people themselves.  If people can't even agree on the outcome of an intensely scrutinized election, it seems to me that we're many steps away from reaching any kind of agreement on something as nuanced as gerrymandering.	1610512280.0	gj2xb0x	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2wweo	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xb0x/

365gxfm1	I’m interested to hear what you think about the inflammatory rhetoric that lead up to and primed the storming of the capital.  I can think of a couple of examples off the top of my head, but I know there are many more:  - Speeches led by Trump and his inner circle at the RNC proclaiming Democrats as “evil people who want to destroy your country and take away everything you love”  - Painting with a broad brush by saying they (Democrats) are stealing your election and country.

N/A	No, I’m not pretending the riots - which, in general, are perpetrated by people identify as antifa who, while they vote democrats, are absolutely not democrats; they just vote that way because it’s a two party system - didn’t have less violence and destruction.    But are you trying to pretend that riots a few select areas in cities which were swiftly put down by police are equivalent to *storming the capitol* and by alll accounts being egged on by the outgoing president because he lost the election?   There’s a BIG symbolic difference there which makes me label one as a riot and one a stochastic terrorism  I’m not saying the democrats are tame and tolerant, I’m saying that storming the capitol because you lost the election (with no evidence of voter fraud) on the word of the outgoing president is a lot more extreme than rioting over perceived systemic social injustices in the police (with quite a lot of evidence to back it up)  As an aside I make the distinction between antifa and democrats to be accurate and it’s worth mentioning that antifa is not an organisation but an ideology (in much the same way that Christianity is not an organisation) and blaming “antifa” for the riots is a bit like blaming the US dollar for people being poor.	1610511624.0	gj2w7nw	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2t951	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2w7nw/

N/A	Read up about “selection bias”. Use the simple English Wikipedia.   In short, if I take a group of 100 people at a Trump rally and ask them if they support trump and 90% say yes, I could truthfully say that of the people I polled, Trump had a 90% approval rating  “The Republican Party” as in the establishment politicians? They have a well documented bias to appear pro trump to appease voters. This is quite literally the GOP party platform. And there’s no way you could ask every member of the Republican Party (ie the registered voters), so you’d need a representative sample. So, who is in the sample of the people polled?  I’ll give you a hint: almost NOTHING in life has a 90% approval rating. I would put money on trump not having it given his approval rating across America generally in many nationwide polls has never gotten far from 30-40.

13ckh6	>And the  end of history hypothesis hasn't been disproven. I'm not sure if you ready the book, but all of the things we've been looking (from China, to illiberal democracy and so on) were things that Fukuyama raised as possible to exist, but not as ideas that would rival western liberal democracy.  At one point, Greco-Roman values were dominant in the west, with nothing in sight to challenge it. Centuries later, the West became Christian, which was such a fundamental shift in values and ideals, that I think only these days are we experiencing something comparable to it. The end of history theory is one of arrogance, ignorance and short-sightedness.  &#x200B;  And a lot of "illiberal democracy" is just ideological hot air. Either it's hot air, or code for fascism. Would you compare Viktor Orban with Jair Bolsonaro? Would you consider the Polish government to be "illiberal"? Because in my estimation, both Warsaw and Budapest are not governed by truly illiberal people. One could not compare Bolsonaro's regime with theirs.	1610517967.0	gj35jvm	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj33utn	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj35jvm/

No. Only western civilization, and to an extent Islamic civilization, claims values that are in their eyes universal (the West due to Western emphasis on universality in general, Islamic civilization due to the proselytizing, expansive and even militaristic nature of the Islamic faith).

ayjrx	If Trump said that there's evidence currently being investigated and to wait for the courts to determine the validity of said evidence before drawing conclusions, then I would agree with you.  Instead, before anything has been proven in court, he has said that without a doubt the election was stolen. If he knows that the courts haven't yet confirmed the validity of the evidence, yet makes affirmations that the election is stolen, he is willingly giving false statements and thus is liable to the consequences of making those claims.	1610504184.0	gj2is78	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2hq4f	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2is78/
737p5	I think Jim is to blame for creating the conditions that could lead to my assault, but I wouldn't charge him as an "accessory" to my assault, if you will.   Don't get me wrong, Trump's actions since November have been incredibly damaging and absolutely deplorable. I think it's far-fetched to claim that he incited an insurrection, and therefore shares legal or actionable blame for that insurrection.   But that's actually an interesting question - we have laws about slander, but to my knowledge those are only executable in the event that they cause financial or emotional harm. Of course there's a difference between slandering a specific individual/group versus a process, but an interesting comparison.  Just looking it up, it seems the penalties are pretty minimal...  >"From 1965 to 2004, 16 cases ended in final conviction, among which nine resulted in jail sentences (average sentence, 173 days). Other criminal cases resulted in fines (average fine, $1,700), probation (average of 547 days), community service (on average 120 hours), or writing a letter of apology.[16]"  Regardless, if someone is murdered for example due to slander, you'd be charged with slander and not manslaughter. But then there's also things like shouting fire in a movie theater, which again - there's a big jump to be made between the penalties for something like that vs impeachment of a sitting president.  But also, the grounds for impeachment are incredibly vague - I just don't think what Trump's done amounts to a "high crime." There's an argument to be made, but I think it's an incredible stretch. I also readily agree that there should be a certain moral standard attached to the presidency, and respect for our democratic institutions is perhaps paramount to any other responsibility the president has - so there's an argument to be made that his denigration of our electoral process renders him unfit for office, and that line of reasoning is more along the lines of where I fall. However, I think that's better executable as a deterrent for voting for him in 2024, as opposed congress deciding that he legally cannot run for president, thereby removing our ability as a nation to decide for ourselves whether we want him in office or not.   Sorry for the ramble, but that paints a clearer picture of my thoughts.	1610526462.0	gj3f40x	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj3ddgs	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj3f40x/

End lobbying, no more corporations pulling politicians' strings. This would fix a lot of the anti-science nonsense that spreads misinformation to benefit industries.

ayjrx	You're completely missing the point. Free speech doesn't equal freedom of consequences. You're muddying Trump's claims by thinking he's saying it's possible he won. He's not saying it's possible, he's saying not only did he absolutely win, but the election was stolen from him. That's a powerful claim, a claim that can anger his followers.   It's a claim that has yet to be confirmed true, yet he's claiming that it is. Freedom of speech doesn't just allow him to say whatever he wants and not get in trouble when the things he says can cause people to believe that politicians are actively stealing elections.	1610508951.0	gj2rmbv	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2mt04	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2rmbv/

7owtn	This has been a great thread and has convinced me Trump needs to go. By way of impeachment. I agree - yelling fire in a movie theater doesn’t absolve you of the consequences of people literally being trampled because of it. Now was there evidence of a fire and did the poor person just not realize it was only someone’s cigarette lighter? That can happen and would surely play into any outcome of a trial.  But Trump has been spouting claims of a stolen election for months. That he won, and that the other side is literally orchestrating a huge democracy theft of all time. My God. His words matter more than the news, the courts or the congressional house to many Americans out there. He told them there was a fire and he convinced them it was real and they reacted to it. Now as the smoke clears (pun intended), with all the litigation that has occurred, there has been no proof of that fire. Are we really going to let an American President lie to us? Are we going to condone the attack on our Capitol that was caused by this president’s yelling of a fire?   I was of half a mind to just say the term is nearly over and we’ll move on. But I think we need to send a clear message to this President and all those in the future. America will not be lied to nor will it be attacked for lies. To not do something I think only says that this is all okay and we are okay with more.	1610512309.0	gj2xcp7	t3_kw2lq8	t1_gj2rmbv	/r/Conservative/comments/kw2lq8/fox_news_mcconnell_believes_trump_committed/gj2xcp7/

If they are evil, there's only one thing to do.  They are not Americans if they want to rewrite the entire history of the country.  Fuck them.  I feel bad for normal Democrats though.  We associate Democrat with aoc and pelosi and Schumer, etc.  Remember when Obama was considered far left?  Jesus how times have changed.	1585828507.0	fm7iuvx	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm63wic	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7iuvx/

N/A	Good job on the pics.   However I cannot agree with that video, I cannot agree with something that tries to downplay the severity of this virus. China lied about their infection rates, and they lied about who it kills. More evidence is coming out every day (by evidence in this case I mean deaths) that show it isn't just elderly who are dying, it's killing people in every are group. An Olympian recently recovered, he had to be put on a ventilator for it and said it was the worst illness he's ever experienced.   Just wash your hands, don't touch your face, stay at home, stop panic buying, and this will eventually end.  Overreacting now will help us to stop this virus from spreading and prevent Armageddon when the second wave of it hits in the fall.	1585804573.0	fm6vne1	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm62ez1	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6vne1/

N/A	I know multiple people from West Taiwan. Mostly the Hunan and Fujian Province.  They either lick the boots of the CCP and deny that Tiananmen square ever happened, stating it's the fault of western media spreading lies because they hate West Taiwan, or they say in private that they/their parents escaped the genocidal regime that is the PRC and that they are too scared to tell any of their asian colleagues, as there is a trend for the PRC threateninng family back home since Xi got into power, with it greatly accelerating after Xi removed term limits. The PRC rewards whistleblowers.  You know, the only reason I follow West Taiwan so closely is because one time this batshit woman went off on me when I joked that this product was made in West Taiwan so it's not reliable. Chabuduo and all. When I digged deeper she went on and on about how the west lies about West Taiwan, but lost her shit proper when I asked why China jails [more journalists than any other country](https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2019)   I heard that Taiwan is pretty good though - from some of those same people too scared to speak up.

ylh1m	5% stake but 50% of their 2019 fundraising. Tencent paid ~$150M out of ~$300M Reddit brought in. Equity is long term, cash flow is instant. Reddit has issues with monetization. It doesn't mean they won't figure it out, but they *need* direct investment to continue. Even a minority investor gets preferential treatment when it comes to lending/investing. Providing 50% of the previous year means they're going to be top of the list when they are looking for more.

e4yw4	You can't have huge concentrations of power at the federal government (which is exactly what socialism ascribes to), without the corresponding consequences of socialism (communism).  One of the key principles of socialism is the nationalization of resources and industry, which is something the Chinese government has done many times over.  Edit: the to the dolt above me, simply saying "no u" doesn't actually prove your argument. Learn some other political theory besides what you've read from Karl Marx.  Edit: "The goal of socialism is communism." -VI Lenin  The reason socialism and communism are so great in bed is simple: socialism is inherently *authoritarian*. The seizure of private property and labor is *authoritarian*. "We, the government, will provide this great service for you. Now let us leech taxes off of you so we can pay for them. Don't want this service? That's too bad, you're paying for it. And forget about other options."  It's no coincidence that Democrats and Progressives are so hard on private and home-schooling. They don't want citizens to have that choice, especially if it mucks with the planning of their central authority.  This idea that socialism can be democratic, therefore \*libertarian\* is absurd. Freedom and democracy are not the same thing. Jim Crow laws were voted on by a majority. Were blacks a free people?  Communism has neither freedom nor democracy.  Even on the basis that socialism can be democratic, there is nothing more democratic than capitalism. Markets are decided by free people, *and require a free people and a free market to work*. To be a truly free nation, a country must have capitalism as their economic model. Under capitalism, people decide how to spend their money, which they earn from their labor. It isn't decided for us (unless it's taxed from us.) Markets respond to demand, and does so almost instantly.  On the flipside, the government is painfully slow in almost every walk of life. Electing a new central authority happens every four years. So when the economy is ruined thanks to your socialist president and his socialist policies, don't worry! After four years of starving, you can elect a new leader, assuming elections aren't completely rigged, *something Democrats have been trying to do for decades.*  My flair is appropriate, because socialism is the philosophy of children. It is children who look at what others have, and cry because they don't have it.	1585835319.0	fm7rpdm	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6mdfp	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7rpdm/

5ryk4pno	This is not a defense of the Chinese government or communism, but they are not actually communist anymore. They use the trappings of communism and trumpet their past, but they are a kleptocracy that enriches very few select elites beyond with vast sums of wealth while the vast majority toil away in factories producing consumer goods for western markets.  It is a Xi-ism that anything, and their only real goal is to entrench their own power and preserve their government.

N/A	>You know what pisses me off, is people like yourself who dilute the actual meaning of the word racism.  Connotation - definition - an idea or feeling that a word invokes in addition to its literal or primary meaning.  People like you who whinge about dilution of language all day don't realize that language isn't supposed to be static. Racism's connotative meaning is about discrimination and stereotyping.  All of this besides, arguing semantics is useless. At the end of the day what's important is if you act a certain way, not if you fit a word's description. You'll go around all day making shitty racially targeted jokes but as long as you can argue you don't fit your preferred definition of a racist (not THE definition, A definition) it's ok. In other words:  You care more about not fitting a particular description of a racist more than you care about actually not being racist.  Oh yeah, and:  >a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.

800to	Switzerland is fucked, Netherlands is fucked, Denmark is fucked, Belgium is fucked, Germany is fucked, Sweden is fucked. Finland is not fucked. I live in Finland and we, as well as the countries mentioned all have single payer healthcare and I love it, it is better than the system in US when conditions are stable. However it does not seem to matter at a time like this. What matters is whether the country is prepared or not and believe it or not, US was the most prepared country in the world for an epidemic. I think it's disgusting to stand on the graves of the dead people to push my agenda on universal healthcare when clearly there is no evidence that this has nudged the argument in my favour.	1585854598.0	fm8rdoy	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm8kl3j	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm8rdoy/

3w14ub6l	In a sense the Civil War could be about both states rights and slavery. Confederate States seceded from the Union over the Federal Government issuing more constraints on slavery throughout the 1800s like banning the importation of slaves. In the Confederacy’s eyes, you could say they believed it was up to the state to decide all the rules on slavery . So there is an issue in federalism and the US government was “overstepping” their bounds on the issue of slavery. You could also say that the Southern States probably believed at that point the government was becoming tyrannical in their eyes.    Note: I am no way in support of slavery due to the inherit fact of it exploiting another humans freedoms. Nor am I a Southern Sympathizer. I’m happy with the outcome of the war. I want to make that clear.	1585839291.0	fm7yfpb	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm7sz31	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7yfpb/

N/A	"everything that democrats dont control is unreliable!! if its critical of dems its fake newssssss"  i love how youre so terrified of the free presss. you only trust a handful of outlets that are basically just Democrat propaganda like the Washington Post New York times CNN MSNBC daily show Huffington Post excetera..       Thank you for your post. This is why the democrats act the way they do. A significant chunk of their base is completely removed from reality and has been trained to distrust any story or news source critical of their party.  They call fox a partisan tabloid and claim the right is obsessed with conspiracy theories while trusting openly-left-wing news sources and ignoring that all available data shows that conspiracies are significantly more popular on the left  (such as russia. And racist conspiracy theory that the president of the United States is a secret Russian agent. or the weird conspiracy theories that the Earth is going to completely crumble into dust and New York City will be thousands of feet underwater if you don't stop charging your iPod. are conspiracy theories that the Koch brothers somehow run the world even though it's been proven through documents that people like George Soros literally pay people to start protests. And of course other conspiracy theories like the wage Gap. Or this mystical patriarchy)  We live in completely different worlds. Our fundamental assumptions and facts do not line up and you have been told to distrust any source I could give you that might prove this  because its probably part of a “faux right wing news” conspiracy that targets your “side.” You live in a media bubble that claims any opposition from basically any angle is fake and untrustworthy and all part of "a vast right-wing conspiracy" against you .  You would only trust a handful of discredited Outlets. And even some of the left-wing ones but disagree with you you claim to be Russian agents  Its brilliant. But unfortunately it means we can’t even agree on basic facts in many cases.  This makes serious conversation impossible on many issues and there is no quick or easy way to fix that problem.	1585804427.0	fm6vh52	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6l1or	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6vh52/

mh67w	Trump hasn't been taking things seriously? How so? Did he not create the [coronavirus task force](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-launches-coronavirus-task-force) long before we knew the real threat of the virus? Did he not try to reduce the risk of transmission by [placing restrictions on travel](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspension-entry-immigrants-nonimmigrants-persons-pose-risk-transmitting-2019-novel-coronavirus/)? Or is the problem that he's been offering [too much hope](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/20/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-false-hope/index.html) when he should be telling everyone they're just going to die instead? Again, what was everyone else doing for weeks afterwards? Because if Trump wasn't taking things seriously then surely you wouldn't say that they were, right?  Based on the last presidential election, at least half the country is against Trump, so do you really believe they're listening to him on the news? Of course not, so what happens when they hear someone they support, like Pelosi or de Blasio, say that everything is fine and to come gather in Chinatown/Times Square in mid-February? Do they listen to "not my president" or #presidentPelosi?  If you want to keep pointing the finger at Trump for everything that goes wrong then that's your prerogative, but remember to keep pointing that finger if hydroxychloroquine works out, if the economy bounces back quickly, and if it turns out that media reports have been more anti-Trump than they have been pro-truth.	1585858069.0	fm8xx74	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm8ey31	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm8xx74/

N/A	OP says the ccp is "deleting" this pic mate, the original post is still up. That post was locked by the mods of r/pics, not the official reddit admins.    It's weird that they locked it not gonna lie, but we can't just turn to automatic facebook conspiracy bullshit. There are also hundreds of other anti ccp posts depicting the dictator as winnie the pooh which reach r/all weekly, and those don't get deleted or locked.   If china really was censoring everything as you say we wouldn't have heard a thing about HK or all the other things China has done. Good chance this post would have been deleted too. China deserves all the criticism it gets, but this is just unfounded. The fact they don't give a reason for the lock is pretty iffy though, but this one instance doesn't mean shit compared to all the other thousands of anti china posts.   If I had to guess, the mods of pics locked that post because they're more anti trump than anti china, and they don't want winnie to take the spotlight.  Bit out there, but I'd say that's more reasonable than this conspiracy	1585795001.0	fm6irgk	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6hpcz	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6irgk/

gncnq	China exists as an evil on the world stage entirely independent of mine or any other's judgment.   I'm happy, as a US citizen, to be critical of my government. As an American, I'm afforded that liberty, unlike a Chinese citizen.  Believe me, I'm fully aware of the excesses of capitalism, but Mao with bling and technology is still Mao.   Conservatives have been decrying the destruction of the middle-class through the outsourcing of jobs and the economic and national security issues presented by corporate espionage and the expatriation of critical industries. Shit, we're building a wall. You think we don't have corrective ideals and restorative plans for other threats to our nation? The upside here is we *will* be restoring manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and other industries to our more direct control, as a result of this shit show.   That doesn't mean there's a better system than capitalism. Capitalism has raised the standard of living of more people around the globe than any other system by far. There's no comparison. All the prosperity that's come to China in the past 40 years is thanks to Western capitalism. Capitalism is only a tool though. If a sword's master is evil, the sword is not to blame for who it cuts. Capitalism demands temperance and regulation, and the West has strayed from the best path, but communism, which is the desired outcome of socialism, is far more brutal, oppressive, and totalitarian than anything in the modern West, and to be sure, China's system is a blend of markets and communist totalitarianism, not liberal Western democracy.   My right wing wet dream is for everyone to work and enjoy the fruits of their labor, to have a nuclear family, own their own home with a garden, follow their own spiritual path so long as it doesn't demand others comply or accommodate them, have freedom to express their ideas, explore their potential, create and build, have the ability to defend it, and pass it down to their children with minimal interference.   That's why China can't win; nor Islam; nor communism.	1585819576.0	fm7anhu	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm76lnt	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7anhu/
N/A	&#x200B;  >When people point out Chinas massive financial success it's suddenly not communist anymore.   Yep. That's because China's financial success isn't due to communism. They've been able to trade in an open global market. That's capitalism. Even Marxist thinkers (Zizek) argue that China is inherently capitalist because of this. The difference in China is that instead of private individuals owning the capital, the state has a monopoly on all capital and appears to put that capital above the rights of the individual. This leads to tyranny and oppression within the state itself. It's really not that difficult to understand.	1585819234.0	fm7acnk	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm76lnt	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7acnk/

N/A	"everything that democrats dont control is unreliable!! if its critical of dems its fake newssssss"   every one of those sources is highly credited reliable sites  u use unreliable nonsense sites like "cnn" or "politico" or "Washington Post"  its laughable  i love how youre so terrified of the free presss. you only trust a handful of outlets that are basically just Democrat propaganda like the Washington Post New York times CNN MSNBC daily show Huffington Post excetera..       Thank you for your post. This is why the democrats act the way they do. A significant chunk of their base is completely removed from reality and has been trained to distrust any story or news source critical of their party.  They call fox a partisan tabloid and claim the right is obsessed with conspiracy theories while trusting openly-left-wing news sources and ignoring that all available data shows that conspiracies are significantly more popular on the left  (such as russia. And racist conspiracy theory that the president of the United States is a secret Russian agent. or the weird conspiracy theories that the Earth is going to completely crumble into dust and New York City will be thousands of feet underwater if you don't stop charging your iPod. are conspiracy theories that the Koch brothers somehow run the world even though it's been proven through documents that people like George Soros literally pay people to start protests. And of course other conspiracy theories like the wage Gap. Or this mystical patriarchy)  We live in completely different worlds. Our fundamental assumptions and facts do not line up and you have been told to distrust any source I could give you that might prove this  because its probably part of a “faux right wing news” conspiracy that targets your “side.” You live in a media bubble that claims any opposition from basically any angle is fake and untrustworthy and all part of "a vast right-wing conspiracy" against you .  You would only trust a handful of discredited Outlets. And even some of the left-wing ones but disagree with you you claim to be Russian agents  Its brilliant. But unfortunately it means we can’t even agree on basic facts in many cases.  This makes serious conversation impossible on many issues and there is no quick or easy way to fix that problem.	1585804438.0	fm6vhlv	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6pmy0	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6vhlv/

The US got heads up from seeing how things were unfolding in China, Korea, Italy and Iran then things escalated in the US, North America had more time than most of the regions in the world to prepare for this. There’s a big difference between telling people they’ll die or giving them hope vs saying cases would go to 0 and things were under control and April was approaching so it’ll go away. He’s the leader, he’s there to be pragmatic about things, not lie just to make people feel good.

69yssqki	Yeah. Leftists also like to hide history about the honest slave trade, that is the White Slave Trade. Yes, whites used to be routinely kidnapped and sold into slavery too. Even outside of the slave trade, though sometimes ended up inside of it, in the 1700s, Muslims used to kidnap whites from the colonies before selling them off as slaves after first traveling back across the sea again. Pirate was a term used for Muslims who would kidnap and sell off white people.

N/A	Great, a wall of text that totally ignores my point about different dictatorial systems throughout human history. A self-righteous monologue completely neglecting the realities of this world as well.  > China exists as an evil on the world stage entirely independent of mine or any other's judgment.   A lot of evil exists in this world, a lot of it is supported, established and comitted by the US government. Americans only care about an evil when it can be exploited for political influence at home.  > I'm happy, as a US citizen, to be critical of my government. As an American, I'm afforded that liberty, unlike a Chinese citizen.  I don't know why you would make this a pissing contest between being American and being Chinese because I sure as fuck don't care about neither. I am critical of my govermnet and still point out that the American understanding of socialism and communism is dogmatic and fueled by propaganda. It's not a neither nor thing. Chinese citizens can be oppressed and American conservatives can still try to blame authoritarianism on "left" ideologies alone while ignoring that most evil in this world is a result of reactionary conservatism.  > Believe me, I'm fully aware of the excesses of capitalism, but Mao with bling and technology is still Mao.  Mao's dead baby, Mao's dead. China today is a completely different animal. The sooner you understand that the better.  > Conservatives have been decrying the destruction of the middle-class through the outsourcing of jobs and the economic and national security issues presented by corporate espionage and the expatriation of critical industries. Shit, we're building a wall. You think we don't have corrective ideals and restorative plans for other threats to our nation? The upside here is we will be restoring manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and other industries to our more direct control, as a result of this shit show.  That's not even a conservative topic, that's a sentiment you can find across the whole political spectrum, but I see why you would like to pretend that. Besides there's a huge difference between what joe shmoe in his red state thinks and what the party he votes for and the wealthy elite behind it then decides. Honestly, I find it pretty amusing that you bring up this point after decades and decades of conservatives selling out to China. Further down you try to formulate a somewhat libertarian idea of a society, yet you want to force people to stop their business with China. That's just not consistent.  > That doesn't mean there's a better system than capitalism. Capitalism has raised the standard of living of more people around the globe than any other system by far. There's no comparison. All the prosperity that's come to China in the past 40 years is thanks to Western capitalism. Capitalism is only a tool though. If a sword's master is evil, the sword is not to blame for who it cuts. Capitalism demands temperance and regulation, and the West has strayed from the best path, but communism, which is the desired outcome of socialism, is far more brutal, oppressive, and totalitarian than anything in the modern West, and to be sure, China's system is a blend of markets and communist totalitarianism, not liberal Western democracy.  I honestly don't know where you got the idea from that I would open up a discussion about whether communism was better than capitalism or not. I pointed out the onesided view the guy above me revealed that is very telling about the political education of the users in this sub. I disagree about the success story of capitalism you try to tell here, because you ignore what capitalism does to the rest of the world outside of our wealthy nations, our wealth rests on the back of the poverty other nations have to Deal with, weaker nations etc and on the back of poor people within our capitalist systems. But I don't think this is the place for that debate because I won't get any differentiated point of views here.  > My right wing wet dream is for everyone  For you it's this, for other conservatives its a homogenous ethnostate or at least a exclusionary nationalist state where minorities have a very specific place, for others it's a religiously driven state etc. And its all around the world the same. The American creationist is in it's anti-women, anti-homosexuality, anti-government mindset closer to the fundamentalist muslim than a leftist will ever be.  > That's why China can't win; nor Islam; nor communism.  You hold this misonception that this was a race where there is a start and a finish line. The Soviet Union collapsed and you claimed capitalism just won the whole thing, several decades later an Ex-KGB straight up owns your asses because he understood how to manipulate your political system and the people in power. China and Islam already won, because they exist in the real world and millions of people are just fine with it, they live in these systems, accept them and they don't want yours or ours, I know it's hard to grasp. And socialism won't die neither, different forms will always emerge because the idea of people working together for a common goal is per se not unnatural.	1585824649.0	fm7f4cb	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm7anhu	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7f4cb/

4aujy	People keep emphasizing "*Democratic* Socialism" for a very good reason. When any government loses any check on its power, it inevitably falls to pieces. Totalitarian Socialism is an insanely arrogant viewpoint that believes the government can do literally everything better than the private sector. That's stupid. You know it's stupid, and me, a Bernie voter, knows it's stupid. If you think we're advocating for that kind of stupidity, no wonder you think we're morons (I'm assuming you think we're morons; does not feel like a great leap right about now).  Democratic Socialism in its current form says simply: Some things are better left to people not seeking profit, and businesses by their nature can't be expected to behave in a humane way. Economic darwinism produces a lot of innovation, but it's too brutal and cold to handle human problems like healthcare, childcare, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, minimum wage, etc. And it's not businesses' fault; the only way a company can survive while giving those things out is by dismantling its own competitiveness. A self-imposed minimum wage is a death threat to many businesses, but a *systemic* minimum wage eliminates that threat. I imagine many small business owners wish they could pay their employees more, but can't. But if all of their competition has to as well, they can.  Democratic Socialism still demands a robust public sector. It just recognizes the limits of the public sector to deliver compassion and healthy lives. You don't have to think businesses are evil to know that they can't be good if it doesn't make them money.	1585836218.0	fm7t5qm	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6y2cb	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7t5qm/

N/A	"everything that democrats dont control is unreliable!! if its critical of dems its fake newssssss"  i love how youre so terrified of the free presss. you only trust a handful of outlets that are basically just Democrat propaganda like the Washington Post New York times CNN MSNBC daily show Huffington Post excetera..       Thank you for your post. This is why the democrats act the way they do. A significant chunk of their base is completely removed from reality and has been trained to distrust any story or news source critical of their party.  They call fox a partisan tabloid and claim the right is obsessed with conspiracy theories while trusting openly-left-wing news sources and ignoring that all available data shows that conspiracies are significantly more popular on the left  (such as russia. And racist conspiracy theory that the president of the United States is a secret Russian agent. or the weird conspiracy theories that the Earth is going to completely crumble into dust and New York City will be thousands of feet underwater if you don't stop charging your iPod. are conspiracy theories that the Koch brothers somehow run the world even though it's been proven through documents that people like George Soros literally pay people to start protests. And of course other conspiracy theories like the wage Gap. Or this mystical patriarchy)  We live in completely different worlds. Our fundamental assumptions and facts do not line up and you have been told to distrust any source I could give you that might prove this  because its probably part of a “faux right wing news” conspiracy that targets your “side.” You live in a media bubble that claims any opposition from basically any angle is fake and untrustworthy and all part of "a vast right-wing conspiracy" against you .  You would only trust a handful of discredited Outlets. And even some of the left-wing ones but disagree with you you claim to be Russian agents  Its brilliant. But unfortunately it means we can’t even agree on basic facts in many cases.  This makes serious conversation impossible on many issues and there is no quick or easy way to fix that problem.	1585804497.0	fm6vk6b	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6tlt7	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6vk6b/

Furthermore, you cannot be serious and try to compare countries with different cultures, populi and demographics to one and another. That's unbelievably stupid. Wanna know why something like your wet dream of "dEmOcRatIc sOcIaLisM" works in a country like Denmark? Because Denmark is a country of only 5 million, homogenous people.

Congratulations on claiming you could speak for every individual in this community of several thousand regular users. That's a very smart move that will very likely convince more people than the reactionary circlejerk here. Of course your argument is bullshit. You can't speak for everyone here and you don't know everyone here. Playing the victim though? Check.  The truth is the homogenous ethnostate is something an extreme fringe group would support. They do exist for a matter of fact on the far right political spectrum and in this community because they share a lot of the very same rethoric you use.   But I pointed out the exclusionary nationalism for a reason, because that one is widespread here and it's only a precursor for the ethnostate. Plenty of rightwingers around this world abused xenophobia and islamophobia to push their exclusionary nationalism. Polish conservatives for instance talk pretty directly about a Poland only for ethnic Poles. They dressed it up in some replacement myths, but it's obvious how they Imagine their conservative utopia.

N/A	What really got me though was the "without the ability to think for yourself" - line. That one was just hilarious but I couldn't come up with an answer right away that wasn't disrespectful.  Conservatism is literally the idea to let everything like it always was, not questioning, not changing anything. People like you are hitting the breaks on human progress since forever. The conservative movement is full of religious, traditional, superstitious, reactionary and otherwise dogmatic thinking people that just hold the believe to not stray from the track that was there already. From the creationist, to the evangelicals, to otherwise moderate Christians, to the folks that interpret the constution like others the quoran. You're the opposite of people who would think for yourself.   Allthough when I read your response I think of a contrarian anyways, you're probably not even a real conservative, but fell for the very recent "they come for the white man" - propaganda.

They would have open the borders wide open to China and Mexico and all these other infected countries..  meanwhile Trump was dealing with that at the same time that he was inherited dealing with the fact that he inherited a mess from Obama with Obama having used up all the supplies and not replenishing them  and then we find out that New York was stashing medical supplies in warehouses and not distributing them..   these are problems Trump has to deal with.  dealt with it better than any other country. And for all the far left liberals complaining that he didn't shut down the country completely don't forget that he merely suggested doing that and the left freaked out  you listening to left-wing news I encourage you to turn it off and turn on non partisan news..	1585797599.0	fm6mle3	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6m7bw	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6mle3/
N/A	Youre right, nobody is immune to miscalculations.  I dont have any examples of him screwing up as I really havent been following his response to the outbreak, but im sure theres something.  HOWEVER the type of shit articles from "unbiased" sources i get in my google searches looking up coronavirus news is unwarranted and almost slanderous at times.   Trump hasnt fucked up any more that any other president in american history, which is impressive given he has no political background.  He has also proven to be a quick learner.	1585838868.0	fm7xnve	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6m7bw	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7xnve/
N/A	  Thank you for your post. This is why the democrats act the way they do. A significant chunk of their base is completely removed from reality and has been trained to distrust any story or news source critical of their party.  They call fox a partisan tabloid and claim the right is obsessed with conspiracy theories while trusting openly-left-wing news sources and ignoring that all available data shows that conspiracies are significantly more popular on the left  (such as russia. And racist conspiracy theory that the president of the United States is a secret Russian agent. or the weird conspiracy theories that the Earth is going to completely crumble into dust and New York City will be thousands of feet underwater if you don't stop charging your iPod. are conspiracy theories that the Koch brothers somehow run the world even though it's been proven through documents that people like George Soros literally pay people to start protests. And of course other conspiracy theories like the wage Gap. Or this mystical patriarchy)  We live in completely different worlds. Our fundamental assumptions and facts do not line up and you have been told to distrust any source I could give you that might prove this  because its probably part of a “faux right wing news” conspiracy that targets your “side.” You live in a media bubble that claims any opposition from basically any angle is fake and untrustworthy and all part of "a vast right-wing conspiracy" against you .  You would only trust a handful of discredited Outlets. And even some of the left-wing ones but disagree with you you claim to be Russian agents  Its brilliant. But unfortunately it means we can’t even agree on basic facts in many cases.  This makes serious conversation impossible on many issues and there is no quick or easy way to fix that problem.	1585804550.0	fm6vmex	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm6ssip	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm6vmex/

lds26	1. I have not claimed that Trump was to blame. The person I replied to brought up Pelosi. I asked how, if we’re operating under the belief that this pandemic is the result of the federal government’s mishandling, does the blame fall to Pelosi and not Trump? I haven’t said a single thing about my own views here, I was trying to understand someone else.  2. Words have meanings. If the original commenter told me “I wrote that in a hurry and it didn’t represent my actual beliefs: here they are...” that’s no big deal. But you making the assumption that someone else didn’t mean what they said and then condescendingly applying your interpretation to it is a waste of time. His words didn’t make sense, so I tried to understand what he meant.   3. I don’t think I’ve been rude to you, but you’ve been assuming that I have certain motivations (“score orange man bad points”) and you’ve insulted me for wanting to get the meaning of someone’s words from them. I’m not interested in talking to you anymore since you’ve been pretty unpleasant, but I hope you have a nice day and stay safe.	1585861444.0	fm94aj5	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm90toe	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm94aj5/

4aujy	You can't even explain your own position, but I'm the one without a clue. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Some irony.  The US is big, but everything we do is big. The government processes the taxes of every business and family in the country. Healthcare, while complex in policy, is simple when interfacing with individuals. You go in, you get healthcare, they pay. Nothing about scale makes this unreasonably difficult. And certainly nothing about homogeneity. The reasons you claim are self-evidently clear were just low hanging fruit that sound nice rhetorically and thus were repeated by other people who you copied, but they don't have any real meaning.	1585838315.0	fm7wnpi	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm7vh83	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7wnpi/
1005ll	Context. OC posted a pretty damning list of democrat and media hoaxes. In response to aaaaallll of that, you said:  >"Are you telling me that you believe Pelosi and DeBlasio downplaying Coronavirus is somehow the reason for how badly America has been hit by it? You posted a lot of links, but none that back up the claim that Pelosi and DeBlasio were downplaying Coronavirus.  >But if your claim is factual, Trump was also entirely downplaying it, he has a much greater access to speaking directly to the people, and any policy he doesn’t approve of most likely won’t make it through the Senate. By what basis is he less responsible for this mess than Pelosi"  A comment which is, in context, very clearly attempting to defend democrats because you're nitpicking at a small portion of language in a veeery long detailed post.  Secondly, your tone and method of questioning made it abundantly evident where you stand politically. Someone who posts:  >"If you voted for Trump the first time and were informed during the campaign, you knew you were voting for a man who employs racist dog whistles when talking about illegal immigrants, mocks mentally ill people, and a whole lot more vile shit.  >If you vote for him in 2020, you’d rather have a lying, dysfunctional presidency that defends keeping kids in cages than any other option. And you should ask yourself why."  Is pretty clearly angling to attack the president when they respond to OC's comment in the way you did.  I think I've made it pretty obvious why you're here. Maybe it's time to cut out the bullshit and sealioning.	1585862667.0	fm96js9	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm94aj5	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm96js9/

They have to carry water for Democrats and hold up Democrats as this infallible perfect party. like The Washington Post or The Huffington Post or CNN MSNBC and other Democrat propaganda outlets that would never dare dream of criticizing the Democrat party    based on that alone Fox is definitely more reliable then any of your Democrat propaganda outlets from The Huffington Post Washington Post or New York times. at least Fox will tell you about the shity things that Democrats do..  your Democrat on the outlets will simply cover them up like they have in the past. I can't even count the number of stories that the New York times and Washington Post have buried   I mean it's hilarious LOL. you can look at this long huge list of fake news that I posted and verified examples of these outlets lying and you still trust them more than actual reputable outlets that don't have a history of lying..  that's how you know you're too far gone.. you're completely unreachable.

N/A	The same young socialists who do not lift weight, learn to fight, and/or vote for 2A infringements. The irony always seems lost on them when the discussion boils down to brute force. None of them have ever been able to answer "How are you going to seize anything from someone who you physically, literally stand no chance of survival or winning a fight against?"	1585831059.0	fm7lsaj	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm7lg39	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7lsaj/

8x7fc	Not engaging with someone in serious discussion who fails to understand the very basics of what he's pretending to be an expert in. Been there, done that, it's a waste of time and will change nothing. It is, however, quite fascinating watching people like you argue themself into an intellectual septic tank, I must admit.	1585839039.0	fm7xza7	t3_ftaazt	t1_fm7xhka	/r/Conservative/comments/ftaazt/china_is_paying_reddit_to_take_down_pictures_of/fm7xza7/
