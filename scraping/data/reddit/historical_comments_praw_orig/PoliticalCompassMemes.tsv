5x18yjze	The argument would be that they still have representation, even if they are not yet an elector of that representative. The difference between this scenario and that of the colonies is that the latter simply did not have representation in the British Parliament; there was no Lords from the Americas, and the Commons drew no Members from the colonies. It's not that you couldn't elect your representative, but that you had no representative to advocate for your community at all.  &#x200B;  If we interpret representation to be someone you voted for, then surely those who lose in an election ought not to pay taxes? They likewise do not have representation insofar as they could not select who represents them.	1590649697.0	fs2dag3	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2dag3/

The elected officials for an area are *supposed* to represent the interests of all their constituents - which is why the census counts *people* not *voters*  But politics in the US has devolved to only representing the interests of those who voted for you, and fuck the rest.	1590651281.0	fs2f26o	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2f26o/

N/A	They aren't taxed. Single returns have standardized deductions of \~12,700, which young people have too.

163hgc	I have a thought in a similar vein about the draft. Now really we should abolish the draft, but if we keep it, in addition to it being gender-equal, people should only have to register after the first Congress takes session after the first even-number year election that person is entitled to vote in. So for example, if you turned 18 after the 2016 election, you wouldn't have to register until January 2019, after the 2018 election which was the first you could vote in. That way the person has at least some ability to exercise consent before potentially being sent to their death. Of course this kind of assumes wars have to be approved by Congress, which isn't how it is in practice.

N/A	Meanwhile every accountant sees the 800 problems that this would cause.  If this were true, mega wealthy families would distribute fuck loads of money to their children and not pay any tax. This is why children are taxed at higher rates. If you want the rich to pay virtually no tax, then by all means, let's implement this policy.  If children had the same tax rates as adults, wealthy individuals would distribute money to their children every year. Technically it's the child's but the parents could argue that it's to cover expenses to pay for the child (School equipment, the time spent on them picking them up/dropping off, etc).   It sucks, but I do not think that avoiding tax on children would be practical.  You could say "but just exempt dividends and trust distributions" - then the child would just be a contractor, or employee. You would then ban children from being able to do contracts for money, but that would cause issues with people I personally know (which implies it's fairly common). You ban children from being employees? I'm sure a 16 year old would rather pay tax than be exempt from a job.  You could implement a test to see if they're being paid appropriately for the work being done, but that would be an uphill battle from the start and a *huge* drain on the system, holy shit the effort it takes to verify this already for partnerships is crazy high.  It sucks, but honestly, it's there for a reason. SMH reddit.  Not a single person here has thought critically about this and has instead just gone along with it in agreement. I agree with u/paulddraper about felons though. That would likely be a better starting point than minors.	1590637861.0	fs1xj8e	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1xj8e/

579varnv	Well if you don’t want to pay taxes, I think you also should not enjoy the benefits of government spending that comes from taxation. Your parents claim you as a dependent on their tax return and in some countries, the government gives your parents childcare benefits of hundreds monthly.  Also if you don’t pay taxes, then police shouldn’t protect you. Schools shouldn’t educate you, if you don’t want to be a part of the system.	1590639729.0	fs20cxo	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs20cxo/

5a4f9	Bring on the downvotes, but ...   ITT: people misunderstanding what "taxation without representation" means.    Even if they're not allowed to vote yet, teenagers still have representation.  They're still constituents of their state's elected representatives.  Congressmen are supposed to represent the interests of *everyone* in their state/district, not just the ones who vote for them.  (Whether you think it always works out that way in practice is another question entirely.)   As a few people here have noted, DC residents are among the few who might actually be able to use the "no taxation without representation" rallying cry legitimately, because they have no voting representation in Congress.  They do get a few electoral votes, at least.  Now, if you think teenagers should be able to vote, or shouldn't have to pay taxes, that's fine to argue, but it's a separate issue from "taxation without representation".	1590640159.0	fs20z93	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs20z93/

12ldg8	This is such a stupid stance. You are paying taxes for two reasons; to legitimize money and to pay for stuff.   If you earn you should contribute to the legitimatization of the currency. If you use services paid for my the gov I.e being able to sleep at night due to a standing military then you should pay taxes.   You don’t magically get the benefits bc of a vote.

7omvd	To all the other replies - before you’re 18 you’re under the guardianship of either an adult or the state. They are responsible for providing for you. You don’t need to work - it’s voluntary, and not necessary to your existence. If you don’t agree with the taxes and voluntary terms of employment, don’t work. Once you’re 18 you can express yourself with a vote. Also “Taxation without representation” was basically a campaign slogan, not part of any legally enforceable document.   Pay your taxes, citizens.	1590643638.0	fs25ta7	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs25ta7/

8pqoy	This will be abused to hell by rich families. If they would be tax exempt, it could only be to a certain amount, which is just like what the current tax code is.   I think what you lot are really on about is kids not paying into social security and healthcare. Moreover, the reasoning of OP is unsound since your parent or guardian is your legal representative in all things, so they are essentially voting for you, but their vote can’t count more because that, too, can be obviously abused.  What this really is is a bunch of people wishing they had been paid more for their low wage part time job in their teens which, at the end of the day, boils down to a minimum wage increase *for all*. These poorly thought out ideas are why the youth aren’t respected politically.	1590644740.0	fs27a3z	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs27a3z/

6ysqf	Taxation without representation refers to being taxed by an authority without elected officials.  You have elected officials.  You are exempt from voting just as you are exempt from the military or being charged as an adult.  You have representation in the form of your guardians voting for your elected officials.  You do not need to file income tax returns unless you breach a pretty significant single filers income bracket.  This is right up there with some r/teenagers level intelligence.  But if you want to really follow this logic, then so be it.  Since you can't vote, you don't have to pay taxes.  And since you can't pay taxes, you don't get to collect income from a job.  You are listed as dependents, and the pay for your labor should go to those who've listed you as such.	1590646584.0	fs29los	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs29los/

They would just roll up minor's income into the income of their legal guardian, on the basis that the legal guardian is responsible for you, and able to vote with your interest in mind.  Or they would just raise the minimum age of employment, and still get their taxes.  Don't forget, lots of people aren't able to vote, but still get taxed. Felons, non-citizen legally (and sometimes even illegally) working, and people with mental impairment issues.  They still get taxed though.

1t2fmzsq	I’ve been saying this for years. And to add on- I don’t think minors should pay ANY taxes, including the basic tax slapped on any purchase made (such as food or clothing). Minors do not have a say in where that money goes due to not being able to vote, therefore it is taxation without representation. No taxation without representation is literally the basis of which America was built on. To violate that through minors is extreme hypocrisy, and arguably, traitorous to this country.	1590671485.0	fs3346m	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3346m/

tpk25	It seems good on paper, but it has several issues. There is little to stop people from have teenagers earn their salary to evade taxes if teenagers were tax free. People already reduce their taxes by putting their assets in a corporation, so why don't you think this will be exploit to avoid taxes completely. Additionally, since many countries have progressive tax brackets and standard tax return, it would be rare  for a minor to earn enough money to have to pay taxes anyway. People may not even earn enough to be taxed even if they can vote. Additionally, sales tax is a thing. Should stores have to check customers ID to verify their age to pay sales tax? Or should the business bare the cost of the sales tax? Having valid ID is already a problem in the US. What would prevent a business charging sales tax because someone can't prove they aren't a minor.	1590673105.0	fs35w2k	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs35w2k/

af1n7	taxation without representation is for the state rep, not the individual vote. This is like when people say "I have the right to free speech" when a private organization censors them. The right to free speech only applies if *the government* is the one censoring you. Same thing here, you still have representation with the government at 16. your state ***representative*** is voting for you with the federal government. You just don't get to vote who your state rep is, because your state considers you a minor and so your parents legally speak for you.  representation ≠ your individual vote.  representation = your state ***representative*** in federal government	1590674004.0	fs37igr	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs37igr/

It is a conflict of interest because your only motivation to vote will be to preserve your income.	1590675575.0	fs3afm1	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3afm1/

36hn0a8o	This is stupid statement on many levels, because taxes in the right system are paid to keep public services alive. Using that logic, if a kid is not working he should not use health care, school system or any public service. Paying tax is not equal as a right to vote. I for example paid tax as a foreign citizen and had no vote whatsoever. And not to mention the level of critical thinking at that age is probably the same as an average US voter (both democrat or republican), and now mentioning that I take everything back and say fuck it how much worse can it be 🤣. Give everyone a right to vote, because they will probably do it based on mainstream media reports (I repeat again both republican and democrat).	1591209225.0	fsrvje5	t3_grvlk2	t3_grvlk2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fsrvje5/

At rough minimum wage of $8.00 an hour that’s 31 hours a week. That’s a lot of working for a teenager.   Not saying they should or shouldn’t be able to vote, just seems like an unlikely situation.

Although, what about the employer who has to pay payroll tax for the 16-17 year old employees? Will that still have to happen?  If not, employers wouldn’t bother to hire people that are 18/19/20 simply because hiring a 16/17 year old means less payroll taxes.  If so, employers have to pay payroll taxes on younger employees paying no taxes at all?	1594240316.0	fxcnfuv	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1bcg9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fxcnfuv/

Taxation without representation was a rallying cry before the US Revolution but, despite that, it never shows up in any US law, including the constitution.

8bf7y	Seems like removing taxation from those unable to vote would be a legal loophole.  Unless you simply make it impossible for them to own a company or have assets transferred to them in this way until old enough to vote.  Or you make it simply so that those given responsibility enough to work and/or run a company are also allowed to vote. But only allow that if you can prove yourself in need of that before the normal voting age, such as by being legally distinct from your parents or legal guardians (they already have legal emancipation in some cases).  Both are solutions I would be in support of, so it seems like a non-issue honestly.	1590642633.0	fs24g9w	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1l95v	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs24g9w/

46rsnnmj	“16 year olds” aren’t taxed. they pay a pro rated rate during the year and at the end of the year they typically fall into the lowest tax bracket and literally get that money back. the lowest tax bracketed pays 0% taxes.   that is the “Tax Return”. That money at the end of the year isn’t just magic government money, it’s literally the money you have been paying during the year. it just helps the government keep a stream of income moving instead of paying all at the end, and they can’t know how much money you will make so they estimate during the year.  If you are 16, working a full time job and clearing the next bracket, then maybe there’s a point here. Otherwise it’s just not knowing how taxes work.	1590638814.0	fs1yztn	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1i418	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1yztn/

I know Ohio gives it back, but I don't know about the rest. The city I live in gives everything except school district taxes back.  **Edit:** After some quick Googling, turns out that the Federal part is not true. Minors *tend* to get all of their Federal income (still not including FICA) returned because they are typically working minimum wage jobs and are in the lowest tax bracket.

gk0gc	There'd be less spending on the welfare of the unemployed, but I don't think it'd have an effect on welfare programs that help people who are employed. There'd also likely be more employee protection.   On one end there are people who want a stronger safety net. On the other, others want less taxes.  I wouldn't mind it too much if stuff like landlording, investing, and business ownership didn't count as a job. That'd literally be a dictatorship of the proletariat.	1590641762.0	fs2397o	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22rn5	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2397o/

1uhpp0p4	No because you've bought the toy as a tax paying voter and have gifted the toy to your child. Your child did not pay tax on the gift.   If you had gifted the money to your toddler, and your toddler had used that money to buy the toys then maybe there is an arguement that it should be tax free.   That's the big problem with sales tax. There is no way to decide who pays what. While it's logical that the wealthier people pay the most in sales tax because they buy more things, it's also logical to say that poorer people are hurt more by sales tax because it takes up a larger portion of their spending power.   The right thing to do would be to abolish sales tax for everyone	1590649375.0	fs2cx3w	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1rqya	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2cx3w/

2ovgpp33	Not a big fan. Democracy is not a privilege but a right, in my view. Tied to the sovereignty and freedom inherent to humans. Doesn't sit well with me to set such requirements for voting. The right to vote ought only to be limited with very good reason. Having to contribute tax money means that a lot of the weaker members of society would lose their voice. People who need help and are in vulnerable positions. Of course there are also people who are just lazy and want handouts among them, but I wonder how many of those there are and I don't think it's worth it to oust them from voting if that also means the vulnerable people of society will lose their voice.	1590652716.0	fs2gn4k	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1bwh3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2gn4k/

N/A	Yes.   If you take out more in tax money than you pay into it, you are LITERALLY a leech on the ass of society.   I’d posit that this should only last one year. If you get laid off and fall on hard times, and you need to hop on unemployment/etc., and you take out more from the public purse than you put in that year, you will lose your right to vote, as well as any additional extraneous social services, besides whatever you’re already on.   If, however, you get hired someplace else and pay back into the public purse, you will be eligible to vote the next year.  Edit: who the fuck gave this gold? Next time you feel so enlightened about my retarded comment, donate a tree to be planted in Israel on my behalf. Make sure it’s a Gympie Stinger tree though.  Edit2; try not to take this so literally. Sometimes I just post random hypothetical shit for be reason, just to see some of the limitations of it and the reactions to it. Obviously if I ever became a despotic dictator, this would be pretty low down on my list.

N/A	No, because then the poorest can't vote.  Say you and the person you're married to make $23,999 a year, below the $24,000 threshold and none of that money is taxed.   Those are the people who have it hard, just barely scraping by, and if they can't vote because of that, the poorest would never be able to have a voice in government, and it would be easier than it is now to ignore them, and welfare programs that could help them would be even lower priority than they are now.  I say, all eligible voters pay taxes, not all taxpayers are eligible to vote.  The majority of us see literally no difference in our lives, but 17 and under kids with summer jobs get larger paychecks. As soon as they hit 18, pay your taxes, register to vote, and take your draft card.

4m2lcujx	Your axiom : ONLY net tax payers have the right to vote.  Opposite of your axiom: Non net tax payers do not deserve a right to vote.  Can we agree to a 3/5ths compromise for voting representation?  Wouldn't that be absurd? What if only men can vote? what if only landowners can vote?  What if only native born citizens can vote? What if race was a factor?  What if only non descendents of slaves could vote?  What if education tests were a prerequisite? What if there was a tax to vote?   I don't like where your  "Should only net tax payers have the right to vote?" is going.

5x18yjze	The real question; should the rich get more votes? If representation (votes) is tied to taxation, then surely those providing greater sums in taxation should be afforded greater representation in the system to which they have a greater investment.

4qzaro1z	According to a study I read a while back, it varies a lot by state and what you spend your money on but the average income for a single person who is actually a net tax payer for their life is around $95,000/year over 30 years; obviously where you live and what you do will greatly influence this number, it's just a national average.  This number is also highly variable based on what services you receive as well; if you went to private schools K-12 for instance you would only need to earn about $80,000 going by the national average.    People often forget that net-tax doesn't just mean welfare vs. income but also schools, roads, police, military, etc.  Ignoring the study and doing some work myself offsetting your share of military spending alone requires a salary of $28000 to "break even", and that is only for when you are working.  If you expect to live to be 80 and work 40 of those years you would actually need to be making close to $48,000/year for your federal income tax to offset your lifelong share of the military budget.  Such a proposal would disenfranchise a lot more people than you would initially expect.	1590656383.0	fs2khxp	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1bwh3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2khxp/

af1n7	taxation without representation is for the state, not the individual. This is like when people say "I have the right to free speech" when a private organization censors them. The right to free speech only applies if *the government* is the one censoring you. Same thing here, you still have representation with the government at 16. your state ***representative*** is voting *for* you with the federal government. You just don't get to vote who your state rep is, because your state considers you a minor and so your parents legally speak for you.   representation ≠ your vote.  representation = your state ***representative*** in federal government	1590673991.0	fs37hn3	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs27vhk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs37hn3/

3p7nkw2n	You pay social security and Medicare tax roughly 7.5% where i am that comes out of your income. It’s at a state level.  You have to make $12,200 to qualify to pay federal. And then all these people keep mentioning these one off taxes, like gift, and payroll, which will certainly almost never apply u less you gift more then $15,000 at 16-17 or you manage a company with payroll. Though at 16-17 not being an adult, you can’t legally sign the documentation to own a business so I don’t think it’s actually possible at all.   The idea with the social security and Medicare is that it goes to a pool where you can use it later when you get older and need it. Social security is suppose to help with retirement costs. Basically helps people with more financial management have something when they retire. However the state of these two programs is very controversial at the least. So I’m just gonna leave it at that.   The other huge flaw is literally anyone who buys something pays sales tax. So now what?  Should everyone who buys stuff be allowed to vote? Or anyone under 18 be exempt from sales tax?	1590679736.0	fs3irv4	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2h6xn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3irv4/

It’s why felons can be literally enslaved without any issues, which also results in prisons being packed full of people with minor offences and prisons threaten to shutdown unless they get filled back up over capacity.

N/A	> They don't want people hiring their child as a contractor and pay them their salary.  They would still be paying payroll taxes (the majority of them),  and it's still "income" and would now be taxed _twice_.  You _can_ already give a one-time tax free gift to your children of a pretty sizable amount..  and you can deduct the costs of their care,  so this is not a good scheme.  Plus if you have children,  there are _tons_ of tax-free investment and accounting vehicles available to you _and_ your children already.  > and the child doesn't pay tax.  State rules vary,  but Federal rules are clear:  Children pay federal taxes on any earned income over $12,200 and any unearned income over $1,100.  They pay taxes using the standard rates and tables as anyone else.

Plus then some elections would come down to the first candidate to figure out how to use Snapchat or become a meme.   There’s also no chance the average 16 year old understands geopolitical and financial policy. I don’t think the average adult voter does either but there are still a hell of a lot more that do.

N/A	Most right wingers that aren't neocons (liberals) want to raise the voting age to something above 20.  And this topic is actually indicative of the differences in ideology. Nobody disagrees that under 25 or so your brain is unformed. Leftists LITERALLY want/need people without adequate discernment or rationale to vote, and this sentiment is tied into their open border ideals as well.

That's a fine system, but it's not what most Americans are asking for or thinking of when they're pushing college for all. They want us to keep our current system where the people who struggled through high school can go to college, but have it paid for.   There's only so much money to go around.

biatu	There's decent points though. The top voted comment is mentioning how would we handle noncitizen workers? They clearly shouldn't be allowed to vote, they aren't adult citizens which is the criteria for voting, whereas the slogan "taxation without representation" was never a part of any legislation and was only a propaganda slogan. While it's a good one, it was never more than that. And to add to it, should noncitizen workers pay taxes?  While there's a decent argument you can make to allow kids to be exempt from taxes, it's not like they aren't directly benefitting from everything state and federal taxes do anyways. Roads, public services, parks, education, healthcare for low income. Sure they can't vote, but they're still able to take advantage of almost all those things that they're paying taxes for.  Maybe lowering the voting age to 16 would be better? But who knows. I wouldn't have wanted myself to vote at 16. My opinions have changed a ton since then, and at 16 I was arrogant about what I knew as a sophomore in HS. I hadn't even taken a single class yet about politics, it would've purely been voting out of my feeling about something without any knowledge of what I was voting for, which is a bad thing.

41hbtkyx	They are being represented. Their Parents (who make all important life decisions for their children anyway) vote with their kids needs in mind. This isn't about representation it's about wether they are developed enough to make an informed decision. I'm in high school right now (literally sitting in math) and the 16 year olds I know, even the 18 year olds, are not.    >So representation doesn’t matter if the person is sufficiently mentally impaired?  You make that sound pretty bad but yeah, kind of. I also don't want seriously mentally ill people voting, if they can barely perceive the world well enough to get through everyday life they can't really make an informed decision either. Only reason I'm against a law regulating that is the potential for government abuse of the law and the low number of people who actually are that impaired.  But while the age at which people are developed enough to make such a decision can be argued about, I think you would agree that a 4 year old shouldn't vote. So really it's not about should there be a minimum age but rather what should that age be, historically that has changed quite a lot but the developed world seems to have settled on about 18 which I, as am 18 year think is ok if not too early. I say that despite being more liberal than the current government and knowing that younger people are more liberal. But thats the point, they are more liberal and passionate about issues right now which can be good but when voting passion really isn't needed. What is needed to make an informed decision when voting is a mature grasp on the realities and consequences of all sorts of issues which is something that children living at home simple don't have as much as people who have experience more life, or at least life beyond the very protected environment of high school	1590657756.0	fs2lw2o	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2kfg4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2lw2o/

Bezos is hoarding off the back of tax breaks and subsidising his workers through state welfare so he can pay them peanuts. Money that's hoarded away by the rich is useless, it might as well be Thanos snapped out of existence.

3qbarojo	Suuure, you should study better history, what sparked the revolution were the Draconian measure adopted after the tea party act. Not to appear weak UK closed ports and cities. Ignored the plea for peace of the population and that's what sparked the revolution and British officers like George Washington to defect.  Taxation without representation sparked a bunch of bufoons to throw tea in the Arbor. If the British had accepted the offer of the cities to repay it fully and forgive them there would have been no revolution.  But instead they closed down entire cities and militarized major ports so that the population could not access goods.  Most of the heads of the revolution were British officers and represented already by the British parliament genius as were the colonists all British citizens.  "No taxation without representation" was nothing more than a ear-catching slogan  Not the taxes but the "intolerable acts" drove people to revolt  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts  Most "revolutionaries" never wanted indipendence in the first place things just escalated into civil war and people didn't have much of a choice when the British started behaving with repression.	1592152114.0	fut9bls	t3_grvlk2	t1_fun38vu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fut9bls/

3p7nkw2n	I get that, I worked 3 days a week and could see how doing “doubles” Saturday and Sunday with a Friday evening could put you close. That’s how I spent my first couple months working in college while I adjusted. I wanted time for school so when the weekend came to work I worked all day.  And every area is different.  Minimum wage is different.   Sometimes it’s a need, sometimes, like me, I just had nothing else and wanted money so I would volunteer to work that much.   I also did not clarify that state tax is entirely separate in that comment but I also did really expect anyone to read it either lol.	1590646208.0	fs2952j	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs28tx4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2952j/
3p7nkw2n	That makes sense, because I believe in some states you can drink on private property at 18. Not sure though.  However drinking isn’t the only thing that’s 21. Firearm purchases and ammunition and well now cigarettes and tobacco is 21 and up.  Again why can’t I choose to ruin my body at 18 but I can be trusted to vote for something that will impact a whole country.   To me the easiest thing is that 18-21 isn’t going to be the majority voting power so it’s not like whoever they vote for is automatically the winner. There would have to be some other age group that also votes the same for them to carry which is why I do not particularly care.	1590678847.0	fs3gxhs	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2g64d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3gxhs/

And in most countries working youth jobs never pays enough to get over the tax free threshold anyway (I believe it varies by state in the US)  And take WA as an example. No income tax, but sales tax.

N/A	This has nothing to do with gift tax. The idea is if there was no income tax for minors parents could "hire" them as contractors/employees and run their salary through them.  I live in Australia and this is still currently already done. We dont pay taxes on the first 18k~ of income, so if a business owner is facing a somewhat high tax bill its very common for their accountants to put their teenage kids on the payroll and throw 17-18k at them on paper. It saves thousands in tax. All legal.  Now imagine that exact same scenario again, except instead of saving a few thousand off of the 18k worth of taxable income, its tens of thousands being shifted on 100k+ taxable income.	1590650851.0	fs2el66	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1y50u	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2el66/

Also, I don't see why applying for small business loans has any relavence, why bring it up? (Actually asking, I'm curious).   In the same conversation, the person I was talking to also brought up trading stock in your kids name from a much earlier age.

2202eo7h	First of all the child would be the owner but the parent could still represent the child as the CEO and sign for anything. As far as the gift tax goes it is about 40%. So let's say the company is worth $10m. The gift tax would be about $4m. Typically a company is worth about 2-4x earnings before taxes. That means the company is making between $2.5-5m a year before taxes. Corporate tax rate is about 20‰. So by not paying taxes because it is owned by the child they are saving $.5-1m a year. Which means they break even in 4-8 years. If the gift is put into a trust the parent can decide when and how much money the child gets which prevents the child from just taking it all.	1590653677.0	fs2hoc8	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1yt2g	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2hoc8/

8bf7y	Sadly there's no good way to test individuals for their "capacity to vote," as such testing would be ultimately abused in some way.   So we have to set an arbitrary age for it, to ensure fairness. Even if millions of adults will never be mentally mature enough to make informed decisions in voting, regardless of their age.  If a 16 or 17 year old shows themselves as responsible enough to work a job and file their taxes, essentially being a part of our system that is society by doing so, I think they should be allowed to vote though. Because at that point they are doing exactly what grown adults are doing.  This would only work well though if such individuals were legally distinct from their parents or guardians, as otherwise parents would be able to control their income or voting decisions or such very heavily.	1590644008.0	fs26b2q	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1ty4k	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs26b2q/

1z61wsmg	From my own experience as a Scot, the voting age for Scottish elections is 16 and for whole UK elections it's 18. Now, as with most things, it's a matter of opinion which one's more of a shit show, but, I mean... come on.  As for personal experience (which is obviously far from universal, but still counts for something), I know that all my friends who are now 18 basically have the same political views as they did 2 years ago and ain't changing their minds. I'm not 18 yet, but I don't see my views being any different when I am.  I think for the most part, the 16 and 17 year olds who would actually go out and vote are probably informed and independent enough to make their own decisions. There will always be idiots and gullible people in every age group, we can't deny them the right to vote just because of that.	1590655825.0	fs2jwx5	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1ty4k	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2jwx5/

No matter what we do, the military age has to be the one where the government steps off of your rights. If you're a big enough kid to fight and kill for the country, you're big enough to drink and vote.  I'm not saying raise everything to 20 years or something, but that the military age should at least be the cap on age-related stuff. You can't be a soldier at 18 and eligible to vote, drink, and smoke at 21, for example. If I'm risking my life, body, and mind for the country i should have my part in running it.

I'm bored and interested to see the ROI that can be earned if you pay zero in federal taxes for the whole year and invest it as you're paid.  Median income is about $30k/year. A single taxpayer with no deductions will pay about $1,942 in federal taxes. If you got paid monthly and you had your W-4 withholding down pat you would pay about $162/mo in federal taxes. If you put that money in to an mutual fund each month that averages 7% (not happening this year lol) over the course of the year you would make about $75.  If you put the money in a high yield savings account of say 2% (probably a little lower than that now but this time last year some were around 2.1-2.2%) you would make about $21 in interest.  If you were a high earner, say $100k/year, you'd be paying about $1270/mo in federal taxes. Your money would earn you about $590 over the course of a year at 7% in an investment account or about $166 over a year in a 2% HYSA.	1590693880.0	fs4d014	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3150c	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs4d014/

352cl	No. If you know for a fact you will make under the amount that's required to pay taxes you can set your withholding to 0. You should not have any taxes taken out of your paycheck at that point.	1590653399.0	fs2hdmc	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2cewn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2hdmc/
352cl	It's yearly earnings after deductions. If you're working a ton of hours you might be outside of the deduction range. It should still not be a significant portion of your income. If it is, you need to fix your withholding. A lot of employers may default you to a much higher rate than what you actually need to pay.  If you've filed a return, a quick way to tell is by answering this question: Did you get money back, owe money, or come out even?  **If you got money back: You overpaid tax.**  If you owed: You didn't give the government an interest free loan (good)  If you came out even: This is ideal. You didn't under or overpay taxes.  **If you got a significant amount back: You definitely need to adjust your withholding.**  Federal income tax on a year (2080 hours worked) of min. wage, with no other deductions/credits other than the standard one, would be $1442 or roughly $60 a paycheck. That includes FICA.	1590653867.0	fs2hvjg	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2081t	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2hvjg/

juc2p	As a European, I can confirm.  I can also say that the American way of no-standardised-tests sounds *incredibly* stupid. Like, here, it's pretty simple: every course has a certain number of possible students, and the students with the highest total marks in national standardised tests gets in. Fair, equal, no way to cheat it and none of this "Depends on how much the university likes you" bullcrap.  But in US? Noooo, can't do that. Gotta instead decide who gets in based on *interviews*. Literally, like job interviews, but where instead of for a job, it's for a thing that decides your entire life. It's so corrupt that "He got in because his dad's a big investor" is a common refrain everywhere, and the response to questions about racism are "Lawmakers say it's a good thing".	1590666620.0	fs2vy86	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1z3bb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2vy86/

myjzi	Popularity contest winners shouldn't have the ability to alter taxes for anybody. Simple and transparent - flat rate taxation would fix many of the injustices that exist by disallowing special treatment for any one group of people or bracket. It would also take away a big financial incentive to purchase popularity contest winners for special treatment (not all, but a big chunk of it). I feel having this in place combined with an UBI would be a nice balancing trick to make most of the political compass happy.

N/A	I agree. and I personally GDP should be pretty far down the list of metrics by which we should measure our country’s successes. Pains me that it’s always number one.   I don’t know. I’m kind of just spitballing or brainstorming. I would say that homemakers are probably not on welfare since they’re families would be provided for by the breadwinner.   I mean, a couple hundred years ago, people were trying to give married men two votes since their wife would “obviously vote for whoever her husband chose, if he was in a good and obedient marriage”.	1590665242.0	fs2u5uv	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs27zmi	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2u5uv/
N/A	You can be poor and not a welfare queen.   Also, money in to money out is relational. You can be poor, work minimum wage, and still break even or be net positive towards public purse. Poor people shouldn’t live on welfare. It should be temporary, until they’re able to get back on their feet again.   But also consider that we are on a meme sub for political extremists and nothing that we talk about will ever be put into practice and we’re essentially just arguing over whatever random shit I just made up to post in the child comments of a meme with less than a thousand upvotes.	1590638429.0	fs1yep0	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1xyr0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1yep0/

cwlek	Yeah, it's kind of scary.  I don't have the hard numbers, but I suspect a lot of the people saying "yes" think that in the scenario where only "net tax payers" can vote it would result in like only blue collar middle class voters or something.  Reality is, most of your rich dudes are still "net tax payers" even with the tax havens etc...  The only people actually hurt in that scenario would be lower class folks in the most dire of situations.

5gxhs75j	At least for myself and among the people I know, the main reason 16 year olds had jobs was to support their struggling working class families. I'm from the US, where unfortunately, this is still the case. If I were to have children in the future, I would make sure to never put my own children in the position of needing to work $5.00 an hour after taxes to help provide for the family, but it's a different case for others who are struggling and do have children. Additionally, this taxation case falls under my libertarian sensibilities as well; if you tax a 16 year old's paycheck, you should allow them to vote. Otherwise, it's clear and simple taxation without representation.  While it could become a tool in our capitalist system for the rich to make a tiny amount more money a year, it would *still* do more good for everyone than harm.  I want to defeat capitalism as much as the next revolutionary, but we can't do that by hurting the working and middle classes.	1590660410.0	fs2ojo1	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2nbkl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2ojo1/

4xk2n	The issue isn’t whether a minor can sign the contract. The issue is that a contract signed by a minor is voidable by the minor.

The ways around it in states is to have an adult co-sign it.	1590673949.0	fs37etl	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1uupa	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs37etl/

8bf7y	>Minors can enter into agreements, but have the power to void those agreements at will.   If you have the power to void an agreement at will, it isn't a legally binding contract, and so saying they can "sign contracts" is a bit misleading in that case.  Maybe technically correct that they can "sign" it, but not so correct that it counts as a contract.	1590642761.0	fs24mht	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1y5xk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs24mht/

8bf7y	Honestly, some folks working when younger get an advantage to it by learning how to work, so I would say it's not bad for those younger than 18 to be working necessarily. It can make easing into work once you reach legal adulthood easier if you have learned to work while younger.  In the USA, youth often won't have to pay tax due to standard exemptions, that is true. Though so do some grown adults, and I would never argue that they shouldn't be allowed to vote just because they are essentially in poverty.  Sales tax is different from income tax. I would argue that taxation without representation only should reasonably apply if you are taxed on your income, not if you just have to pay a higher prices for goods and services - something universal across society.   It's a complex issue. I just personally think that if someone is contributing to society through work, and is a part of our system which files taxes and maintains our society, they should be allowed to vote on how that system is run. It seems better in my view to have that be at age 18 normally, but allow for exceptions for those who are legally distinct entities from a younger age (such as those who are legally emancipated).   Perhaps society could also just funnel taxes from those younger than 18 towards programs specifically to help those younger than 18, like education, to find some justification for taxation without representation. Since at least in that case, the taxes would be working for their benefit less ambiguously.	1590643289.0	fs25ce4	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22eag	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs25ce4/

2ooje7ls	You think senior citizen with dementia (watching scare tactic “news” all day) is any better? I said this in another comment, but if a 16 year old is civic minded enough to want to vote (when most 20 somethings don’t even care to vote), then they should be able to.  Edit: and 18 is arbitrary. How is that so much better than 16? Might as well raise the voting age to 25 if you really want to be sure people have matured as much as they can.	1590641850.0	fs23dms	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs23606	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs23dms/

Its a huge risk to try and run a business without being able to apply for loans as well as it will cripple your ability to grow too.

99gxlgm	Reminder that almost no 16 year old is paying 12% taxes.  In the first place you’d have to make more than $12k in a year to pass standard deduction before income tax is even considered. Almost no minimum wage part time is going to get you over that.  That leaves state tax (variable but usually has its own credits) and Medicare (you will use this when you’re old so pony up now).  EDIT: also thought “education tax” was hilarious since that’s almost exclusively handled by property tax and I’m guessing you don’t pay a dime of that.	1590641343.0	fs22o2u	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1vsnf	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs22o2u/

2yz3ba7u	Aswell get rid of useless majors or atleast don't subsidize them. Aswell cut the number of people who actually go to college by closing down the number of universities and restricting the number of extra students a school can have based on population growth. Truth sucks but college shouldn't be for everyone, everyone should have a shot to get in but if you just aren't made for it you don't go and learn a trade or get in another line of work, simple as that.             Libs like to talk about European free college but they don't realize that over in Europe less people get to go to college, only about 30% of german students go to uni in comparison to the US's 70%. Shit isn't so different in the rest of Europe, with French students 70% graduate High School but from that 70% only half go to college which is almost identical to norways percentage.	1590643297.0	fs25csf	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs21syy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs25csf/
1lgs0ywy	It’d be cheaper for everyone who went to college. What about blue collar workers who didn’t need to go to college? Or people working in computer science without a degree? They’re all getting fucked for something they had no part in causing.   In fact, it would encourage more people to go to college. Even if you “trim the fat,” the unescapable reality is that it will still cost more and be run much less efficiently with so many people. Not to mention, it’s going to be more or less state run and there will be shitloads of government inefficiency.   The fact of the matter is, people across the globe travel to the US for schooling because of the full experience it provides. People are willing to pay 6 figures for a reason; the US has the best higher education system in the world.   And if the college experience isn’t your thing, then go to fucking community college. It’s cheap as hell, and if your goal is to get a meaningless degree then you’ll accomplish that for sure. That sounds like what you’re describing here, to be honest.	1590647345.0	fs2ait3	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs21syy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2ait3/
g71m8	Well there’s a number of things at play.   1. Most college students don’t interview for their college. This is mostly for prestigious private universities.   2. Most European countries don’t have large swaths of the population who’s ancestors were slaves and as recently as 50 years ago were legally discriminated against based on their skin color. That *is* true for America though. So university systems are trying to balance the disadvantaged background of minorities against their grades.   3. All public universities have entry requirements based on rigid criteria like what percentile of your high school class you are and standardized test scores (like the SAT and ACT). So if you’re in the top X% of your class, you’re automatically accepted. If you score above X on the test, you automatically get accepted. Again, it’s private universities that go by looser criteria.   4. “He got in because his dad is a big investor” is a problem, but I’ll also argue that those wealthy people donating ludicrous amounts of money to schools is why those schools are some of the best in the world - they spend that money on better professors, better facilities, funding research, etc. Harvard has more money in the bank than some small countries - that’s largely because of the rich donors. The rich kids get their piece of paper, the less wealthy students get a better education.	1590678032.0	fs3f9sj	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2vy86	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3f9sj/

But most ppl will study history or literature or whatever for 3/4 years and then go work in a completely unrelated field and never use their degree again.

1lgs0ywy	Agreed. I was admittedly being a bit bombastic. It honestly irks me when Europeans bring up the good old “just follow the rest of the developed world” like the US isn’t it’s own country with its own culture and set of principals that obviously don’t match up with the “rest of the developed world” (Europe, really).  It’s not really about the value of the degree to me; it’s more about not forcing me to subsidize others decisions.   If you can’t afford to go to a big college for 4 years, then go to community college for 3 and transfer to a university. Preferably, specialize in what you want to do with your life early on and ditch college altogether.	1590636575.0	fs1vihd	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1tmfj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1vihd/

We could go further. Buisnessess can't vote, so they should be exempt from tax too.   Felons aren't taxed, they can't buy anything, they can't have an income while in prison. Felons are one of the few groups where this already applies.   Where the logic breaks down is when millions of Americans decide the right to vote every four years for one of two corrupt and broken political parties for their least worse candidate for president isn't worth the tens of thousands of dollars they pay on taxes. I would certainly forego my right to vote if it meant freedom from taxation.	1590651601.0	fs2fewx	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2eb2r	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2fewx/

Like locking your door when you leave, someone can just pick the lock, kick down the door, or break a window but it takes more effort. When it takes more effort, it'll happen less.

d1dnt	No. Corporations can lobby because politicians constantly leave and work for them (i.e. Health Minister under pre Trudeau government, Ronna Ambrose, now is on the board of Juul) not to mention the incestuous relationship our PM, cabinet, premiers, and staffers have with corporations and their executives/"liaisons" to government.   Our government is a bunch of technocrats who don't want a real democracy because then they would lose power and require actual oversight and accountability. By keeping government and it's institutions so fractured yet bureaucratic they can ride the chaos like seasoned jockeys while disenfranchising citizens and stripping them of basic and obvious rights like the ability to vote for you PM, premier directly without having to compromise your local representation. Or how about voting for senate? Or how about hiring guaranteed experts to run the different ministerial departments rather than play politicks 101 and appointing from a minority of elected reps, hoping you have people with the best qualifications (statistically near impossible)...	1590638941.0	fs1z6p0	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1ppha	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1z6p0/

3p7nkw2n	Weird I have never heard of an employee having to pay their employers taxes. I think if that’s the case you should probably seek other employment elsewhere.   Also right a letter to your congressman/woman, about employers having employees pay a tax for the employer. You have representation, you can call or right your representative, you just can’t choose them.   Regardless everyone pays sales tax but that just seems to be blatantly ignored here.  Edit: I did some research on payroll tax. It appears you may be confused, or myself, as how it works. It is essential setting aside your state tax. The employer pays the actual “payroll” tax. The employee portion is just setting aside the money that would go to state tax.	1590680845.0	fs3l3r4	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3kn0s	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3l3r4/

gskd3	Define contribution to the society. Is kindergartener contributing to society if he picks up trash from the ground? Is wearing a mask during pandemic is contributing to society? I'd say contributions are not equal. Giving some part time trash job for a summer or few days after school to a teen is more a favour to them than a necessity to a business or a country, I have no problem with baning work for kids, I'd much rather give them to the unemployed or seniors for them to be less isolated and that would give them feeling of being useful, and reintegrate them to the society like they do it in Scandinavian countries.  Right now we have a voting system based on maturity 18 is pretty much the norm for "mature enough" in my opinion barely. 16 year olds can barely look after a house cat. In addition, at 16 most kids don't even know what are the governing bodies are and what are their functions, how money works and is regulated, how the economy works in other words - basic knowledge to form any educated opinion. In my opinion voting should be based on education with bachelor degree as a minimum, but that would introduce number of problems because of perceived unfairness.	1590653037.0	fs2gzmf	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs28bzy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2gzmf/

6ay6chyn	I would'nt say "almost no". My last two years of high school I was working 30hrs a week at $8.25 (10 cents above minimum I believe) during school months and 40-50hrs a week during the summer. Some very rough math puts that at $14,355 (I don't actually recall what the exact number was). That was a not atypical schedule for kids in my area. Though I guess my state has pretty lax (no) laws on maximum hours for 16 and 17 year olds. Also knew a number of kids getting 15 bucks an hour for some companies. At that rate you'd only have to work an average of less than 16 hours a week to hit 12k.	1590662514.0	fs2qvbw	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22o2u	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2qvbw/

7tp58	1. A lot of 16 year olds start working part time jobs and paying for things for themselves. They start to take on other responsibilities too, such as getting a driver's license. There are many 16 year olds with more political knowledge than the average voter.     2. At 16, kids are actively learning history, civics, economics, geography, and other related subjects in school. If they could actively put that knowledge to use by voting, then it would start them on a lifelong journey of participating in politics. As it stands, by the time kids are 18 many have left their home towns to go to college. It can be difficult for college students to vote. For example, do you vote in your home riding, or your school riding?      3.  Elderly people who do not pay taxes are allowed to vote. They will obviously vote in their best interest, which tends towards the economic right because they are looking to protect their wealth, and they are looking for short-term solutions to problems, because they don't have long to live. Their decisions can seriously screw over young people, who get zero say.	1590637314.0	fs1woli	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1vl1p	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1woli/

aw9q5go	The standard deduction on the federal return is $12,400 which means your first $12,400 is not taxed. The standard deduction in Nebraska is $7,000. You’re probably still subject to FICA taxes, but there are certain instances you would be exempt from them as well.	1590672367.0	fs34lrm	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs32ggj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs34lrm/
352cl	The fact that you're 15, so presumably still in school, is why I say you shouldn't be paying anything. You're unlikely to be close to the taxable amount of income while working and going to school.   Even if we say you work 4 hours on weekdays and 16 hours on weekends you come out to   (4 x 5 + 8 x 2) x 52 is 1872 hours  1872 * $7.25 = $13572  The standard deduction is $12200, so $1372 would be your taxable wages... Or something like $137 in federal tax for the entire year.  But, again, given that you're 15 I doubt you are working 4 hours after school every single night AND working 8 hours every day on the weekend AND not taking a single day off.  And again this is only considering federal. Not state, SS, etc.	1590700462.0	fs4qptt	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs32ggj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs4qptt/

kem6q	Ironically to this conversation, my wife is Puerto Rican and we both have very strong feelings about exactly what you're pointing out. I agree that the PR issue is not the same as DC. But there is a similarity- a lack of representation in congress (which is solely what I was trying to respond to). There is no way that DC today looks like the original design intention. There are over 700,000 people living in it. And if it is operating as designed, then that's a bad original design. 99% of people living in DC are normal people who deserve to have congressional representation. They get taxed like every other individual. The indirect political power in DC comes mostly from Lobbyists and not from individuals. Individuals deserve representation.	1590677904.0	fs3f0h0	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs368x6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3f0h0/
ei9uk	Then it has nothing to do with paying taxes, and everything to do with being citizens. Therefor it doesn’t matter whether you pay tax or not.

5bnrl	Sales taxes in the US are calculated at the point of sale. Most businesses do not include the sales tax in the price of goods. When you buy something from a retail store, they calculate the tax at the register, you pay it, and then they give it to the government.   In the OP's example, if I'm a foreigner in America or a minor then I shouldn't have to pay it because I don't have representation.	1590646229.0	fs295z5	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs26uo8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs295z5/

82ula	TBH, if democracy is representative enough there should be all kinds of wackos in the parliment since there are always wackos to vote for them.  First past the post + two party system keeps fringe people out, regardless if you think they are good or bad, but it's just worse in all other aspects no matter how you look at it. Country basically swings wildly from 100% democrat to 100% republican (which aren't even good parties and barely have any meaning behind their namesake.) so people get to pretend their choice is the only existing political reality for 4 years, while all that means is half your life time you are basically unrepresented no matter which two you are voting for.  Also they get to repeal each other's laws every 4 years as if it's some dying roman republic farce where each new take-over dismantles everything from their previous consul. (Ok, it's not actually this bad yet.)  Regardless of political leaning, I think first thing to fix is dismantling two party first past the post system ASAP. Literally everyone but the establishment, that doesn't represent anyone in particular, wins. Exposing the reality with representative soup of parliment by showing that there are people who support wacko candidates is a very low price that comes with actual representation. Just accept that 50% of people are ratards (remember that the average person is dumb, and half of people are dumber than that), and hope for the best. At least there will be actual discourse.	1590639769.0	fs20f0k	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1skzv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs20f0k/

At 21 you can buy alcohol and tobacco (after that new legislation from last year)  At 25 you can run for the House of Representatives.  At 30 you can run for Senate.  At 35 your can run for President.	1590643185.0	fs257cf	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1xheg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs257cf/
N/A	I'm fine with pushing it to 60. But I'm pretty firmly of the idea that if your at the age where most people are retiring and giving up responsibilities,  that taking on the job with the *most* responsibility is probably not a good idea.   Plus 20 years in many cases is the low end for the impact of policies to take effect. It was mainly deregulation from the early 90s that lead to the 08 financial crisis.  It was regulations from the mid 90s that has caused student debt to begin to reach an untenable position.   And there's a big difference between being alive when these things happen and having to live with their outcome for 40-50 years.	1590639322.0	fs1zrav	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1z23d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1zrav/

8bf7y	> It does count as a contract even thought it is voidable.  I guess that just doesn't sit with the standard definition and usage of a contract, that I am aware of. Although I suppose if it can be enforced in one way, or under limited circumstances, then it is a contract to some degree.  But ultimately calling something a "contract" when you aren't required to follow it seems misleading at best. The entire point behind people trusting in a contract is that they have faith that the terms will be followed and legally enforceable.  If someone can sign a contract, but not be required to follow it - the contract is a useless scrap of paper (or digital document, or whatever medium was used to form the contract).   If such "contracts" are allowed, then we might as well not allow them to be signed in the first place.  Though I understand from a business perspective, or in certain circumstances, simple hope that a person won't void a contract or find a way to get around terms in it legally often are calculated and compared to how many will follow through in good faith.   So it isn't as though companies would be totally against allowing contracts that can be voided in whole or in part.  As an individual though, I would hate to ever risk signing a contract with a party that could void it at will.	1590652542.0	fs2gg4p	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2g2un	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2gg4p/

8bf7y	That is one possible implementation of a solution.   Though a parent could still in such a situation pay their child through their own business or the like an artificially enlarged amount, then effectively use their money as their own as they are a minor.  How would you prevent that from happening? I don't think there's a reasonable way to do so.  If you lower the tax burden on a minor in any way, some parents will find a way to exploit it for their own gain - though obviously this only applies to self-employed individuals.  Perhaps we could just allow minors to vote only if they earn above a certain amount of money - even the $12,000 or so standard exemption in the USA, for that specific year. If it was set to that amount, they wouldn't be taxed without representation after all, and a huge number of minors don't earn enough to get above that threshold.   Though then we end up with money being able to buy votes effectively, and what would stop a company or rich individual from employing minors and paying them $12,001 to get them to vote a certain way in swing districts or the like during major elections?  The problems are not easy to solve.	1590656070.0	fs2k65i	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2jk8x	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2k65i/

ocyad	I don’t think we should let 16 year olds vote. I knew to many idiots who didn’t pay attention and also talked about politics “for the memes”. While that is still true for older people I think at 16 many kids are still to immature to take voting seriously. We should have more programs in High School to encourage voting though. Having a mandatory lesson on how to sign up and giving the kids an option to register early would be great. Also streamlining the process for mail in voting would help with 18 year olds going to college and not knowing where to vote. The elderly still need a vote but we need to encourage younger people to vote by easing the process and putting in as little speed bumps as possible. I do like the idea of not taxing 16 year olds since they cannot vote though.

2yz3ba7u	Yea im totally cool with implementing similar programs here, theres no reason why your apprenticeship shouldn't be payed. Here in the states trades pay well as well, so its not like you actually need to get a degree for a good salary. However what i do see and hear is libs acting as if physical labor is beneath them or treat it as work for immigrants.           My dad is a tradesman working in construction and hes been open about how theres always work and his company offers paid apprenticeship but people don't want to work construction even though people have pretty high starting salaries of almost 20$/hr and go up real quick with a shit ton of overtime, as well he says that white city folk are the worst emplyees the company gets and they rarely last more than 3 months, the company and the construction industry in general is mostly made of Mexicans, "rednecks" and eastern europeans. (my dad actually learned to curse in polish from working in construction which i found funny)	1590649912.0	fs2djds	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2a9dv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2djds/

aeran	For that year, but in my experience most do pay taxes. Many young people dont pay while students, many retired people dont pay when retired, but most will pay taxes during the 30-40 years they are in the work force. Low income parents might add a few more tax free years, but by the time their kids are on their own they are at the peak earning years. I'd be curious what the percent of people have lifetime negative income tax rate. I also point out most of the statistics leave out Ss and medicare taxes, which are a federal income tax just by a different name.	1590658496.0	fs2mmcu	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs26omn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2mmcu/

anapr	Yes, the government is worse at risk assessment than the private sector, but the alternative is less people going to college. One way or another, whether the USG gives out backing for student loans or public funding, we've already accepted that the public goal is to make it easier for everyone to go to college, regardless of the ROI of that decision (and I happen to think it's great). That risk is already being taken; we're just haggling over who gets to pay for which part of it.	1590680027.0	fs3jdpu	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2nspr	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3jdpu/

n0kpc	Not really. There's a lot of types of Libright and a lot of different forms of AnCap. Generally every ideology's extreme can be broken down into the utopia and dystopia. The LibRight dystopia has the megacorporations, the LibRight utopia does not. Every ideology thinks that their ideology will ultimately result in their utopia (which is generally a good thing but never happens). Every ideology thinks everyone else's will result in their respective dystopia, which is also rarely ever the case.   I'm probably more of a LibCenter these days, truth be told, as I believe pretty strongly in unions and the worker's right to organize and strike for fair compensation and labor regulations. Those things are strengths to capitalism because, in the absence of government, people can petition their small business owners to give them fair wages and hours. Just the same, the business owner can fire them. If there's not a megacorporation that could realistically afford to hire and train a fuckload of new staff that need jobs, then business owners will be forced to compromise. In the LibRight/LibCenter utopia that I propose, neither the worker nor the employer would have an unfair upper hand. Whether it'd work or not in practice is kinda debatable, but it's a utopian ideology like most ideologies.	1590641758.0	fs2390h	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs21rj1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2390h/

4i3ld367	Not when you start to scratch beneath the surface of the basic woman.  Why are the vast majority of divorces filed by women? Because they see the father of their children as disposable.  Why do women not want to see women guilty of false allegations of rape go to prison?  Because they have no empathy for their sons, brothers, cousins.  Why do women have such a lackadaisical approach to parental abuse?  Because women would go to prison for beating their sons.  Ever since women got the vote the world has been built on maternal neglect and abuse, and feminine contempt for obligations to husbands and fathers.	1590645150.0	fs27t3m	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs27j7s	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs27t3m/

15syd9	Tldr: No corporate/union donations and a $1600 donation limit   Individuals are only allowed to donate a certain amount annually (approx. $1600). Corporations/Unions/NGO’s cannot donate at all. On top of that - the candidates themselves (prospective members of Parliament) are only allowed to spend approx. $110,000 over the course of the campaign (This fluctuates depending on the length of the campaign) Every candidate must have a designated individual who would face jail time alongside the candidate in the event that cap is breached.   Although I’m sure it may happen - people donating in others name is not a huge deal. It’s not that hard to raise the money to spend to the cap so why risk it fucking around?

3p7nkw2n	I see the confusion, you are referring to Medicare and Social Security, I’ve never heard it called a payroll tax before.   Regardless of that, you still   1) Have representation, though you may not have elected that person, they are still there to represent you.   2) Pay a tax anytime you buy something, excluding  a few states.   Also I have mention in other posts, being able to vote based on what level of tax you pay.  Edit:  I don’t know what flair I am lol. I take all sides, I’ll debate anything.

6vm2i	The logical endpoint of that way of thinking is a "one vote, one representative" system, where each citizen has a representative, and wherein we might as well just represent ourselves.  Or, the other end of that way of thinking is that anyone who lives somewhere that has any chosen state representative overseeing them has representation. So slaves that came over on ships from African colonies had representation in their new "home" because there were representatives chosen by other people.	1590679933.0	fs3j6nc	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3dbmr	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3j6nc/

352cl	Yeah. They _used_ to teach this stuff in public school. A lot of the life skills classes need to be brought back and made requirements. Everyone should have a go with home ec, civics, practical economics, shop, etc. Just get some foundation laid for basic adult things.  Don't feel bad. I'd say most adults in the US don't understand how their taxes work. Whenever you see someone talking about how Bernie (or whatever progressive of the week is the target) wants to tax you 50% it's because they don't understand how tax brackets work.	1590779046.0	fs8a5b6	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs4qx91	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs8a5b6/

7qhhv	Obi Wan wisely said that only the sith deal in absolutes. No gray area, it's either one extreme or the other.  Have you been to PR? Driven through "downtown" Arecibo? It looks like the Roman ruins, abandoned. A town that used to be vibrant and bustling with energy. If first-hand experience doesn't suffice, look at the numbers. Compare the fiscal situation right before Maria to the situation 30 years prior. The decline was self-inflicted. After all, the colony was established over a hundred years ago, so that didn't change.  People in PR don't realize the degree to which Americans are taxed. They went on a decades long spending spree, like a kid in a candy store, without having the means to pay for it. When the inevitable moment of reckoning came, they blamed the colony for it. How convenient.	1590684849.0	fs3tsbm	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3qizd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3tsbm/
ei9uk	Yes I know that the difference is the citizenship, that's partly the idea here.  This meme shouldn't be about taxation but simply about them being citizens. Just forget the historical nuance, think about how **technically irrelevant** it is to actually pay taxes in order to vote.  Can unemployed *citizens* vote? Sure can. Depending on their situation, they may pay $0 taxes.  And my entire point is that if we decide to fight for equality and justice, immigrants deserve to be part of that fight for many reasons.  Arguing that immigrants can't vote because they're not citizens, it's literally the same as arguing that kids can't vote because they're under 18. **So fucking what**, you know?	1590662709.0	fs2r3o2	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2q073	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2r3o2/
5iys9	Posts like these just reflect poorly on you. Maybe you shouldn't have forgotten what you learned or you should break out a notebook and practice.   School teaches you how to learn and how to think. It teaches you how to find the answers to things you don't know. If you didn't learn those things you unfortunately were in a region with poor education.   That exists in this country. Just because the system isn't perfect doesn't mean it's completely broken. Also how did y'all completely miss the point of the post.	1590641540.0	fs22y17	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22kmy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs22y17/
634gu	School teaches you how to take a test not how to learn.   You know theres more to life then STEM right? Just like there is more to education then tests.  Really showing your privilege assuming everyone has a functioning parent or two, but I guess all parents did k-12 right? So at least they can get a job in stem or learn how to get divorced or learn how to become an alcoholic or an OD'd junky. Ironically, child care and parenting is part of home economics. Something that i assure you exists in some of the largest suburban schools still.   Nurturing, creativity, and actual practical skills need to reach beyond just that of a child if you want to shit out a functioning adult at 18. Especially when parents, if they exist for a child, are busy churning away to pay bills with America's incredibly fucked work life balance in order to provide.	1590642107.0	fs23qhf	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22kgi	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs23qhf/

hgxv1	In programming it's rare that you ever have to do something more complicated than division and multiplication. When something more complex is needed, there's probably already an open source tool to help you with it or a brilliant savior who posted something on stack overflow about it ten years ago.  Regardless, I don't disagree that some general knowledge of topics is necessary to be a functioning human person. Obviously we need at least a baseline of subjects like math that will cover everything from addition to exponential functions, but needing to calculate the area of a triangle isn't going to come up a lot for the vast majority of people.  I believe that one of the biggest problems with America's education system is a lack of understanding of where practical knowledge ends and specialized knowledge begins. I think that elementary through middle school should be used to teach the bulk of practical knowledge (at a more accelerated rate than currently, of course) while highschool should be about teaching life skills, knowledge that there wasn't the time or understanding to cover previously, and the basics of specialized knowledge from a wide variety of fields to let kids get a taste for what they want to do in the future.	1590636934.0	fs1w2xp	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs1v097	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs1w2xp/

e7kqg	Agree!  But you can't have 90%+ of your asset ownership in the 1% class.  That's a recipe for falling into dictatorship and oligarchy.  I think we (as a western society) and the US especially has slid a little too far this way and is angling toward some dark times if that doesn't settle down.  It's not like a 1b payout is that much less a draw than a 100b payout, provided you're comparing well to others around you.  After all, a bit of that is about competition, rather than the raw number.  Most billionaires admit they'd never be able to spend all their money and just give it away eventually anyway to somewhat arbitrary charities.  Just a small amount more progressivness in the system will help toggle that a little more rationally in my opinion.  Think a little closer to Sweden instead of the US.  Maybe like Canada+.

91m87l	Avoiding it by giving it to kids is going to be the same as parents avoiding taxes to spend on self tho. What would stop the parents from spending it themselves? Its still effectively the parents money, all they have to do is take it back. The kid lives in your house and has no real power to say yes or no. Most kids that age have their parents as a verified user on their bank accounts anyway. I guess the kid could in theory threaten to sue or refuse to let them steal the money, but then the parents could just not hire them if they dont go along with the plan. So the kid could be super easily strong armed into that situation.  It isnt hard to imagine a parent saying. Im going to deposit a bunch of money in your account each month and then pull all of it out except for 200. You can keep that money, you dont have to do any work just let me deposit and withdrawl as I please. If you dont like it you dont get your share.

3p7nkw2n	Say that 18 is the legal age of adulthood. The fact that at 18 you can sign your own contracts. Also 18 means you’ve had the ability to complete your free education in k-12 except for rare occurrences.  This is pure speculation I really don’t know.   18 also doesn’t entitle you to have to pay tax, I believe it’s earning a certain income is what mandates federal tax, specifically, $12,200 a year. You may pay income tax depending on what state you live in but In Florida you do not. We pay sales tax so by this justification above, anyone in the state of Florida who purchases something should have the right to vote.  Sooo.... I think there might be some logic flaws in this.     Age also limits who can run for certain offices, such as 35 to be president. I assume the justification is to allow tile to build a resume and have practical experience before being handed the reigns of a country.

anapr	You're assuming that going to college is only worth it for the degree. The education that people actually get in college is important for many fields, like in most of STEM, teaching, architecture, management...etc. Having a society where everyone gets an opportunity for an additional 2-4 years of education is a good thing and there's not really a downside. Inexperienced 18 year olds are at the time in their lives where they have almost the lowest value to contribute to total productivity; that's the perfect time to invest in their education.   And the ROI of a college education for individuals is amazing.  I'd like to hear a reason for why people who want to go to college should not be able to do so, one that would increase total productivity or happiness of society or whatever.	1590686160.0	fs3wll1	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3qh5x	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3wll1/

Democracy, especially direct democracy is terrible for achieving the goal of greatest net happiness. Trusting the majority to know the best course of action for managing a population is just asking for trouble. It lends itself to corruption and is incredibly susceptible to propaganda. Fear can easily be used to make people vote a particular way with little to no regard for the facts of a situation.

6ay6chyn	So you're assuming that anyone in this thread who doesn't prefice their statement by saying "16 year olds shouldn't vote" is automatically pro 16 year olds voting? That seems like pretty flawed logic. The federal tax rate (for 2019) for income less than 9,700 is 10%, so $970. The income over that is 12% so $4,655 of the example would come to ~$560. My point is that they can't assume that almost no 16 year old is making $12,000 a year. Especially with rising minimum wages where is some regions of the US it's going to be as high as $15. NY for example where there are tons of kids working the just 16hrs a week necessary to hit 12k.	1590689355.0	fs43g8i	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs41ata	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs43g8i/

d8qwo	You're overestimating the grip and stranglehold that corporations would have on a government.  Now if the question were whether or not the United States government would take action on behalf of its corporations if Puerto Rico were to nationalize those industries post-independence... I think we would both agree that it would (and, in my opinion, should).  Native Americans is a bit old-hat, on the whole before my time. They have a lot more legal teeth now (which is a good thing) so I generally don't pay as much attention to it. There are far more pressing issues in their communities, namely drug addiction.  I looked at that Venezuelan coup attempt and it seems that it wasn't US backed so much as backed by mercenaries from the US. Now as a matter of fairness you could claim that that was just a cover story, but by the same token even the United States government isn't incompetent to the point they thought a fishing boat invasion would do anything.  I think Venezuela could certainly use a coup though. Those people are suffering greatly.  >Wealth disparity  Here is something we could agree on for sure I just think we would probably disagree on the solutions to it. I'm personally of the mind that a more free approach in the form of UBI would be best, the more left minded people may prefer a more socialist approach. I take issue with the idea that billionaires haven't earned their money though. I think that Microsoft as a company is certainly worth its market capitalization and Bill Gates is well deserving of the wealth he obtained from it. I think that Amazon as a company is certainly worth its market capitalization and Jeff bezos is well deserving of the wealth he's obtained from it. however at a certain point the lock-up of all that value is detrimental to the health of the economy and the economic prosperity of the nation's citizens. I don't think policies that just directly tax people without providing an incentive for those that are wealthy to take alternative means that would be more beneficial for the society and are associated with tax breaks are healthy.  For example Jeff Bezos has that pet space company called Blue Oriigin. If we were to Levy new taxes on the super rich but associate large tax breaks with investment into industries the United States deems particularly valuable (like space) then we can have the best of both worlds.  >Gerrymandering  District drawing should be done by algorithms  >Treatment of minorities  Cops should wear body cams and there needs to either be less collusion between the prosecutor's office and police or an oversight department to make sure that they're not playing favorites  >Influence of corporations  Lobbying is a gray area and I don't really want to get into it here but I want to make it clear that it's not all bad. It effectively serves as a way for the government to be made aware of corporate interests, like if a bill could have potential unforseen negative effects that the government isn't otherwise aware of.	1590686736.0	fs3xuc7	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3u8g0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs3xuc7/
7qhhv	In 1951 the people of PR democratically approved the law that eventually led to the creation of the current system.  While I prefer it to other systems of government, democracy does not guarantee economic success. Just look at Venezuela or even Greece. Lack of political power does not necessarily guarantee economic doom. See China, most of the former British colonies or Chile under Pinochet.	1590707011.0	fs53k3j	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3vn2f	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs53k3j/

N/A	While I understand that in your case it wouldn't be the best option, yours is a fairly uncommon situation if you think about it. Of the percentage of people with citizenship of a given country, that work abroad temporarily while retaining citizenship of the original country, and who have kids in the original country, and so on. I think the solution to that would be that people who work only temporarily overseas but retain a permenant home and permenant citizenship in the original country get a vote, but anyone who resides permenantly and/or does not reside for work reasons in another country don't get a vote.   For example in the UK you get fuckloads of retirees who go off and live in Spain til they die, they shouldn't get a vote in the UK because whatever happens in the UK doesn't affect them, but they should get a vote in Spain because it affects them because that's where they live. Of course that doesn't make sense if they don't pay taxes in Spain because that's taxation without representation in the UK and representation without taxation in Spain for them, but I assume (though I don't know) Spain has some kind of retail tax that they're subject to, and maybe some kind of solution could be worked out with transferring their pension to be in Spain, or maybe they just pay the taxes on their pension to the Spanish govt at the rate they would in the UK, or whatever whatever.   The point is if someone stays in another country for good then the elections in their home country essentially no longer affect them and they shouldn't get a vote.	1590663119.0	fs2rkna	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2lu15	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2rkna/

3z7wtl1o	Donations means you essentially tax being a good person. So you encourage people actively to be assholes, and the more of a parasite someone is, the more they are rewarded. Nobody likes to pay taxes, but your approach is actively conditioning society to be worse.  And if that wasn't enough of a problem, donations also result in bad allocation. No money goes to long term goals any more. Nobody wants to to research for non-urgent problems. So we'll never cure cancer or go to Mars, and end up with total stagnation.  As for "the private sector advances": Most of the private sector's advances are directly linked to foundational research done by universities, on taxation money. Oh, universities? They are gone too. Enjoy living in a country that's suffering from brain drain.  Donations do not scale, and do not get the money from where it's a surplus to where it's needed. Any western country that switches to a donation based budget will be utterly devastated within a generation.  You know why we all have tax systems? Survivorship bias. All the other systems were not competitive, so they do not exist any more. Taxation was so fucking effective that it replaced everything else. Let that sink in: Taxation is so good at accomplishing competitiveness that all tax-free societies have disappeared. Donations instead of taxes is a child's dream: You just want *other* people to pay taxes. Temporarily embarrassed millionaire, eh?  You know which economic system does not require taxes? Communism.	1590692937.0	fs4b14o	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs3zxe3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs4b14o/

9l50q	Holy reading comprehension... x2 for the lack of effective tax rate knowledge.   The statement was that almost no 16 year old pays a 12% tax rate.   If your income is $14k, the standard deduction knocks your taxable income to $2k. The 10% applies to that $2k. It’s that simple. All your other math is just straight up wrong.   Now, for the other part. In order to pay 12% in federal taxes, you need to make $68k/year. I’ll go out on a limb and say “almost no” 16 year old earns that.   Maybe you’re closer if you want to include FICA. FICA+Income Tax is 12% for those earning $22k/y. That’s not what was said, but I’ll be nice and give you that out if you want to take it.    You’re outside your element homie.   No flaws in that logic. You really trying to pretend that defending 16/17yos as tax payers in a thread discussing the voting rights of tax payers requires some kind of quantum leap in positing your support for 16/17yos suffrage?

Pretending like any minor who has sex is being groomed is dumb because teens also want to fuck their SO.   Also this doesnt have to do with voting, but hey lets get rid of the sexual assault comparisons: if i can trust you to drive a car which  could very easily cause damage to life, properly, and public safety, i can trust you to vote for a presidential candidate.	1590672850.0	fs35fxu	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs25jr6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs35fxu/

al6zp	You said “even 24.”  > As more policy starts to effect you, you tend to learn more about how it works and what you like, don’t like, and what you would fix and how.  I still did my research and voted as I saw fit, I wasn’t “ignorant”.  I’ve met 20 year olds who know more about policy than some 40 year olds I know. Using your own personal experience as a reason to limit voting isn’t valid. I feel more mature and educated on policies at 30 than I did at 28. That’s called life and experience.

6ay6chyn	Ah, I made the incorrect assumption that standard deduction didn't put you in a different tax bracket and that *gross* income over 12k was taxed at 12%. You are correct in that it would be taxed at 10%, not 12%. Also I subtracted 960 instead of 12000 from 14355.  Going back I think there is some confusion over what "almost no" I was referring to, I was quoting the the "almost no minimum wage part time is going to get you over that." My argument still stands that that is not the case.    I don't know where the 68k a year stat coming from though. If you make 22k and subtract the 12k then you have a taxable income of 10k (in the 12% bracket for federal income tax). The FICA tax rate is less than 8% for those making under like 100+k.   I also still think it's a leap to assume that someone saying that plenty of 16 year olds make 12+k a year means that that person wants 16 year olds to vote.	1590694395.0	fs4e2xh	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs4965d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs4e2xh/

N/A	It has nothing to do with how elderly or young vote. It's a matter of democratic stability.  Under one man one vote, a numerous demographic has plurality control over governance (and electioneering) for the majority of their lives, while smaller cohorts may see much shorter (if any) period of plurality electoral power.  Something is necessary to balance the different in power between generations. Should we have a massive Corona-babyboom, it basically means current Gen Z will never have a decent say in politics as they're outnumbered now and outnumbered later. (Im not Gen Z, so again, not personally impacted)  In the 1980s; the majority of policy was driven by wishes of late active working age population. Today it's more and more driven by senior citizen voting patterns, which are the same people. This is exactly why some generations, especially the younger ones, lose faith in democracy.	1590720641.0	fs5rnsr	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs388l1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs5rnsr/

85x2d	....really sounds like you're defending child grooming because adults get raped too. The fuck is wrong with you that you somehow think child grooming is comparable to workplace sexual assault? You seriously don't understand that child grooming involves with how you're talking about it, fuck off dude.   Yeah, if two 16 year olds fuck, it's fine. If a 23 year old at a party gets with a 16 year old, it's not fine. I'm not arguing the semantics of child grooming and rape with you.  Kids can also be easily coerced (or forced) to vote for whoever their parents tell them, with threats of violence or being grounded or something. 18 and you can move out and away from these abusive situations, and are more securely your own person.	1590727204.0	fs61yvm	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs35fxu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs61yvm/

3p7nkw2n	Correction “if not even 24” making it not definitive, but take it as you want.   Your whole next block here is just vague. You will always have a one off of every situation. There is always that 1 14 year old who is graduating college. Now before you get to into this, I’m not taking any sides here, I know I know, totally against this sub, but if you want to have a legitimate conversation consider everything.   First this is regarding 16-17 not 18 or older to which you seem to be implying so as of right now I don’t see any disagreement.     28 is ridiculously high secondly. The only considerable options are 21 to pair with drinking and firearm purchase as well as ammunition or 25 to pair with rental cars which are calculated based off insurance which is statistical, to which I’m sure includes maturity to some extent.   However, at 18 you can rent a car for certain situations and at 21 it lessons to allow just an extra surcharge as they are higher risk.   Now to regards to the actual topic at hand, a 16-17 year old making enough to pay federal tax is few and far between and can ignored. They would have to work 30 hours a week at a minimum wage every week. For state tax, on states with income tax, I can see an argument to be made to have voting rights on the level that applies, in that case for state governor and other officials.   However this is where the argument of no taxation without representation is flawed. Sales tax. Anyone who buys literally anything (service or grocery related and some other exceptions) is paying tax. Including every 10 year old spending their birthday money on a new toy and your dearly beloved elderly spending money on whatever it is they buy. I include that as some feel there should be a max age.  So then you say well tax on getting the money. Gift tax only applies above a certain amount, so that can be discarded.   I think that’s all I got, Cheers	1590642539.0	fs24bp5	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22t1a	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs24bp5/
3mwqac5d	Setting the minimum age at 18 is also aggressive because people aged 16-17 have a huge stake in college-related policy but can't vote on it. It leaves a lot of needs unanswered, as we can see today.   I picked 65 arbitrarily. I'm sure scientists could figure out the exact age at which the brain regresses past that of a 16 year old's.	1590641361.0	fs22oyf	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs22djx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs22oyf/

9l50q	EDIT: Went digging back to see he said “almost no” to 2 things. Get what you’re saying now. Was wondering what you were so hung up on. Still a pedantic and ultimately worthless correction to make.   > Going back I think there is some confusion over what “almost no” I was referring to, I was quoting the the “almost no minimum wage part time is going to get you over that.” My argument still stands that that is not the case.  The dude said no teenager pays a 12% tax rate. Literally no minimum wage job will get you there. Maybe with 50 hours overtime for a 90 hour work week. I don’t know what you’re arguing there. You’re just wrong.   If you run the numbers on a $68k income, it’s a 12% federal income tax effective rate. The first comment said their income tax was 12%. That’s impossible unless you make $68k. That’s why the response was “almost no teenager pays a 12% income tax”.   You’re the one that improperly interpreted that as “no teenager pays income tax”.   If you have $10k taxable income, only $300 of that is subject to the 12% tax rate. I don’t know what you’re getting at. It’s still less than 6% effective tax.   You lack contextual awareness then. This thread says 16/17yo workers are being taxed without representation. Someone says, “well not really, they don’t really pay taxes”. Then you say, “well I paid a couple hundred bucks”... so given the context... why say it in the thread?

85x2d	There's a big change between 16 and 18. 30 to 32 may not be, but you're still figuring shit out in high school. So the extra two years, and mental preparation that society does for an 18 year old to be an adult vs a 16 year old is important.	1590802502.0	fs9i20e	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs8y3mb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs9i20e/
5qo3yzey	I think you’re kind of detached from reality here:   1) child grooming(that is of a 16 year old) and work place sexual assault are comparable for two reasons: 1) there is a significant power difference(an adult vs a minor and a boss vs their employee) and 2) there is an age difference and thus a maturity difference(a 40 year old vs an 18 year old). these two reasons mean that the victim is much less likely to come out against their abuser or resist them.   2) but thats not how consent laws work: when you say a 16 year old can fuck that means they can fuck. Child grooming and sexual assault are still crimes. Saying the age of consent is 16 is literally just saying if they consent they can have sex legally, if they dont consent its still rape. Also if you think a 23 year old and a 16 year old hooking up at a party is child grooming you don’t know what it is.  3)In the United States there is a thing called a secret ballot, you dont have to tell anyone who you voted for. Not your parents not your employer not your SO. I think if a kid knows that their parent would take action against to them, and they are going to vote against the parent, they would lie to their parent to avoid retribution.   4) 18 year olds can be influenced easily as well especially by their parents, hell full grown adults can easily be influenced by their parents. Also in this economy most 18 year olds cannot just move out, especially with the severe lack of jobs.  Finally: just because **some** parents **might** use their kid for an extra vote it doesnt mean we should deprive ~2.53% of the population, about 7 million people their fundamental right to vote.	1590730280.0	fs66asx	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs61yvm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs66asx/

Then think about the odds of it working compared to the potential pay off.

klh9h	Most of our traits are genetic but we're tricked into they're learned since it's used to justify not giving handouts to the unintelligent, the unskilled, the lazy, etc. Most everything about a person has hard coded limits to the best it can be, and upbringing can only make it worse.	1590658058.0	fs2m6xd	t3_grvlk2	t1_fs2jnbb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fs2m6xd/
fcl6f	If by rules you mean laws that you can’t just simply re write, there’s a couple of reasons.   Feel free to go back a couple comments of mine and see the part of the burden of responsibility that is placed on 16 year olds in our society and 18 year olds.   Then realize that I would be ok changing the law to 16 year olds voting if their shared the same societal responsibilities, education, and burdens as adults.   Then realize you can’t simply make that happen by lowering the voting age, or the driving age. It would require a complete shift in our society.   Then realize why I think 16 year olds are mostly retards isn’t because of age, but because nothing is expected of them.   Now connect the dots.	1591237989.0	fstgnnv	t3_grvlk2	t1_fsdwwxd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/grvlk2/taxation_without_representation/fstgnnv/

7k83sh3	I can agree with most of that but 22-26 are pretty problematic. It's the age old positive vs. negative rights debate.

fcl6f	Nah. The policies and local offices they’d be voting for effect them way less if they can’t even do all these other social responsibilities. One age fits all for almost all except driving, experience is what makes kids better.

Number two: Listen fatass, I was never involved with my sons consultant firm, and number three? Well, listen Fat, I know all about Racism.  Back in my hometown, the group I used to run around with always go to the soda foundation of the *East* side of town. Mostly because there weren't as many colored folks around in those days. I said, "Now, why would we hike all the way across town when there's a perfectly fine soda fountain right here?" It was called Othello's and you could get a lime phosophate there for 10 cents. My friends said they were afraid of getting jumped on the walk home, which I thought was just so dang racist. They also had licorice whips. So one day I said, "No, I'm not walking that way, we're staying." cause it was August and it was 94 or 95 degrees out there. So we went to Othello's instead and got some malts and one fella got a grape nehi. So yeah, Danny got his head caved in with a tire iron later that day when a gang of black dudes caught him walking home, but for the rest of us it worked out fine. And salt water taffy, they had that there, too.  Anyways, my time is up.	1586391474.0	fmuhfij	t3_fxdq5s	t3_fxdq5s	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuhfij/

3ht84qy	I don't understand how it's possible for people to legitimately be freaking out this much about it. Bernie lost weeks ago. Dropping out was a formality.  Look, I love the guy, and I absolutely think he would have been a better president than either Trump or Biden, but after Super Tuesday I knew his chances were slim-to-none, and they only got worse. I had friends still posting campaign stuff saying, "We're not done yet! The race isn't even halfway over!" and I kept trying to explain to them that election math doesn't work like that. Bernie didn't need to win by a little, he needed to win by a *lot.* Huge, double digit margins, week after week, state after state, all over the country, if he wanted to actually catch up to Biden.  Turns out that radically improbable things don't happen very often. I'm sorry. It sucks.

N/A	People aren't even bothering to dispute that Biden has dementia over at r / politics. Like seriously, go check the comments sections, sort by controversial and you'll see a wall of people pointing out his cognitive decline. Barely any of them get a response. It's like even the shills have been ordered not to touch the issue at all. I suspect the astroturfing agencies know that even getting into an argument on the subject is a political loser, because all it does is solidify the association of "Biden + Dementia" in people's minds.  I mean like... you can't watch a Biden video these days and not notice his encroaching senility. The media spin machine may be in full swing, but even they can't polish a turd like this. Eventually voters are going to notice that Biden is just out of it and muttering incoherently, forgetting basic facts like his name, where he is or what he's doing, etc. I'm starting to expect something like a 40 state republican win in November.

3hqrmx4b	Turns out if you only post in pro Bernie subreddits, and only get pro Bernie news, you tend to think he's still got a shot. The most reddit thing in the entire primary was the day after super tuesday where the top posts on r/politics were articles about the 3 states Bernie won, some fluff piece that Beto O'Rourke's bandmate doesn't like that he endorsed Biden, and finally an article with a title like "Bernie's youth vote isn't showing up. Biden's older vote is".	1586406441.0	fmv59kh	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmun9af	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmv59kh/

6fqvu	It's almost as if there are consequences to Sanders losing the nomination and people are correctly concerned about that.  Supporting Sanders has always been an uphill battle. The establishment had always played dirty, always acted petty, and we knew what we were up against. Part of an uphill battle like that is being resilient and believing in your cause, in the possibility of victory, even when the odds re completely stacked against you.  If this is honestly the best reaction you can muster to people's frustration and despair, then I think that says a lot more about you than them. Is it really so hard for you to empathize here? Or does acting superior and condescending about it somehow make you feel better?	1586421905.0	fmvm0af	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmun9af	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvm0af/

yzab4	Reddit liberals are 20 year olds who's political leaning are sorta far left (not Gulag levels) while Biden is moderate left (or some would argue centre right).   Bernie basically represented the policies these kind of Liberals (Reddit liberals) wanted and that's why Reddit (or the large majority) rallied behind him. It's why you'd notice posts that  speak highly of him or promote him, get heavily upvoted. These views however do not represent the larger American populace nor do they represent the democrats (which Bernie wasn't a part of but was utilising and the base he had to convince for the primaries) therefore he hasn't won the primaries in the past 8 years (reddit liberals will argue that the dem establishment has worked against him, they have but that's kinda because Bernie isn't an actual dem and his policies go against Dem political leanings).  Now ever since Super Tuesday, Biden has been ahead and stomped Bernies presidential run in it's tracks. Now BernieBros (the term used to describe Bernie supporters) are upset and taking there frustrations out on Biden which has sprung up a plethora of posts that attack his character.  That's just what I've gathered as a non-american reddit user that browses numerous Political subreddits over the past year.	1586387619.0	fmuaiyb	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmu4nx6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuaiyb/

4shd70l6	I think Trump is a mixture of Populist while being  anti-anti-Trumpers. I don't think even HE considers himself anything specific. He's been registered as D, R and I in the past.    He's arrogant. He'll go with your advisement if you stroke his ego or if your position already leans toward his preconceived notions. IMO, He could've used his brashness to great advantage by being more selective and pointed with his words. He could've called out people for what they were doing without lobbing infantile insults.   Moreover, he could've chosen to be a true leader during this Covid ordeal. But we get a bunch of stream of consciousness ramblings as he's seemingly trying to gather all of his thoughts out loud in front of the country.   His policy has been hit or miss, IMO. I'm not mad. I'm more disappointed. He could've been better. He could've been that independent businessman that the fiscal conservatives have always wanted. To me, he loves his country, but he ultimately loves himself more.	1586397683.0	fmus4ts	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmug7ww	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmus4ts/

15s4kg	Bernie is an ineffectual, impotent, windbag. He has been in Congress for more than a quarter century at this point. What has he accomplished? What major piece of legislation has he graced the country with?   As far as I can tell his biggest policy contribution is making the Senate change their nepotism laws because Bernie was paying Jane, and her children from a previous marriage, something to the tune of $75k a year to "consult" for his Senate campaigns.	1586410543.0	fmvaehq	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmusfmt	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvaehq/

N/A	You can make the case that the trump presidency hasn't been that different from a Obama presidency.   The only true noteworthy thing Trump has done in office is killing Soleimani. I wasn't a fan of Trump as that played out but that was a pretty big win for not just the U.S. but the rest of the world whether they'd like to acknowledge it as such or not. They even have similar approval ratings.  That said, Biden's entire campaign is "I was VP to the first black president, let's beat trump". Meanwhile his political history has him pitted against minorities. The dude only says what he thinks will make him popular, he has no conviction, and he's flip flopped back and forth so many times I'm not convinced he believes in anything that comes out of his mouth.  Bidens plans will only hurt minorities. He has all of these ideas about helping out black entrepreneurship and education but the dumbass passed the crime bill of 1994. He's just saying the things people want to hear meanwhile he's had a hand in keeping minorities held down. The dude is just going to waste money on affirmative action because he thinks that's the cure to the race/wealth disparity when it's really just income inequality across all demographics.	1586394136.0	fmum6vl	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmuh5se	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmum6vl/

73emm	If by landslide you mean crashed and burned in first three states, won 1 state because everybody was busy dunking on Bloomberg and Bernie which then 3 Democrats proceeded to drop out and endorse him in a single day right before ST and few days after ST all election coverage stopped because of covid-19, then yes, he won by a landslide.   Month before Iowa Biden was near 30% in polls yet ended up with less than 15%, same with NH and Nevada. Anytime there is an attention on Biden he seems to crash and burn, but surely that won't happen in general election right? Nobody really pays attention to general election right? I'm sure it will work out, neolibs got this, they'll show bernie bros how it's done, again.	1586399745.0	fmuvekg	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmusabd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuvekg/

N/A	Bernie does quite well with people between 30-45, and that's an equal population to the over 45 crowd where Biden does best. Proportionally speaking, the under 30 vote was still very low regardless. People blame it on the increase turn out from older people but then you have to wonder why younger people didn't have a surge that was anywhere near similar. Even if you could point towards them having jobs and things that made it impossible for them go out and vote (which is fair enough in a lot of cases), the turnout still went down in some states.	1586398974.0	fmuu6wr	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmuipsj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuu6wr/

q2o6ntt	He’s the worst candidate as far as everybody is concerned. The neoliberals will vote for any moderate that has a pulse so they picked one with a pulse that the black voters would vote for. That way they can own Bernie.  The downside of voting for anybody with a pulse is now your candidate is a senile creep with extremely low enthusiasm and is likely to cost you every branch of the government.  But they beat Bernie Sanders I guess	1586411565.0	fmvblgj	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmuds95	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvblgj/

All those people wanting to bring back the good ol' days might want to consider exactly what policies made them so good...  - Pro regulation - Pro science - Pro labor - Pro environment - Anti trust - Anti corruption  All things that the modern Republican party is counter to.  Of course, his party was also a pretty big proponent of Prohibition, but you can't win em all.  It's also important to note that, though the party he founded (the Progressive/Bull Moose Party) supported equal rights (both race and sex), he was a bit of a racist (according to the Wikipedia article that I just read, anyway).  So, sadly, I agree with you that Trump will probably be reelected, but I just wanted to clarify that it's a fairly bad thing.  This concludes my Ted Talk.

Corporate taxes aren't progressive or efficient anyway so idk why people want them to be so high. They fall quite heavily and in a very flat way on labor and consumers. Capital gains are more progressive but also quite inefficient as you really want to encourage investment for economic growth.

I know, it's stupid to have to do it, but you are competing against 70 years of fucking propaganda and brainwashing. And like 45 years of those were without the internet. Also, maybe don't praise Castro and Cuba when you're a self labeled socialist. You're just asking for a weeks news cycle to be run on you.  If the goal is to wait 30 years to achieve anything then keep going. But if they don't switch branding AOC and the Squad aren't getting above the Senate at best.

N/A	> was a recent ruling and I can't see any bill that prevents me from owning my guns being passed.  but they can do that a multitude of ways.  make it infinitely more difficult for gun manufacturers to make guns, make more hoops for citicizens to own a gun, retrict ammo a million ways, etc.  they don't need to ban guns, or ammo, they just need to make them progressively more difficult and they can trample all over the 2nd amendment and do what they want.  >Not that I am in favor of any kind of gun law, I am not, but I'm more worried about rightward authoritarianism  yeah i just don't see that happening at all right now.  as far as i'm concerned the right is more about protecting my free speech.  the left wants hate speech laws.  the right is more about protecting 2nd amendment rights, and many prominent folks on the left have supported essentially a firearm ban and confiscation.  i see the right (i.e. trump) making an executive order that requires the removal of 2 regulations for every 1 imported on business.  freeing the business, removing government restriction, etc. etc.  but the left?  proposed the green new deal which would trample all over corporations and make it much harder for them to operate.  i just don't see right wing authoritarianism.

xefm4m2	> I can't see any bill that prevents me from owning my guns being passed.  Biden stated he would put Robert Francis O'Rourke in charge of an effort to specifically confiscate "assault weapons" from US citizens under the guise of a buyback, or force them into a federal registration scheme with the ATF.   DC v Heller hasn't carried much weight since the Supreme Court has refused to hear a relevant gun rights case since then, with the most recent being a blatantly unconstitutional NYC law that averted any court ruling by abolishing that specific law before the case reached the SC.   The fact that the ATF alone can make sweeping changes in what is legal with a simple change of opinion and written letter shows that the axe is hanging above the 2nd Amendment as a whole, and if the current "liberals" get their way the 2nd will literally be reduced to a right to hunt squirrels.	1593554121.0	fwis1dl	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmxhlci	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fwis1dl/

4tac3q9m	Bernie consistently was the most popular candidate among lower income and working class voters and was endorsed by many workers unions. Not to mention that Sanders policies would undoubtedly help working class people and families much more than any other dem candidate running. Medicare For All alone  would benefit lower income individuals and families immensely. And yeah he wants to eradicate student debt, which I think is fair. Also I wish that people would let the “but he has 3 houses” argument die. His two homes (which he has because he lives and works in different places and must establish a residency) and his cabin are by no means mansions, and even if they were it would not really matter to his base or contradict his policies.	1586403928.0	fmv1qrp	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmv0jg1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmv1qrp/

But he didn’t perform atrociously in the Dem primary debates, and even though in 2016 Trump had impressive knockdowns in the primaries, he didn’t do that well in the presidential debates...and it had zero effect on the election.

N/A	Well that one is fake but the Cornpop transcript is real and reads pretty much just like that one:   "I learned a lot. And I learned that it makes a difference. This was the diving board area, and I was one of the guards, and they weren’t allowed to – it was a 3-meter board. And if you fell off sideways, you landed on the damn, er, darn cement over there. And Corn Pop was a bad dude. And he ran a bunch of bad boys. And I did and back in those days – to show how things have changed – one of the things you had to use, if you used Pomade in your hair, you had to wear a baby cap. And so he was up on the board and wouldn’t listen to me. I said, ‘Hey, Esther, you! Off the board, or I’ll come up and drag you off.’ Well, he came off, and he said, ‘I’ll meet you outside.’  My car this – was mostly, these were all public housing behind us,” Biden continued. “My car – there was a gate on here. I parked my car outside the gate. And I – and he said, ‘I’ll be waiting for you. He was waiting for me with three guys with straight razors. Not a joke. There was a guy named Bill Wright Mouse the only white guy and he did all the pools. He was a mechanic. And I said, ‘What am I gonna do?’ And he said. ‘Come down here in the basement, where mechanics – all the mechanics- – where all the pool builder is.’ You know the chain, there used to be a chain that went across the deep end. And he cut off a six-foot length of chain, and folded it up and he said, ‘You walk out with that chain, and you walk to the car and say, ‘you may cut me man, but I’m gonna wrap this chain around your head.’  I said, ‘You’re kidding me.’ He said, ‘No if you don’t, don’t come back.’ And he was right. So I walked out with the chain. And I walked up to my car. And in those days, you remember the straight razors, you had to bang ’em on the curb, gettin’ em rusty, puttin’ em in the rain barrel, gettin’ em rusty? And I looked at him, but I was smart, then. I said, ‘First of all,’ I said, ‘when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I’ll kick you out again, but I shouldn’t have called you Esther Williams, and I apologize for that. I apologize.’ But I didn’t know that apology was gonna work.  He said, ‘you apologize to me?'” Biden went on. “I said, ‘I apologize but not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said.’ He said, ‘OK,’ closed that straight razor, and my heart began to beat again."	1586436065.0	fmvztw1	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmvv6kc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvztw1/

N/A	At this point Trump has suffered so many sexual assault accusations that I don't think his reputation can be harmed by them any further. His supporters understand that most of them are probably lies and they deride "fake news" as even faker than ever before, which frankly it really is.  I think Trump bringing up rape accusations against Biden will be a shock to many voters who haven't heard of it at all so far, because the media has barely covered it. It would force the media to address it at least for a week or two, which could significantly damage Biden's reputation.  Trump's reputation has already been dragged through the mud and you either love him or hate him. But Biden hasn't been dragged through almost anything yet, so he has a lot of damage that can be done to him. And Trump will be so happy to do it.	1586389893.0	fmuembt	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmuc1zs	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuembt/

iuxz7	Sanders is super easy to push around. I remember being really supportive of Bernie until he came to my city to give a speech, and let two sheboons snatch his mic away. All while he stood two feet away with his head down, while he listened to some random angry black chicks rail on about how racist the crowd was for being slightly more irritated about the interruption than fucking Sanders himself.   That's weakness. Pure, unadulterated, weakness. I can't even imagine Jeb Bush letting that happen. That shit might fly in Vermont, but I would unironically rather have someone with literal dementia in the oval office than someone who is such a massive pussy.	1586406477.0	fmv5bb7	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmuug4j	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmv5bb7/

N/A	To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bernie Sanders. His politics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Democratic Socialism most of his policy positions will go over a typical low-information voter's head. There’s also Bernie’s revolutionary outlook, which is deftly woven into his platform- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Castro's policies, for instance. Millennials understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his legislation, to realize that they’re not just renaming a post office- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bernie Sanders truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Bernie’s existential catchphrase “Millyuhnares and billyuhnares,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Marx's epic Das Kapital. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those establishment simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bernie Sanders' genius wit unfolds itself on their Twitter feeds. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂  And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bernie Sanders tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they don't just vote with their vaginas beforehand.

This reads like somebody who wants to keep the electoral college because “otherwise the cities would have too much power” while failing to recognize individuals would be getting equal representation  >after 5 other center/right dipshits dropped out  1. If you think anyone in the Democratic Party was “right,” (except maybe Tulsi sometimes) you’re dangerously out of touch. 2. Biden was still the most popular throughout almost the entire primary even before everybody dropped out. Bernie was only a head because no states with a significant number of black voters had voted yet. 3. Shouldn’t it matter that he was the second choice of all those voters? Doesn’t it say something that Bernie was so low on people’s lists that even when all but 1 competitors drop out, he gains very little support?  >that doesn’t mean the general voting populace wants him  Check the head-to-heads.

kyiky	We are not them. The establishment Democrats are right of center corporation stooges who entirely operate on cultural posturing without desiring any real change. We, the progressives in the party (I don’t like labels but I guess that one fits the best) have absolutely no desire for their platform at all, but every election we’re expected to fall in line, told were extremists and that they need to pander to the precious moderate vote (no offense). They assume well just vote for whatever toady they tout out on that stage because at least they’re closer to left than the other guy. Here’s an example of the constant way they split in our face: you just had a rather ugly nomination, you should in some regard make some concession to the large part of your base that just lost right? Picking Sanders as VP would be super popular and would secure those votes, picking Tulsi would at least show that you hear those voices in your party and would still get you your precious woman VP that you’re so concerned about. Instead they’re rumored to pick Kamala Harris, who is despised by most of us. Not even the slightest attempt to appeal to our agenda.  Well we make up a good 30% or more of the party, and we’re coming to realize that this will always be how they operate as long as they assume they’ll get out vote no matter what. If anything, were finally *starting* to form a coalition, a coalition that says “you don’t own our vote, and you won’t until you start making concessions to what we want done.” To people like me, it’s not the end of the world if Trump gets re-elected, and I could care less honestly.	1586432618.0	fmvvsoo	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmvum85	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvvsoo/

m9p2i	Yeah imo to go from Left to Centrist would be too much for me.  I think a healthy and opportune but duly-regulated economy with fairly strong monopoly protections is best for everyone, so I think that makes me more LibCenter.

I could largely give a fuck how well the state of the economy is personally advantageous to me, if that means that it’s the same level of decently-advantageous to as many people as possible, regardless of race/class/other social issues stuff.	1586410953.0	fmvavyw	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmv8tis	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvavyw/

7d0jd	If you go through my post history after only two comments, you’re already losing the argument.   And I’ll fully admit that I once thought he could win. Never said I didn’t. Bad faith argument.   I simply believe that he shouldn’t change his beliefs to something that will appeal to more people if he doesn’t truly believe in it.   That’s why I said that young people happen to agree with his ideas, he’s not “trying” to win by getting the young vote.   Like you said, literally everybody knows that’s not a good strategy for winning. He supports his ideas because those are his ideas   Not so hard.   Then I used the aforementioned examples to demonstrate that even when progressive ideas aren’t the most popular in the current moment, that it is still worth it to support what you believe in and work towards change in the future.  If you truly believe in your ideas, you shouldn’t give up on them just because other people might not like them.  Forget what the actual ideas are, and forget the fact that you disagree with and are having an emotional response to them.  It is logic not to compromise your ideas for the sake of popularity. This doesn’t even have to be political.	1586396662.0	fmuqftv	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmupefv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuqftv/

I find that to be silly, so I class myself as LibCenter.   However, under the logic of this sub, I’d be center on auth/lib because I believe in non-authoritarian government and center on left/right because I believe in regulated capitalism. Despite that, I don’t think “centrist” really describes my political views, so I don’t use that flair.	1586419145.0	fmvjfdk	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmvavyw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvjfdk/

Many of my NDP supporter friends say it’s hard to find major policy differences between the 2 now. Also the NDP has been so massively weakened over many election cycles, the libs are quickly replacing them as the dominant left party. It’s looking more and more like a 2 party system lately.

N/A	J. Salwyn Schapiro gave the best definition of fascism I've seen so far:  "It would be a great error to regard fascism as a counterrevolutionary movement directed against the communists, as was that of the reactionaries against the liberals during the first half of the nineteenth century. Fascism is something unique in modern history, in that it is a revolutionary movement of the middle class directed, on the one hand, against the great banks and big business and, on the other hand, against the revolutionary demands of the working class. It repudiates democracy as a political system in which the bankers, capitalists, and socialists find free scope for their activities, and it favors a dictatorship that will eliminate these elements from the life of the nation. Fascism proclaims a body of doctrines that are not entirely new; there are no "revelations" in history."	1586448766.0	fmwlla7	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmwjxbe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmwlla7/

cxevy	The difference is that the party in the center/center-left (the Liberals) has a vested interest in appeasing the left. If not, they bleed their left-leaning voters to them and can’t win.   Overall, it also helps in situations where a party nominates a trash leader, as the parties aren’t as polarized. Like in 2011, the Liberals completely shit the bed, causing an enormous portion of their voters to abandon them to vote for the left party (the NDP), making them the official opposition instead.   This same situation also works on the right. Less polarization means that there are a LOT of swing voters between the Liberals and the Conservatives as well.	1586389088.0	fmud6nw	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmucchh	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmud6nw/

cxevy	That’s true, but the one thing is that they’re also kept in check by the Conservatives.

5cpsq914	[This article](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/30/politics/kfile-joe-biden-cnn-interview-busing-desegregate-schools/index.html) seems to be a more nuanced take on the issue.  Also as a side note I'd prefer someone who supported garbage things 4 decades ago but has good policy today, over someone who is actively against free trade today and has come out against immigration in the last decade or so.  Particularly since if you look further into the past you can see plenty of fucked up things being supported by Bernie, such as his love for authoritarian regimes as long as they at least pretended to be left wing.	1586392967.0	fmuk39g	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmujef1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuk39g/
N/A	> for fucks sake  This quote right?  > Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this.  One can make many assumptions based on two words alone but I think you should dig deeper into what was going on here. I’m assuming you’re not basing “jungle” into a derogatory remark because that’s not the case based on context. NDuring this time government approved funding to education; however it became apparent segregated education centers were receiving less funds, hence bidens and many activists initial decline to busing and funding mandated by the department of education.

N/A	Its cool you take easy pot shots at bernie. Issues that are in vogue and hot button now.  But bernie was right in 2007.  Anyways, you also re iterate the lamest talking points ever of, "he thought this way back then when racism was allowed.  But changed his tune only as voters got younger and those making up the even more draconic laws than we have now were dying and couldn't prop their hate up with just money."  If going back to racism or whatever issue you say he flipped to the right way of thinking, would win todays race, joe would be like I flipped on this issue but i really didnt want to!  You can see where I used to stand on this issue!  Id rather have bernie who voted correctly and on the right side of history and for the people dating back 50 years.  But like hillary and her changing her stance on gay marriage somewhat she thought youre fooled on the easiest things because its the ea$ier group choice.  So I wont vote which is like voting for trump.  It really doesnt affect me, but because of this you can be for damn sure no woman or minority is ever gonna get the vote from me and a huge majority like me.

The percentage of abortions after 30 weeks is so low it doesn't even register as a percentage.* And to top it all off, abortions are decreasing and have been for quite a while.  If evangelicals *really* cared about abortion, they would fund the shit out of sex ed programs and wouldn't complain about giving women contraception.   *https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm  Edit: Found the vote. She voted against a law that would punish women receiving unnecessary late term abortions, rather than doctors giving them.	1586398331.0	fmut6c9	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmus4cl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmut6c9/

86qj6	Yes agreed. But in a lot of ways the DNC has already shot itself in the foot:  - They've been screaming rapist, racist and everything else at Trump at the drop of a hat that people have essentially become desensitized to it. And notably this hasn't hit his approval rating.   - It becomes hard to say your candidate is the salvation when they're being accused of the same things. Hell you can even put in clips of prominent Dems making those claims and overlay Biden being creepy.	1586410370.0	fmva743	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmv9kf2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmva743/
N/A	Leftists always pretend to believe  the amount of funding is tied to  how much people care. How much does it cost for parents to teach their daughters not to get pregnant out of wedlock? That should be ingrained by the time they get old enough to get pregnant. Both my parents taught me that getting a girl pregnant before marriage basically meant my life’s dreams were over. Buy little girls evidently get taught that it’s oppression to make good decisions around sex.    I’ve gone my entire life without having babies out of wedlock, but I gotta pay taxes to careless women that get pregnant to provide for their abortions? Get out of here. Obamacare gives women free access to condoms, but excludes men form getting them, but women needs more funding and support? At this point they should just explicitly play the inferiority card instead of having it underpin all their agendas.	1586399270.0	fmuunne	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmut6c9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmuunne/

b2xdg	Ironically I don't think this will make a jot of difference. If you start early with this, then in turn Biden voters become desensitised. If you leave it too late, it'll probably be irrelevant since this isn't at all new information and by then we'll know how the economy is going (which will really decide things). If there's a Corona recession Trump has literally nothing to say, especially if 100,000 Americans are dead and Biden is playing that tape of Trump bragging about disbanding medical teams	1586410556.0	fmvaf2c	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmva743	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmvaf2c/
N/A	> How much does it cost for parents to teach their daughters not to get pregnant out of wedlock?  So if their parents don't teach them or they don't have present parents, is that their fault?   *but I gotta pay taxes to careless women that get pregnant to provide for their abortions?*  No one said anything about you paying for unnecessary abortions. I was talking about 'religious' businesses using that as an excuse to avoid paying for health insurance that provides birth control for their employees.  *Obamacare gives women free access to condoms, but excludes men form getting them*   I would obviously be against that if it's true.

He is calling my union members lazy for risking their lives by still going to work, working double and triple shifts then opting to go eat fast food.

1uifwxnj	I’m just gonna chime in here to agree with /u/probablypissed. You’re getting pretty up in arms over the fact that they rightfully claimed fast food isn’t essential. It isn’t. It never will be. Not while grocery stores are open and running as usual. You’re really conflating essential with convenient here and it’s making you look really silly.	1586486011.0	fmyh2sg	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmyaxat	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmyh2sg/
N/A	Sorry but you are wrong.  You need to be able to feed people and not everyone can cook for themselves or drive 20 miles to the nearest grocery store to get stiff to cook when they are working 18 hours a day  Every state government and even the federal government agree you are wrong here.

N/A	This just popped into my head.   I don’t think you and that idiot who is attacking healthcare workers right now understand the logistics of the situation on why they are essential.    Imagine if all the restaurants were shut down.  The only place for people left to get food is grocery stores.    The grocery stores would not be able to handle the capacity of everyone going to them for all their food.  They wouldn’t be able to keep enough food on the shelves.    And to add to that, you would be sending everyone to the same places during a time we need to social distance from each other.    Not to mention you would be making it an extreme hardship for those on the front lines.   NYC has 9 million people living there. Do you think they have enough grocery stores to supply those 9 million.    The metropolitan area has 20 million.  Seriously take a second and think about the logistics of the situation.  There is a reason why politicians on both sides of the isle are telling you this.	1586524361.0	fmzm52e	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmyh2sg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fmzm52e/

1uifwxnj	>Do you think they have enough grocery stores to supply those 9 million.   Wait, are you honestly trying to compare restaurant capacity and grocery store capacity? Surely you realize that people can grocery shop once a week, maybe even less, whereas they'd be going to restaurants multiple times a day since they're only getting one meal.  Also, yes, grocery stores were literally built handle high capacities. Nothing has changed with a pandemic lol. If anything, they'd be less busy due to people staying home and hoarding.	1586641652.0	fn4hrwl	t3_fxdq5s	t1_fmzm52e	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fxdq5s/no_refunds/fn4hrwl/

8kvm3	Queer cleansing was the right answer in the 30s, but I think that's a little harsh in 2020.  The ultimate solution is within our grasp: DNA engineering.  We find the queer genes and we simply switch them off for new births.  Slowly over time LGBT will be naturally eradicated from the earth.  We have a social responsibility to do this, especially considering it will eradicate pedophilia and child rape.	1584896744.0	fl78ulx	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl6y6vy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl78ulx/

5pycv	That first one just isn’t an opinion it’s just a white supremacy talking point like come on. There’s pretty much never a good reason to be bringing that kind of shit up, cause if you’re at that point you’re probably already trying to defend some racist shit you said or you’re about to say some racist shit.  Besides that fact that pretty much any statistic, especially one quoted by some dumbfucks on a comment thread, should be viewed as unreliable unless you know the actual methodology behind it; Black people statistically get arrested for violent crimes more often than white people is the actual statistic and obviously at least part of that statistic can be attributed  to racism on behalf of the police. Saying “black people statistically commit more crime” is simply an incorrect statement that comes close enough to the actual meaning for people to let the change slide, but distorts it enough that a statistic that previously could be used as an argument that black people continue to be discriminated against by the police is now used to argue that black people are more likely to commit crimes.  I’m pretty sure men make up something like 75% of arrests but you don’t see people tossing that statistic around.	1584936988.0	fl907k3	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl74nv6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl907k3/

N/A	Statistics don't work well with one number. If you want to sort of tell a story with them, you need as much data as you can get.  An example I still love is when I was new to reddit and went to r/atheism before realizing it was shit, one thing they pushed was 90% of prison inmates are christian. But Christians only made up about 75-80% of the population. So obviously more christians were criminals than other groups.  Unfortunately that really doesn't actually tell me much. For instance, how many converted after being put in there? It wouldn't surprise me that some people, while working through their guilt, used religion as a way to find personal forgiveness. There's also the question of how many are really Christian. I hate to use a No True Scotsman arguement, but if you point to a person who pushed drugs and was arrested for stabbing someone while robbing them, and told me they were a Christian before getting arrested, I would question how much that should count. Maybe an extreme example, but it still makes the numbers seem a bit off IMO.  So them we go back to the whole black people issue. We know for a fact that black people have been systematically held down. And a lot of the things that fucked with them wasn't done all that long ago. There are people alive today who went through segregation. And even after that ended, we know the governmebt did things like put drugs in black communities to make life harder for them. It's also been shown they get arrested for the same crimes more often than white people. They get harsher sentences, similar to how men get harsher sentences than women.  Is there a problem with crime in the black community? Yes. Is it because they're black? No. Anyone who thinks it's because of pigment is dumb as shit. If they say it's because of culture, then we need to explore why they have a culture that has a crime problem. Not turn it back around to the color of their skin.  People who bitch about other saying that stats are racist are just looking for an excuse to continue to justify their racism. No one is saying facts are racist, just that people use them for their racism.  Edit: Also, trying to find out how to flair up on mobile.

1ysvm5i6	I've talked with some other people about this, but basically if you want to help black communities, first you have to admit that there is a problem. How are you going to solve the problem if you can't even talk about it?  Are you really going to put how *others might view you* above the severe economic, social, and cultural problems that exist in black communities?  Seems to me to be a holier-than-thou approach while simultaneously avoiding the problem so you don't appear to be racist.  >I’m pretty sure men make up something like 75% of arrests but you don’t see people tossing that statistic around.  Feminists do. It's one of the reasons why it's so hard for men to find shelters when they are victims of domestic abuse. No one believes them because it's usually the man right?  Well it turns out that statistically men and women commit domestic assault against each other about the same amount, and if you're a man you're more likely to be assaulted by another man than if you were a woman.	1584937296.0	fl90kwf	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl907k3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl90kwf/

h8wqw	This is actually incorrect.  Poor people tend to be white, black people tend to be poor.  While a higher percent of black people are poor compared to other races that does not mean a higher percent of the poor are black.  Whites still make up the majority of the poor and impoverished in the USA.  If it was just poor people being more likely to commit violent crimes white people would be over represented instead of underrepresented in those statistics.  There are far more variables like culture and population density to consider.  Also flair up.	1584898908.0	fl7chkz	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7aqe4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7chkz/

5pycv	Ok bud so what would say the problems are? Like are you seriously going to sit there and start typing out that these problems exist because the communities are black? Do we just ignore the fact that most of those communities exist purely because back in the 60s black people were piled into ghettos by the government? Do we ignore that until only like 40 years ago there were plenty of people in America who would probably have found the idea of being in the same pool with a black person disgusting? That as nearby as the 90s there were concentrated efforts by the government to put black people in jail? That the schools in most ghetto areas haven’t received a boost in funding since they were made to separate the little white boys from the little black boys?   Please explain to me in detail how the problems facing black communities stem from anything besides the situation that they were specifically put in by others.  I’m not being holier than thou I’m being fucking realistic.	1584937998.0	fl91eu2	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl90kwf	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl91eu2/

Hence they are silenced as to not break this carefully cultivated echo chamber for everyone knows dictatorship mentalities can’t hold up to scrutiny so silence of criticism is the only option left to these ideological tyrants so there followers don’t think outside their accepted world views.

5egody8y	It's a long fucking story and I don't feel like digging for everything right now.  I believe r/AgainstHateSubreddits still has a stickied post, where the moderator comment has details and links.  The stickied post was a response to the conspiracy theory that AHS is getting Right-Wing subs banned by spamming them with CP.  The long and short of the most recent development is this: certain Far-Right-Wing subreddits repeatedly allowed posts that are against the rules.  The admins start to take action.  All of a sudden, a bunch of CP is spammed in the subreddit.  The Right-Wingers say that this CP is the reason the sub gets banned, and that someone in AHS is doing it.   The admins have enough evidence of past harassment and ties to far-right subreddits, that they are on a damn near zero-tolerance policy.  This particular AHS moderator has been sent CP, accused of posting CP in other subs, doxxed, and harassed in real life.  The ~~mods~~ admins have investigated, and view it as a sustained harassment campaign.  This confuses people who come in and wonder what is going on. The admins aren't tolerating it anymore.  They are not willing to spend time sifting through the honestly curious people and the guys that "are just asking questions" (i.e. Why's it a big deal if there's nothing to hide?).  Since, in the past, trolls were posting CP and saying it was this mod, the admins feel there is a similar pattern with the conspiracy of "AHS is posting CP to get Right-Wing subs banned".  They view it as a continuation of the harassment.  Basically, besides the normal Reddit rules, don't accuse the admins and AHS of working together to post CP on Reddit.  Don't even entertain the idea.  They've had enough.	1584914612.0	fl82nic	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7z3xy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl82nic/

dqkq1	>"For some years past I have managed to make the capitalist class pay me several pounds a week for writing books against capitalism. But I do not delude myself that this state of affairs is going to last forever ... the only régime which, in the long run, will dare to permit freedom of speech is a Socialist régime. If Fascism triumphs I am finished as a writer—that is to say, finished in my only effective capacity. That of itself would be a sufficient reason for joining a Socialist party."  - [Quote from one of Orwell's essays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell#cite_ref-cejl1_242-0)  Sounds totally right-wing to me. \s	1584903225.0	fl7jubh	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7eo2m	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7jubh/

4ttmytbo	Anyone who seeks to abolish or at the very least minimize the size of the state, no matter what programs it undertakes.  A libertarian, for example, usually understands that a regulation abolishing lemonade stands is the moral equivalent of a regulation abolishing gay sex.  Self proclaimed "left" or "right" libertarians usually don't see it that way, they are libertarian in a dimension of their specific choosing, which is great, I'll happily accept any support of liberty but I wouldn't call them libertarians. They are usually _barely_ not authoritarian when it comes to their specific preferences and authoritarian on every other issue.	1584900909.0	fl7fxbn	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7f79k	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7fxbn/

N/A	Crime stats aren't denied, they are just interpreted and applied in a way that goes beyond using them as a stick to beat minorities. A lot of people are so hung up on the statistics of black people committing 50% of crime despite making up 13% of the population, but never ask themselves why that is. The figure is just accepted and people move forward from there instead of going back first to assess root causes.  ~~Edit: ah yes downvotes without explanation for critizing a different worldview on the sub about political differences, my favourite~~ nvm	1584901970.0	fl7hpw3	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl76nxj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7hpw3/

5egody8y	I hate when my Quadrant tries to simplistically explain this.  You have to get into police discrimination, for-profit prisons, recidivism, etc. and how all of these cause criminality to grow in a community.  The Black Panthers strapped up and started following cops around in Chicago.  It prevented cops from harassing the community, and criminality was lowered.  Dismantling the drug war and adding educational programs to prisons helps lower criminality.  Revving up the drug war, targeting certain communities, giving harsher punishments to certain folk, etc. cause criminality to go up for those communities.  It's not that hard to understand or explain.  "Cause they're poor" is just lazy.	1584909814.0	fl7uri0	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7chkz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7uri0/

1ysvm5i6	Just to start off I never claimed YOU were acting holier-than-thou, just the people who act like it's racist to bring up problems that effect certain communities.  First, you need to understand something about statistics. Let's say you have 5 neighbourhoods  A. It's mostly green people  B. It's mostly blue people  C. It's mostly red people  D. It's a mix of blue and red people  E. It's mostly turquoise people  Now let's say you have 10 officers patrolling at all times. After a month you notice that Neighhood B has the most crime per citizen, second is D, and that despite there being about 20% of the population, 50% of the people who were found to be committing a crime were Blue people.  The police are going to send 50% of their officers to the areas with 50% of the crime! And guess what, they'll catch more people doing crime because now there's more police on patrol. It's a feedback loop.  So that's the first problem: a lot of blue people are ending up in jail.  Second thing the police notice: most of the Blue crime is caused by teenagers or young adults, and is often gang related. Well now the police are going to specifically target Blue teenagers to make sure that they're following the law, as well as attempting to stop gangs from recruiting them.  Now police are just reacting to the surface level problem. You can go ahead and blame them all you like for the reason why black people are in prison but they aren't going to let a crime happen when and where they know it is happening.  ------  The causes have multiple layers, here's just one example of how it can go: missing father figure ---> broken home ---> poor education/dropping out of school ---> recruited by gang ---> sex giving you a kid ---> arrest ---> no one will hire you because you have no education and a criminal record ---> forced to join gang again, or continue in gang ---> arrest, but this time longer sentence ---> continue in gang ---> arrest but even longer sentence ---> and so on  And if you manage to get a job after getting out of prison, now you are paying child support so good luck with paying for some other man to have sex with your ex-wife and live in your house with your kid.  Ever wonder why black rap music was always about being a gangster making fat stacks, getting that booty, and literally killing your rivals? There's a culture problem regarding gangs and gangster life.  The lack of healthcare certainly doesn't help. The lack of school funds seriously doesn't help. But I mean, what is the government going to do? They give the school money, and the kids are dropping out. Why would you spend more money on people who are dropping out?  Additionally, those kid's families will be in bad shape financially, meaning they'll need some sort of part-time dead-end job which lowers their grades and their chances of getting a scholarship meaning they need to take out a loan and if their parents need to cosign then they are SOL.  All this is from the top of my head and I've got other stuff to do tonight so you can reply if you want, or not, your choice.	1584938967.0	fl92juy	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl91eu2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl92juy/

That is literally and unironically problematic seeing as solutions can only be found once you admit that you actually have a problem.   I mean just look at it on this site: Mentioning a statistically proven fact anywhere makes you and all your opinions racist and not worth discussing. How are you supposed to work on a country-wide permanent solution like that?  How can we find out if it's genetics, black culture, institutional racism, poverty, slavery, aliens, freemasons or jews who's causing this and put an end to it if were not allowed to establish (an already established) fact first?	1584963913.0	fl9o31g	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7hpw3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl9o31g/

h8wqw	> Per capita, black people make up a larger portion of the poor.  You're saying two separate things here.  Black people per capita are more likely to be poor than white people.  That is very very different from saying they make up a larger portion of the poor.  If half of all black people were poor and 25% of white people were poor that still means you have more poor white people than black people, despite black people being twice as poor per-capita than white people in the example.  >That’s literally not how math works.  That is how math works.  Group A having a higher rate of X does not mean that group A is the majority of X.  Group B could have a lower rate but a higher population, thus being the majority of X.  >Except that you’re ignoring the whole point being made.   The point here was that being poor is the cause of increased violent crime rate in blacks in the US.  The point is incorrect because if simply being poor was the cause blacks wouldn't actually be over represented in violent crime.  The logic that poor = crime is an oversimplification of the issue because if it were true that poor = crime 13/52 wouldn't be true.  The point was made on a faulty presumption.	1584902738.0	fl7j0sv	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7hxjd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7j0sv/

5pycv	Wow there’s a lot to unwrap here, first let’s start with one of the worst analogies ever used by anyone:  In this little world of red and blue people you’ve made, there’s conveniently no history between the red or blue people. In real life, history actually exists. There was no “oh the police noticed some extra crime happening here”, the police in this world started with 50% of their forces in the blue district. Hell half the police force were of the belief that the blue people committed a crime anyway, and that even if they didn’t arrest them for one they actually committed they had probably committed some other one anyway so it was fine. Movies are made that depict the blue people as rapists and thieves and poor. Why does no one ever talk about the fact that District D’s police department is entirely red people, who just so happen to dislike blue people? See how easy it is to make strawmen? This entire analogy is based on the idea that, for some mysterious, cosmic reason; the blue men commit more crime. In real life we have science and medicine and know that if there was any part of the brain effected by race we would have found out by now.  Now most crime is committed by youths but that is consistent across all races because (big fucking surprise everyone) kids are dumb as hell. When I was 16 I was breaking into abandoned buildings to smoke weed and drink, and I grew up in a pretty nice neighborhood so I can only imagine what actually goes through the heads of kids who grow up in violent areas of the country.  truthfully I don’t know damn near anything about gang formation or culture so I can’t speak much about it, but you’re also absolutely fucking kidding yourself if you think that culture is limited to race. There are black, Latino, Asian, and white gangs; fuck there’s probably some transgender Romanian gangs. Also you’ve given yourself away with that rap statement buddy. Something tells me you have a very preconstructed idea of rap music because if you put literally any effort in you could find plenty of rap that isn’t gangster rap. Might I suggest chance the rapper, childish Gambino/Donald Glover, A tribe called quest, Kanye west, Tyler the creator. For fucks sake buddy most new age rap is more about drinking lean and feeling sad than it is about gang shit. Even a lot of the og rappers are softer these days. I haven’t heard a serious gangster rap in years, and gangster rap was popular in the 80-90s because it was a rebellious phase caused by the fact that cops in the 90s were inarguably racist as fuck and would plant crack on black man without even thinking about it. Gangs started partially as a way to maintain strength against a corrupt police force, since a bung of kids together with guns could reasonably take a cop.   I also love how close you get with the whole “schools aren’t funded thing”. Maybe kids are dropping out because the school fucking sucks and their community doesn’t encourage higher education? Maybe with some actual money the school could hire teachers that give at least a single fuck about the kids they teach? Or maybe they could buy materials to teach with? Or do you think that black people just aren’t good at school and are more likely to drop out?  Why spend money on people dropping out? Well that’s fucking obvious pal, they’re the ones who need it. Why give money to people who are doing perfectly fucking fine without it? That’s like saying it’s better to give $10 to a billionaire because homeless people wouldn’t be able to buy a house with it.  You got the financial situation right; kids in inner city areas start off with a fucking foot tied because ever since black people were allowed to be citizens they have been forced into poverty. You say it’s a cycle, well it had to fucking start somewhere buddy, America hasn’t just been in its current state since the beginning of time. When you put a specific race of people into a situation where they have to work twice as hard as others to gain a foothold, how does it become their fault when barely 3 generations later many are still trapped there? Where do you think you’d be if you grew up in the kind of environment presented by lets say south side Chicago? I assure you, you would be very different (unless you grew up in south side then you would be very much the same) if a lot of your life involved gunfights on your street. So once again, explain to me how this is caused by the race, not by the fact that the race was targeted specifically by others.  All this is from the top of my head too pal. Luckily I’m literally currently in a criminology course for a arts/humanities requirement so I am literally taking tests on the statistics side of crime at least. The bottom line is that racism is pretty clearly defined, so let me help you decide if you’re being racist:  If you think that certain people are predisposed to committing crime because of their skin color-> you are being racist  If you think that certain people are more likely to drop out of school because of their skin color-> you are being racist  If you think that there is any correlation at all between skin color and cognitive ability-> you are being racist  The day the science community comes out in agreement with a revolutionary “wow yeah so we actually compared the brains and they’re different” I will begin to think otherwise, until then I’m going with the well established fact that there is no significant difference besides skin pigmentation. Talk all you fucking want about “problems in black communities”, all it does is show that you don’t have the capacity for independent thought required to actually consider what you’re talking about.	1584947231.0	fl9an8a	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl92juy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl9an8a/

hv02y	Not unless you’re inciting violence. Deplatforming has become a political tool used to control free speech. People are being banned for having different ideas.   The other problem is that it’s radicalizing people to the right. Look at Count Dank,  he used to just be an edgy humor guy and his beliefs were honestly pretty liberal. Until he taught a pug to Nazi salute, a bad joke for sure however I fail to see how it’s actually harmful. He was then fined for violating “indecency” laws and turned into a pariah by the left which caused him, understandably, to run the the right. And he wasn’t even deplatformed or American and is now considered an alt-right gateway	1584904434.0	fl7luvt	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7kyqs	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7luvt/

You usually see self proclamied "lib" lefts cheering for the former regulation while so called "lib" rights are happy at the passage of the latter regulation.

1ysvm5i6	Wow you have some problems.  Think about this logically, okay?   1) Fact: skin colour has no effect on IQ  2) Fact: people with dark skin pigmentation have lower IQ  I say, there is a correlation and you say "That's racist"  No it's not you retard. Correlation =/= causation. When someone says there is a correlation it does not mean that skin colour causes lower IQ. I hope to God that you're white just to help me prove this point.  3) If the above two points are true (and they are) then it is the actions, beliefs, or culture that is causing the difference.  Now I hear you cry wolf about the school funding. Newsflash, if kids are dropping out due to school funding, then you would see ALL kids, regardless of race, increasing their dropout rates at the same pace.  But that's not reality. Somehow, for some reason, Asians are fine, white people are fine. Why are black people dropping out of highschool and getting such low marks?  Their life at home is the answer. Here's a few good ways of making sure your kid has good grades:  +[Be married and have a stable job even if it sucks](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-stable-home-equals-a-successful-child_b_9688750)  +[Be involved with your kid](https://www.ptotoday.com/pto-today-articles/article/399-involvement-matters-what-to-tell-parents). Ask about school, be checking the homework, etc.  +Go to [church](https://www.livescience.com/5051-church-attendance-boosts-student-gpas.html)  You can read more on what can negatively effect children's education [here](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/negative-effects-instability-child-development-research-synthesis)  ---------  Look, it's not like this is some mystery that hasn't been discovered yet. It's just hard for people to talk about it when there's a risk of losing your job for being "racist", so nothing gets done about it.	1584948644.0	fl9bt5f	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl9an8a	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl9bt5f/

47owti7v	The Selfish Gene where Richard Dawkins coined the term is a very good read. But yeah, speech policies are unsavory and controversial for that exact reason. I don't personally see a problem with policing speech if the rehabilitation efforts(though unfortunately the 'justice' system likes punishment instead) fit the crime relatively, as it does do damage to society as a whole. The plastic bottle comparison works here again; if a policeman sees you littering, he isn't going to beat you up for doing it, but you're probably going to get scolded and if you seem unapologetic, you might get fined.	1584905583.0	fl7ns25	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7moki	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7ns25/
N/A	It requires a more personal policing. This isn’t something you can legislate without authoritarian repercussions, you have to shame the fuck out of these people. Run then out of town for being racist fucks, dump shit  all over their yard if they’re against gay marriage etc.   You can’t arrest someone for thinking or saying something unless it’s, like he said, a direct call to violence. Modern day racists have learned to dog whistle really effectively so the onus is now on us as a people to call these degenerates out.	1584909217.0	fl7tsf8	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7moki	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7tsf8/

5pycv	“You have some problems” says the fucking guy who somehow thinks in the year 2020 that “people with dark skin pigmentation have a lower IQ”. Like right there you are not only wrong but so inexcusably racist that it’s sad. I’m serious, it is actually sad. How have you not had enough education throughout your life to realize how stupid that thinking is. I’m done talking with you, not just because you have now made it obvious that you don’t care jack shit for facts or logical thinking. This is fucking science you retarded piece of shit. And you are a piece of shit, that much is clear now. “White people and Asian people aren’t dropping out of school” Jesus Fucking Christ buddy read a history book. Plenty of white trash morons drop out of school constantly. You actually have to be fucking intentionally fucking stupid to not even think about that.   No, the biggest reason I’m done with you is because you have shown in that last comment that you are actually racist. You are literally trying to argue that their race is somehow involved in their culture. Fun fact doctor dumbass: there are black people in other countries. So if black people in other countries have different cultures than black people in our country doesn’t it follow, using literally a fucking half gram of logic, that maybe the culture is related more to the experience the people face in their environment? But no, somehow your warped, fucked up brain decides that this is somehow due to them being black. You are actually fucking disgusting.  It’s not like the science community back in the day was specifically looking to undo slavery, part of the reason racism has become less common in recent years is because advancements in science have helped prove that that kind of thinking is completely uneducated and unfounded. You’re literally just wrong, that kind of major difference in brain function would be distinguishable in our studies of the human brain. You’re the racial equivalent to flat earthers, arguing against years of actual scientific research with “BuT I SeE ThE BlaCk PEoPlE geT ArEstEd All tHE tImE”. This isn’t an opinion, this isn’t something that is debatable. Black peoples do not have differences in brain function, that’s science. You can argue all you want but you might as well argue against gravity, so before you even consider typing a response I’d recommend considering going to fuck yourself first.  +go to church  Lol so I can help my kids what?

Idc about edgy jokes or racial humor, it is what it is and I don’t support silencing people. But they use these tactics to take over subs and push out the non believers.

N/A	I think it's more that gaslighting or elements of it are now the focus of lies in the political sphere. Specifically the focus on creating cognitive dissonance, questioning their own memory of events, or purely trying to create a feeling of lowered confidence and esteem to lower voter turnout. This is mainly possible due to the huge amount of data gathered these days on each and every individual, allowing lies to become more personalised. Bannon's comments on radicalising young men comes to mind.

6z4ickq	Yea... still not really what gaslighting meant originally.  It was specifically about someone using the trust of an intimate relationship to make someone think they are crazy, question their perception of reality, and be easily manipulated, but I can accept that words change in meaning over time.  I am curious though to know what you're referring to in the previous post with the "gaslighting by religious figures" because I struggle to see how it could be applicable.  If a priest tells everyone to give him 10% of their income because they'll burn in hell if they don't, or that gays are the root of all evil, or some other stupid shit, that's not gaslighting.	1584903732.0	fl7koy2	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7kh69	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7koy2/

1ysvm5i6	Jesus defines marriage as only being between a man and woman  >**4** “Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19:4-6&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23767a)\] **5** and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19:4-6&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23768b)\]? **6** So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”  This is important because sex outside of marriage is adultery. Jesus said this:  >**17** “Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”   >   >**18** “Which ones?” he inquired.   >   >Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, **19** honor your father and mother,’\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19:17-19&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23782a)\] and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19:17-19&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23782b)\]”  Homosexuals go to hell confirmed  To make it more clear, Paul wrote this in 1st Corinthians  > **8** Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers and sisters. **9** Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+6:8-10&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28477a)\] **10** nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.	1584910022.0	fl7v3l0	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7thlm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7v3l0/

1ysvm5i6	Well in Christianity, we believe that homosexuals **who practice homosexuality** go to hell.  The reason why they killed homosexuals in the past: Can you imagine how quickly diseases spread when people stick their penis in every hole they find? Like even eating the wrong animals can cause international epidemics.  There's a reason why they killed people who had sex with animals (bestiality), or who just had sex with anyone they could (adulterers). They would spread diseases and get sick. Well you don't want to get sick and die, you don't want your family to get sick and die. The only option was to kill them or risk everyone else dying.	1584910778.0	fl7wcf1	t3_fn0osr	t1_fl7vrlm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fn0osr/gamer_word/fl7wcf1/

2snnv2ow	I’m a republican and I think that gay marriage and weed should be legal. I could care less for who marries who and who wants to accelerate their death but the government has no right to regulate it, that’s unconstitutional. Also the govt. could make so much money off of taxing weed. And it would allow for so many knew jobs and investments as well as less people in prison. I’m straight and don’t smoke weed myself, but from an economic standpoint it would be stupid to not have these things be legal.	1589138571.0	fq6w1h7	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq6w1h7/

Even a capitalist libertarian has to agree, expensive authoritarian departments should get cut before the relatively inexpensive welfare programs the USA runs right now. Seriously those programs are basically centrist because of how little funding they actually get, whereas the NSA and abortion banning are extremely authoritarian.	1589170296.0	fq8napl	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8napl/

qnoko4v	This is a strawman and a misinterpretation of "small government".  Republicans are for small government in terms of limiting federal force used over our own citizenry. It doesn't mean Republicans are for the NSA spying on citizens. In fact, most Republicans are very critical federal power.  A strong military doesn't necessarily mean "big government".  The reality is you need a strong military for your countries defense. Also things like interventionism is something almost every world power is engaged in. Its not a Republican invention and many Democrats have supported interventionism as well. This is just general US foreign policy.  "Support torture" is also a ridiculous characterization. Republicans support gaining intel that protect the homeland.  Abortion isn't a small government issue. It's a philosophical life issue. The left tends to be pro-population control because they are central planners and think abortion is a means to equality not freedom. Not to mention the billions that go into government paid abortions.  I haven't seen many Republicans running on banning gay marriage or keeping weed illegal. I think younger Republicans have different positions on both of these issues.  That being said, sure there are many AuthRight, LibRight, and Centrist Republicans as there are AuthLeft Democrats and LibLeft and Centrist Democrats.  Why aren't Democrats held to such purity tests as much as Republicans are?	1589161361.0	fq89pdi	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq89pdi/

N/A	Banning gay marriage is Authoritarian I agree, but Trump hasn't tried to do that and I don't think he's ever even mentioned trying to outlaw it. Abortion isn't an Auth/Lib thing, it's about when a life starts, because if it's a life it's a life and killing it violates the NAP. Only if it isn't a life (so if you're pro-choice) is it Authoritarian.  Most Trump supporters don't support NSA spying at all. They hate China for spying on citizens and such. Republicans believe in less interventionism than others, making them more Lib.  Mainstream Republicans have a couple Auth ideas I don't like (bailouts, illegal drugs, etc.) but they're far more Lib than Democrats and if you like small government you **are** Libertarian.  &#x200B;  All in all, I'd say the American Republican party ranges from just above center right Rhinos to the bottom right corner (Rand Paul). The Democratic party ranges from center left (some Democrats in swing/red states) to the top left corner (AOC).	1589153303.0	fq7vx99	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7vx99/

Even congratulated Elton John on his civil union in 2005 to which in writing donald trump said "It's a marriage that's going to work ... If two people dig each other, they dig each other." While he said marriage was for a man and a woman in the year 2000 he also supported civil unions at the same time.

I just don't think the government should run around slapping price controls on things and nationalizing industries, or telling people what they can and can't do in their own homes. They should stick to the things they are needed for like redistribution, health, safety and the environment.	1589146234.0	fq7gwdf	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7gwdf/

Also, republicans see abortion as an issue concerning the preservation of a baby’s right to life, so from their perspective, it’s not hypocrisy, since it’s about protecting someone’s rights.

N/A	Personally, I don’t understand how abortion has become a matter of freedom.  I think that your personal freedom should stop when your actions impede on the constitutional rights of others.  I mean really, I don’t just get it.  Typically, your own choices put you in the position of abortion being an option.  You had the freedom to choose whether or not to conceive a child, but just because you made something doesn’t mean you should have the right to kill it.  Shouldn’t all people have the freedom to do whatever they want as long as their choices do not steal another person’s right to life, liberty, or property.  And I would say any human being qualifies whether they understand yet or not.  So with that said, I’m in favor of anything being legal that doesn’t impede on other people’s freedoms, weed and gay marriage included.	1589150715.0	fq7rhey	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7rhey/

N/A	What would this be?  \- virtually non-existent laws and a small, Christian government  \- biblical teachings are from God and as such untouchable by man - accuracy and purity regarding the bible is constantly maintained , cross referenced and researched - no pseudo-Christianity allowed, constantly fights against external corruption (sorry modern day Catholics)   \- freedom of speech and of self defence  \- people are naturally kind and crime is extremely rare due to vehement dedication to Christian doctrines, thus freedoms are permitted and any perceived degeneracy would be dealt with by the parents, priest and greater community to teach and, if it persists, shame or perhaps exile, but perhaps only temporarily.  \- no central banking system  \- bartering economic system, no money. People are taught to be self reliant on top of this so instead hunt, grow and forage  \- people are never homeless and rarely go hungry due to charitable nature encouraged by Christianity  \- no NSA or any form of spying agency - outlawed and condemned  \- military has it's own, independent economic system, uses money (still no central banking system - all money is tied to gold) to keep up with other industrial nations that could pose a threat  \- military respect their foes and ultimately answers to Christian government and people. Soldiers have deep love and passion for their people, would never betray them  \- kids are taught about the importance of fitness from a young age, have appropriate role models. obesity and greed is virtually non-existent (in part due to Christian beliefs condemning greed and gluttony)  \- history is treated as one of the most important subjects taught - real history is taught here, including the fall and rise of civilisations and recurring patterns, behaviours and ideologies  Sounds like paradise to me but wondering if it has a name or something to describe it. Obviously I don't go into fundamental detail here but just want a rough idea, even if partly inaccurate.	1589167148.0	fq8irf9	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8irf9/

gf9is	It always gets a chuckle from me that people think in such a binary way that abortions *as a whole* are either legal or not. I was under the impression that humans had the mental capacity to realize such general laws are not the norm. Theres a reason bills are often hundreds of pages in length before the time for voting them into law arrives.  But somehow that topic always devolves into "well, what about rape" and other corner cases when its glaringly obvious that the vast majority of abortions are not from those causes. Its far more prevalent that some slut wasn't using protection despite knowing well in advance they didn't want a child. Promiscuity and lack of foresight don't mix well.	1590445995.0	frt9t6g	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/frt9t6g/

7a1bj	I always find that GOP argument funny. They want small government, and taught letting the people govern themselves. Yet they feverishly try to pass laws to tell us what to do with our bodies.  I live in Alabama and I sent an email to my congressman over his response to covid and how we should shut down for a little while or risk doing more damage to the state economy in body count, he responded within 3 days. He responded saying he doesn't want a nanny state and they should only have to give us guidance and not force us to do anything. So I responded back and asked him if that is so, why he tries to pass laws controlling what people can do with their bodies, the most private thing a person has. It's been almost 2 months and he hasn't responded. I had some friends of mine also send him emails asking the same thing, they have also had no responses.  Hypocrisy thy name is GOP.	1590928401.0	fsf0x43	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fsf0x43/

It isn’t a very fair thing to group all republicans into this specific group, just because you are republican doesn’t mean you have to support banning weed and gay marriage. That’s the main issue with politics these days . No ones allowed to have there own opinions . Everyone’s constantly grouped into one side or the other even though they may have many different agreements with different portions of each parties agenda. It’s not healthy for a society to force people into this bout between two different political parties . Surely we will learn our lesson at some point in the future , because this amount of negativity and fighting will surely bring no good in the long run.	1589157298.0	fq82qdz	t3_gh4aq4	t3_gh4aq4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq82qdz/

The problem with the left is that they literally say they have no culture, so reason, rationalizing, dwcency, respect, all these things they don't give a fuck about. So they either scare away any normal guy with their screetching, they ban you from their safe-spaces and your world-view never gets challenged, or they identify with their politics, due to the fact that they claim to not believe in race, culture, family, etc. So this whole identity disorder that the left has isn't really shocking.

1p01flui	Ya, but with the regionalised nature of the legislative system, it would be largely impossible to establish a system like, for example, the British or Israeli parliments, which encourage division into many more parties.   I suppose larger states could attempt a system for their state legislatures, or even their delegation to the House of Representatives, but for the Senate, you will always have only  1 senator being elected in a cycle. Same with POTUS. Really, any office where you're not electing a delegation is gonna be next to impossible to move away from the two party leviathans. Particularly considering that it's a state level power to assign delegates to the electoral college.	1589139999.0	fq6zy0c	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6asx8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq6zy0c/

13karf	I might be wrong, but the attitude from socialists and progressives that I’ve known towards the Democratic Party is mostly “well... fuck the other option is actively catering to facists so I guess this is the best we got”.  In other words, I think auth right and lib right  people buy in to the idea that they’re going to have their ideas more directly represented by the republicans than socialists and progressives beleive the same for the Democrats.  And I want to put stress on the fact that this is a matter of degrees rather than a binary “right are gullible fuck nuts while left are enlightened to see the truth” I think the right is callous or spurned into hating their boogeymen more often then stupid, and the left has its fair share of folks who treat politicians like their favourite vlogger to be personally admired, but I think that the attitudes of the coopted as you put it are different, although the coopters are less so.	1589166016.0	fq8h1oz	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6dc5a	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8h1oz/

4cd8f	I definitely have lived in areas where what you describe is typical. I've also been to areas where that "strawman" is 100% accurate.  Can't flair rn as I'm on mobile but I'm LibLeft  ETA: honestly I think a lot of the problem is that what most of the voting population thinks their politicians stand for isn't what they actually stand for. Most Republicans in my parent's circle are pretty moderate in a "live and let live" way regarding social issues. They are just worried about being personally forced to condone things that they don't, but don't actually hate people for being gay or non-white. They don't understand that those Republicans do exist, just not in their bubble in California. Likewise the Republicans in the Midwest don't have much experience with Democrats other than what they hear on Fox news plus rowdy college kids that are lazy and want to live doing nothing. So, it's much easier to buy into the lie that "Democrats hate actual working people". When you bust your ass to barely make a living and some rich d-bag from the University starts telling you to give up more of your paycheck in taxes it sounds like a scam to them.

That’s just wrong, you don’t see strait people doing that regularly and no adult should ever think it’s okay to do that where kids can see.   That’s what most people see the problem as. Sure, there are going to be people that get offended if they see two men holding hands but most people I think are already past that.	1589145817.0	fq7fs2g	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6lcvl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7fs2g/

t03fy	> 55% saying it depends on the circumstances  > Only 32% want it banned under all circumstances  I take issue with these stats. Many hardcore anti abortion folks would support an abortion when the mother's life was at risk, but under no other circumstances. This still agrees with their moral worldview that life begins at conception.  This statistic clumsily shoehorns many conservatives into the "68% who don't believe abortion should be banned". It misrepresents the views of millions of people.	1589173702.0	fq8rrsk	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6nlj3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8rrsk/

Democrats support the NSA and Republicans generally do not. Also Republicans nominated a guy who wanted to get us out of useless conflicts and wars.

ixwui	To many marriage is a promise to stay committed to each other and is often made infront of a deity. There fore religious communities and organisations should be allowed to choose what forms of marriage they recognize.  But it is also a legal contract that (depending on where you live) effects inheritance, custody, ownership, adoption, social security and next of kin status. There fore the state should recognize all forms of marriage (gay, straight, poly) unless marriage is ignored completely in all government policy.	1589154003.0	fq7x4h6	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq76m42	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7x4h6/

3uolztic	Except a ban on abortion doesn’t stop abortion. That’s what is so frustrating for those pro-choice. Protecting women’s reproductive rights is a full package that includes the choice of an abortion. By providing comprehensive education to teens, that will stay with them into adulthood, as well as access to birth control is how abortion is reduced. By focusing on preventing the unborn, protecting them is no longer needed. Being pro-choice does not mean being pro-abortion. It means reproductive rights.   If you are as concerned as you say, your fight wouldn’t be for or against any law, it would be about prevention. It’s against the law to commit murder, still happens everyday. It’s against the law to abuse a child, happens every day. Laws don’t prevent anything, they deter. That’s why it’s hard to believe someone who SAYS they consider abortion murder, but only fight for a law, as if it is the answer. Instead, someone like me sees someone like you as person who wants to control my health and reproductive rights.   Just imagine if both sides joined forces. Both sides would get what they wanted. Full rights to one’s own body and a reduction in abortion below what would be if it was banned. That is a win/win and a fight worth fighting.    Also, human rights need to extend beyond the unborn, birth, country of origin, race and orientation.	1589157456.0	fq8304j	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq804ys	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8304j/

N/A	Porn isn't really legal.  You can't have an under 18 showing of deep throat at your local cineplex.  It's not even the same as a rated R movie, which you can show to kids, you'll just get bitch slapped by the MPAA, a private organization.  You'd face no legal repercussions though. Porn is severely restricted and showing it to minors, or allowing minors to access it, is illegal.  From a libertarian perspective, a product that is restricted and a product that is illegal are the same thing.  Heroin is the same as codeine from a chemical perspective.  Ketamine and xanax are essentially the same thing.  In that sense, neither drug is legal, they're just allowed in certain contexts.  I doubt even you think porn should be "legal." No sane person does.	1589174200.0	fq8sep6	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xn8u	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8sep6/

p81z7	It's because of our "first-past-the-post" electoral system. It means a vote for a third party is effectively a wasted vote.

20y86esq	https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo  First past the post voting systems always devolve into two party systems.  Mathematically a majority is %51. Unfortunately this means a tight race between 3 candidates results in minority rule because now a candidate only theoretically needs %34 to win.  Meaning instead of %49 of people being dissatisfied with the outcome in a two party race, we end up with %66 dissatisfied with the outcome in a 3 party race.  Mathematically our Republic is flawed in that more choices on the ballot means less accurate overall representation.	1589141098.0	fq72x8z	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fhla	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq72x8z/
13ylep	Because there isn’t a progressive party.

N/A	Because you need EVERYONE to switch or you're wasting your vote. It's really not complicated. We are slowly getting ranked choice, that'll give us third party options organically.  Edit putting my below rant here, cause y'all really don't get it  No, first past the post keeps the two party system.  God this sub is ignorant.  We ALL went through the period of not liking the two parties. Guess what? It's really two parties. Google duvergers law.   We've had three president's from a third party. It DOES happen. But then the new party knocks off one of the old parties. That's literally why the Democrats and Republicans today are the opposite of during Lincoln's time. Because it's just a name, the parties have changed multiple times.  But always two.  So you're wasting your vote UNLESS you get enough people to ALSO vote that way. Which CAN HAPPEN. But just because YOU felt good casting a vote for Gary Johnson, you still wasted that vote, unless you literally had zero preference between Trump and Hillary.	1589138057.0	fq6umn6	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fhla	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq6umn6/
mytn5	It's a shitty system but it's the one you have and shooting yourselves in the foot won't help you change it. If a bunch of right wingers are just dandy with it and a bunch of left wingers rebel, cross their arms and refuse to vote against the republican (which is, in essence, what voting blue is in a two party system) then the republican always wins and there is absolutely no incentive for the party in power to amend that system in a way that would hurt them.   I'm all for direct action, but as far as voting gives you power to enact change it's against your own self interest to vote 3rd party in the US unless you care about nothing other than destroying the system in some way, no matter how catastrophic.	1589143588.0	fq79pfc	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fhla	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq79pfc/

N/A	See, what people don’t seem to realize is their individual vote is not going to change the outcome of a national election.

Hell, in the US Senate and House of Representatives, even if their single vote did change the outcome of the election, they would have changed one single vote of a chamber that homogeneously votes like 98% of the time.	1589142517.0	fq76rzk	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fhla	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq76rzk/

3mss79hg	There is so much going against third parties in America that even if they got 20% of national public support and votes, they would not be competitive for the presidency, and would maybe pick up a few dozen seats in the House and 1-2 in the Senate. We need proportional representation.

ftpsl	I don't think I've met anyone who actually would prefer the two party system over a multi party system if it came down to it, but pragmatically the whole "get mad at people voting for a 3rd party" makes sense. The parties are polarized enough so that the "lesser of the two evils" argument makes sense.  There isn't that much wrong in saying "the system is bad but we should work within it to ensure the best outcome" and when you think the other party is literally trying to implement communism or fascism or whatever it was them the lesser of two evils is basically looking like an angel compared to the enemy	1589145386.0	fq7emci	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fhla	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7emci/

4je6r	The two  part system is stupid, but throwing your vote away to a third party candidate is more stupid. The two party system is the natural conclusion of the American election process, the only way to change that is to change the process. The best case scenario for any third party is eventually they supplant one of the two, becoming a new two party system. Given enough time the two parties will adjust to pander to voters left behind from the dead party and you'll be right back at the beginning.	1589156427.0	fq81880	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fhla	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq81880/

All it does is increase the likelyhood of a fascist evangelical party which will make it institutionally harder to ever change the system.   At least if we vote Biden, the next Bernie might actually have a chance.

Prevention of murder is one of the core responsibility of the government.  Edit: forgot about gay marriage. Libertarians don't oppose gay marriage either.

6ch4e	Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.	1589149971.0	fq7q6k7	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6lpi6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7q6k7/

de16s	That’s not true if you actually look into the numbers.  According to Pew...   “Three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (75%) and fewer than half of Republicans and Republican leaners (44%) favor same-sex marriage”  “Support for same-sex marriage now stands at 88% among self-described liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners and 64% among conservative and moderate Democrats. Fewer conservative Republicans and Republican leaners (36%) support same-sex marriage than moderate and liberal Republicans (59%).”  Only 44% of republican leaning individuals were in favor. Not sure how that translates to “a majority”.  Republicans are still laughably and pathetically low on same sex marriage approval. I’m always curious why more socially forward conservatives on Reddit try to deny this fact.   https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/	1589140157.0	fq70dlx	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6nvz9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq70dlx/

If the mother or child is in danger of death or serious harm then it can be considered or allowed in my opinion.

rfvf0s8	Trump’s “social left” isn’t the same as the Democrats’ “social left” though.  Trump supports gay marriage but he also proposed banning Muslims from the US.  EDIT: I knew I should have included an inb4 for “haha but literally every muslim anti-gay brr brr.” Tolerant and gay muslims exist, and the ban would have applied to them too. Banning an entire religious group is highly illiberal, and I wouldn’t support such a measure in the US or Iran. I’m referring to the proposal Trump made during the campaign, not the “travel ban” he tried in office, which was obviously a watered-down attempt at a similar goal. His exact quote was:  > “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”  Here’s a video of it from Sky News: https://youtu.be/hLgTF8FrYlU	1589153272.0	fq7vvdg	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq72vjq	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7vvdg/

knarp	I see it as you have the right to choose if you want to risk having sex, but abortion is immoral unless we can find a hard line when consciousness/life begins.

hpnhf	Well there's a slightly better analogy (I guess its subjective), but sex isn't inviting pregnancy but its a risk you have to consider. A good one is leaving your window open at night for a cool breeze (aka sex) and a burglar takes advantage of that. Now the question falls on if you have to take responsibility for leaving the window open or not.	1589144519.0	fq7c8y7	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6x9rj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7c8y7/
as348	That would be wrong if the fetus is a person, yes. But it's clearly not at conception since there's no brain!  And no you can't use the "it has the potential to become a person" argument. You could draw the line at the fathers sperm, or his pickup line to the mother.   It's still an arbitrary line. But unless you're gonna say that a soul exists (which there is 0 reason for beliving) then a brainless entity cannot be conscious	1589161628.0	fq8a59i	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6x9rj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8a59i/

For Pro-choice libertarians it is indeed this way, but Pro-Life libertarians believe the choice was already made when the pair consented to having sex with each other, and pregnancy is a consequence of that decision. In their opinion if you invited a mate onto your boat, you have a responsibility to drive them back, you cannot throw them overboard as your plans change.   For this same reason, many of them actually do support abortion in cases like rape since the choice was never offered.	1589195558.0	fq9efj9	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8m8qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9efj9/

13f65y	Agreed it is also very difficult to assess the government's effectiveness in any particular domain. For many things (healthcare for example) there are governments doing a good job and those doing a terrible job and a lot of in-between. The simplification that the government is always good or always inefficient is infuriating because specifics matter tremendously. Instead of arguing with ideologies, we should implement ways to prototype and adapt public policy in order to find out what actually works and what doesn't. There should be no shame in admitting that a policy did not have the intended effects and that it is amended or private/market initiatives can take this role instead.	1589141318.0	fq73ie9	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6yh5a	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq73ie9/

ecyfy	Most of things you are talking about are not specifics to republicans., those that appl to both parties I'll list below.  >Their conviction that it is not worth sacrificing personal freedoms for security  >Their refusal to ever help dictators  .  >Measures against employment discrimination  Those near universally violate employer's rights. No human has the right to be employed, but all humans have the right to free association. Weather or not such discrimination is irrational and immoral is not relevant to weather the state should regulate it. You mark yourself lib center, so you should understand that right to association is more fundamental than weather or not you get hired.   > letting gay and trans people serve in the military.  More trans drone pilots.  >Their well-known opposition to capital punishment  Again, that is not a simple situation, as abortion is not. After all, if I were trying to stab you, in that moment I have certainly forefitted my right to be alive, so it's not like it's impossible to do so, the question is only if that can be applied beyond immediate circumstance and to what degree.  >Their commitment to clean air and water  The us has fairly clean air and clean water, and unless a lib center individual wants to proposition a blanket ban on automobiles (which is basically the only solution to the air problem in cities, as that where the vast majority of air pollution comes from there).  >Their pledge to accept refugees and treat them humanely.  We do accept refugees. of course, if they illegally cross the boarder, we do indeed treat them like criminals, as they have committed a criminal act. If a refugee goes to an access point, you can apply to be a refugee there, at which point we will go through the process of determining weather the claim is legitimate, as we do for the thousands of refugees that enter the US. The only hypocrisy is i you decide to disingenuously propose that illegal aliens are all refugees, which is simply false, particularly when you remember that the commitment the US made was only to protect those who were fleeing persecution from their home state only, which does not include those fleeing from civil wars (unless one or more parties of the war are targeting the individual in question) or those fleeing from poor economic conditions.  in fact, when you remember that, the US has historically been far more generous than it has needed to be by law or by commitment, including most refugees from the middle east crisis, who by in large were not political asylum seekers, but people displaced by war who the US made no agreement to protect.	1589151369.0	fq7sm92	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq72su2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7sm92/

I was saying for all the other things.  >Obviously there are exceptions, but from my understanding this is a very common libright belief (correct me if I’m wrong).  You are wrong, it's highly contentious on the lib right. Basically, as I just said, the question isn't about government size, it's weather the unborn have human rights. If yes, the government's job is to preserve human rights. If no, it's not their job to regulate it.	1589163462.0	fq8d2me	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq88gag	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8d2me/

phwp5	In Australia we have preferential run off voting for the lower house (government) and single transferable vote for the upper house (senate).   Works pretty well since lower house votes are based on your local electorate, where you might have as low as 3 candidates. The upper house is multi candidate at the state level, the ballot sheet for that is crazy long. I admit the upper house voting can get messy but you can either vote 'above or below' the line which gives you the option of a simplified vote if required.	1589147928.0	fq7ld7b	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6x0g8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7ld7b/

tefgk	Dont ever vote for someone else than your first choice because it would be 'wasting your vote'. The moment you vote for one of the 2 parties instead of your preferred candidate, is the moment your vote becomes wasted.

5ift9rgh	Well everybody "hates" their one of two choices, says their vote doesn't matter, and claims it doesn't matter who wins because everythings run from behind a curtain. But when it comes time to vote they'll still uselessly vote for the figurehead they "hate" because in all honesty 90% of conservatives in America want to see Republicans win and 90% of liberals want Democrats to win.

6vteuj	The US, and most other former british colonies, uses the system called First-past-the-post/Winner-take-all. This means that whoever wins in the election takes all the mandates. So if a US state has an election for its 100 mandates the part that gets the most votes will take all madates even though they merely won by a few percent, making all the other votes meaningless. Most other countries uses proportional representation where the mandates would sorted out based on what percentages the different parties got. So if one party got twenty percent of the votes they would get 20 mandates. By using this system every vote matters and does a difference.  &#x200B;  An example of this could by my country Denmark. Today we have ten different parties, but if we used the winer takes all we would only have three. By using proportional representation you also avoid gerrymandaring.  &#x200B;  It is essentially this system which keeps the US a de facto two party state, and is also the reason why the popular vote doesn't elect the president.	1589141414.0	fq73ric	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6equc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq73ric/

8d7ec	On the contrary, I think the GOP have taken an even harder stand against abortion lately. The laws several states have recently enacted, never would have passed 20 years ago. Republicans used to give lip service to the pro-life movement, but didn't actual do much. Hell, pro-choice Republicans were fairly common in the not so distant past. They even nominated one for president in '96. Can you imagine that today? Now you'd be hard pressed to find any pro-choice Republicans in any position of power. Maybe a few blue state GOP governors, but even they tend to go back to pro-life when they don't need to win in a blue state (Mitt Romney was pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, but became pro-life once he hit the national stage). The rape/incest exception that used to be standard in the GOP, is becoming less popular. We're at point now, where overturning Roe v. Wade is becoming a very real possibility in the next decade, and that would have been unimaginable in the 90s.  On the flip side, not too long ago the Democratic leader in the Senate was pro-life (Harry Reid). No way he would become the most powerful Democrat in the Senate today, with his views on the matter. So I think both parties have really doubled down on this particular issue.  Now marijuana, I definitely see a shift. That seems to be more of a generational divide than a party divide though. I don't know a single person under 40 who supports prohibition, and I don't see Democrats like Joe Biden advocating for federal legalization. Aside from the generational divide, even some older Republicans have come around. Former Speaker of the House, John Boehner has become a very vocal advocate for the legal pot industry.	1589149078.0	fq7oavk	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7c5zv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7oavk/

N/A	Nope lol. If you really look at it gen z is pretty populist but as far as everything else goes it’s split between berniecrats and trump lovers. The only “centrist” people I know are asians, haha.   Pc culture isn’t exactly a left-right issue but Gen Z is much more sensitive to that type of stuff then the generations before it (except maybe millennials). If I had to guess I would say gen z will be about the same as millennials except even less centrists.  However they’re definitely going to be more left than Gen X and boomers because even the “far righters” hate homophobia and racism, and believe climate change is a huge issue. So things are definitely trending left in that way	1589175531.0	fq8u25s	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8blz9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8u25s/

2z3ucn05	Personally I consider myself Conservative and it really seems like Conservatives as a whole, at least in America are really changing their views. Not necessarily switching parties because honestly I'd say it's a growing cause, but a lot of people are becoming a lot more libertarian. Especially considering that large figures that are more right wing are libertarian as well. Like I believe Ben Shapiro self identifies as libertarian, and Crowder seems to have pretty libertarian views. There's a large movement of people that their views on things is just do whatever if it doesn't bother me. Personally my view in some things is similar. I may/may not disagree with things like gay marriage but truthfully what you do in your bedroom is none of my business. A lot of people may disagree with you but in reality they likely don't care as long as you don't bring it up/don't bother them.

Frankly, I don't want to get into the always-lengthy debate about fetal personhood, right now, but of course consenting to sex also entails consenting to the potential consequences of sex.

So a better analogy would be that you're ferrying some cargo from a junk yard, and didn't notice that one of the crates you picked up had a homeless man sleeping inside.  Even if you didn't "consent" to ferrying him, and even if you're a long way from shore, throwing him overboard in the middle of the ocean is still murder.	1591073482.0	fslrkun	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7b6qw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fslrkun/

p4bplir	So value defines a human? Is it than completely moral to kill an invaluable human?  (I know you are authright so would probably agree but the original argument was against an libright)  >How is just living immoral?  You are misrepresenting my argument. I clearly stated living in modern society is immoral. Living in Ethiopia probably won't be immoral ( idk I don't live there). But also you are using some kind of computing device to postthis comment, so you are living an immoral life. You directly aren't responsible but you do contribute. It's kind of like hiring a person to hire a hitman to kill someone.  >Autonomy isn’t important.  Original argument was against a libright. But also autonomy is very important. Many people have given up their lives just to have a little chance of being autonomous (not necessarily talking about people fighting in revolutions and stuff, but they are one example). You or anyone else can't have a completely logical reason to take away someone's autonomy. People are just able to do it because they have power.	1589143998.0	fq7attt	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq78yre	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7attt/

184zofe	Are you saying the baby owns the womean's body?  Up to what point? My body is my body. The baby's body is the baby's body. I guess the most ethical thing to do is to remove the fetus from the uterus and then put it in some sort of water to see if it can survive on it's own. It shouldn't be murdered, but it also doesn't have the right to stay inside someone against there will. I dont see what the baby being a good or bad person has anything to do with this.  The baby doesn't deserve to die, but the woman also don't deserve to risk my own health to save it. I don't see abortion as murder. I see it as refusing to donate your body to save another person.	1589202432.0	fq9mq04	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq9jghc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9mq04/

3uolztic	Crisis pregnancy would not be such a problem with comprehensive reproductive education and access to birth control. The amount of pregnancies that occur due to ignorance of human reproductive anatomy and biology should be of great concern. Did you know that when a woman/girl is ovulating her biology makes her more susceptible to emotional manipulation by a man? Men are also driven chemically to want sex more intensely when interacting with a woman ovulating? This fact alone would be helpful for women, but especially young girls AND young men. When this kind of education is given at their most vulnerable age, allowing them to create life long responses, it will have an impact on decisions young people make about sex. The reduction in abortion would probably be greater with this type of education than an abortion law, not to mention unwanted children. However, because this kind of education is not allowed in schools by the same groups trying to ban abortion, abortions continue to be too often a choice made.   I would love to see abortion as a form of birth control be eliminated. But not because of a law and an infringement of my rights. But because the need is eliminated. Because education allows young people to make better decisions about sex and birth control. Because support for those in which birth control failed is available without judgment, social prejudice or burden.    You do what you’ve always done, you get what you always got. The anti-abortion movement has not accomplished an abortion ban in 50yrs. Instead the issue is used in politics to pull people into a party that has no real concern for human rights, and has only survived because of the anti-abortion issue. Do you think the GOP really wants to get Roe overturned? Think about that. If abortion is settled, for good as banned, would the GOP survive? I know several people that vote Republican just because of abortion. If abortion wasn’t on the ballot, they would have voted Democrat. It is such an anchor issue, that it can only be something chipped at, but not eliminated. So depending on politicians to have any effect on abortion, except limited access to small pockets in the country, will continue to have the same result. So I’ll say it again: if you really care about abortion, you would be fighting for what will actually make a difference. Comprehensive reproductive education and easy access to birth control will be the best way to approach the abortion issue. Until then, you’re just fighting to win a fight, not for real purpose. You’re also acting as a useful tool for a party that violates human rights daily without apology.	1589174036.0	fq8s78v	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8krv6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8s78v/

emitu	Life is precious, but it's cool to let a mother die for her baby?  This is what's crazy about this primarily conservative pro-life movement. They say life is inherently valuable, up until the moment that baby's born. What if the mother has other children? Or even a partner that depends on her? What if she's a very productive member of society? Why does her life have less value than the potential value of her baby?  Then if that baby's born into poverty or unstable family, conservatives sure don't want it to maybe catch a break with any social programs.	1590304724.0	frmlbb7	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fr5mqg6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/frmlbb7/

1xx56e6j	Your support of the drug war is the view of someone who masturbates...to politicians. “Drug bad, therefore illegal” isn’t logic. Criminalization of drugs comes with consequences, which include:  * Restriction of competition in the pharma market, leading to price gouging. That’s what happens when you “control” the sale of drugs. Competition gets heavily restricted, leading to higher prices  * Proliferation of laced drugs. Black market dealers, obviously, are not subject to quality control  * Proliferation of gang violence. Black market dealers also cannot, obviously, settle disputes via litigation. So disputes get settled with bullets.  * Destruction of civil liberties. It’s become common practice for searches to be conducted on the basis of a dog sniff, aka [improbable cause](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/01/07/132738250/report-drug-sniffing-dogs-are-wrong-more-often-than-right)	1589143975.0	fq7arjd	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq763fx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7arjd/

Your argument that these things are terrible is completely valid, however, the only things that have shown to reliably mitigate these factors are not more policing but instead regulated legalization and huge investments in preventative measures as well as improvements to the general wellbeing of a community. Militarised police only add to the violence that is part of the illegal drug market.	1589143095.0	fq78d23	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq75xi9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq78d23/

fw6ir	Yeah, that's the thing. When the wasting the vote conversation comes up it means different things to different people.

jli4c	I mean from a moral perspective yeah sure that’s great and all, but game theory doesn’t really care about that, that’s the overwhelming problem with a winner take all system.  It’s not that it’s wasted if your candidate doesn’t win, it’s wasted if your candidate doesn’t have a realistic shot at winning, it’s why tactical voting is a thing.  I’m not going to demonize people for voting third, but it’s important that we recognize it for what it really is.  Not doing so downplays the issue of winner take all voting and pushes us further back from fixing the real issue itself.  The best way to support having a realistic shot at a 3rd party candidate elected in your lifetime is to push the problematic nature of our current voting system into widespread social recognition.	1589141433.0	fq73tez	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6w6bt	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq73tez/

jda63	The difference is asking whether you want to align with your interests  and values or effecting legislative change. You cannot have both in the current political system.  If you vote 3rd party, you "succeed" in voting for your best interest.   If you vote for 2 parties, you "succeed" in having one of them enact change.  Wasting your votes depends on which one you want. For me, everyone knows what they personally want, why do you need additional confirmation? So I vote 2 party because I already know which one aligns LESS with me so I vote for the party that WILL effect better change.	1589143969.0	fq7aqyt	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6w6bt	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7aqyt/
N/A	No, first past the post keeps the two party system.  God this sub is ignorant.  We ALL went through the period of not liking the two parties. Guess what? It's really two parties. Google duvergers law.   We've had three president's from a third party. It DOES happen. But then the new party knocks off one of the old parties. That's literally why the Democrats and Republicans today are the opposite of during Lincoln's time. Because it's just a name, the parties have changed multiple times.  But always two.  So you're wasting your vote UNLESS you get enough people to ALSO vote that way. Which CAN HAPPEN. But just because YOU felt good casting a vote for Gary Johnson, you still wasted that vote, unless you literally had zero preference between Trump and Hillary.	1589142681.0	fq777yy	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7420c	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq777yy/

6e5et	It's never a vote wasted. Even if your candidate/ party never sees a polling booth, the support is "absorbed" by other parties. Rather than wasting your vote, you're taking a extra step in voting for whoever you voted for likes the most. They can also use any founded popularity to help sway voting in legislature and future elections.   I voted independent party and in my state, that candidate got 21% of the vote, which is crazy high for a third party. When he fell out of the prelims, he went on and used that support as a basis to found the "never trump" movement and after the elections continued to be a vocal critic of the current federal government and helped found the organization Stand-Up Republic which monitors and garners support for... mostly anti-Trump stuff.	1589149104.0	fq7od6z	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6fmgz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7od6z/

39bjwv9b	To be honest there have been several scholars arguing for a two party system in Germany after the disaster of the Weimar Republic. The opposition of CDU and SPD was kinda by design, because it would allow for a relatively stable state. If we continue with this comparison it still baffels me how there arent atleast some minor parties with relevancy in the US. The big parties in Germany were until recently never really shaken, but the system still allowed for some smaller parties to gain influence. In the US we would have to go as far back as the Bull Moose party or so to find a third relevant party. Does it have to do with the presidency? Why is there no push for abolishing the importance of the president and strengthening the congress?	1589158695.0	fq854uh	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6q5y1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq854uh/

Since 2000, the GOP has held both the executive branch with a majority in both chambers for 6 non consecutive years. The Dems, for only two years. The GOP has held a majority in both chambers for 10 non consecutive years, the Dems for only four years.

N/A	Demographic changes due to mass immigration are, at their current rates, going to eliminate Republican power as white Americans become a minority.  Non-whites vote en masse for Democrats (on average 9/10 blacks, 7.5/10 Asians, 7/10 Hispanics), and this remains true regardless of Republican/Democrat policy positions.  By failing to address mass immigration, the Republican Party has hurt itself, and if it doesn’t do anything about it soon the party is indeed doomed.	1589144513.0	fq7c8dx	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xtxe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7c8dx/

Imma assume the “every thing” pert is exaggerated for the purpose of, what I assume to be, comedy. We haven’t done more than the Democrats, we just get covered more because of politics bias by CNN. & Fox constantly bringing it up in their debates doesn’t help.   Honestly, the majority of things that come to mind with “doing everything” part was prolly due to coverage by CNN & Fox driving it into the ground denying it.	1589141811.0	fq74uen	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xtxe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq74uen/
12rbdb	The Republican Party is going to have major demographic problems in 5-10 years. They were trying to adjust for this with relatively moderate figureheads like Romney and McCain and reaching out to Hispanic voters through representatives like Rubio. But Trump has really put a wrench in that whole plan. Instead of Hispanic outreach, the Trump admin is caging brown children at the border. Why do you think the RNC fought his nomination so hard? He is the face of the party and a significant part of his constituency is going to be dead in 10 years.  Republican strongholds are going to start falling. Biden could win Texas. He probably won't, but a Democrat will soon. And downballot races are going to fall in line across the country.  The GOP isn't on the verge of collapse, but they need a major rebrand if they want to avoid a significant decline in power.	1589140936.0	fq72hk3	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xtxe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq72hk3/

2snijkey	“No real sign of falling out of power” Look no one can know at this point, but polling indicates democrats could sweep the senate and possibly  take the presidency. Of course it’s not a given but there is plenty of real signs that the Republican Party is on the verge of losing power.   If your curious what polling I’m referring too, check out 538 senate polls, and compare with a map of the battleground states. Dems need a net gain of three, and are consistently polling with solid leads in 5, and very close in Iowa. Counting in a likely loss in Alabama still gives the Dems the senate.	1589153492.0	fq7w8ro	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xtxe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7w8ro/

f6q8j	They arent set to retake the house. The polls do not look good for Trump, he could outperform them perhaps. And now the Senate is looking not to be a lock for Republicans.   This entire thing goes in ebbs and flows and no party will be exclusively in power for huge spans of time. The senate will continue to favor Republicans, the house will favor dems for now. Its just they might lose all power next january except the judiciary. So I wouldn't make overconfident statements. The Republican party isnt pon the verge of collapse or anything you are right there. If they lose on November, they will just tweak a bit, and the public will become disillusioned with democratic leadership and we'll just cycle through again.	1589172290.0	fq8py4a	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xtxe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8py4a/

vf04guo	How does anything resembling the modern republican party survive in 30 years when less than half of Americans are white and less than half of Americans are Christian?  It just can't happen.  No matter how much republicans pump up voter participation of their base, that only takes them so far as that base continues to shrink.  Even gerrymandering and voter suppression has it's limits.  So yeah, I wouldn't say 'on the verge of collapse'.  But a generation from now?  The republican party can only survive if they change to the point they are virtually nothing like today's Republican Party.  Trump's dominance over the republican party makes that extremely unlikely in the short term.	1589163858.0	fq8dov4	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6xtxe	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8dov4/

8d7ec	How do you feel about legal heroin and meth? On the one side, banning it creates a dangerous black market, with violent crimes and impure drugs. But on the other hand, I know from personal experience, if opiates were legal and readily available, I *never* would have gotten clean. I quit due to the high prices of the black market, and risking a felony everytime I picked up. So for anecdotal reasons, I don't buy the whole argument that usage would spike. I also would have done more meth, had it been available at a dispensary, instead of just once in a blue moon when my pill hookup smoked me out. I'm also sure a certain number of people that would never try heroin or whatever, actually *would* pick it up to try. Just like we saw with people who never used THC before due to the change in legality. Difference being THC isn't addictive in the way opiates are. There are a handful of illegal drugs I have never tried due to them being illegal, and therefore scarce (PCP, ketamine, etc). If they *were* legal, younger me may have picked them up and fucked up my 20s more than I already did.  I think decriminalization is a given, but I'm talking straight up legalization like we're seeing with weed in several states.  I'm not trying to start a debate here either, I'm just curious of your opinion. This is just the one issue I've gone back and forth on, and have never been able to come to a concrete conclusion. I guess if I had to absolutely pin myself down, I'd go the decriminalize end line users/low level dealers only. Legal or not, I don't think slinging a few grams of dope when you're 20, especially when certain circumstances are taken into account, should fuck up the rest of your life. Creating the cycle, where once your a convicted felon, your choices are so limited you almost have to re-offend to make ends meet.	1589148334.0	fq7me6s	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6unso	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7me6s/

1q3rs	They are trying to identify as a libertarian the same way some teenage girl who kissed her friend Sarah is now a bisexual; they are appropriating something that doesn't belong to them.  I think the only thing more wrong than the right calling themselves Christians is the right calling themselves libertarians.   It's literally classical liberalism. Anti-authoritarianism. Civil liberties *and* civil rights.   Like the meme itself, the right aren't libertarian any more than Somalia is libertarian. The right's idea of a "libertarian paradise" is anarchy for outsiders, fascism for the favoured.   An actual libertarian paradise consists of good government when it works, small government when it doesn't, no government when it is useless. It isn't about corporations and state-owned businesses, it's about the individual.   Conservatives view private property as absolutes, but the point of private property is that it's entrusted to people who respect the public good.  All things have to fall under "your right to swing your nose stops at my face" - having power and property is right *and* a responsibility. It's not like some bizarre system where you extract rent from people using a road for authoritarian purposes, but more like a system where you raise a collection to improve the road. If you can pay, you do. If you can't, you don't. But if you are able to pay, you should be responsible enough to pay more.  It's not about extracting rent, it's about stewardship and using personal liberty to work for the collective good, and the collective good helping to promote personal liberty.  The right cares nothing about the collective good. This is why they can't be libertarians.	1589150511.0	fq7r4oe	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6rdh2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7r4oe/

by7ol	The problem that us lib lefters have with this take, which seems reasonable at first, is that whatever part of the right that finds gay marriage distasteful can always be weaponised in the correct circumstances. They can always find a way to turn that underlying discomfort into anger and righteousness, especially when the LGBT+ community seeks to bring their legal and social status more in line with the 'average american'.   Whatever feeling gets right wingers to privately oppose gay marriage, it's the same feeling that gets them anti-trans, or racist, or sexist. It's their rigid perception of what is 'normal and right' being undermined, and a lot of people will get hateful about it even if you 'don't bother them'.   Shapiro himself gives many fucks about undermining the trans community at any opportunity for example, but the libertarian community accepts him with open arms. Almost no-one considers themselves hateful, but when push comes to shove the right simply believes in imposing hierarchical supremacy over perceived inferiors in a way that the left (especially the lib left) does not.  So in summary, it doesn't really matter if the right wing base is becoming less authoritarian, it's still capable of being shitlords.

N/A	In the debates going into LGBT acceptance in general, you’d often hear the phrase “Who cares what people do in their bedroom?”  Yet now we see that LGBT most certainly is not just confined to the bedroom. It’s inserted into television, parades, the workplace, libraries, etc. Within a few years of gay marriage being legalized we already have drag queen story hour and transgender children. In some places people can be prosecuted for using the wrong gender pronoun, and in others you can be prosecuted for refusing to cater a gay wedding.  We now see “Who cares what happens in the bedroom” was always a lie used as a smokescreen.	1589143167.0	fq78k3k	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq728xt	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq78k3k/

mozgu	I'd argue the opposite, because precautions exist you should assume responsibility for the consequences if you don't take them.     If I invite a girl onto my boat and I don't have life jackets, then the boat sinks and she drowns, I'm responsible for her death because I didn't take the proper procautions.     If I invite a girl over to have sex and I don't wear a condom, then she gets pregnant and has a baby, I'm repsonsible for giving that baby life because I didn't take the proper procautions.    Otherwise if having a resonable expection for sex to not result in pregnancy absolves her of any obligations to the child's life it should do the same for me.	1589151681.0	fq7t5ll	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7cg96	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7t5ll/

cwlek	The whole like slippery slope method deployed by him. If we let X happen then Y and Z will happen. But it's just simply not true.  Yes conservatism has morphed in the past century (like every ideology) but it didn't follow a linear path. The 19th Amendment didn't intrinsically lead to the 26th amendment (which I assume he would consider to be "allowing babies to vote") and that of course hasn't led to anything on the Donkey front.  26th Amendment comes more from animosity towards the draft than the 19th amendment. That alone kinda renders his entire linear argument obsolete in my view.   It's like a very "My views are no longer popular but I have to be very smart so I'm just going to claim 'true' conservatism for myself" approach especially given the context of the man who said it.	1589145704.0	fq7fhbh	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7e5o8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7fhbh/

Are human beings not worthy of life because they can’t survive on their own? What kind of fucked up metric is that? Can a regular baby survive on their own? Can a 5 year old child? It literally takes more effort and resources on behalf of the mother to raise a born child than it does to massively raise one in the womb  Under your retarded logic, you’d be justified in killing literally every single human being in the womb until we all died out  When’s it supposed to be bad to kill a baby ?

I just figured I didn't have to refute a point as mind numbingly stupid as "all my political opponents hate human rights" as if that were a real statement rather than the hyperbolic assertions of the political partisan.

Not thinking, say, having a job is a human right (because it doing so would naturally require the trampling of another, far more easily justified right of association) does not mean you don't care about human rights.	1589169776.0	fq8mkre	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8gohf	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8mkre/

But to give you your premise, are you saying this is only a justifiable use of federal force because they're supposedly terrorists?

What if Oregon sees the situation with these protesters differently, in which case, who are the feds to come in and say who's a terrorist and who's a peaceful protester?

N/A	I don't agree that easy access to birth control will reduce abortions, and there's social science that backs that opinion. I agree with that education is a crucial element in forming people to be responsible with their sexuality and their reproduction; and I'd venture to say most conservatives would also agree with that. Where we would likely cease to agree is in the content of the education you would want to provide.  Regardless, I didn't come here to argue abortion, what I came to do was make clear that this meme isn't accurate in portraying what conservatives generally believe.   If you want to argue abortion I'd recommend looking up Lila Rose's interview in The Rubin Report.

N/A	No, the actual point is that you argue like a child by creating your own goalposts.  One does not have to be against ALL government, or against all parts of government pro-rata, to be pro-small-government.  Lets say there are 5 categories of government (A, B, C, D, and E).  Each currently is at 8 of 10 sizewise.  So government is 40 of 50.  Lets say I want to cut A, B, and C down to 2, and D down to 5.  Keep E at 8.  I now support a government of 19.

65bo5mik	Canada the United Kingdom, the two closest physical and cultural analogues, have multiple viable parties at all levels of government, and these parties repeatedly win the equivalent of congressional seats at the national level. This isn't some big gotcha, but continue to be a good trained dog.  FPTP sucks. I'm not saying it doesn't. But pinning your hopes on something like Ranked Ballot Voting that would be challenged all the way up to the Republican supreme court is stupid and short-sighted. Solve the disease not the symptom. Two centrist parties with the exact same policies dominating all facets of life is not because of FPTP, it is because of the ridiculous amount of money in American elections that allow only the candidates with corporate backing to get enough air time to win.	1589181822.0	fq912eh	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7dojb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq912eh/

Principally because if a party gets a certain percentage of the vote, they get matching funds in the next election.

qgzn5e6	> Why is there no push for abolishing the importance of the president and strengthening the congress?  Because most members of Congress hate taking votes that leave them exposed to attack ads, whether from their own ideological side in their primary or the other side in the general election. And the more power Congress keeps to itself, the more tough votes members of Congress have to take and the more responsibility they bare when shit goes wrong.   It's way easier for a member of Congress to let the administration, whether you're in the same party or not, take all the blame for running things. "Sure I voted for a massive business bailout, but I NEVER voted to give tens of millions to big businesses! That's all the administration!" is what tons of Congressional Republicans are saying right now.  > Does it have to do with the presidency?   Yes. Political parties organized in the US for the purpose of winning the Presidency. We've literally had 2 parties since the 1st election after George Washington because the fundamental rules of electing the President - winner take all by state - force a 2 party system from the top down. So then you have parties managing Senate appointments from the state governments and later state wide elections, House of Representatives elections, and then state and local elections.   There have been multiple cases where one of the 2 dominant parties imploded and was replaced by a new party quickly to re-establish the 2 party system. The Federalists in the early 1800s to the Whigs and the Democratic-Republicans in the early-to-mid 1800s. The modern Republican and Democratic parties solidified in the 1860 election that resulted in the Civil War and those two parties have survived literally every disaster the nation has faced since - 2 world wars, The Great Depression, the cold war, Vietnam, Watergate, etc. The 2 parties aren't going anywhere unless there is massive electoral reform and even then they'd be hard to dislodge because of their literal century and a half of party infrastructure.   If you you edit the Constitution overnight and eliminate the Senate and the Presidency and turn the Speaker of the House into a Prime Minister, you'd very quickly get viable 3rd parties all over the place.	1589229711.0	fqb31sc	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq854uh	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqb31sc/

Only the left-most fringe in the party support any amount of socialism, open borders is a very controversial position in the party, diversity quotas are extremely fringe, gun control is Auth. Literally the only non-AuthRight thing that you listed that is supported by a significant portion of the party is abortion rights. Yes, these ideas are present among a small fringe portion of the party, but they are not representative of the party as a whole. They get labelled as representing the entire Democratic Party by Conservatives who want to paint the party as too extreme for American politics.	1589141611.0	fq74azx	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq71q9g	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq74azx/

The demographics of America are changing and voting trends by race haven't changed substantially and will not change. Why would they? The democratic party is offering free shit, free citizenship for everyone, speaking spanish, and bending over for blacks. What is the republican party doing for them? Low taxes?

5pc6m	Perhaps, but I doubt it. The same thing has been said before in different times. The truth is people shift in opinion over time and, while hardly homogeneous, the young tend to lean left where the old lean right. Parties and groups evolve over time in different ways, but this trend is surprisingly consistent.   Is the pendulum swinging away from Republicans soon? Could be, though I'd wager Trump will survive this election. But, after a two term president, the ruling party usually gets set back.   If Biden wins this next contest, the pendulum's swing will be harder to predict, but swing it will.	1589141730.0	fq74mo3	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq72hk3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq74mo3/
iidjx	But will it is the question. Will we even see such a change in our lifetimes?   Because the way we vote is hardcoded into our constitution. So in order to bring about that direct correlation you need a 3/4ths majority in both parts of congress to agree to a new system that would give up their longstanding hegemony.    Getting rid of FPTP voting is fun and all, but actually doing that *very* hard and would basically take a massive left wing victory in nearly every state for 6 years in order to do that.	1589151529.0	fq7sw0b	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7r7w3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7sw0b/

Perhaps the Republican party has changed to the point of no recognition, but the people that do this kind of shit seem to hold ideologies that are not in line with traditional Republicans.  I became so disenfranchised with the Republican party that I slowly became more libertarian in regards to social issues as well as economic (it's more complicated than that, but my disenfranchisement was the catalyst). I have absolutely no hate for people who still identify as Republican because I completely understand the appeal. I'm just disappointed with what it's become and political parties in general.

3r7ja9ar	I'm honestly ok with abortion. I look at it like euthanasia. If the family isn't prepared for it and an adoption can't be lined up either, it'll cause less suffering to end a life then bring it into the world. I still think it should carry some guilt/remorse because it isn't as ideal as it never existing in the first place.	1589149666.0	fq7pn8e	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7p7j5	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7pn8e/
N/A	You missed my point. I am saying we don't need a hard line of when consciousness begins, to determine whether something is conscious. Consciousness begins somewhere we know that, but it doesn't begin at conception for example.

rmb9i	Consider a scenario where you cause a similar situation as pregnancy, but with an adult.     Say you're driving, you look to turn up the a\c, and in that lapse of attention you cause an accident. You wake up in a hospital bed, back to back with a bed holding the other driver. You realize there is a machine plugged into you and the other driver, a nurse explains their kidneys failed due to the accident [hand wavy magic stuff happens] and both of your blood supplies are filtered through your liver/kidneys/whatever. If you unplug yourself they will surely die. But, they can get a transplant in nine months and you go your separate ways.    Assuming this all makes sense as an allegory for pregnancy, should someone have the right to remain connected to you until they can survive on their own?

nh56c	Ahh, so it doesn't exist to kill innocents, but it does kill innocents, but that's OK, because most people killed aren't innocent.  How many innocent prisoners being murdered by the state is the right comfortable with killing? What's an acceptable "Oops, we got it wrong" percentage?   > Are you telling me that killing a child is the same as killing someone like Ted Bundy.   Now that's a false equivalence! On multiple levels.  You really did a number on that one.  Well, first of all, I would say that 91% of abortions happen in the first trimester - when the fetus is 1/2 ounce in weight or less.  I wouldn't call a 1/2 ounce (14 gram) fetus a "Baby".  And most aren't even that big when aborted.   Second of all, no, I wouldn't say aborting a 14 gram fetus is the same as killing a prisoner (Likely guilty, potentially innocent).    Right, I get it. You and many others on the far right see the abortion of a fetus that weighs less than two quarters stuck together as "Infanticide", which is defined as "the intentional killing of infants".  Most people don't subscribe to this theory though. Anyway, I digressed slightly.    It's interesting to me that the right wants to "improve the system" when it comes to capital punishment and not kill innocents, but for what end goal? It costs more money to put someone to death than to jail them in perpetuity, and no system will ever exists that will 100% be sure to not kill innocent people.  So capital punishment costs more than a life sentence, kills some innocent people (and always will), it doesn't more effectively deter people from committing awful crimes, so what's the goal? Revenge? Vengeance?	1589161911.0	fq8alyz	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq885os	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8alyz/

N/A	Well I actually agree with you here. But as I said already, it's the poverty that's the issue. Drugs are generally just used by the poor and uneducated people, and unfortunately in eastern Europe the poor and uneducated are a large portion of the population. Since they cannot find a meaningful "way out", they have to turn to alternatives.   I'm sure your resentment of drugs comes from personal experience so I don't blame you for the views you hold, but you should just consider that maybe your resentment is pointed in the wrong direction.

5h8cxmd7	Fair enough I took the 96% chance that you weren't in the 4% doing better than me. I'm at 165k base, no stock options though, at 28. I assume youre a  older than me if not great job seriously. My net worth is not nearly as high. Average 22k a year on heroin does not lend it self to saving although I do have about 80k now.  And you dont know what your talking about at all in terms of drugs. I have a masters in applied math (graduated on heroin while working as a data scientist) still am in that position at a non friend or family company. you'll see that in recent comments with some in depth discussion on data science/stats look alittle further back and you see a comment I made maybe a week ago about the different drug that are powders which are not injectable, and how you can inject them. I know from experience.   Again your ideas are all wrong, I cant work on cocaine nor ever had a problem with it, same with benzos. your notions of drugs are completely retarded. Different people have different reactions. Heroin and opiates on the other hand let me focus and work long hard hours. I'm not saying it didnt negatively impact me. It did with relationships especially since pretty much everyone reasonable doesn't want to get into a long term relationship with a heroin addict once you tell them. (hypocritical but I'm not dating a junkie, most cant pass, although there are a few others out there like me).  Im not saying the majority of drug addicts out there are like me, they're not but there alot more than youd think. Most of the common problems junkies have come from 3 things, all of which have remedies.  1.) a lack of motivation that was already there. It's why when you see stories of people who got clean most are not making 6 figures. They never had motivation in the first place.  2.) I know this is going to sound kinda ridiculous, but lack of self care. Outside of veins which I rotated regularly (and makeup with short sleeves or when going out so if I went home with someone they wouldn't notice), every other outward sign of heroin use is from not taking care of yourself. Not brushing your teeth twice a day, not shaving/showering daily, eating like shit and not working out. All things I made sure to stay on top of. Just because you use drugs doesn't mean you should let everything else go. Again money made the eating well and working out alot easier I understand most junkies cant do that. But the other things they cant but just dont.   3.) Legal issues. Again never had any because I could pay to get my heroin delivered to my apartment in a nice neighborhood so no risk with cops in the hood, and never stole for my habit, nor would I have.  So you can plug your ears and pretend you're right being ignorant, but you just make yourself look dumb which you clearly not. Again theres pretty solid proof of my drug use or at least deep knowledge of it, and math background in my comments. So if you think I planted those waiting for this exact scenario theres not helping you believe me.  On another note, from your salary I assume you work in  the private sector. You PhD wouldn't happen to be in math would it? I ask because I'm trying to decide if I want to get one but am trying to gauge people's opinions on PhD's from good European universities, because I dont want to waste 2ish extra years going through the required courses for a US one when I already took them.  Edit: also alot of junkies dont regulate their dosage enough so you see them nodding out like idiots. This is actually my biggest advice for anyone using. Get high but dont overdue it.

5cpsq914	United Kingdom has a parliamentary system which makes things more interesting. However in any given region it's still almost always a two party election. Outside of Scotland it's pretty much always Labour vs Conservative.  It also has a truly massive spoiler effect going on, with LibDems receiving 11.6% of the vote and getting 11 seats, and SNP receiving 3.9% of the vote and getting 48 seats.  Canada is fairly similar	1589182429.0	fq91nz7	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq912eh	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq91nz7/

qgzn5e6	If you had a President elected in a manner similar to ours, you'd only have 2 parties as well. Parliamentary systems lend themselves to multi-party systems better because the only elections you have to worry about at the federal level is the single election in your constituency.   The US has an analogue in the House of Reps and we'd probably have viable 3rd parties if the elected government only consisted of the House, but also has state-wide Senate races and the Electoral College. As a result, only 2 parties are viable in these contents with far more people. Our political parties literally developed around Presidential campaigns and it's why you still have these giant conventions (the DNC and the RNC) held to nominate a Presidential candidate but aren't held in midterm years.  The US also doesn't have anything analogous to the Bloc due to Quebec's unique cultural differences vs the rest of Canada. There are variations within each state Democratic or Republican party but nothing like what the Bloc has vs other parties. Compare Dem Governor John Bell Edwards of Louisiana and GOP Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts versus the generic member of their national parties.   The US essentially has a 100 party system with 2 parties in each state that align with each other for federal elections but otherwise can be quite different on certain issues.	1589228870.0	fqb1ddk	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8pp20	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqb1ddk/

y1dux	Anti immigration Conservatives and anti corporate leftists both suffer from one glaring obstacle: Donors don't agree with their goals.  Immigration is consistently the one thing that R politicians ignore when they get power. Trump, who made immigration his *signature* issue, **still** has not beaten Obama's record in deportations per year some way some how. It's honestly impressive that he hasn't.

16hibn	>unlimited immigration  Biden has very much advertised himself as being exactly like Obama but white, and Obama did kick out millions of illegal immigrants. Bernie never really focused on immigration but based on everything else I would say he wouldn't do this.   >unlimited feminism  Biden has been accused of rape and hasn't been exactly the most feminist person in the process, along with the Anita Hill stuff.   >unlimited abortion  Up until a year ago Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which isn't exactly fully pro abortion. While he does seem to support abortion rights, he has a wavering history that would worry an abortion rights activist.   >hate white advocacy  Biden defended him working with segregationist, which based on your flair, you don't view as being the same as white advocacy, but I think we can agree this would make him more lenient and willing to work with the right on their white advocacy, however you would define that.   Hopefully bias doesn't come through in this too much, as I don't want to necessarily say anything is right or wrong (even though I obviously do have opinions on all the topics), just that Bernie and Biden are not identical on social issues. There are also some differences in the other topics, such as Bernie honestly is probably more Pro Gun rights then many people believe he is and my guess is that Biden isn't 100% understanding of the LGBT+ community, but I don't think there was too much need to highlight every single difference.	1589145373.0	fq7el31	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq76y97	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7el31/

N/A	>12 years  then you're not thinking long term enough.  We're in the beginning of a countrywide race war in the US lmao.    You can dress it up all you want with fancy words like "conservative values" and "free speech" but it comes 100% down to race.  "Right wing" = doesn't like non-whites, and "Left wing" = doesn't completely loathe non-whites.    And unlike the past "race wars" of the US (think events like Tulsa etc), the non-white minority is 35%, not 10% of the population.  And lemme give you a hint: when Blacks and Latinos get fed up enough with white mobs killing them for eating a grapefruit or something, they're going to be very receptive to *ahem* other countries extending their "influence" across the Pacific.	1589176867.0	fq8vo4q	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq895g7	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8vo4q/

N/A	They’re both wrong anyway. Demographic changes due to mass immigration are, at their current rates, going to eliminate Republican power as white Americans become a minority.  Non-whites vote en masse for Democrats (on average 9/10 blacks, 7.5/10 Asians, 7/10 Hispanics), and this remains true **regardless** of Republican/Democrat policy positions.   By failing to address mass immigration, the Republican Party has hurt itself, and if it doesn’t do anything about it soon the party is indeed doomed.	1589142075.0	fq75k7m	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6yi3k	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq75k7m/

2snijkey	Sure. 100 years ago. And it made it basically impossible for them to win the popular vote in the early 1900s. Woodrow Wilson only won bc the republican vote was split. The party shifted around the time of FDR and it’s been different since then. The Republican Party will survive but not in its current form.	1589198211.0	fq9ha99	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7qkzx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9ha99/

12rbdb	It's not just age that's going to drive the shift. It's ethnicity too. More black and brown Americans will be going to the polls.   There's multiple factors at play. The GOP is currently enjoying the benefits of the baby boom. But when that reservoir dries up, their constituency is going to lose numbers quick. Yeah, 10, 20, and 30 years ago, old conservative voters died too. But there weren't nearly as many as there are right now.  At the same time, younger voters are becoming eligible, although this isn't as notable because there wasn't a millennial or gen Z baby boom.  The candle is going to start burning at both ends. The GOP is going to lose members as boomers die off, and the Democrats are going to gain from the newly diverse and younger electorate.  Yeah, sure, this is all conjecture. Maybe every boomer survives the next 10 years and every Gonzalez votes Republican. But that's a statistically unlikely scenario. If conventional political wisdom surrounding demographics holds true, the GOP is going to start hemorrhaging support within the next decade.	1589142544.0	fq76ur1	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq74mo3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq76ur1/
N/A	With the compassion thing, this is why people like the clintons come across as so deeply and obviously hypocritical.  Essentially its simpler to say that they are lying rather than the significant mental gymnastics that would be required to say that neoliberalism is primarily motivated by the need to understand the needs of others through your own and then acting to satistfy both. When you look to break down existing power structures, unless you literally mean the younger generations take control as in the existing positions are filled with younger versions of their current selves, its redistributive, you look to empower some through disempowering others; the modern day power to threaten ones life inherited from the same power in a feudal lord or slave trader or decider of policy. Essentially unless you were to try really hard, I don't see that theres any particular contradiction in our views.	1589141787.0	fq74s5d	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq72s9x	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq74s5d/

2snijkey	Trumpism isn’t sustainable long term. It may be a political ideology but it will be short lived, because demographic shifts will make it impossible for republicans to win on their current platform.

I wouldn’t be shocked to see one if we ever fix our garbage voting system.

He’d always express disappointment in how far left the republicans have become and I’d have no clue what he’s talking about until I asked him to define “right wing”.

Turns out, if people are going to get arrested (judged, followed, tracked or other, lot of variations so focused on eventual and possible criminal consequences) for seeking help due to drug use then less people look for help. Because admitting to being a heavy class A user is the same as admitting to the purchase of hard drugs, which has high punishments in the most lenient of case.    People who genuinely want to get better don’t give a shit what people think of them, they just don’t want to lose their freedom, so they continue the path.

Sixth, he is again, against over the counter birth control which I don’t know any libertarian who isn’t. I will give you his exact argument on that if you would like, again just to prove you wrong.

24xziqip	Well I don’t know if you call yourself a tankie, but tankies are famous for celebrating the USSR, China, Vietnam, and Cuba, which all were extremely authoritarian. Marx claimed to be against nationalism and a statehood altogether. He believed the unity of the working classes would substitute the need for a national or state identity and was by and large anti-authority. Lenin simply used Marx’s theory to apply a structured circle of leadership in Russia after the Tsar was overthrown.

6dt6v347	You can’t really hide an abortion if it’s banned, unless you’re willing to improvise at home, which can be scary. It’s like if you ban surgery, people aren’t gonna try and do it themselves at home. Abortion is also a tough decision and is a complicated procedure, especially if you’re not a medical professional. It’s not anything like a drug deal. So yes, banning abortion would completely discourage people from doing it themselves. You’re taking the liberal side of this argument, so are you trying to tell me banning abortion will not keep people from getting an abortion, but banning guns will keep people from getting guns? Banning a commodity is not the same as banning a medical procedure.	1590529900.0	frwyoyt	t3_gh4aq4	t1_frvhdb0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/frwyoyt/

65bo5mik	The NDP and Libdems have acted to make the larger parties more accountable, have often held them to minority governments (ensuring their ideas are represented by trading votes for policies), and holding much more power at lower regions of government, further shaping the policy of other parties.   To use the UK as an example, Labour has been forced into more leftist political stances to differentiate itself, while the conservatives had to fight off advances from UKIP. All parties have had to be flexible and adapt to voters choosing what they want. The biggest example is also the one reddit hates the most, Conservative Brexit. The conservatives campaigned against it, their entire leadership hated it. Their voters loved it, pushed it, and now we have Boris.	1589184650.0	fq93wh7	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq91nz7	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq93wh7/

N/A	>Biden has very much advertised himself as being exactly like Obama but white, and Obama did kick out millions of illegal immigrants.  I was making a bit of an exaggeration, but the key point is this: During every year of Obama's tenure, over 1,000,000 new legal immigrants alone were allowed into the US. We don't even know how many illegal immigrants came in, but we can assume based on other numbers that it was in the hundreds of thousands if not millions.   While Obama did deport a good number of illegal immigrants, his administration did **next to nothing** to prevent them from coming back into the country. This is why there are so many headlines such as "Illegal immigrant deported 6 times arrested for murder".   Due to the combination of allowing in millions of legal immigrants, and allowing illegal immigrants to either re-enter en masse or be legalized through amnesty (which is the Democrat Party platform), both Biden and Bernie support absurdly high, demographic altering levels of immigration.  >Biden has been accused of rape and hasn't been exactly the most feminist person in the process, along with the Anita Hill stuff.  While this is true, his policy positions on paper are still extremely feminist.  >Up until a year ago Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which isn't exactly fully pro abortion. While he does seem to support abortion rights, he has a wavering history that would worry an abortion rights activist.  Again, this is mostly true, but on paper his policy positions on abortion are basically the same as Bernie's. As I recall, Tulsi Gabbard was the **only** Democrat candidate to vocally support even basic restrictions on abortion (in the third trimester).  >I think we can agree this would make him more lenient and willing to work with the right on their white advocacy, however you would define that.  You may have a point here, but more because Bernie was **particularly** rabidly anti-white advocacy. He proclaimed he wanted to "Go to war with white nationalism in every aspect of our lives". Biden's more similar to Obama in that he softly supports anti-white narratives and causes rather than proclaiming his will to destroy it.	1589146142.0	fq7gnib	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7el31	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7gnib/

qgzn5e6	>the American public could try to change that with protests, public discurse, strikes, boycotts etc.  Because most people that are politically engaged enough to care are content enough with the parties. The people who hate both parties the most are already the least likely to vote and participate in the political process at all.   If you're only on reddit and social media, you get a very distorted view of how the average American voter sees the parties. Approval for each party usually hovers somewhere in the 30-40% range the past number of years, and the Dems were regularly >50% before 2010. Source https://news.gallup.com/poll/24655/party-images.aspx  So if the Dems and GOP combined have ~70-80% of the population approving of one of them, there's not actually a whole lot of enthusiasm to break them up. And those who dislike them the most are the least likely to do anything about it.  Many states have ballot measure laws that allow members of the public to propose and ratify laws with 0 involvement of the elected government. States could start adopting thinks like ranked choice voting or proportional representation but right now only Maine has ranked choice and it's only for some federal races.  There is a slow movement towards ranked choice though. Maine because the first state in US History to determine a Congressional race with ranked choice in 2018. The GOP incumbent was leading with like 48% of the vote, but after ranked choice redistributed votes from 3rd party candidates the Dem got just over 50% and flipped the seat.   Virginia just passed a law allowing local government to use ranked choice for stuff like mayor and county council elections. I doubt the US ever moved towards proportional representation - people want to have a person directly accountable to them - but ranked choice could start to give 3rd parties more of a chance.	1589303062.0	fqe7lue	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fqdiv8e	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqe7lue/

10atjr	Sorta, it’s not supposed to be, and we set up to avoid it becoming partisan but the problem is the opposite parties in the US both have very strong stances on the constitution (the ruling law) and they are almost always tied to policy beliefs.   So, while a justice that is an originalist and reads the constitution in a conservative manner isn’t necessarily a “Republican” justice, he probably voted rebublican.  The same goes for a progressive justice, those that see the Constitution as a living and evolving document. They aren’t “Democrat” justices, however, the policies that Democrats push are based on the premise that the constitution is evolving and meant to be interpreted.   Neither view of the constitution is wholly right or wrong imo but I think that some rulings by progressive justices tend to be a little more baseless because I think that they are over interpreting the constitution rather than just seeing it as it is. I vote republican. That’s how the court is “sort of” partisan.	1589146580.0	fq7hu5h	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq71ec2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7hu5h/

5pc6m	Perhaps you're right. That is certainly a valid scenario. It is far from certain, however. Sure, minorities tend to align closer to the left, but that isn't set in stone. Groups (ethnic, socio-economic, age, etc)  move, though it is usually harder to see in two-party systems.   Each party is a mix of coalitions. How those coalitions are built change. So the republican and democratic parties evolve. The Obama coalition worked for him, but fell apart for Hillary. The coalition that delivered Trump was different from the one that delivered Bush. Hillary lost blue collars, Trump lost suburban women. None of them were massive shifts, but parties work constantly to maintain that 51%.    Again, perhaps things will happen as you say, but forecasting political futures is very difficult to predict with reliable accuracy. Dems can get complacent and watch as they get outflanked, but their party leadership isn't dumb.   Why do you think the entire establishment ganged up on Bernie after his early race victories? Parties are first and foremost interested in self-preservation, not ideological rigor.	1589163005.0	fq8ccyz	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq76ur1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8ccyz/

If we legalized drugs like that (or at the very least decriminalize them) we could treat addiction as the mental health problem it is more cohesively as a society rather than as the violent criminal enterprise society has collectively pigeonholed it into becoming through criminal prohibition.  Edit: Also those substances alter mood and I know that, but the outward effects could be mitigated by social acceptance of addiction as a mental health issue.	1589146457.0	fq7hhz4	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7gyic	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7hhz4/

36f817f7	The thing with abortion is that it depends on whether you value the fetus' rights or the woman's rights.   I'm not taking a stance here, but if you believe that the fetus is deserving of regular legal rights, then you should be against abortion, libertarian or not.	1589145068.0	fq7dqvp	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7570t	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7dqvp/
797cd	While abortion is obviously a huge political issue, I've always thought it's kind of apolitical. The question is just "When does a zygote become a child?" If you believe that a zygote just is a child, then abortion is obviously impermissible. If you don't think it can be considered a child until very late on, abortion is permissible.  &#x200B;  I've always found it kind of odd when women claim that being pro-life is sexist, because it's 'men trying to control women's bodies'. It's like, no, the whole point is they think there is another person inside you - it's not your body anymore.	1589151206.0	fq7sc28	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7570t	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7sc28/

5n04s3eq	I just don’t see the logic in forcing an unprepared person to have a child. If a low income 15-20 year old girl gets pregnant the quality of life for her and the baby will be horrible. What’s the point of life if it is full of suffering and pain? If she isn’t ready financially or emotionally to support a child and the republican party is strictly against handouts it just seems like the ultimate goal is actually a decrease in social mobility for the lower class.  The 1% care less about abortion and what is morally right than they lead on. I think it’s just used as justification to target poor communities who disproportionately have less access to contraceptives. If you can prevent the poor from climbing the social hierarchy the income inequality status quo remains and the rich win.  It’s the same reason they don’t want to support universal free health care or free college. Both these things would make it significantly easier to enter the middle class. They also setup the FAFSA in a way the prevents anyone who has bad parents from going to college until the age of 25.	1589200365.0	fq9jw39	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8iw19	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9jw39/

3r7ja9ar	I know it's just weird to think about if you try to rationalize it completely out of context from humanity. Majority of morality can be determined from a few axioms. A lot of cultural right/left conflict happens because they can never agree because their axioms are different. Abortion is one edge case where you get two conflicting opinions of what is moral and both are valid because both views value different things.

Treatment "with human dignity" is also irrelevant because it doesn't answer my point: we kill anencephalic human beings but I don't see you protesting to keep them alive as long as possible. Unless you do change your position and start arguing that we need to end the killing of anencephalic babies, then whether or not something is "a human being" does not tell us whether or not it should be alive. Same point may be repeated for the death penalty (assuming you are for it). Whether or not someone is a human being does not tell us whether they should be allowed to die or to be killed.	1589299282.0	fqdzjp6	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8i13m	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqdzjp6/

bqi071a	Yes, there is totally logical reasoning behind assuming that abortion will just magically remove the “murder of infants” from the face of the earth... if you want to ACTUALLY ban abortions, you’re not going to see any significant drop in the rates of pregnancies, because it’s already such a huge problem in impoverished communities across the country that simply banning it has no effect...   In order to get this movement across you’ll need to be a traditionalist, the exact same way temperance and prohibition activists saw it out. And even if that’s your reinforcement, I highly doubt those impoverished communities are going to give enough fucks to be like “Wow, Jesus is our savior!” To people who just banned abortion who are now coming in to spread the virtues of childbirth on an area where families are already incredibly disjointed.  Case In point, banning things leads absolutely nowhere, but regulating it? That’s the way to go. Abortion should be the last measure, and abstinence should be emphasized so that the people have a conscious choice. Abortion should, by no means EVER, be celebrated. It should be a sad experience for all parties involved, and for some of my own generation to proudly say “girl c’mon just kill that thing” is stupid. But banning it? It will fix NOTHING.	1590530789.0	frx0fxb	t3_gh4aq4	t1_frwyoyt	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/frx0fxb/

1xx56e6j	> What have the courts ruled?  Is that probable cause?  Courts in the US are one of the primary methods by which civil liberties have been eroded. They’ve stretched the power of “judicial review” wider than the most ratchet stripper in the most ratchet club you could find. In essence, they now have the power to de facto amend the constitution, redefining words and accommodating tyranny.  What’s happened with the 4th amendment is a microcosm of this issue. The supreme court, in florida v harris, ruled that drug dogs are “probable cause”. But as shown by a wide array of cross-sectional studies, it is NOT probable that drugs are in a spot that a dog indicate. The supreme court has **redefined** the word “probable” to mean it’s antonym, improbable. Essentially an amendment to the constitution  > We do not incarcerate enough.  And our prisons are a joke.  I am from Russia, THOSE are prisons.  No true scotsman fallacy. The word “prison” means “a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed”. Prisons in the US are...prisons. By definition. You’re insinuating that they’re not really prisons because the conditions within aren’t as bad as russia  > I am not saying a possession charge compares to death.

I explained why western drug laws are an insignificant deterrent from drugs  > I have no idea why you think controlling of substances raises prices.   Because it restricts competition in the pharma market. The process of “registering under the controlled substances act” to be able to legally sell pills is an extremely thick web of bureaucracy. This competition restriction, by basic economics, leads to higher prices  > It is IP that is the number one issue.  IP is a major issue. As is the “controlling” of substances. Both restrict competition in the market, spurring higher prices  > Or do you mean you want opiates to be cheaper?  I want all pharmaceuticals to be cheaper. In something that actually resembles a free market, they would be.

5h8cxmd7	Thanks for the reasonable response. It is hard to get clean from, and I would never recommend it to anyone. Legality and the high cost cause more problems than the drug itself imo, and money solved one problem and really mitigated the other for me, but many others arent as lucky as I am.   Truthfully just like guns the issue (shootings) isnt completely inherent to the product itself. Yes heroin affects you alot more than owning a gun, but a lot of the negatives from it are caused by legality and high cost which follows. Legal or not the number of users wont really increase. At the end of the day, it's a mental health problem for both issues. Legality will never stop people from shooting up heroin...or people for that matter.	1589163618.0	fq8dbg0	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq846r9	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8dbg0/

5on2xfi0	I live in the Czech Republic and it's probably the only country in the world where Pirates are a relevant political force.  They are the 3rd largest party in the lower house of the parliament (the most powerful house) - which is a big deal considering there are 9 parties represented there and the biggest one only has \~30% of the seats - and the mayor of the capital city (Prague) is from a Pirate Party.  I expected that they'd rise in some more "progressive" country like Germany or Sweden where they like weird novelty political activism in general, so I was pretty surprised that it's this relatively conservative CEE country where they became so popular, from 2% to 11% in the parliamentary election - 150 000 to 500 000 votes - in just one electoral term.	1589140373.0	fq70ypp	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6m6po	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq70ypp/

One of their policies is to rebuild the wall in Berlin and separate germany into east and west again, with the east solely living off handouts from the western part.

In fact, it's been literally proven in neurology that conservatives operate on base feeling and emotion, while liberals operate on protracted, emotionally distanced thought--but only WHITE liberals (because most non-white people know that voting Dem = survival)  Now imagine a party literally based on killing Brown/Black people, trying to pull the democrat strategy.  LMAO.    Most BLACK people are conservative as well.  In fact, most people in general are very receptive to conservative values.  The problem is that American politics has literally nothing to do with principles, values, or anything of that sort--instead it is 100% a violent identitarian struggle.  But it's dressed up with lolbertarian excuses like "durr I like-a the free market even though I hate it when Chinese people benefit from free market"  Asking republicans to "woo Hispanics and strong minded women"  is like asking Xi Jinping to consider granting the "Uyghurs and Tibetans more autonomy"	1589177290.0	fq8w5ps	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8r5a4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8w5ps/

9x9kf	Liberals and the left in general shot themselves in the foot over abortion, since for many people it is the one single issue that dictates their political  leaning. If they had handled that differently, the right would have far less power today.   The funny thing is that they don't even have to drop legal support of it. If they treated it like an unavoidable thing that has to be legal but allowed it to be treated as a moral issue to be solved personally then many conservatives would have fallen in line. But that take on it was quickly abandoned in favor of the idea that so much as saying it is even a moral issue at all means you should be shouted into oblivion. This comes off definitely in bad faith, so it makes reacting against that take so easy. There are plenty of problem totally willing to ally even with people they know are bad over this.	1589144140.0	fq7b7no	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq75out	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7b7no/

9x9kf	There are tons of other options.  1: They have value before being conscious. Or in an area of ambiguity that possibility is so high that you need to act like they do. After all, people aren't conscious in some levels of sleep, so consciousness can't be taken as the sole arbiter of value.  2: Being conscious in and of itself doesn't confer much value because if you argue that your value is only based on your current state (why else would they need to be conscious) then two volts in a brain is not equivalent to self aware people and so doesn't have much meaningful value.  3: consciousness as we know of it isn't actually a thing. If consciousness is just information processing, all physical systems process information, and so there is no meaningful dividing line where it "starts."  4: Killing people is only wrong because people want not to die, and something not developed enough to want not to can't have that state projected onto them. If killing is wrong even to people who don't want to live, does that mean we can't euthanize old people who want to be put out of their misery?  And all of these are without even getting into autonomy arguments. None of these have anything to do with progressive kool aid. In fact, progressives want to *cover up* the existence of argument #2, because if it came out that even infanticide is not that theoretically different than abortion, the amount of people who would turn against abortion is much higher than would suddenly be okay with infanticide. Ambiguous middle grounds that have very little actual defense are where progressives want you to stay.	1589180738.0	fq8zxqr	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8tcrz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8zxqr/

I know, that you know, that the concept doesn't hold. Its dismissive and reactionary, as the stories in the thread prove.

Those of us who don't care to make being gay our whole identity got complacent and ceded control to the crazies. There's a slow rising movement to take it back.

Your viewpoint seems to rest on this odd idea that the essence of humanity overrides the pain a conscious creature might feel because you wanted to have hot dogs.

2yz3ba7u	It can be objectively speaking, however if you truly believe in any faith its almost certain that you believe that all humans have a soul and only god has a right to take life under most faiths. Therefore if you do hold true to your religion then it would come to the point where its practically impossible for them in good conscious to support abortion or for the matter euthanasia.             Because of this i believe although it shouldn't be banned it shouldn't be tax payed either because it would be u fair to expect peopleto be forced to pay for a service that they deem extremely immoral.

13w5hr	You could define it as being human, or in the case of aliens, you could generalize it to being a member of an intelligent species. Under this view, a fetus would have personhood by nature of its species being intelligent.  One benefit to this view I can see is that we avoid judging people's moral value on their intelligence. For example, it would become quite clear that we can't just cull the vegetables.  If this alien species were designed in such a way that the males are no more intelligent than a chicken, but the females had superb intelligence, would you only grant personhood to the females, or would you extend it to the males? Would it not be cleaner and more consistent to apply it to all members of the species?	1589220657.0	fqakljn	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq9lmzn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqakljn/

And that is all pro-lifers have.   >Abortion is one edge case where you get two conflicting opinions of what is moral and both are valid  No they both don't make moral arguments. One is an argument of liberty (pro-choice) and the other is an argument from morality (pro-life). They also aren't both valid since no moral arguments should be considered "valid" because morals mean literally nothing. Everybody has their own, they change every few years, and laws shouldn't be based on what somebody "feels" is right.   >It's fun to use it to try to abstract morality and see how arbitrary it is.

4jjytbpd	personhood must exist at conception if it exists for any of us if it is to remain internally consistent as a concept.  consciousness is a poor indicator of personhood for many reasons.  consciousness evolves throughout our life as a consequence of brain development (which begins at conception).  a human can't form memories until 2 years post-birth.  memory is integral to consciousness.  yet we wouldn't say newborns aren't persons even though in their current state they have a far inferior mental capacity in many ways when compared to an adult human.  they are both people.  consciousness is a continuum that evolves over our life span - it is NOT a binary.  whereas I would assert that personhood is a binary.  unless you're cool with someone being half a person, which I'd love to see someone honestly try to defend.  what you're doing is taking a continuous property like "consciousness" (and a poorly understood one at that) and trying to force it into a binary.  the problem is this property continues to evolve long after birth, which makes it extremely problematic as a benchmark.  weird that you're the one refusing to the look closely at the internal inconsistency of your own assertions when it comes to personhood, and then you accuse me of being focused on feelings, and not facts.  all I ever did was remain logically consistent, and apparently that made you angry.  i don't have to think magical properties about anything.  all i am saying is that if YOU are going to ascribe some thing called "personhood" to some humans and not to some other humans, you need to do it with logical consistency.  consciousness does not pass that test.  and if you can't find a logical answer and yet you still insist that you're right, what you're doing is actually illogical.  you're robbing some humans of personhood without a reason, thereby totally devaluing their life without a reason.  that is pretty evil.  look, i know it's fun to walk around with a reddit-tier, lowest-common-denominator understanding of personhood and think you know everything.  but sometimes you're just going to be wrong.  and that's ok.	1589190605.0	fq99mrq	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8vm0a	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq99mrq/

a5pzz	This has already happened and it’s why working class whites - the base of the Democratic Party for the preceding 70 years - voted mostly republican in 2016. Personally I’m not so sure I buy the “demographics is destiny” argument. Over the short term, in the present moment, obviously it’s true. However, once whites are actually a minority, what holds the “coalition of minorities” together? Since nothing meaningful binds them together in terms of ideology, It should be pretty easy for republicans to peel away groups that feel neglected in the hierarchical identity-based coalition (Asians will likely be the first to go, followed by 3rd & later generation hispanics, followed by gay white males, etc.)	1589166892.0	fq8idkg	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7a4h1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8idkg/

ewsjc	Honestly, it's an attempt to neatly summarize the complicated political realignment of the North & South with "racism" and for the Democratic party to pretend it's deeply racists roots was really just Republicans the whole time.   It's very effective propaganda for a generation of Americans who prefer an unnuanced view of shifting political allegiances, motivations, and strategy.  Written and elaborated on because of an Atwell quote and some very generalized "dog whistles".   There is also the small issue of the Southern Strategy being the dumbest fucking plan of all time. Why would a political party say "you know what would really give us more power? Fewer seats in the House and less that a 50/50 shot of winning a Presidential election!"   This isn't the whole story, but it sets the stage better than the "Southern strategy".  Republicans re-branded themselves following the open corruption of the Nixon administration as the "law and order" party and got a huge boost because of the turbulent late 70's 80's & early 90's. People wanted order in the streets because drugs were the great scourge of the time.   Bill Clinton wised up to this and ran a law and order campaign to win in the 90's (So did the democrats also adopt the southern strategy?) before that fell out of style and the Republicans re-branded again to the "fiscally conservative party" following Gingrich forcing Clinton over a barrel and into a balanced budget.   The rest is due, for the most part because the Party gave up on centralized power, and allowed the individuals candidates to be more defined regionally than by strict party dogma. This is evident in how Republicans    1. Continue to win in Blue strongholds like New York, NJ, California and Washington State.  2. They might be able to whip votes AGAINST the Democratic party, but they rarely fucking agree on anything when it's their time to vote FOR something.   You could point out wedge issues (guns, Jesus and abortion) but those are wedge issues for a reason, and defined by the radicals on both sides of the political spectrum. But again, their position on those issues is largely defined by their electorate.   I'm going to close with a challenge for you. Anytime someone tries to convince you of something, and that something plays to long dead stereotypes/biases; requires you to broadly assume the motivations, character and culture of people you don't know, and is largely based on the research conducted by think tanks hired to construct a narrative around their own re-branding.  Be a tiny bit fucking skeptical.	1589176665.0	fq8vfkd	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8hhcx	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8vfkd/

12dp88	Not at all. It would just take some non ideological but super popular figure like trump to push "trumpcare" That costs somewhat less and better in some specific tangible way and republicans would get behind it. Just look at the UK. The right there was against public healthcare until they suddenly weren't and now they are stronger in support of it but they are still boxed in by their history to support every little expansion of it because if they ever decide some new issue is too far they will get reminded of their past and called anti NHS. The only issue with that is that by now they convinced their own voters that NHS is good which the Republicans didn't yet.	1637555625.0	hllosxs	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8cw5m	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/hllosxs/

12l5g62	ZoomerRight sounds right up my alley, I'm so sick of the media calling gen Z the most progressive generation when that's just not true, most studies actually show the opposite, Gen-Z is the most conservative generation in the past gew generations,     I blame the media for confusing us with Millennials, especially since many other Zoomers also incorrectly think they're millennials.  But I think Gen-Z is more conservative than previous generations because we're seeing the end of many different rights movements, like gay rights, and while the generations before saw the hard fought battles for those rights, we just see a bunch of annoying assholes who have all the rights they want but are still bitching about it, I was a very sjw type when I was younger, but I grew more conservative when I realized that gaining the rights they wanted didn't make people happy, and I see a lot of my friends feeling the same as well, I think lots of Zoomers are more conservative than they let on, they're just afraid to show it, due to the ever growing presence of wrongthink.	1589142420.0	fq76ic2	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq6qm6m	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq76ic2/

I can't decide to kill you because "cOnScIoUsNeSs IsN't ReAlLy A tHiNg." Putting someone out of their misery is ending suffering, not reaching into their house, stabbing them, and crushing their skull with forceps while they lounge around developing and maturing with an entire life ahead of them. We don't even really do that in this country. We typically don't act until a person is a vegetable. Even in cases of mercifully pulling the plug on someone who is in a vegetative state, we require evidence and some kind of will and testament before we do so.

N/A	When it comes to taxation Europe is certainly more auth than the US, look at taxes in France or in the Nordic Countries for high income earners. If you earn 100.000 dollars per year on the US you lose 34% of it in taxes, in France 53% and in Finland 60%, and thats for Individuals, if you are talking about companies in the US Amazon doesn't even pay taxes. Yes, I get the fact that in theory they did not generate any profit in previous years because of investing, but still.  Diversity quotas are present in a lot of countries, they implemented one in my home country that makes it so that state run companies must have 1% of their workers be transgender even if they only make up 0.02% of the population. I am not aware of any of any diversity quotas in the US, but thats probably because I am a foreigner.   In terms of drivers licences I don't see that as a right or left question at all. In reality, If you are a libertarian you should be in favour of illegal immigration, at least economically, since they have lower wages and can be easily exploited.

Consciousness doesn't fucking matter to me. Stop bringing that up. The only thing worse than killing an unconscious human is killing a conscious human. An unconscious human is worth more than a conscious animal, whether they're a vegetable, in a coma, or unborn. Does the value of your life diminish if you can't speak up for yourself?   Humans have a social contract with each other. We have determined that we ALL as humans, have rights. You can't just pick and choose who has rights based on how you feel. I don't want people to be pregnant with a child they dont want, but killing an unborn child is a worse offense. Put the child up for adoption, and before you say that living as a foster child is wrong etc, I urge you to ask foster children if they'd rather have been aborted.

5ltof	For all your supposed expertise in the matter you evidently don't understand that body awareness is an initial stage of self awareness.   I'm also not really sure what you're trying to argue here. Are you in favor of killing babies because they don't recognize themselves in the mirror? Because that would absolutely be murder. Cognition happens in the cerebral cortex. When it fires up is when a being begins to become body aware. Because embryos and earlier fetuses do not have activity in their cerebral cortex they basically don't exist as lifeforms yet. They're living tissue with no consciousness attached. Basically the same as a brain dead person on life support.	1589153492.0	fq7w8sa	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7veje	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7w8sa/

1xx56e6j	As i elaborated on in my example, courts are one of the primary methods by which liberties have been eroded. Various liberties have been, in essence redefined out of existence  “Free speech” has been redefined as “heavily restricted speech”  “Shall not be infringed” has been redefined as “it’s actually cool and good to broadly infringe”  “Probable cause” has been redefined as “improbable cause”   And more. Instead of providing an iota of counterargument, you start acting like a patronizing cunt and dismissing my claim, 0 evidence. Argumentum ad lapidem  > Add the fact that you then claimed those same evil laws are an "insignificant deterrent" to drug us, and I have to withdraw from arguing with a fool.  Me: claims that western drug laws are an insignificant deterrent from drugs.

5h8cxmd7	Funny to me at least, youd actually probably have the opposite problem. People would think you're a cop and not sell to you. I've had that problem on the rare occasion I did have to venture out instead of getting delivery, but without makeup I showed track marks.   A couple google searchs to find a decent area (news stories, and ironically enough crime tracker lol), and you're good to go. Also, in places like NYC, chicago where I am, and most other big cities, it pretty unlikely you'll get straight up mugged in those areas during the day. Dealers in high traffic areas crack down on that type of shit because it affects their buisness. Most people there just go about their day. Obviously it's still not a super safe but most people dont have issues. Most likely you'll get ripped off with bunk product if you don't know what red flags to look for. Also, if you're going into the hood by yourself there's a high probability you're already using.  I put money on three tries for someone who hasn't done it though to be successful. Undercover cops arent a problem at all, but most people look out of place there if they dont live there or a similar area, so theres a higher chance of getting stopped and searched, 4th amendment rights dont really matter in those areas.   Even without experience it's surprisingly easy to buy heroin in the US and even France from my experience. I do speak french though. Need some street smarts but that's really it. That's why I see laws doing no good, again akin to the large majority of gun laws. I do completely understand your thought process though. It's just people don't really look into it ever.	1589172326.0	fq8pzsu	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8g3jm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8pzsu/

h2fpe	>that's why we win. because we've brainwashed gullible fools such as yourself into thinking the left is composed of literal communists.  You misunderstand. I'm going to vote democrat no matter what; as a centrist, I'm bound to be pragmatic and always make an effort to vote for the lesser evil. (at least, while I can still vote, anyways.) This puts me in league with the sane, moderate democrats.

Which is, indeed, how you "win" , so you're still right on that front.  Luckily, as a centrist and a pragmatist, I'm also the kind of person who prepares for worst case scenarios, so I've built up and am building up the financial resources to weather crisises like this one, so luckily I'll still outperform dogmatic ideologues from either side of the aisle, on average, anyways.	1589162254.0	fq8b5vf	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq89jko	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8b5vf/

5on2xfi0	In America, it'd be called "progresive" but with some specificities, such as greater focus on digital issues.  Pirate ideology has originated in opposition to overly restrictive copyright laws. As the name suggests, it was closely linked with software and intellectual property law, where Pirates would oppose too much appropriation and corporate power, copyright, draconian anti-piracy laws, patent abuse and patent squatting/hoarding etc. Quite a few of the Pirate Party politicians in CZ are actual software engineers and computer scientists.  They kept this original focus, but now the ideology is much broader and includes the classic liberal left causes like environmentalism, anti-climatechangeism, anti-discrimination, gender equality and minority and immigrant rights. They support marijuana legalization and some of their top representatives attend the legalization marches. They tend to be heavily pro-EU and in favor of further integration.  And a random nugget from their party newspaper that illustrates their ideology in a nutshell:  > (...) focusing on the risk of discrimination by AI. Patrick was coordinating the second panel, where he emphasised that discrimination through automated systems is nothing new; in fact, empirical studies show the opposite. It is therefore more important than ever to focus on the issue more deeply and weigh all political solutions.  https://european-pirateparty.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Netwletter.pdf	1589146204.0	fq7gtgo	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq73sl7	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7gtgo/

But the basis of how and why I do is different enough that I don't really consider myself one of them. Even among the different varieties of "standard" types of leftist, none of them are really close enough for there to be big circles of what I would consider "my people."  Which is ironic of course, because most of the people I am closest with resemble me somewhat. Yet we find ourselves at a loss to have language to describe ourselves with.

v3054	Yeah that's my hangup on my abortion stance. I am for allowing abortion to a certain point, but I 100% see the (secular) reasoning for the anti-abortion stance, and I respect it.  I wish liberals would try to at least see and understand conservatives' point of view and stop constantly building strawmen. Conservatives don't want to "control all women" in the same way that liberals don't want to murder babies en masse. They simply believe that human life begins at conception and so view ending that life as murder, which is a morally consistent view even for a non-religious person.  I would like to believe that a compromise could be found by pursuing policies which reduce the amount of abortions by preventing unwanted pregnancies from occurring in the first place. We also (in the US) need a more robust system to care for unwanted children who are born and put up for adoption/put into foster care. The instability of our foster system sometimes produces some pretty fucked up people.	1589150097.0	fq7qej0	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7cut4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7qej0/

N/A	Liberty is more reasonable than morality. Liberty arguments are almost always stronger than moral arguments even when arguing for the same thing. Liberty can be a bit abstract but it's nowhere near as flimsy as morality. Two people can have 100% opposite views on something based on their own morals. Beliefs about liberty can only do that in a few issues.   Also I should clarify that I don't think morality has no value. It does. I just don't think such a personal thing should be used to make laws that effect everybody. Moral arguments for laws are in the same boat as religious arguments for laws, and most first world countries separated church and government long ago for a good reason.	1589155555.0	fq7zqvi	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7vlo1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7zqvi/

Many animals have body awareness and no self awareness.   I'm not arguing for killing anyone. Might want to reread again. Perhaps you should mention that point to those who justify abortion with the lack of self awareness babies have.  As for fetuses not existing as lifeforms because they lack some activity in their brain, you might want to speak to a biologist. Life isn't defined by having a fully functioning human brain.	1589165146.0	fq8foi5	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7w8sa	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8foi5/
4jjytbpd	a human-shaped configuration of proteins?  that's just an absurd way to describe a human.  it's certainly a human - that much is unequivocally true.  what you're saying is because this human's organs haven't developed yet, that makes it somehow inhuman?  are teenagers inhuman because their wisdom teeth haven't grown in yet?  no.  what about if someone has their appendix taken out, are they inhuman?  you're talking about personhood, not actually being a human.  people seem obsessed with not only denying personhood of the unborn, but denying the fact that they're human beings which is really not a gray area at all any more.  we KNOW it's a human, beginning at fertilization.  this has been known for a long time now - to deny that is to deny science.	1589197565.0	fq9gjww	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8yliz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9gjww/

4jjytbpd	So seeing, and hearing, and feeling emotions is what makes someone a person now?  You're just pivoting around to various different definitions of what makes a person a person whenever you're challenged.  Is it consciousness or is it having emotions, is it our sight and hearing?  Pick something.  Be precise.  And no, a human being begins at fertilization, not before and not after - when a human being is created, actions had already led up to its creation and it will develop into an infant provided you don't kill it or it dies spontaneously...the same as with other humans going to their next stage of life.  You seem to have a marked lack of understanding of basic biology and are very wishy washy on the subject of personhood to the point that you actually have no state-able view.  Maybe you need to look a little more deeply into this.  I'm not going to flair up so you can try and dismiss my points by making some snarky remark about my politics.

The problem with getting every minority group to vote for you is that they all hate each other. There's core value sets that are far harder to pivot than current policy positions.

N/A	They aren't trying to answer that question, and that isn't the question I'm asking. It would help you if you understood the debate that actually exists instead of the one you are imagining.   And literally, they never had to answer that question, because the entire premise of the founding documents was that every human being is equal....and we fought wars to make certain that our constitution reflected that fact.   The Founders never bothered answering the question of when a fetus becomes a human, and that is likely because they felt it was obvious. Constitutional protections are not limited to citizens, though only citizens have certain functions within our system. You still can't murder a foreigner, because they are human beings. You still can't decide for some poor downtrodden immigrant on the verge of death that their life must mercifully end. Because all human beings are born with natural "god given" rights, and one of those rights is explicitly stated....life.  So.... While a fetus is unborn, if any evidence of any sort of consciousness emerges, at that point aborting them is legally murder and there is no newfangled cockamamie argument that will ever change that fact, because it is OBVIOUSLY a human being with a level of consciousness and a right to life.  Until then, constitutionally, the government has no business making the call because there is not enough specific legal material, and it should be left up to the mother.	1589293866.0	fqdoosn	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fqcpo70	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqdoosn/

3pqaxquz	Pain is definitely more consistent because it is expected to happen after X weeks of pregnancy, but viability varies greatly by time and place (Mississippi hospital vs New York hospital).  Why is it wrong to legislate based on the safest bet? Just because an issue is polarized doesn't mean that both sides are correct and we ought to find a compromise. One side can be correct.  Imagine there are 3 wood boxes with 0 to 3 alive people in the boxes. Someone has a gun, and they know there may be people in each box. Some people think there are 0 people in the boxes, so shooting any are okay. Some people think only box 3 has a person, so you can shoot box 1 or 2. Some people think that box 2 and 3 has a person. And some people think that all 3 have a person.

Nowhere at all did I say that people with limited rights can be executed. I can't even begin to see where the hell you got such an idea, but it almost looks like you tried to reverse the logic and committed a hasty generalization fallacy or something.  Edit: Or maybe you misunderstood my test. I wasn't saying "deprivation of other rights supports deprivation of the right to life", I was saying that we don't see fetuses as distinct human loves in the first place and the lack of other considerations as a result of that supports the view that they have no right to life.	1589172760.0	fq8qk77	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8iqps	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8qk77/

4ha3s	I know you put a lot of time into writing all that and I’m sorry if you don’t feel like I’m taking your words seriously enough but when you describe the Southern Strategy from the offset as:  > "you know what would really give us more power? Fewer seats in the House and less that a 50/50 shot of winning a Presidential election!"  it’s hard for me to draw the connections between your opinion on this weird strawman and any of the objective facts. We *know* Barry Goldwater campaigned in the south on his opposition to the 1964 civil rights act and we *know* that he won exclusively southern states in what was a political upset of the voting norms preceding that.   *Somehow* the Democratic Party went from the party of the KKK to the first black president. *Somehow* the Republican Party has gone from the party of Lincoln to the party that gets KKK endorsements. That’s only a fraction of the bigger picture in American politics but those are some big transformations worth talking about.   When you tell me that this transformation was just a coincidence of other economic and political factors and nobody was actually trying to court the racist voters it just sounds like revisionist Civil War history to me so I’m sorry if I lumped you in with a crowd you’re no part of.   I asked you if it was disinformation because I *was* skeptical of my own beliefs and I wanted to know if you had any facts that should change my mind. You then assumed an ass out of me and told me that I should “be a tiny bit fucking skeptical” like I hadn’t just demonstrated that I was and you knew better than me. I *guessed* that you might be a revisionist and now you’re  the indignant one.    ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯	1589224276.0	fqas0ho	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fqalpir	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqas0ho/

h1iih	I guess we have different definitions/interpretations of socialism, then. I tend to see socialism as inherently anti-state (strictly speaking it involves workers owning the means of production, which I see as being more towards anarchy than authoritarianism); at least in the most viable way of it being achieved nowadays.  Typically I view authoritarian 'socialism' as just a gateway/transition period towards communism.

N/A	Now try to think about the fruits of an action. Sex is an act which births life; what is born from homosexual acts, pedophilic acts, or sterile acts? Why has deviant sexual activity been shunned or criminalized since civil societies' conception?  Do your actions effect others in your society? If you cut yourself when you're alone, does that have an impact on others? If you beat your wife and that's her fetish, is that so bad? If you sodomize a child, and they cope by developing as a homosexual, is that immoral?  The Socratic method can help onlookers develop themselves, but it's not really intended for you as someone who sees pornography or homosexuality as moral or in any way the same as procreative sex.	1589175825.0	fq8uf2s	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8sdaz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8uf2s/

N/A	"Human rights" are God-given and enforced by the state. However there is no "human right" to shove shit up your or your friends' asshole. Sodomy is a crime against nature.  Also, nazis, KKK, and evil people like that want to kill people because they see them as a plague on society, not because they're "born different". You'll notice that they don't exactly go around calling for the extermination of productive, God-fearing, high IQ, law-abiding citizens.

N/A	>Arbitrarily applying value to an individual's freedom is the same as arbitrarily applying value to an individual's life.  First off that's not what I am comparing. I am comparing liberty arguments to moral arguments. Valuing somebody's life isn't an argument since you can value somebody's life for moral reasons or any other number of reasons.   Secondly, yes I agree they are both arbitrary, however more people uniformly value liberty than value a specific moral opinion. People are happier when they have liberties. This is something that is widespread and most people would agree with. You are less likely to find a moral opinion that is that widespread or universal. Because morals aren't universal.   >If erring to the side of liberty was not a moral system and was instead definitively the correct decision always, murder would be fine.  This is what I don't get about you kinds of moral knight people. You think if we didn't use moral reasoning we'd all be fucking serial killers, because apparently morals and jesus are the only thing that stop us from killing each other. Murder is illegal because if you want to live in a safe society you cannot allow murder. It is about *safety* not morals. You can see this very clearly when places that outlaw murder allow capital punishment or frequent lethal force from law enforcement.	1589157115.0	fq82exj	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq80w84	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq82exj/

3g6jg1kv	Religious vs spiritual is what you are missing here. Spiritual people arent crazy. Have a relationship with whatever creator you want to believe in, cool. Im spiritual. I have my beliefs in the everything that arent important to anyone else, and i definitely wouldnt let them control what I believe should be made illegal in a country of millions and millions of other people than me because it literally will never ever ever ever affect me or you unless we have abortions. Ever. In no way.  People who join and let organized religion control their thoughts and lives and morals (the people against abortion) are crazy. Very simple.

77t9i	It has absolutely nothing to do with morality. Sex is not sacred solely because is is a form of reproduction.  If you believe this and you take this staunch a stance, then for the sake of conviction I assume that you never have sex for pleasure or rather without the intention of creating a child. God forbid you masturbate.  I'm going to take a swing and guess you've never had sex. I do not mean this as an insult. It literally does not matter. However, I used to hold similar beliefs to what you're saying here. That was of course before I had sex.  Religious values and moral values are two completely different things. It's totally fine to form morals based on your religious beliefs, but it is a complete fallacy to assume that they cannot be derived any other way. The Old Testament was extremely accepting of the concept of slavery. This is an outdated concept on today's society. Most (I'd hope to say all) Judeo-Christian religions have since adapted their beliefs to reconcile the fact that slavery is no longer considered a moral concept. There are numerous other examples of adaptation--not even simply from the Old Testament.  If you have a problem with homosexual relationships or pornography then don't partake. Move on and try to build a life that is free of it. Who cares. Do not think to impose your own views on others because if the tables were turned, you would not hold the same position.	1589176637.0	fq8vedb	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8uf2s	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8vedb/

N/A	I do not agree at all with what I am writing, I am an orthodox Marxist. I am just trying to get in what I consider to be an Ancap's shoes in order to discuss your beliefs. Although, I must admit that I am pretty horrible at it most of the time since I have 0 empathy.  First off, its already happening and people just don't care. People will still end up buying goods from shady producers if the price is cheap or if the product is good enough, which means that employers are incentivized to employ the lowest bidder, which usually is people from third world countries. Sometimes they go one step beyond and just outright move their factory to one.  Secondly, my point there not racist at all, it is just what generally happens with illegal immigration. Im not arguing that illegal immigrants must take shitty jobs that no one wants due to some racial superiority reason. In fact, I'm from Latin America, the ones who generally get those shitty jobs. The reality is that people who illegally immigrate are in a more dire situation than the average citizen and therefore more willing to do more degrading jobs for cheaper.  Lastly, even though illegal immigrants funnel what little is left to their home countries its still not nearly as much as the amount funneled by wealthy individuals with accounts in the Cayman Islands. Secondly, If you want to keep your job as a wage slave then you must be better than the competition, if you are a capitalist you must believe that it's not fair for wages to be artificially raised due to scarcity of labour, and that unemployment is necessary in order to fuel the reserve army of labour.	1589155601.0	fq7ztp4	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7x5fk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7ztp4/

3pqaxquz	First of all, flair up.  Second, legislating or determining violence is not socialism. Socialism is an economic system where the workers own the means of production. Communism is a top-down version of socialism. Maybe you are thinking of authoritarianism?   Abortion presents a unique problem. For people with epilepsy or nut allergies, we can ask them or they can avoid strobe lights and peanut butter. Most video games have epilepsy warnings and most food labels have warnings for this reason. I think these would still exist with a limited or no government. With abortion and this theoretical box example where you aren't allowed to ask, we really don't know if they are a person for the first X weeks and they are helpless to it.  Maybe you can think of a more extreme example.  Are you arguing it should be legal to light 2 boxes on fire if you have any reason to believe there are people in the boxes?	1589197117.0	fq9g2d5	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8ut09	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9g2d5/

5ltof	>Yeah they shouldn't have let him on the debate stage but there's no one giving anyone permission to run.  Precisely what I said, only worded poorly because I just woke up. So you agree that they allowed Bloomberg in specifically to draw criticism away from Biden because he's AuthRight and therefore was being constantly attacked, fairly, by his compass opposites. Bloomberg, afraid at the prospect of a progressive government, approached them with the idea that he could run to draw criticism away from Biden in debates because obviously the only target more enticing to progressives than an AuthRight masquerading as a leftist is a billionaire getting preferential treatment.  They all started to drop out at once. Coasting into Super Tuesday and seeing how much of the vote they get literally wouldn't cost them any more money. Why would they stubbornly dedicate a year of their lives to this race, while consistently barely having a presence in the polls, just to quit right before the first obstacle that could make or break a campaign? Their campaigns were already broken, they had nothing to lose. You have to be blind not see the coordination going on there.  And again, it's not illegal. It's just highly manipulative and very authoritarian for the establishment to elevate one candidate above the others. But I think I'm wasting my time with you because there are none so blind as those who will not see.	1589209780.0	fq9yzf2	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq9wwmg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq9yzf2/

N/A	You don't think that people with 100k+ debt are slaves? You can change the vernacular but it doesn't change the act. I'd rather people treated their slaves well like the Bible advocated than leaving them in the gutter to die. This is a contrast you should think about: people 100+ years ago didn't die of opiates in the gutter en masse. Thats a recent, cosmopolitan invention. Black families under legal slavery had a more cohesive family unit and drastically higher marriage rates. And this was while they were being physically separated and sold to other plantations.  I have had sex outside of wedlock but I'm honest and coherent enough to realize it was a mistake I won't do again. That doesn't exactly happen with homosexuals or beastiality or incest/take your pick of deviancy. I would absolutely impose this value on my family and those I love because I care about and want the best for them.

N/A	I'm referring to the social aspects associated with those, but yeah pretty much just hard authoritarianism focused on individual happiness and consideration.   That's this exact kind of dismissiveness, "oh they can just avoid it" straight up doesn't work. Schools have tables that explicitly ban peanut butter, and products are supposed to be labeled, but that doesn't help with  contamination, laziness, accidents, etc. I have celiac, so I'm well aware of the feeling of getting something in your system that wasn't supposed to be there, and of course celiac isn't lethal thankfully, but some allergies can be, and if we actually wanted to protect people when we can't ask if something is clear of whatever their allergy is, we'd do a lot more.   Happily, when you have someone in a  brain dead or completely unresponsive coma, with that approach, you would always commit resources to keeping their body alive as long as possible, because we can't be sure if they can feel or hear anything, or if they could recover, or if they have any sense of self etc, and we can't ask. If you also support that then at least you're consistent, but in my eyes, that's a terrible approach, because you end up spending way more resources on people who will almost never have any meaning in it, which harms people who could actually benefit from those resources. You have to draw a line at some point. That's what I'm arguing, I'm not claiming that you should be able to abort a kid the second before you go into labor, but at the point where they biologically can't or dont' seem to be able to think or sense pain or have a sense of self or anything like that, why not.  This is personal bias, but I have a ton of friends with abusive or otherwise horrible parents who've had their lives absolutely ruined by them, people should never have a kid when they don't want a kid. I'm glad they were born and exist, cause I care about them, but it creates so much suffering, and suicidal people.   No, I'm arguing that not providing support to people in situations where they would die or horribly suffer is in the same wheelhouse. And that of course depends on what you consider support, and what situations you consider to be those situations.	1589233056.0	fqb9qmz	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq9g2d5	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqb9qmz/

1ejzb1oz	On a philosophical level, it’s not wise going toward either position hard. Nor is it easy to find the logical synthesis.    Currently we have a legal system that defines whether the fetus is or isn’t human by the volition/perception of the mother.  If she wants to carry to full term, and is intentionally hit in the stomach by someone and the child dies, it is often considered a homicide (murder of a *homo sapien* aka *human*). And yet if the mother had on the next day decided to abort the fetus, then it was *not a human*.     That system doesn’t seem fully coherent, as humanity isn’t normally defined by the volition/perception of others to consider you or I as *human*... or else racism would be fine, because their humanity is based on your perception of them.  It’s a tough topic. The science simply can’t supersede the philosophy, as we are discussing labels not experimentally provable assertions.	1589168499.0	fq8krcy	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8jxgb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8krcy/

3pqaxquz	I definitely have empathy for people who have unique death-imposing threats like nut allergies. I had several friends in high school with nut allergies. As difficult as it must be, they do have *some* agency, whereas a fetus has no agency. Preventing incidental or accidental death is different than preventing murder.  Keeping people alive is what we do today as I understand it. If someone is rushed to an ER and requires life-saving surgery it is performed regardless of the ability to pay. A never-ending coma is an interesting argument, but I don't know if it is quite the same. With a fetus, we don't know at any given point where the fetus is actually a person, but we do know it will become a person within a predictable 9-month period. I think the probability plus the knowledge that it will be a person in 9-months makes it different than a person in a coma who may or may not be awake again. I'll have to think about this farther.  Interestingly I came across this story  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/world/middleeast/woman-coma-27-years.amp.html  This woman lived for 27 years in a coma. I had no idea it could be so long.  I agree that we need better parenting, but abortion is an unnecessary component to reducing the number of bad parents. The key problem is that people's personal and interpersonal values are misplaced. I know that fixing that isn't a sexy task, but I believe it's true. I believe that if people truly understood and work on their own moral principles and ethics, they would do more right things even in more dire circumstances.  For instance, it's true that relative and absolute poverty, biological and personality differences, and location correlate with crime. But fundamentally, in my opinion, crime is due to misplaced values of self over the rights and well-being of others they interact with, and due to misplaced values of short-term vs long-term rewards.	1589237652.0	fqbikrr	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fqb9qmz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqbikrr/

N/A	I mean I’m open to the idea of pegging if that’s what you want. My political views, since you’re so interested are the following: I don’t think gay marriage should be legal, I don’t think abortion should be legal, BUT I also don’t think my opinion should hold any weight at all as neither of those things effect my life. I think trumps a moron, Hillary was trash, and Biden probably did it.  Bernie sanders was a solid option, but regardless of Votes he wouldn’t have won. The us is in a state of decline because we are greedy, fat, and stupid, and the general vibe of things sees that trend only continuing on.  I think food stamps and welfare are Just fine, and I think elected officials should be drug tested if their state also requires drug testing for majority of public jobs. I’d also like to see actual accountability for both sides doing things would would get me thrown in jail for life.  I wouldn’t consider myself lib or left because of my views on abortion and marriage, however I wouldn’t consider myself conservative because I’m smart enough to realize my opinions should never run a country, and if the majority want those things, well that’s just fine.

7baqk	Yeah, alright. Secular isn’t a core part of it, though, the old bleeding heart liberal Christians also overlapped into this. The guy who wrote the pledge of allegiance especially comes to mind.   Honestly excluding these people via identity politics is probably the main reason the modern progressive left hasn’t caught on. Just add a couple shakes of racism, sexism, and eugenics and we’d get back a decent chunk of the modern Republican base, which is careening wildly authoritarian anyway, so obviously that’s not a dealbreaker for them. But that’s unthinkable to the modern left, a decent chunk of which would rather compromise economically before socially, but no one *really* wants economic compromise, so reaching out that way just leaves everyone disappointed.	1589170623.0	fq8nqn8	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7x70s	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8nqn8/
166my5u7	Dude, James Wilson was very anti-abortion.   “With consistency, beautiful and undeviating, human life, from its commencement to its close, is protected by the common law. In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb. By the law, life is protected not only from immediate destruction, but from every degree of actual violence, and, in some cases, from every degree of danger.”   The Above quote is taken from one of Founder James Wilson’s lectures to his law students. The founders were quite conservative on the notion of abortions, even writing laws that continued to criminalize the act. If you don’t believe me look up William Waller Hening’s ( a man who was a contemporary of Founder Jefferson and codified Virginia laws based on Founder Jefferson’s notes) “The New Virginia Justice, Comprising the Office and Authority of a Justice of the Peace, in the Commonwealth of Virginia” While, yes the Founders were not very religious, it still profound impacted their personal philosophy.	1589151715.0	fq7t7oz	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7n2n4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7t7oz/

It’s become difficult to find academic studies on anything that don’t have a woke vibe to them, and not just in the social sciences.  That makes people become reactionary, when their general intuition is entirely delegitimized by the public discourse.   I think academia and the media would do well to become a bit more self-aware of their biases/paradigms, and take a more empirical stance as a means of both renewing the reputation of scholastic rigor and calming the impending storm.	1589174140.0	fq8sc0w	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq8nqn8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq8sc0w/
czciohr	I literally quoted that exact quote and explained why it supports a "second-trimester abortion" viewpoint.  you:  >“With consistency, beautiful and undeviating, human life, from its commencement to its close, is protected by the common law. **In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb.** By the law, life is protected not only from immediate destruction, but from every degree of actual violence, and, in some cases, from every degree of danger.”  Me:  >“In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb.”  Stirring does not take place until 14 weeks into pregnancy at the earliest, and usually as late as 16 weeks.  The Virginia Laws you mention categorize using abortifacients **after stirring** as a misdemeanor.  And again, this is one of the multiple founding fathers. The idea that they, as a whole, were stringently anti-abortion, has no historicity.	1589152069.0	fq7ttmj	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq7t7oz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq7ttmj/
352sd8qt	I see you don’t know anything about constitutional law. The 4th amendment protects you from unreasonable searches and seizures. The right to privacy is a far broader right that was imputed via the due process clause of the 14th amendment, which protects life, liberty (the important one here), and property. The Court has repeatedly held that the right to privacy is implicit in the definition of liberty. It’s an entirely different right than the 4th amendment.  I’m not going to continue to try to have a conversation about the constitution with someone who thinks the right to privacy is the same as the right to be from unreasonable searches and seizures.	1589157414.0	fq82xkr	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fq820a7	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fq82xkr/
130cjr	>You typed it out before I could  And what rallying cry would you be using during your rebellion? That the city-folk are imposing tyranny upon the morally upstanding rural-folk? You see that by rebelling against the system I described, you admit that the status quo is tyranny and that urban dwellers would be justified in rising up against you to fight for their political rights. In doing so, you accept that your protestations of the moral inferiority of the urbanites is pure hypocrisy. By your own definition, you are a supporter of tyranny, who will defend your rights to oppress others with violence. So, what you really believe in is not a moral ideal - such as Christianity or traditional values, but moral relativism.

4wb5pkm5	Ok one, being in a serious addiction does create a servant master relationship either to the drug dealer you didnt refute that.   Two my main point of drug addiction is inherently unfree and constrains your life has yet to be refuted. You openly said that it needs large amounts of willpower to control. Why would you say that if it isn’t absurdly hard to take over. All you have to do is use absurd amounts of money and you are no longer a slave. You have yet to refute this point.   Three i have not touched the positive effects of drugs because that is not the discussion, what the positive effects it may have are not what i am inherently talking about. I am talking about the consequences they may have.   Four just because you are free to enter slavery does not mean it should be allowed.   Five. All you have said so far is “ i am right you are wrong” on every point above. Then proceed to name calling. If you can definitively state why i am wrong other than “hypocrisy” and “stop being an idiot so science” then i will conceide but you cant seem to get your emotions in order. Smooth brain problems i guess.   My main point still stands drugs inherently debilitate life, they by nature rewire your brain into creating a dependency, they make it so you can not live your life with ought it, this is what dealers want. They don’t care about you, they’ll sell to you as long as you make them money. This is my thesis prove it wrong and dont go on about other conservative talking points because you cant even handle your own ideology don’t criticize others.	1589250164.0	fqc4va2	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fqagbs6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fqc4va2/

smrapiv	Right, and I asked where that was viable? The same reason why Bernie Sanders didn’t win the primary is the same reason why Libertarians never gain much steam. Their ideas don’t resonate with Americans. Libertarian ideas and socialist ideas are great and helpful, but the US doesn’t see that yet. We’re in our conservative infancy as a country.

16x9fp	You're speaking as though all drugs are the same thing. Sure stims, cannabinoids, opioids, alcohol, etc... are addictive, but there are plenty of drugs that aren't. Psychedelics in fact have shown promise as an effective treatment for addiction to drugs. I think people should have the freedom to do drugs if they want to, as a little acid or mdma every couple of months completely obliterates my depression/anxiety issues.	1592700658.0	fvhrxwr	t3_gh4aq4	t1_fqc4va2	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/gh4aq4/small_welfare_state_small_government/fvhrxwr/

mapo1	To be honest he kinda has a point. I hate that I have to agree with him but class divided have become increasingly large and are becoming a stronger divide than any racial lines we try to draw. That said, Tucker is failing to acknowledge that class lines and racial lines are strongly correlated for to many racist policies put in place by the government and corporations. These policies which are at the root of this problem are the same ones the Trump administration supports.  Also with all his talk of rich elites in the media brainwashing people it's a little ironic given the fact he inherited millions from his step-mom's TV dinner business and he is himself an elitist doing the bidding of his even richer bosses at Fox News.	1586330281.0	fmrp15o	t3_fwnwft	t3_fwnwft	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrp15o/

y3re6	Carlson is a nationalist first, traditionalist second, social conservative third, and populist last. He was once partially libertarian, but has since changed his populist stance into also economic populism.  This seems to have developed not long after Trump became President, and it is hard to know if he just sucked Trump's dick so hard that he absorbed Trump's neo-liberal (or fascist?) economic policies combined with his love of flexing over the markets, or if he was in hiding all this time, and trying to lay low because he thought the Tea Party pseudo-libertarianism was going places.  If we went full fascist tomorrow this fucker is in. Also, if we went full Stalin-style tankie communist tomorrow, he may put up some fight at first, but by week 4 this fucker will also be in. This guy just wants to feel like his country is the bestest ever, have the ability to flex that on other countries, and, most importantly, to feel controlled.	1586325452.0	fmrjvvm	t3_fwnwft	t3_fwnwft	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrjvvm/

shuz6m3	As a leftist I also believe that the most powerful in this country are putting people against each other based on race. What Carlson is saying here hasn’t fully realized the issue however, he’s saying that these elites are accusing people of being racist in order to incite racial division. That just doesn’t make sense to me. What I see is an elite class funding media that draws young white men deeper into racist conspiracies using dog whistles and innocent sounding but sinisterly motivated talking points. The alt right pipeline as it is often referred to by leftist leads vulnerable young men through a series of beliefs, often at their beginning accurate criticism of the modern world be it the problems of liberal democracy, or late stage capitalism, or dumb shit that radical feminists say. These base truths are then used to draw conclusions about culture, often that minority groups are asking for or being given more privileges then working class white people. This logic caries through painting an abrasive image of the left. Then through jokes and narrow statistics these young men are drawn closer into beliefs about groups and races of people, encouraging maybe not an outright racial hierarchy but certainly a belief that their are inherent differences between the races. Racialism. Over time though members are drawn closer and brought to believe in the outright separation of races or later into belief in the validity of an ethnostate. Conspiracy theories are circulated in alt right groups such as the great replacement. The modern American right consists of various levels of racialism and racism that are often on close communication. A conservative radio host might have as a guest a racialist book author, thus introducing his audience to those ideas further indoctrinating some of them. That same author might write about a facist figure such as Hitler, disavowing the uglier parts of his politics while justifying others. This means that some of his audience will be introduced to these ideas and some of those indoctrinated into a facist mindset. What’s generally at the center of the alt right are ideas like “the Jewish question” offering for example the idea that the Jews are behind conspiracies like the great replacement but also that they are the driving force behind the problems of late stage capitalism. My point is, the right either online or in media will often use true statements and a leap in logic to justify untrue conclusions. I see this here.

ks527	Tucker gets a lot shit because he will say something incredibly stupid on his show every 4-6 months, but between then, he's a very grounded, reasonable, and morally and ideologically consistent commentator. Can't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The people who bash him don't actually know what he says or what he stands for. They just get a Young Turks (shutters) soundbite... They just think he's some Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity clone. He's not -- like at all. He truly says whatever he wants to and believes in, not what Fox tells him to. His ratings are insane and he's powerful enough to go above his own network's head.  But yeah, Tucker is one of the most pro-worker political commentators on a mainstream American show. Whether MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, etc. He cares about people's livelihoods and has done some good podcasts with Adam Carolla on the issues of automation, globalism, workers losing their worth, livelihood, etc.  &#x200B;  He's really an alright, smart guy.	1586305049.0	fmqqrjp	t3_fwnwft	t3_fwnwft	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqqrjp/

nyx3x	He actually does this more than one would expect. One of his biggest talking points is how the elites are using globalization and technology to find cheaper and cheaper forms of labor, leaving many areas that use to rely on such industries like manufacturing and textiles to slowly die from stagnation. He even advocates for protectionism and hostility towards corporotocracy for exploiting American labor. I disagree with a lot of his opinions, but he is not as far to the right as most think. He represents Midwestern conservatism that one would find in Michigan or Ohio more than anything else.	1586295274.0	fmq99er	t3_fwnwft	t3_fwnwft	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq99er/

So here it is in order, the "left msm" incites racial disparities to distract from class issues, and the "right msm" complains about the left pointing out racial things to incite the right to get angry and to "own the libs".   He made a good point about the class warfare things and the distraction from it by msm.

N/A	I don't think he's a commie. Most of you fools just don't know what an authoritarian is. It's a monster. "Dont trust the government and the powerful" isnt an authoritarian ideal - y'all are just retarded, but it's ok  These sound like my talking points. Bread and circuses. Anything to keep you from looking at Congress and how many bribes they take.  Get you snipe hunting for Nazis, which by and large don't exist.   Then the other side gets you snipe hunting for globalists and SJWs and want you scared of climate change policy.   I would say Tucker is a patriot, except I know all the other things he has said 🤣   They don't want you thinking about unions, they don't want you thinking about how much in common you got, they don't want you to think of your countrymen as your brothers and sisters.   The division is false.

N/A	Social conservatives are sometimes middle of the road or left on economics, you’d be surprised. They do TEND to lean capitalist but that’s only cause we are mostly libright converts.  Personally I just want conservative social values again and economics and government control don’t come into the equation much anymore.

She’s totally unsympathetic, yet he’s not looking for any, nor making excuses for what he was party to, rather sadly just owning it.   He’s a true shitball who’s book I’ll read if I find it bootlegged on the internet for free.

You’re either a libertarian zealot controlled by the banks, yammering on about entrepreneurship and how we need to cut entitlements, or worse, you’re some decadent trust fund socialist who wants to ban passenger cars and give Medicaid to illegal aliens. There isn’t a caucus that represents where most Americans actually are: nationalist on economics, fairly traditional on the social issues. Imagine a politician who wanted to make your healthcare cheaper, but wasn’t ghoulishly excited about partial birth abortion. Imagine someone who genuinely respected the nuclear family, and sympathized with the culture of rural America, but at the same time was willing to take your side against rapacious credit card companies bleeding you dry at 35 percent interest. Would you vote for someone like that? Yet that candidate is the opposite of pretty much everyone currently serving in congress. Our leadership class remains resolutely libertarian: committed to the rhetoric of markets when it serves them; utterly libertine on questions of culture. Republicans will lecture you about how payday loan scams are a critical part of a market economy. Then they’ll work to make it easier for your kids to smoke weed because, hey, freedom. Democrats will nod in total agreement. They’re on the same page."

hbzko	Tucker is a fascinating character.   From interviews I’ve heard with him it seems that his political philosophy is something like this: he understands he is a rich elite, he grew up wealthy, married wealthy, and is personally wealthy. He also understands that poor people, have power in their numbers. He understands that if you don’t give the dog a bone it’s going to bite your hand eventually. He sees that the elites have oppressed the common man.   Now this is where he gets confusing and where the really maliciousness of Tucker comes in. As you will see with this clip, I assume it ended with him blaming the rich coastal elites IE democrats.   In many ways he isn’t wrong. The DNC is guilty of a lot of what he says, but it’s absurd to not mention the fact that the GOP does this as well, and pretty clearly to a larger extent.   Because tucker has a show, and it’s an entertainment show that relies on viewer, he has decided to basically speak about many things like Bernie sanders but then turn it around and say, actually this is the democrats who are doing this.   Now to be fair, he is probably one of the more critical fox heads regarding the trump admin. But he never really directly calls the president out. It’s always the Republican Congress  or corrupt people that have betrayed trump, which he then ties to the elites which have already been engrained in his viewers as democrats.   If you want to understand more of this ideology, sagar enjeti shares the core beliefs but his show isn’t as ideologically driven so he is able to express it without all the partisan bullshit surrounding it.   If the Republican Party starts to listen to these types of people more, they will become much more formittable. Someone actually being able to articulate the right wing populism that trump ignited, but has still never really cemented because he doesn’t fully grasp what he is getting at.   How do I know trump doesn’t get it? Well he has said so himself. He has said that during his rallies he basically just throws random stuff out and sees how it plays and then based on the audience reaction he keeps going or stops that train of thought. This is what trump is the best at, reading his crowds and feeding them. For the “lock her up” chant he said that he didn’t even really think so much about it but the people seemed to love it so he rolled with it.   Someone who actually understands what trump was hitting at, while knowing how to manage the more racially charged aspects with more care than trump, would be a very formidable force in the election.	1589401976.0	fqiwv0q	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpk9ud	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fqiwv0q/
3slr3o9e	He says this then turns the other way and says the exact opposite in a quite disingenuous-seeming way. There was a video of him talking seemingly very explicitly about how this was all a "schtick" and that he was sort of acting to create and extend distracting ideas that would keep viewers from thinking about other news.

68cyu	Others have pointed this out, but, to clarify, this is a common rhetorical strategy of Mr. Carlson to come off as a man of the people. In reality, Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson is the step son of the heiress of the Swanson chicken brand (their birth mother left their family to practice a "Bohemian" lifestyle in France when Carlson was six), grew up wealthy, and is currently a millionaire. To say this means they're disingenuous here would be merely speculating on their personal feelings on the current class divide, however. Rather, they can be quoted from several public appearances as being an "out of the closet elitist", and how "one thing you learn when you grow up in a castle and look out across the moat every day at the hungry peasants out in the village is you don't want to stoke envy among the proletariat". They can even be ironically quoted as deriding Bill O'reilly, the person whose slot they would replace, as having a very lucrative man of the people schtick, which was fine save for how transparent they felt it was.     In short, they use this kind of anti-elitist rhetoric not to address the actual issues of wealth disparity, but rather to get in on the wealth disparity argument, and steer it to their own benefit. It's acknowledging the problem of wealth disparity, only to blame it on the other side and culture war issues so as to deflect responsibility away from the politically right economic policies supported by their employers.     This isn't a slow shift to the political left. It's repurposing attractive aspects of leftist rhetoric to push politically right talking points.	1586313068.0	fmr3kcr	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpk9ud	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr3kcr/

3sj4d	He doesn't really care about that. Carlson's purpose on FOX News is to capture what segment of the viewers actually do have misgivings about corporate corruption and workers' rights and ensure that he provides them with the right-friendly outlet for their desires (read: things that don't actually address their issues) instead of looking to the actual left. He does this on a variety of issues as well, like military intervention. Ooh, Trump and the Republicans want to do a war-thing? Are you a FOX News viewer who doesn't like that? Don't worry, Carlson will be there to explain why it's a bad idea but *also* why Republicans and Trump aren't at fault for this, it's really the Dems' doing, and you should continue to vote for and support everything else on FOX News with no change despite your current misgivings.  I'd say it's insane watching this sub fawn over him and fall for the con so easily, but it's mostly authrights and those in disguise who realize it's political convenient to boost a guy who at least *looks* like he's not a shill. Like, is this the sub's first rodeo? "Woah, an authright source using socialist rhetoric! *They get it*, man!" Not to drag out the Hitler or Strasser comparisons, but **come the fuck on.**  Carlson has completely changed his political philosophy before and he'll do it again. He is completely beholden to corporate power, but he also knows that bitching about them on occasion can only strengthen FOX's case, rather than weaken it. His viewers aren't actually voting in ways that rein in the corporations, you'll notice.	1586309862.0	fmqykg3	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpcyef	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqykg3/
N/A	Maybe I’m dumb but he supports a lot of Trump’s policy on China and America First stuff, which seems like cronyism to me.

N/A	If you truly understood the AuthRight, then you wouldn't make the common mistake of associating modern American-style conservatism and libertarianism with historical AuthRight movements like fascism or modern AuthRight movements like the Alt-Right.   The Alt-Right partly comes out of the third positionist/fascist tradition - which was opposed to the excesses of both Marxism and capitalism. And while historical third position fascists did support corporatism, they still forced corporations to serve the state and the national interest. And they also enacted pretty progressive pro-worker and pro-environmental policies for their era. They never would have let corporations export all of our jobs abroad, mass import cheaper labor and mindless consumers from the rest of the world, rape the planet for material gain, or obsess over GDP growth at the expense of everything else. They were also opposed to financial speculation and non-labor based economic growth.   And the modern Alt-Right largely carries on that tradition by combining sensible socioeconomic and environmental policies from the left with White identity politics. And so there's no real need to differentiate yourself from the AuthRight since the AuthRight isn't happy with the current economic and political situation in America either. And you'd know that if you followed the work of leading thinkers within the Alt-Right like [The Alternative Hypothesis](https://www.bitchute.com/video/jeroq1tZ2v6W/) or [Richard Spencer](https://youtu.be/dUP1ZYPgBfQ).	1586292525.0	fmq44uo	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpfo5l	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq44uo/

N/A	Never thought about it that way, but that's an interesting observation. Suddenly, everyone went from focusing on the top 1% of wealth in the country, to either focusing on transgenderism (represents much less than 1% of the population), or refocusing wealth disparity anger against white people (even though whites aren't even the wealthiest racial group on average).  Acting as a coalition of minority groups with little in common outside of what they are not (straight white men), the rainbow coalition model is almost perfectly engineered for infighting, lack of unity, and lack of a focused and consistent purpose.	1586290449.0	fmq03jj	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpjdrs	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq03jj/

yc8vs	Tucker Carlson is one of the best political commentators on TV, no question. He is too partisan and pretends that Democrats are the root of all evil sometimes, but at least he is not delusional about problems regular americans face and he fights back against neocon regime change agenda, something that even "liberal" networks almost never do. Dems usually just smear him as a nazi with ridiculously low standard for white supremacy that they have set.	1586289840.0	fmpywpi	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmppg59	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmpywpi/

d8qwo	I mean the very thing Carlson railed against in the meme was that the rich were using idpol to divide us, and Vox here at ~2:21 used that as an example for what Tucker was *trying to do*.  They're implying he doesn't really believe what he's saying, when in my view it seems much more like he never tried to play himself as something he wasn't. He's been pretty open about his background.	1586288632.0	fmpwjbs	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpljkw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmpwjbs/

N/A	Of course it's a grift, he's a TV personality. He'll say stuff like this and then come out bashing socialism the next day. In reality, he's basically a Trump-style right wing populist.  The class stuff is lip-service, it only comes out when he can use it to trash idpol or Democrats, like in this video.  But even if it is just lip-service, it's a sad indictment of our "left" corporate media that the only real discussion of class politics on TV is coming from a Fox anchor.	1586284612.0	fmpoqnr	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpljkw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmpoqnr/

9sx4i	Jesus that’s an awful video. Taking things out of context. I love the absolute lack of self awareness when Maza says “false consciousness is a phrase grad students use to sound smart” as he uses it to sound smart.   I think what Tucker is saying is he never has pretended he is personally a member of the working class, and he doesn’t shy away from his past. That doesn’t mean he can’t empathize with it or can’t see what is going on. In fact, I think his constant presence in elitist circles has actually probably given him greater insight than any working class person could obtain.	1586315607.0	fmr7d01	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpljkw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr7d01/

3sj4d	Strasserist, but when push comes to shove he'll be right back on board with everything FOX News wants. He's "defector management": there are a number of FOX viewers who don't actually agree with everything the channel says or what the Republican party wants to do, so having a voice on there that is sensitive to their concerns and ensures they can be fed the "correct" information to avoid running off to get outside information is helpful.  Is FOX saying something you dislike, as a Republican, while the party also does something you dislike? Are you disgusted? Tempted to find some information about what's going on elsewhere, because there's nothing but fawning praise on the network and you know it's bunk? Don't change that channel! Good ol' Tucker's here to make sure you know that *yes*, you are right, this thing is bad... buuuut the solution isn't looking for other ideas, or being bad at Republicans, or voting differently. It's actually the Dems' vault when you get down to it. So just be mad about this thing a little while longer, but definitely don't *do* anything. Corporations are bad, yes, but keep voting straight ticket R.  Disingenuously using left-leaning rhetoric (because you know it'ss popular and no one will hold you to following it) in service of right-wing aims is not a new phenomenon. Michael Brooks (Michael Brooks Show, Majority Report with Sam Seder) lays out Carlson's shit fairly often, and there's a [Some More News video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vMK-p6-M5E) and related playlist that briefly touches on this, but mostly covers his **enormous white nationalism**--which should probably tell you something about Carlson's sincerity on race war vs. class war, yeah?	1586310533.0	fmqzn34	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpljkw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqzn34/

N/A	Well, I see Tucker as kind of a dandy-ish, aristocratic type who gets away with humoring the left's ideas, but it's not like him saying this poses any actual threat to the ruling class. They're not going to say "yeah, I suppose you're right, Tucker" and then give up their money lol  That said, the American right cares about power, and actually thinks in terms of power. They understand politics is about power and a struggle between competing interests. They will also be more flexible in power than their opponents assume, because they are interested in preserving their power. This is what liberals fundamentally don't understand about the right.  Liberals don't think like this, because they don't want to create a system that could interfere with their individual freedom ("you can't tell me what to do with my body"), so they eschew tradition (right) and solidarity (left). They replace making hard decisions and limiting freedom by relying on markets, polls, focus groups, algorithms, and petty opposition.	1586313048.0	fmr3jdy	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr29cg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr3jdy/

N/A	Trump would never have been allowed to get elected if he fundamentally conflicted with ruling class priorities. Wall Street, billionaires, etc. have done great under him. His voter base are also middle-class, older homeowners who have benefited under him because his economic policies have been to pump up the debt bubble to create asset inflation in homes and stocks.  He will get re-elected though because libs are vacuous and don't believe in anything and hate politics. Their purported values (freedom, equality) are in conflict with the central tenants of capitalism, the problems which they chalk up to bugs, "externalities," "failures," or simply not having the right Smart People in the room. They can't look too hard at the machinery so they don't really understand it. The outcomes become less important and the *process* takes precedence: things would be better if we had fairer rules, more complex schemes to influence people in the right ways, and were just, well, nicer to one another!  This entailed drilling into everyone's heads that political practice begins and ends with voting, under the preposterous notion that a member of the oppressor class can somehow represent them before his class. Now the masses' only active political right (agitation arguably is at the margins of the system rather than inside it) truly did become a popularity contest. Political practice requires a bare minimum of information in order to serve the supposed function of a democracy, so with everyone dumbed down and alienated, that once meaningful practice becomes a ritual, a liturgy.  This is fundamentally unstable and vacuous, and it fails -- it will always fail -- and leads to the right coming into power, because the right exists to wield power and thinks in terms of power. To circle back around to the billionaires though, it's not Trump's policies they don't like, but because he's vulgar and grotesque and makes other billionaires look bad. But at best it's like trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Instead Trump tears off the mask that we live in a failed state, ruled by a catastrophically incompetent and corrupt elite -- a kleptocratic oligarchy. Expect larger segments of the population to start to question the U.S. ruling class's legitimacy, in ways unthinkable before.	1586314436.0	fmr5mnt	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr46lc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr5mnt/

They hate you, they hate your work, they hate your families, they hate your religion, they hate your way of life."_  He apparently also said: _"The politicians hated when communists called them parasites during the Cold War because it was true"_	1586373283.0	fmtiglr	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpq04h	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmtiglr/

N/A	Agreed.  I hate talking heads, and all news outlets/anchors for most part.  99% of them are just attractive talking heads reading someone else’s work that they don’t even care about.  Tucker actually seems to do some pretty solid work.  I might not always agree with him but he seems 100% more rational than anyone else I’ve heard.  He’s pretty realistic IMO, he pushes a lot of buttons, even in his own conservative/republican base.	1586343399.0	fms1jou	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpxuqp	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fms1jou/

76ia8	oh my god reading this thread today, the day after the announcement of his lead writer stepping down for his comments on AutoAdmit... really crazy how the conversation about Tucker is elsewhere on Reddit right now.

N/A	Anti-open borders was a pretty boilerplate anti-establishment/pro-worker stance until a few years ago. [Bernie Sander's, as late as 2015, understood that unchecked immigration is bad for workers and benefits only the wealthiest employers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0)   I guess since then, the DNC has realized that open-borders guarantees a loyal Democratic voting bloc, and plenty of cheap labor for their donors.	1586290826.0	fmq0tz5	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpuxps	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq0tz5/

j8zp5	Which workers?  You seem to think that non-citizens aren’t people.   How about instead of tacitly winking at employers who commit fraud by paying immigrants illegally low wages we actually force them to pay anyone reasonable wages and punish employers for circumventing the law?  Because if everyone was assured a real wage there would be no reason to hire illegal immigrants and if employers were punished for committing tax fraud then there wouldn’t be a market for illegal immigrant labor.   Somehow you have confused empowering and enriching the bosses and promoting-worker’.   You conservatives like to espouse thinking for yourself.

14xsjg	I've heard him talk, he can only convince you on immigration if you don't try to think of a solution that isn't closing borders. The only way immigration hurts workers is if A. you have capitalism, AND B. the supply of jobs can't meet demand for jobs. A leftist wants to get rid of capitalism which therefore eliminates all economic disadvantages of immigration. Also, even if you keep capitalism, reason B is only ever true in strong recessions, otherwise, immigrants both create jobs by starting businesses as well as filling the labor need that is lacking, say jobs citizens won't do or simply facilitating the creation of start ups by increasing the labor supply.   The line of thinking that is anti-immigrant for economic reasons, (which generally doesn't have any validity except for the narrow cases, strong recessions) would also be anti-natalist fully or partially, given that if you have more kids, you're increasing the labor supply therefore increasing competition and decreasing wages. Most if not nearly all anti-immigrants are not anti-natalist.    The vast majority of anti-immigrant sentiment is held for racial reasons if you dig even a little bit. Economic reasons are used just because it's generally accepted that explicit racism is wrong. Especially with Tucker Carlson, so while it's great he's talking about class (though his critiques are kept within acceptable limits that don't endanger the elites.), he is still a white nationalist (practically a white supremacist, the distinction has no material difference, only theoretical).	1586308132.0	fmqvs78	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpuxps	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqvs78/
N/A	>his arguments about globalism and immigration... Could convince even a leftist to shut the borders  Lmao fuck no it couldn't!  We don't want borders in the first place.  These things only hurt workers currently because of the reserve army of labor.  If you knew anything about leftists, you'd know we want to do away with these things, not make them stronger to protect them.  It's like trying to convince a Libertarian that in order to help the grievances they have about government is to make the government stronger. Doesn't exactly help when they don't want that thing in the first place.  Yes. A reserve army of labor hurts workers under the capitalist mode of production. That's literally Marx. We knew that. So the cure for that isn't to keep the paradigm but try to shut out certain groups from entering the reserve army of labor, but rather destroy the systems with which create the reserve army in the first place.	1586301111.0	fmqjzk2	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpuxps	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqjzk2/

You seem to be struggling with exactly what he was talking about in this video, your politics are so polarised right now that you all seem to struggle with the idea that the “other side” are people too. The “us vs them” we see from the outside is beyond rational thought, to the point that it makes you feel uncomfortable when you agree with anything the “other side” says. You are in an artificial bubble of political thought that has poisoned your perspective of the wider world. It will get better but I think it will take something extraordinary to shake people up and take a step back to see how you are being manipulated. I’m not saying you are wrong or right, I feel sorry for your entire country that is being ripped apart by politics.

The majority of billionaires didn't earn shit, if you know their names, they probably do something right. The real masters of this world don't let their names get in the headlines. In the feudal era, the lords and kings made sure every peasant new their name, in the end it just meant that they knew which head to chop first. Now? They learned their lesson.

tf2xs	Not exactly the way I’d rather the two-axis political spectrum be broken, but it is nice when any mainstream pundit reminds people that our political constructs are just that, constructed, and the grouping of ideologies on either side of any axis tends to be somewhat arbitrary and in itself ideological.   That was a much longer and snootier sentence than I meant for it to be, but I guess I’m just trying to say it’s nice to see someone who isn’t a slave to the political spectrum or compass.

N/A	It's much more complicated unfortunately. We're now in a phase again where corporations are more powerful than states, similar to the day of the railroad barons.   The reason is simple: economic activity outgrew the political sphere of influence. In the 19th century national firms upset state powers and only when power become more federal was some balance restored. Now we have global firms, but national governments and the same imbalance exists.	1586308206.0	fmqvwf4	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq1hb6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqvwf4/

N/A	So what exactly are the white identity politics you believe in? Meaning which are the policies in this regard that differentiate authleft from authright? Why does it matter what your skin colour is?   Just curious because I never see white identity politics actually being held by people interested in intellectual discussion, I've just associated it with 4chan and edgy trolls that shouldn't be taken seriousy (because 90% of the time you see it that's what's happening)  I think you should come over to the AuthLeft and vote for democrats/left wing people if this is what you believe about class division and the enviornment  edit:  To elaborate on why skin colour really doesn't matter, "races" as we know them don't exist on a genetic level, all that exists is the genes that are responsible for skin color. These genes are adaptive and change a lot based on enviornment, natural selection, mutations, and migration. They're also independent of the rest of your genome. This is why there can be skin colour change within a population. So skin colour doesn't mean there is a phylogenetic relationship between individuals. There's a shit ton of papers explaining this. From a scientific perspective skin colour isn't too relevant to genetics, but it's still very relevant in life based on the cultural and socioeconomic implications it has.   And also white people won't go "extinct", because even within populations that aren't white it's completely possible for the genetic mutations or environmental conditions that caused the evolution of white skin to make people whiter, even if there is more mixed breeding. E.g people ethnically asian can be whiter than people ethnically white.   https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/skin-color-is-not-race  https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2016.0349  https://muse.jhu.edu/article/48157/pdf  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.20945?casa_token=EkMkizwTyOIAAAAA:t2LfdgS0Z58Rya5x7-jEwHjOHIDBgQERPf7Q5-MskYAlh8fqlvRzHK3CcZyG9wUbmbg5ruSWExsQUbI	1586303884.0	fmqosxd	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq44uo	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqosxd/

It should be a tool for the people to mass organize efficiently, defend themselves against external threats and improve their own prosperity.   Without a strong government or a powerful institution to enforce social norms and laws, the social fabric of a society will continue to degrade over time and your people will be conquered economically/politically/demographically by those that still have strong stable communities and encourage their own interests.	1586301447.0	fmqkkuk	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq8c3h	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqkkuk/

As I'm fond of joking, after observing the government's performance in stamping out alcohol, drugs, poverty, and terrorism (or anything else they declare war on); I'm skeptical that they're capable of controlling the weather.	1586290000.0	fmpz7z4	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpsi4g	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmpz7z4/

N/A	Corporatism isn’t neoliberalism, that term gets misused so much on this sub. Corporatism refers to the Latin word corpus meaning body, not corporations, it means the economy working as a human body with cooperation between workers, managers, and the state for the benefit of the nation rather that the class warfare seen in capitalism and Marxism, its a third positionist economic theory.

N/A	So what?  Many of the most successful critics and reformers in US History were rich either from birth or through their work and often did hypocritical things. FDR and Teddy were both as elite as you can get in the US. Joe Kennedy, the one who helped FDR reform the markets, made his money on shady stock deals and bootlegging. Andrew Jackson who is famous for democratizing the US and getting more rights the average free man, started as war orphan and worked his way to become a successful plantation owner and general. Fuck  even Bernie is a millionaire after 30 years in the Senate and several books.	1586306759.0	fmqtkf8	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqm5fw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqtkf8/

3xajexa	Just because you bash capitalism doesn’t mean you must support marxist socialism.  They’re both equally worth criticizing IMO.  No, tucker represents more of a third position stance.  That usually means fascism (in an economic sense), but there are others.  There’s distributism, which I call the “other 3rd position” which seems to be what Tucker is advocating for, as his stances align with distributist ones and he has a lot of similarities to the ASP.	1586304240.0	fmqpesc	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpoqnr	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqpesc/

N/A	Right-wingers don't have a problem that the society is deeply unjust and repressive, that is "natural" to them. They just don't like how fucking vacuous it is. This also leads them to seek solutions in personal lifestyle choices at the same time, or looking towards older traditional institutions to impose some kind of commands and duty on the subjects. This can lead to periods of reaction but it is doomed to be swept aside by the inner laws of capitalism.  Like you gotta remember that bourgeois civilization is a repressive, stratified class society and right-wingers naturalize hierarchy and order -- and they don't have a problem with repression or telling people what to do (note I don't either) -- but capitalism's drive for profit is constantly undermining and destroying traditional patterns of life, and they can never break out of it. It's like the scene from the Sopranos where these old-time mob guys try to shake down a Coffee Bean, and the manager is like "there are 10,000 stores in North America, I don't think the corporate office will care if you break my legs and they will have me replaced tomorrow with somebody else." It makes the fascists' sword-and-sorcery roleplaying look pretty ridiculous compared to just how ruthless the capitalist machine really is. Soyboys appear weak to them, but you get rid of one soyboy and the machine will produce another one just as quick. They mass produce soyboys and can pop them out of the oven fresh and ready to buy more Funko Pops.  Look, it's not like corporations are pro-globalization because they are bad guys or have some sinister motives. They support it because they have to, because that is baked into the logic of capitalist expansion, accumulation for profit, etc.	1586322165.0	fmrg36x	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrdlcb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrg36x/

The DNC is not in favor of open borders, I've only heard that from Fox and Reddit which are not reliable sources. Illegal immigrants can't vote either, so I don't know what you're talking about. The DNC is pretty fucked up in general, but don't jump to lies and completely false information.	1586302352.0	fmqm618	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq0tz5	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqm618/

ywi4s	Ok first, what are you talking about, he takes something out of context?? Literally doesn't do that once; show it to me.  Second, I'm glad you decided to comment, because I just recently had a conversation about how Tucker Carlson is a schmuck yesterday. I *do* come to my own conclusions. It's just not obvious to people *why* Tucker Carlson is wrong sometimes, because Carlson misleads people for a living.  Here's more evidence for you. These are the most obvious cases of him being a dunce.  [Tucker Carlson interviews Bill Nye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5L2q6hfWo&ab_channel=FoxNews) about Climate Change (Bill Nye's also a schmuck, but Tucker Carlson is most obviously stupid here. This is the worst one.)  [Unreleased Carlson interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_nFI2Zb7qE) where he's called out as funded by billionaires.  [This video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zthJUf31MA&ab_channel=AllGasNoBrakes)is a great example. It's an independent reporter who went to the Portland Protests to document the events and interview looters/protestors. It's actually a really cool video. Tucker Carlson appears at about 6 minutes in, which you can skip to if you want, but you won't understand the context.  The point is, Carlson likes to spin things in incredibly misleading ways, sometimes in xenophobic and racist directions, but always because it's what his billionaire sponsors want or what FOX thinks it's viewers want to see.  Also, it's very easy to post segments of Tucker Carlson's show that are misleading, but how are you supposed to know a video is misleading if it's *you're being mislead*?  Here's a perfect example: If I link you [this segment here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjO7Eip_wk&ab_channel=FoxNews) and you weren't very informed, you wouldn't realize you're being mislead by Tucker Carlson, here. He strings things along in a way where if you don't know very much about the situation, he sounds essentially correct.  That's why I prefer to link people to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8b1M-TKQQ8&t=293s&ab_channel=SomeMoreNews), which breaks down some of the "facts" that Tucker Carlson presents in his video.

75q52	Tucker just says anything and everything because nothing is true and everything is. There is no Ukrainian state but it's oppressive and all Ukrainians are nationalists. There is no Ukrainian language, but Russians are forced to speak it. There are no Russians in Ukraine (except the peacekeeping troops that are being attacked by Ukrainians rebels). Coronavirus is a hoax, but it's also somehow a (real) deep-state false-flag to mask radiation poisoning from cell-phone towers. There are a million examples of these sorts of contradictions in politics. Some are dignified with one foot in reality and others are just ridiculous conspiracy theories. The point I'm making is that there's a strategy of political propaganda that operates beyond the exact words of whatever claim is being made. No particular truth or claim is important, rather, the trivialization of all truths is. Tucker just says things and none of it is particularly important. The important thing is that the viewers believe everything and nothing at the same time because if they're really sure of anything, they're more powerful.	1586318779.0	fmrbrrd	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqt9rq	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrbrrd/

tf2xs	Honestly, I find it kind of objectionable to describe any fascist economic views as left-wing to begin with. In the sense that it’s opposed to liberalism and banking, sure, but the fact that fascism seeks to legitimize and strengthen existing social hierarchies overrides any comparisons to Marxism in my opinion.   And to be fair to Tucker Carlson, while I don’t approve of his socially conservative views myself, the fact that he supports constitutional democracy sets his beliefs far enough apart from both Marxism and fascism that I don’t think he can be dismissed as a Third Position goose-stepper.	1586302928.0	fmqn60r	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqgjm6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqn60r/

32duad4	**Third Position**  The Third Position is a neo-fascist political ideology that developed in Western Europe following the Second World War. Developed in the context of the Cold War, it developed its name through the claim that it represented a third position between the Capitalism of the Western Bloc and the Communism of the Eastern Bloc.  Between the 1920s and 1940s, various fascist groups presented themselves as part of a movement distinct from both capitalism and Marxist socialism. This idea was revived by various political groups following the Second World War.  ***  ^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)	1586299255.0	fmqgo8p	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqgnwh	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqgo8p/

N/A	>So what exactly are the white identity politics you believe in?  It's pretty similar to the identity politics of every other group. Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians, women, Jews, Muslims, gay people, et cetera, are all trying to organize collectively for the purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of their group. Likewise, we Alt-Righters are trying to organize collectively for the purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of White people - especially in response to the rise of widespread anti-White identity politics on the left in recent years.   The major difference between White identity politics and the identity politics of every other group is that everyone *but* White people is free to organize and advocate for their interests - both online and in the real world - without any major opposition or criticism. In fact, all non-White activist groups enjoy widespread support from virtually all segments of our society - both from the private sector and the government sector. For example, representatives of the so-called "Black Lives Matter" movement were warmly welcomed into Twitter's headquarters to share their views and concerns and were even given their own black power fist emojis. And keep in mind that this happened *after* a supporter of Black Lives Matter carried out a racist and deadly terrorist attack against a bunch of (mostly White) police officers in Dallas, Texas, back in 2016. Likewise, representatives of Black Lives Matter were invited into Obama's White House to have a meeting with the President and his staff.  In comparison, even the slightest hint of White ethnocentrism, let alone actual attempts at political organization, is immediately denounced as evil and unjust racist White supremacism and fascist neo-Nazism and ruthlessly censored online and literally violently suppressed in the real world. For example, numerous colleges, universities, and entire towns basically went into red alert over the mere posting of a few ["It's Okay To Be White"](https://youtu.be/XBtf0YeLoxY) posters. Students whinged about being deathly afraid, they cried hysterically, sought mental health counseling due to supposedly suffering from PTSD, the police were called, campuses were completely locked down, local residents angrily tore the posters down while denouncing White supremacism, both local and national news organizations reported on the dangerous rise of neo-Nazism and the Alt-Right, local community leaders and politicians stated that they were absolutely committed to defeating the hate behind these posters, et cetera. And any attempt to create a real world political movement that seeks to protect and advance the interests of White people is typically violently attacked by huge mobs of anti-White communists commonly referred to as "Antifa" or even declared "anti-democratic" by governments in Europe and banned.   And the justification that the left typically gives for this unjust suppression of our civil liberties is by citing past and historical human rights abuses by White people - e.g., colonialism, slavery, lynchings, genocide, segregation, et cetera. Or they'll point to the fact that Whites still have most of the institutional power in White societies, and therefore there's no need for White identity politics. And so the left has basically decided that any form of White grievance or concern is inherently illegitimate and even laughably absurd. And they've also decided that any form of White ethnocentrism or collective White identity politics is essentially an act of violence, even *genocidal* violence.   But, in our view, it's actually *White* people that are being systematically discriminated against (e.g., [affirmative action](https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/12/17/affirmative-action/)), [bashed constantly by leftists](https://gab.com/VerifiedHate/posts/8425595633755567) (without repercussion), and facing the threat of genocide. And that last concern typically provokes the left into mocking us and treating us like totally unhinged and wild-eyed conspiracy theorists. And that's because most people typically envision piles of dead bodies in the streets when they think about genocide. But what we're mostly concerned about is the gradual extinction of the White race in the future due to a combination of dangerously low White birthrates (which we believe is mostly caused by feminism), replacement-level immigration (which, yes, we believe has largely been pushed by Jews [[1]](https://altcensored.com/watch?v=7nBzJdQB5r4)[[2]](http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/Immigration.pdf)), and pro-miscegenation propaganda in the media.   A lot of people also tend to scoff at the idea of White people becoming minorities in their own countries and gradually getting blended out of existence. They just assume that it isn't true because it sounds so absurd. And so that's where I'll cite a book called [*Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration, and the Future of White Majorities*](https://www.amazon.com/Whiteshift-Populism-Immigration-Future-Majorities/dp/1468316974), which was written last year by a mixed-race Jewish professor named Eric Kaufmann who specializes in understanding demographics and ethnicity. According to his expert estimates (which I personally view as being overly conservative), White Britons are going to become minorities in *all* of the UK (not just England) by around 2080 and about **75%** mixed race by 2150. And that last figure doesn't even include non-White immigrants in the UK that will still remain racially pure. And so White Britons really will be blended out of existence almost entirely sometime in the next century. And he also predicts that very similar demographic trends will happen all across the (formerly) White Western world. And it's especially bad here in America where White kids are already minorities, Whites are already minorities in about half of our major cities (with many more cities being on the verge of becoming White minority), Whites of all ages only comprise about 58% of the American population (when they used to comprise about 85% to 90% of the American population in 1970), Whites are estimated to become minorities in America outright by 2042 at the latest ([2031](https://nationalpolicy.institute/2018/08/17/2050-is-coming-sooner-than-we-thought/) is probably a much more accurate estimate), and Whites will probably comprise anywhere from 25% to less than **10%** of the American population by the end of this century (depending on how liberal or conservative our future immigration policies will be - and they'll almost certainly be much more liberal as America transforms into a California-like one-party Democrat-run state due to the demographic replacement of the White base of the GOP).  And so one of the biggest issues that differentiates us from the identity politics of every other group is that we're deeply concerned with the literal long-term survival of our race. Because we believe that Whites are [inherently superior](https://youtu.be/TTcC9aOc7Vs) to every other racial group besides East Asians (mandatory disclaimer: on average), that means that the entire world wants to flood into our countries and take advantage of the superior societies that our superior genes create. And because the White race is now plagued with suicidal liberal ethnomasochism (due in large part to the excessive demonization of White people in academia and the media), there's barely any resistance to the demographic replacement of White people in their own countries. Neither the left-wing parties in the West *or* the mainstream right-wing parties in the West have an anti-immigration stance as part of their political platform (mostly because they're afraid of being called racist). They'll typically only promise to clamp down on illegal immigration while simultaneously promising to increase or maintain legal immigration. And so that's where the Alt-Right comes in to put an end to both illegal *and* legal immigration - which is absolutely vital to ensuring the long-term existence of our race.    But, unfortunately, since the left completely dominates virtually all of our institutions (e.g., academia, the news media, the entertainment industry, the tech industry, most social media platforms, the government sector, NGOs, and increasingly corporations and even religious institutions and the military) across the entire Western world, that means that the left has the institutional power to completely suppress any form of White identity politics - which they enthusiastically do (e.g., AHS right here on Reddit). And so because we simply aren't allowed to organize politically or funnel our grievances and concerns into a legitimate political party or even express our views online, that's unfortunately causing White identity politics to become increasingly radical and extreme - as evidenced by the spat of White identitarian terrorist attacks in recent years. And, unfortunately, those acts of White identitarian violent extremism (typically by lone wolves) actually further harms our cause since it reinforces the left's narrative that we're evil and dangerous hatemongers and provides them with the justification that they need to further suppress our civil liberties.   And so people like me are trying to encourage White identitarian activists to reject violence and extremism and to support moderate White identitarian activism and gradually work through the democratic process in order to reform the right through grassroots activism. That's the only way that we'll actually have a chance of winning over the critical mass of people that we need to actually affect change in the real world and put an end to anti-White policies like affirmative action, replacement-level immigration, and censorship of our speech.  I'll try to respond to the rest of your questions later if I have time. I have to go attend to real life responsibilities. One of my Golden Retrievers has been gagging and throwing up all day.	1586315428.0	fmr73nw	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqosxd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr73nw/
N/A	> edit: >  > To elaborate on why skin colour really doesn't matter, "races" as we know them don't exist on a genetic level, all that exists is the genes that are responsible for skin color. These genes are adaptive and change a lot based on enviornment, natural selection, mutations, and migration. They're also independent of the rest of your genome. This is why there can be skin colour change within a population. So skin colour doesn't mean there is a phylogenetic relationship between individuals. There's a shit ton of papers explaining this. From a scientific perspective skin colour isn't too relevant to genetics, but it's still very relevant in life based on the cultural and socioeconomic implications it has. >  > And also white people won't go "extinct", because even within populations that aren't white it's completely possible for the genetic mutations or environmental conditions that caused the evolution of white skin to make people whiter, even if there is more mixed breeding.

First of all, race is more than mere skin color. At the risk of doxxing myself, I attended an [ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/) conference back in 2018 in San Diego - which is one of the largest annual meetings of the world's top geneticists. And one of the more interesting talks at this conference was given by Myers and Speidel from the University of Oxford. [Here's a link](https://eventpilot.us/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&project=ASHG18&id=180122753) to the presentation that they gave. I'll highlight their key findings from the presentation below.  >Building genealogies for tens of thousands of individuals genome-wide identifies evidence of directional selection driving many complex human traits.  >S.R. Myers 1,2; L. Speidel 1 1) Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; 2) Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom  >For a variety of species, large-scale genetic variation datasets are now available. All observed genetic variation can be traced back to a genealogy, which records historical recombination and coalescence events and in principle captures all available information about evolutionary processes. However, the reconstruction of these genealogies has been impossible for modern-scale data, due to huge inherent computational challenges. As a consequence, existing methods usually scale to no more than tens of samples. We have developed a new, computationally efficient method for inferring genome-wide genealogies accounting for varying population sizes and recombination hotspots, robust to data errors, and applicable to thousands of samples genome-wide in many species. This method is >10,000 times faster than existing approaches, and more accurate than leading algorithms for a range of tasks including estimating mutational ages and inferring historical population sizes. Application to 2,478 present-day humans in the 1000 Genomes Project, and wild mice, provides dates for population size changes, merges, splits and introgressions, and identifies changes in underlying evolutionary mutation rates, from 1000 years, to more than 1 million years, ago. Using our mutational age estimates, **we developed an approach quantifying evidence of natural selection at each SNP**. We compared resulting p-values to existing GWAS study results, finding widespread enrichment (>2.5-fold in Europeans and East Asians) of GWAS hits among individual SNPs with low selection p-values (Z>6), stronger than the 1.5-fold increase observed at nonsynonymous mutations, and with enrichment increasing with statistical significance. **We found evidence that directional selection, impacting many SNPs jointly, has shaped the evolution of >50 human traits over the past 1,000-50,000 years, sometimes in different directions among different groups** [i.e., human racial groups]. These include many blood-related traits including blood pressure, platelet volume, both red and white blood cell count and e.g. monocyte counts; **educational attainment** [a common proxy for IQ]; age at menarche; and physical traits including **skin colour**, body mass index and (particularly in South Asian populations) height. Our approach enables simultaneous testing of recent selection, ancient natural selection, and changes in the strength of selection on a trait through time, and is applicable across a wide range of organisms.  In other words, we can now detect and analyze natural selection-driven divergent evolution in humans at every single SNP! And so the idea that we're all essentially the same at the genetic level is thoroughly-debunked leftist pseudoscience at this point.   And one of the more interesting slides presented during this talk showed a long list of highly polygenic phenotypic traits that have already been studied and analyzed in each human racial group, and those findings strongly pointed to *lots* of *recent* (i.e., the last 2,000 years - which is long after most human races diverged from each other and occurred within written history!) natural selection across all racial groups. There were tons of other talks at ASHG which covered very similar topics, and most of them had very similar conclusions. Major advancements in AI, combined with huge amounts of genomic data, has made it very possible to now seriously investigate divergent evolution in humans - both within and between human racial groups.  And not only can we detect divergent evolution in someone's DNA now, but we can even *predict* many aspects of someone's phenotype based on their DNA alone - even when they're still embryos! For example, as already mentioned above in Myers' and Speidel's talk at ASHG, we can now predict someone's academic performance from their DNA alone [[1]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/04/05/598532.full.pdf)[[2]](https://youtu.be/FQU0PNYYSBQ). And even more disturbing for leftists, [we can even predict someone's socioeconomic status from their DNA alone now as well](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/31/E7275)!   And so even though the leftist-dominated media, academic community, and scientific community is still pretending that their environmental and social constructionist worldview is supported by science and the latest genetic evidence, it really isn't! Major and recent advancements in genomic science have basically completely annihilated several of the core foundational pillars of the egalitarian left (e.g., inherent racial and class equality). The only reason why the scientific refutation of their worldview hasn't seriously affected them yet is because they still have so much institutional control and cultural momentum going in their favor. But that will (hopefully) eventually change once this information starts to become more widespread within academia, the scientific community, the media, and the public in general.	1586468827.0	fmxoh78	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqosxd	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmxoh78/

u6331h5	That's a fair point about the war on drugs, terrorism, etc. But I think the point of many proposed government initiatives to take on climate change (like a carbon tax) is to limit the damage done by the largest offenders, the corporations who don't give a shit about polluting if it means greater profits. These bodies will continue to spew obscene amounts of greenhouse gases if there's no incentive to stop.   As for your skepticism about leading to a global catastrophe, most of the extreme weather events in recent years can be directly or indirectly attributed to climate change. Ocean acidification from increased carbon dioxide is also a big one that may not seem imminently damaging, but it will severely cut biodiversity and harm photosynthesizing organisms in the ocean.	1586291128.0	fmq1fe8	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpz7z4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq1fe8/

igupg	The problem is 'oppressive tax schemes' could be tax the largest corporations OR tax the working class people to pay for environmental damage. Realistically, we're in WWII territory to combat climate change. We'd need to seize huge amounts of  wealth to effectively start in on large-scale carbon capture and sequestration (oceanic iron seeding, point capture and geological sequestration) or go hardcore geoenineering (solar reflectors, atmospheric sulfur dioxide injection). We're too far down the hole to make the kind of half measures that the world's governments have been trying out.	1586291880.0	fmq2vsa	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpx8m8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq2vsa/

N/A	Republicans like Bush or Romney certainly didn't care about helping white people. You'll not hear me say anything kind about Neocons.  "What were the results of those policies?" Well affirmative action and forced integration have been disastrous. We now have comically incompetent people in all sorts of prominent positions thanks to the former, and countless public schools have been ruined due to the latter.  The real kicker is that the status of most African Americans hasn't particularly improved. Sure things got better for a lucky handful of tokens. But since forced desegregation the wealth gap between blacks and whites has increased, the incarceration rate for blacks has increased, the bastardry rate for blacks has increased, the crime victimization rate of blacks (almost exclusively by other blacks) has increased.	1586349190.0	fms7x0g	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrxio3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fms7x0g/
N/A	What do you call things like the Arab slave trade if not systematic discrimination against White Europeans? How does the fruit and labor of our ancestors factor into today’s world? Do you deserve brownie points because your grandfather worked on a plantation? If thats the case, do white people get brownie points for the *1,000,000* Americans who died in the struggle to end slavery?   And furthermore, they may face certain problems for most of their race, but a significant segment of the white population-about 10%-still faces the poverty and conditions minorities such as Hispanics and African Americans face. In fact, over 50% of those living in poverty **are white people**, with the others being various minorities. The only barriers are the ones the Left creates and points to to try and justify more blatantly unconstitutional Affirmative Action, and its only been SCOTUS’ leniency on justifiable discrimination thats allow AA to exist at all.   A higher percent of blacks live in poverty than whites do, but the simple population of minorities in poverty and whites in poverty is about the same, and poverty is one of the core examples of racism often provided. Gang lifestyle corresponds with encouraging African American violence, while the impoverished lifestyle does similar things to white people.  Its not a racial issue. The reason blacks are in poverty now at a higher rate is certainly linked to past racism, but don’t big dick about how its LE OPPRESSION OF DIE WHITE MAN that is keeping them down. It’s not a race problem, it’s exactly as Tucker put it-it’s a class problem, but you make it a race problem when you divide people-whose race normally shouldnt matter-by race and then put one on a pedestal as the chief victim, in the process racially sidelining all the other minorities or majorities that face the exact same problems.  This is why the racism narrative in America is such a complete sham. Does racism exist? Of *course* it does. Racism and xenophobia exist worldwide. They are not an American phenomenon and they are most certainly not widespread enough to be to blame for the problems minority communities now face.

N/A	I think both parties represent clusters of different industries with Democrats more in the urban service sector industries and tech and media. Trump is big with real estate (a major source of speculative debt financing), recreation (hotels) and oil and gas -- like anything extractive is going for Republicans. Specifically the owners of these industries by the way. Neither one of these are working-class parties. They're bourgeois parties that represent the boojies, just different factions.  Hillary had a lot of backing from Wall Street but it's not like they have a real problem with Trump. I think Wall Street's priority has been stopping Bernie this time around, and now that Bernie is out of the way, it doesn't matter who is president. As far as any real political contest or debate is concerned the election is over. It's not like Trump has raised their taxes or redistributed any of their money, and he doesn't intend to. In fact he is giving them a massive bailout, because he works for those guys, not the other way around. Biden would be no different.  >The rich has brain washed the left into thinking globalisation is the answer to social problems like racism.   No argument there but it's not like there has been a reversal of globalization. Trump's trade war with China didn't bring manufacturing jobs back -- manufacturing entered into a recession before the coronavirus. It was all about trying to wage an economic war to extract better deals from China to keep labor costs there down. The manufacturing that did leave China in any case moved further out to Cambodia, Malaysia, etc.	1586321175.0	fmreut4	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr6w3u	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmreut4/

CNN, and MSNBC have joined fox in pumping out bullshit.  I don't think think Tucker is a closet comrade but I do think he is a rich person that realises that the current system will lead to something bleak in the future. There is a video out there somewhere where he's talking about growing up rich and how the rich don't realize how bad things are, and he's terrified of the violent uprisings that have happened historicaly when shit hits the breaking point.

N/A	That’s the problem when your ideology shifts at the whims of a cult figure. Bernie’s oldest speeches where about the millionaire class and how mass immigration was a rich idea to get richer. What changed? He became rich and the identity politics was seen as an easier path to victory. I don’t care how rich you are if you don’t try to hide your interests. Tucker says he was born with a silver spoon and most of the rich just follow the path of least resistance to get richer. Right now that path is left identity politics. Or do you really think these billionaire CEO’s really care so much about the lgbt community and other such things?	1586315626.0	fmr7dzg	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr55z6	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr7dzg/

91c09	Oh thank you, I wasn’t sure if what I was writing was going to be offensive. I’m Australian so what happens in the US affects us quite a lot. I don’t actually know where I land or feel informed enough to set a flair. When 2016 happened I was in the camp that was anxious about both Hillary and Trump. When Trump won I was actually optimistic that his open book/ no filter presidency would highlight the absurdity of the entire system and generate change. I told my friends that things would get crazy but a whiplash would happen when people became more informed about the corruption. I’m hoping this is still the case and that the world is just in the chaos phase before things break, returning to a better normal for all of us.	1586311701.0	fmr1h9y	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqyb21	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr1h9y/

Bottom line: "The powerful" are powerful precisely because they can undermine the systems you're trying to establish. The only thing that you really change is that when, if, someone falls out of their powerful position, they face more charges. Another good example of this would be russia, where oligarchs who fall out of favor with putin suddenly face tons of charges spanning through their entire time in power.

11n0m68q	Maybe not on day 0, but he will be there within a few years. Wealth has a strong tendency to snowball because it buys you further access to wealth-generating enterprises.   When you have disposable wealth, you can begin risking it on gambles without suffering for it, and you can begin investing it in people who have less wealth with a reasonable expectation that you'll make back more than you invested.  The first police were poor people paid by the rich to protect their wealth from other poor people.  The first governments were wealthy people using their money to dictate rules and laws to their communities.  The first nations were wealthy aristocrats using their money to buy up so many resources that everyone else had to work for them, rent from them, or buy from them in order to survive, giving the aristocracy power over everyone else's lives.  This is the inevitable result of any unchecked market.  After your reset, you'd have a new Bezos in a short matter of time. And you would call him King and let him do as he pleased or else his paid gang of thugs would invade your home, kill you, and put your family to work elsewhere.  That is, until people got angry enough to revolt and overthrow the wealthy. After doing that a few times, they may eventually arrive at the idea of electing governors instead of just letting the rich run everything.   And with the rich no longer running the country, people would begin to make political choices that serve the public's interest rather than the financial interests of the elite.  Eventually, they will begin regulating some aspects of the market to make it more fair for everyone involved.  Congratulations.

N/A	The issue is that culture is seperate to ethnicity, and Auth rights can't even define what white means genetically. Even ancestry has huge variation.   Customs and traditions are culture based, not ethnicity based. If that's what their concern is then I hope they realise that all cultures die eventually. In this case stop all migration, even whites of others cultures.

N/A	>Meaning which are the policies in this regard that differentiate authleft from authright?   Full disclosure: I'm a former far-left Marxist and environmental activist. But I left the left and joined the "dark side" over a decade ago - largely in response to one of my best friends being brutally murdered by MS-13 illegal immigrants. And I also haven't been closely following far-left content since then since I really don't think that they've created any new ideas that are even worth considering in decades - especially since the AuthRight has already stolen and improved upon most of their economic ideas that have any merit or relevance to the problems that are facing modern Western societies. And so my understanding of the modern AuthLeft is a bit outdated. But I do know that there's a bit of a civil war going on within the AuthLeft between the degenerate SJWs that are absolutely obsessed with anti-straight White male identity politics and the old school economic-focused wing of the AuthLeft (which seems to be quite small these days) that despises the fact that their movement has been taken over by corporate-backed neoliberal freaks and weirdos.  But it seems pretty obvious to me that there's some pretty significant differences between the AuthLeft and the AuthRight in relation to identity politics. For starters, the AuthRight is generally supportive of White identity politics, while the AuthLeft is literally violently opposed to it. Likewise when it comes to our views on gender and sexuality. Somewhat similar to Islam, we AuthRighters are radical traditionalists that despise feminism and LGBTQIA+ weirdness and want to bring back traditional gender roles and put homosexuals back into the closet; whereas the AuthLeft seems to support that for Muslims and non-White people, but not for White people... And so, again, we get back to the anti-White, pro-brown views which seem to be inherent to the modern left in general. And why in the fuck would I support an ideological movement that fucking hates my race with a genocidal passion and wants to systematically discriminate against my race, prevent my race from advocating for our own interests, is constantly scapegoating my race for the genetic shortcomings of low-IQ PoCs, and constantly shitting on my race generally?  And if you're going to make the argument that class is what really matters, not race, gender, or sexuality; go tell that to your fellow leftists. As stated previously, the left, including most of the AuthLeft, has gone totally bonkers with their obsession with anti-straight White male identity politics. And so if the AuthLeft did come to power, first of all, it's not going to benefit me personally at all because I'm a rich prick - and I'm not interested in getting my brains blown out by comrade Cohen or sent to the Gulag. But even if I was a poor White guy that was getting absolutely shit on by our current socioeconomic system, I still wouldn't benefit from the AuthLeft coming to power because, as stated previously, their obsession with anti-straight White male identity politics clearly trumps their outdated and unpopular views on class warfare. Even if I lived in a fucking trailer park and didn't have any teeth or a single cent in my bank account, the AuthLeft would still lecture me about my White male privilege and fuck me over when it came to school applications, job hirings, and promotions. So fuck the AuthLeft. Just like I don't expect PoCs to support the Alt-Right since most of us want to exclude them from our societies and redirect our collective societal focus towards helping White people, the left shouldn't expect White people (especially straight White males) to support the left when they want to exclude *us* from our *own* societies, redistribute *our* wealth, and redirect *our* collective societal focus towards benefiting PoCs.   I'm so sick of the left just expecting we White people to go along with political movements and policies that are explicitly against our interests in order to compensate for colonialism and slavery or some other shit that happened generations ago (and usually ultimately benefited the people that it affected anyway). It amazes me that so many White leftists enable this shit by being pathologically altruistic towards out-groups and ethnomasochistic towards their own people - especially now that it's becoming increasingly clear that the supposed noble motivations of the left were actually thinly-guised genocidal anti-White racism [[1]](https://youtu.be/q90kmUbEv7c)[[2]](https://youtu.be/RC-Cqkq6zWc). No other race would put up with this suicidal bullshit - which is why White leftists should join *us*, not the other way around.  And so you tell me what I as a White person would get from the AuthLeft that I wouldn't get from the AuthRight. How would the AuthLeft benefit me in any way when the AuthRight is already offering me nationalized healthcare, free college, worker rights, and environmental protections (plus they don't hate me)?

If you read my edit you'll see the science about skin colors genetic basis. The studies you linked about whites being genetically superior are just not true or proven. It's really bad science. It hurts to see if you base all of your political views off some shitty science. look at research on genetic environment interactions, scientists are far from understanding the extent genes play in psychiatry and personality. You've completely overestimated the ability of psychology to look at genetics and IQ. I'm sure there's a couple psychologists online who agree with you, but if you find psychologists, genuine researchers in real life they will explain to you why these studies are so limited, I could also if you'd like. And these studies completely fall apart anyway when you realise that they were working on the false assumption (which was only realised by later research) that ethnicity has a solid genetic foundation ,which it doesn't as I explained in my edit.	1586316075.0	fmr8145	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr73nw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr8145/
N/A	Also to clarify the twin studies youve mentioned are shit because they don't control for the obvious confounder, which is difference in environment. Prenatal and preadoption environments impact IQ which are not controlled for. Additionally black kids are still visibily black and different, which means they are treated different and won't fit into a white family as naturally. So these studies are also evidence that environment (the effects of being visibly black) impact IQ. The researchers of the 1974 study actually acknowledged this themselves. The study is flawed because the results are easily interpreted for both genetic theories and environmental theories. And they don't actually attempt to highlight certain genes, they just try(and fail) to remove environmental factors and then say this must be evidence for genetics. This hardly explains anything on a genetic level  And they assume having a certain skin colour means you have a certain genetic profile, when in reality this doesn't exist. The genes responsible for making you white develop seperately to the genes relating to everything else. So two white people can have completely different genes, a white person can be closer to a black person genetically than white ect. I explained this in my first comment, there is no genetic basis for ethnicity beyond skin colour. It's just frustrating you based all this off misunderstanding psychology. Psychology is my favourite subject but studies are too misunderstood by the media and certain groups, including yours.	1586318074.0	fmratsy	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr73nw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmratsy/
N/A	To clarify I don't necessarily disagree with any of those points, this doesn't refute my claim at all. None of the sources I listed disputed that population genetics can find differences in groups. My point was that the races we are using - black, white, african american, asian, and the races used in older psychology studies that you linked don't have a genetic foundation, because they were not designed by geneticists. They're social constructs they're based on appearance and nationality, which isn't an accurate representation of genetics.	1586469260.0	fmxpaiw	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmxoh78	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmxpaiw/

He does a problem with bio-males who become trans females beating out bio-women in a variety of sports including weight lifting, running and his personal career (UFC). He feels this is cruel to bio-women as they have no shot at competing against a person who has higher bone density, naturally more muscle-to-fat ratio etc.   Also, I don't think he's ever discussed this but I feel like he would be against the government paying for a person's trans conversion therapy/surgery.

4qzaro1z	He was a pretty reliable critic of immigration, both when it was a Republican policy and even when it became a Democrat policy.  When Donald Trump started winning states in the primary he quickly reversed and toed the DNC line in the race against Clinton.  Some of his statements pre-2016 on the matter:  > It does not make a lot of sense to me to bring hundreds of thousands of  \[foreign\] workers into this country to work for minimum wage and compete  with American kids.   &#x200B;  > It is a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States  ... you're doing away with the concept of a nation-state. What  right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy.  Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be  great for them. I don't believe in that. I think we have to raise wages  in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create  millions of jobs.   There are his now infamous videos of BLM pushing him around even though he was pretty decent on racial issues anyway, better than Clinton was, she just had the DNC on her side.  His response was to pussy out and give them his platform and say what they wanted him to say.  He's generally included identity politics more in his 2020 campaign, which made him too similar to Warren, which probably cost him a few votes from people who didn't like, without gaining anything, because people who care about that garbage were going to vote for Warren since she's a woman.  He actually developed a better foreign policy from 2016, but he never wanted to talk about it because it didn't follow the DNC line and made him sound too much like Tulsi, which was a huge no-no because we can't have anyone questioning Neoliberal interventionism.     He had good policies and maybe did some good things decades ago, but he is now a spineless, weak leader who doesn't have the fortitude to get nominated, much less run a country.  Whether knowingly or unknowingly he has submitted to the anti-economic progress parties, which is the mainstream Democratic and Republican parties.  That said, I hope he and the Green party can come to terms so that they can get a boost on the national stage.	1586314898.0	fmr6blh	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq75ya	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr6blh/

N/A	I believe there could be an effective policy to reduce carbon emissions, if you could somehow get the entire world to agree to the rules and to implement them honestly. I just don't believe that they're going to get it right, or they will intentionally write them in a way to benefit the most powerful lobbies and tamp down small to medium business interests. This just seems to be the general trend of regulations: benefits the most powerful groups with the resources to get around the rules, destroys their competitors without the necessary resources.  This on top of the fact that to meaningfully cut global carbon emissions, we would need the cooperation of the CPC. As little as I trust the US government to meaningfully implement carbon emission reduction measures, I wouldn't trust the Chinese in a million years to intentionally hamper their own economic development in the interest of global environmental interests.	1586291761.0	fmq2nhi	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq1fe8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq2nhi/

20zcy8o7	I agree that tons of monopolies only exist because of government protections. Regional telecom monopolies like Comcast for example can only exist because the government gives them exclusivity in a market.    That said, monopolies would be absolutely rampant without government intervention. Beyond looking at historical examples like the monopolies that ran rampant due to the laissez faire policies of the Gilded Age, monopolies are a naturally emergent factor of a free market.    Any industry that allows for vertical integration will see vertically integrated companies out perform those that are not. If you can get better prices for steel for your railroads because you also own the steel plant and the coal mine, you’ll beat anyone who has to buy them at a higher price. Horizontally integrated companies have clear advantages in crowding out competitors. Without anti-trust, you end up with natural monopolies in almost every industry. I’m definitely pro free market, but it does lead to monopolies.    That said, I’m not even anti-monopoly. They’re more economically efficient, which means theoretically better and cheaper products for consumers. I support allowing monopolies while regulating their interactions with consumers to prevent them from screwing people over when they get big enough.	1586297479.0	fmqdc2p	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqaj03	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqdc2p/

36c7vnj3	Now you’re just putting words in my mouth. I don’t believe in white guilt and i actually think it’s stupid to be ashamed of something you didn’t do yourself. I was specifically talking about tha US and the West, there are probably countries in the world where white people do get discriminated against, but i don’t think it’s happening in the west  Also i for once agreed with tucker, class is the ultimate divider. The rich people at the top don’t really care that much about people’s race. But to complain about racism against white people in western countries is just stupid. White people aren’t being discriminated against systemically in those countries. Even though class is the main divider, it’s a plain fact that Aftican Americans and Native Americans have a much higher chance of being killed by the police. I’m sure if you put all ethnic minorities together and compare them to white people, it’s the same poverty rate. But as you said it yourself black people have a way bigger poverty rate which is linked to over 400 years of racism. Even today if you look at things such as the prison industry, you can clearly see how they’re profiting off of locking up mainly african americans  And that doesn’t mean white people are the “oppressors”, but white people are for the most part more privileged in the west than other ethnic groups. That’s not to say that working class white people aren’t also oppressed by capitalism, but you can’t completely ignore race either	1586344987.0	fms34fw	t3_fwnwft	t1_fms09up	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fms34fw/

5umvoxpu	Imagine AuthCenter as a area, with a compass inside of it. Some AuthCenters are more Right, some more Left, some extremely Auth, others more mildly Auth.   Tucker is an AuthCenter that’s on the further Right end, while being more mildly Auth.   He is very much capitalist, but has criticized vulture capitalism, uncontrolled markets, and even income inequality. He is a nationalist who values the importance of American national security, as seen with his views on the border.   He is isolationist, and non-interventionist. He does criticize overbearing government control at times, but deems it necessary in protecting Americans. He  is therefore toward the bottom right corner of AuthCenter.	1586301549.0	fmqkr91	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq2ho3	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqkr91/

Things that have not been on record but most likely a future plan is Open Borders full stop.  >U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urged supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday night to start "tipping people off" if they see federal immigration authorities taking action against illegal immigrants in their communities.  >It was just one of many tips the New York Democrat had for a crowd in Ames, Iowa, as she continued stumping for Sanders ahead of the state's presidential caucuses on Feb. 3.  .  >Senator Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) on Monday said he may be open to demolishing sections of the U.S.–Mexico border wall, as well as halting 99 percent of deportations.  >“If someone has been convicted of a terrible, terrible crime, that might be an exception to the rule,” Sanders said. “A moratorium on 99% of deportations is nothing to sniff at, and I think the undocumented community would be very proud of that.“  Bernie was never for this type of stuff in 2016. He has changed rapidly, most likely due to his new circle of friends.  This is AoC's motive. https://i.imgur.com/0AqvtAN.png Bernie Sanders 2007  >"I believe we have very serious immigration problems in this country," Sanders said during a 2007 press event, with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka behind him.

Our border is very porous."  >“And I think at a time when the middle class is shrinking, the last thing we need is to bring over in a period of years, millions of people into this country who are prepared to lower wages for American workers,” he later added.

They're religious, big on traditional family values, have a huge cultural emphasis on hard work, etc.  It looked like the GOP was going to hold onto their conservative social values, forfeit younger voters, and make up the difference by courting the Hispanic vote all the way up until 2008 when McCain got crushed. (He was from a border state and was a strong proponent of immigration reform). So they chose to tack on the issue and antagonize immigrants, forfeit the Hispanic vote, and it gained them enough ground in the rust belt and flyover states to deliver them the white house and congress.	1586298978.0	fmqg5tu	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq5wkp	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqg5tu/

mw8c6	Untrue. By 2004, John Kerry won 56% of the Asian vote. One major reason for the previous Republican leaning was because of how strongly anti-Communist the US Asian population was, because many had fled from Communist regimes and that was their primary concern. Now race relations is a much bigger issue among Asian Americans (many of whom are now 2nd generation or later) than anti-Communism, and the GOP's xenophobic messaging is stifling the chances they have of picking up those votes.  It's important to realize that the demographic of the Republican leaning Asian Americans is significantly different than the current era. There's no innate reason why Asians would spontaneously swing back.	1586298208.0	fmqeq3e	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq906t	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqeq3e/

140zns	Wrong. That is the fallacy of labor. You are assuming that immigrants are classifed as similar labor to you, but they aren't.  Immigrants are usually in comparison, poorly skilled, and lack the language and culture aspects. Means immigrants are usually very low skilled labor. They are not competing with the same jobs as a college grad, skilled worker, or even high school worker. At best they can compete with high school dropouts. However, even they have an advantage, as they have language and domestic cultural advantages. Empirical evidence from economists has shown time and time again, that wages do not depreciate due to immigration. This myth needs to stop.	1586301115.0	fmqjzum	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqjlgl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqjzum/

The day Hillary won the nomination, **anything** pro-Sanders or Trump, was scrubbed off the sub and bots downvoting and spamming comments in favour of HRC took over.

tf2xs	I suppose my view is that liberalism and nationalist conservatism are two distinct ideologies that have little in common other than the fact that each supports a different form of hierarchy that leftists seek to abolish.   You have some overlap between the two in social Darwinists and modern American Republicans, but just as often liberals have allied themselves with communists in order to defeat a shared conservative enemy. The liberal republicans did, after all, originally occupy the left wing of French Parliament along with the socialists.   My point is that nationalism and liberalism are essentially unrelated political ideologies that are only placed together on the right because of their mutual opposition to communism, and it stands to reason that each should have their authoritarian and libertarian variants just as there are authoritarian and libertarian ideologies within leftism.   All that just to say, there’s nothing inherently leftist about being opposed to liberalism and there’s therefore nothing inherently fascist about being a rightist who’s opposed to liberalism.   I don’t think I said any of that very well and I don’t know that my argument makes any logical sense, but that’s roughly how I feel.  > I don’t think Carlson supports constitutional democracy, I think he uses it as a rhetorical stick to beat his political enemies with.

N/A	>I appreciate the response. I honestly agree with you about affirmative action being racist. The thing that catches me is the concern with the ethnicity white, and what that actually means. If you read my edit you'll see the science about skin colors genetic basis. The studies you linked about whites being genetically superior are just not true or proven. It's really bad science. It hurts to see if you base all of your political views off some shitty science. look at research on genetic environment interactions, scientists are far from understanding the extent genes play in psychiatry and personality. You've completely overestimated the ability of psychology to look at genetics and IQ. I'm sure there's a couple psychologists online who agree with you, but if you find psychologists, genuine researchers in real life they will explain to you why these studies are so limited, I could also if you'd like. And these studies completely fall apart anyway when you realise that they were working on the false assumption (which was only realised by later research) that ethnicity has a solid genetic foundation ,which it doesn't as I explained in my edit.  [You're simply wrong](http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/07/18/what-the-experts-really-think-about-race-realism-and-white-nationalism-or-at-least-ideas-pertaining-to-it/) about most subject matter experts agreeing that race doesn't exist and that the widely observed racial IQ gaps don't have a substantial underlying genetic causation. As you can see from that link, it's your views that are in the minority. And you'll also see that the uncertainty and denial of race and racial IQ differences is largely politically driven since it's really only somewhat common in the progressive West and only gained popularity following WWII in response to the rise of Nazism.	1586471560.0	fmxthu0	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmr8145	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmxthu0/
N/A	>Also to clarify the twin studies youve mentioned are shit because they don't control for the obvious confounder, which is difference in environment. Prenatal and preadoption environments impact IQ which are not controlled for. Additionally black kids are still visibily black and different, which means they are treated different and won't fit into a white family as naturally. So these studies are also evidence that environment (the effects of being visibly black) impact IQ. The researchers of the 1974 study actually acknowledged this themselves. The study is flawed because the results are easily interpreted for both genetic theories and environmental theories. And they don't actually attempt to highlight certain genes, they just try(and fail) to remove environmental factors and then say this must be evidence for genetics. This hardly explains anything on a genetic level  >And they assume having a certain skin colour means you have a certain genetic profile, when in reality this doesn't exist. The genes responsible for making you white develop seperately to the genes relating to everything else. So two white people can have completely different genes, a white person can be closer to a black person genetically than white ect. I explained this in my first comment, there is no genetic basis for ethnicity beyond skin colour. It's just frustrating you based all this off misunderstanding psychology. Psychology is my favourite subject but studies are too misunderstood by the media and certain groups, including yours.  I'm just going to link you [Alt-Hype's blog section on race and IQ](https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/race-and-iq/) since I don't have time to refute your arguments in detail. He addresses and refutes all of your arguments about environmental factors not being controlled for.	1586472366.0	fmxuxxc	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmratsy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmxuxxc/

3gmlrz6y	Firstly, flair up correctly.  Secondly, by "unorthodox ideas about economics" he was certainly not talking about libertarianism. I'm pretty sure that this guy is a third positionist.  Also, who said that the libertarian right is evil?   >We want poor people to THRIVE and to become rich.  I don't doubt that, but capitalism is literally based on natural selection, and it's is interesting to approach economics with this concept in mind but it's certainly not going to make everyone rich, unless you have something else in mind. I know that a ton of "extremist" capitalists despise billionaires fueled by tyrannical monopolies as much as the left does, but Tucker was talking about class dynamics which is a marxist thing. I'm yet to find a LibRight who accepts marxist analysis of liberalism as acceptable/precise.  >We think people generally make the best choices for themselves that make them happiest and that people deserve to have all the options available to them.  That's almost universal. LibLefts and a lot of AuthLefts (non-tankies, that is) support direct democracy, which is basically our way to approach choice. You won't get to decide on every aspect of your life (economically and politically), but you'll have an impact on the community instead. It's a matter of preference.	1586436838.0	fmw0v8p	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmv35lg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmw0v8p/

3e8283c	One very interesting sauce about the fix costs of nuclear reactors: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516300106](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516300106)  tldr: if you build a custom designed super car which needs uncountable amounts of licenses, it will cost countless of millions instead of just "a few ten thousands".   The inconceivable fix costs for nuclear reactors in most countries are self made and are not the fault of the technology itself. Thus its not a sufficient argument against that technology. Though its a pretty smart tactic to achieve ones goals: make nuclear power too costly to compete? Just go for easy "green terrorism" combined with some nice propaganda and citizen will at some point actually believe that the only reasonable salvation against the global destruction of our environment is "not feasable".      While great for ones agenda, we will certainly ruin our planet if we further demonize one of the strongest renewable technologies. Wind and solar energy certainly have their advantages, but they are not the end of all means and without nuclear power in tandem, we are certainly fucked in the long run.	1586326007.0	fmrki51	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmri5ba	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrki51/

z507c	People really need to stop spreading that statistic; it doesn't mean anything close to what it sounds like. The Carbon Majors Report says that 100 public and private fossil fuel companies "account for" for 71% of industrial (not total) CO2 emissions since 1988. But their calculation of "accounting" is arrived at by treating the emissions from all use of fossil fuels as attributable to the company that originally extracted them. That is to say, when I burn a gallon of gas driving around, the emissions from that gallon are assigned to Exxon (or whoever) pumped it from the earth.   In other words, what that stat really says is that the top 100 companies (most of which are government or quasi-government entities like Sinopec or Saudi Aramco or Statoil) produce 71% of oil extraction. It's dishonest to say they are responsible for the emissions. I'm responsible for the gasoline I burn in my car, not Exxon Mobil or Chevron or whoever was the one that pumped it out of the ground. And because most of the companies are government entities, all or most of their revenue goes to government coffers anyway and saying to 'tax them' really changes very little.   The statistic's only real information is telling us that the top 100 companies are responsible for 71% of extraction. If I were a cynical person, I would suggest that the report was deliberately written and designed to be misinterpreted in exactly the way it has been.	1586290897.0	fmq0z4v	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmpyr9w	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq0z4v/

jda63	The first part of your response sounds more of a reaction to the unacceptable treatment of detainees during this current administration rather than an overall political stance. That's why I was asking more specifically the Open Borders stance. Nothing on record but "most likely a future plan" really translates to nothing on record for me at the moment.   The next paragraph is about the wall and halting deportations. Halting deportations doesn't sound like "free, unrestricted citizenship or entry" into the US. That just sounds like freezing things so they don't get any worse (or any better). Many of these unregistered or illegal immigrants were already here, not recently arrived. About tearing down sections of the wall, in the same interview he also says "If it’s going to cost me billions of dollars to tear it down, maybe the money would be better spent on child care in this country." Not unreasonable. The wall is a ridiculous political talking point for both sides anyways.  Again, I don't agree with labeling AOC's goals as Sanders' goals unless he explicitly says so. That picture doesn't (gonna ignore the Reddit comments because Reddit comments) say anything about Sanders'. To me, it's just some young people taking pride in their culture, who cares. They aren't going to "Latinonize" America. An increase in Latino population does not equate to a decrease in white/black/asian/whoever populations.  His 2007 comments about employing illegal immigrants and borders being porous are also referring migrant workers. I don't think the people worrying about immigration are concerned about people who come in, slave away on some strawberries for a few bucks, and leave when the season ends. They can take der jerbs. How strange that he's a Globohomo shill when the only detrimental arguments people have against Sanders' is his immigration (sic- Mexican) stance. Maybe a Mexichomo would be more appropriate?	1586308059.0	fmqvnz0	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqt2kp	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqvnz0/
nj9i4	What I read and what I watched didnt necessarily disagree with eachother. %100 yes I agree that Bernie's messaging has changed to be clearly influenced by the DNC, making his positions weaker. However, I would not say his position flipped because he points out that he is specifically trying to help the refugees and asylum seekers, which didnt exist in 2008. He also points out wanting trying to undo "inhumane" deportation practices. That doesnt mean stop deporting, that means stop deporting in an inhumane matter. None of that conflicts with wanting the border to be more secure. In the 2007 video despite everything else he said, he still wanted an improved path to citizenship.	1588721017.0	fplwv3l	t3_fwnwft	t1_fplujyr	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fplwv3l/
3guegia2	>Eh, Hispanic immigrants are pretty damn socially conservative and could've been courted to the Republican party fairly easily. They're religious, big on traditional family values, have a huge cultural emphasis on hard work, etc.  Irrelevant. The primary issue among immigrants is almost always immigration. As long as one party is more pro-immigration than the other, then that's the party that will get their votes.  And it's *because* they're socially conservative. They have a solidarity with their people and a pride in their culture that is entirely alien to white Americans. So of course their number one concern is going to be which party is going to allow more of their people in and therefore give those people a better life. They're pro family, so of course they're going to vote for the party which promises to make it easier for their family members to reunite with them in America.  You'll always have outliers, like Chavez, but he's just that- an outlier.  The GOP would have to go full open borders to even compete with the modern Democrat party.

N/A	Hispanics may be Catholic, but they historically don’t vote for their religious beliefs, but instead economic. This is the biggest mistake republicans have made in their lifetime. George Bush and Karl Rove we’re confident this would guarantee Republican landslides for decades. However the opposite happened.  Dems believe in a stronger welfare state, and Hispanics abuse it. It’s a win-win. Dems aren’t idiots and have realized this correlation, which is why you see Dems pander so heavily to minorities and play the race card. White man bad.  However, in return corporations have begun campaigning with Dems since more immigration, illegal and legal, results in cheaper labor.  Paleo conservatives, like Tucker Carlson/Patrick Buchanan have exploited this relationship and have been preaching this “strong state and pro worker” policies. This is why Trump won in 2016.  Go back and look at the campaigns of Patrick Buchanan and Dave Brat. Both politicians were nationalists preaching America First. Guess who campaigned with both those men? That’s right, Trump.  EDIT: Look at the UK. The Democrats face the same fate as the labor party if they don’t abandon these, pro immigration at any cost, policies. Americans want a party that will put them first, hence the American First political movement  Conversely, the republicans will not be able to capitalize on the American First movement until they primary and replace the Republican establishment, ex: Kevin McCarthy, Lindsey Graham, etc	1586302906.0	fmqn4pi	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqg5tu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqn4pi/

N/A	1. Only a fringe group of individuals have called for abolishment of ICE and even then it’s not as if we want remove all ability to have this type of agency people just don’t agree with the brutality and militarization of the department. “Abolish” is a Fox News mischaracterization 100%.  2. How many illegal immigrants who don’t contribute in taxes do you believe receive healthcare? It’s negligible. Again, you’ve been scared into believing this is a legitimate financial concern when it’s a complete crock of shit. On top of the fact the resource aren’t as accessible and no questions asked as you’re implying. I work in healthcare I know this to be a fact. Very few places would provide medical services to an illegal immigrant and absolutely nothing major so Idk what you are even talking about.   3.  Don’t prosecute what? Pretty vague to have its own bullet point. Don’t prosecute poor as fuck families trying to cross illegally so we don’t waste additional money and resources on a dire  immigration situation that is already expensive? We separate families to put parents into the criminal justice system for what reason? Send them back and be done with it. It’s more expensive to jail someone then to deport them it’s also a savagely malicious thing to do to a desperate family.   I legitimately don’t understand what the fuck you are talking about. You’re either lying, telling half truths, or haven’t looked into the actuality of these things yourself.   You’ll notice here literally every candidate simply wants to reform ICE not abolish it here:  https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxv8e/do-any-of-the-2020-democrats-want-to-abolish-ice-we-broke-down-their-immigration-plans  So that was a lie.

Far more efficient than trying to round up 10 million people one by one for deportation.  The wall is only one part of immigration control, of course you can't control immigration just by building a physical barrier on one border of the country.

N/A	>general economic prosperity of the economy will improve,  Leftists seem to understand very well that overall economic growth doesn't translate into more prosperity for the average person if the gains primarily go to the wealthy. But then you throw that intuition out the window whenever immigration is concerned. Sure the economy of a country grows as a result of more people working and consuming within its borders, that doesn't mean the average person is necessarily better off.  >And immigrants dont suppress wages, managers and ceos do  Employers will set wages the lowest they can in order to attract labor. This floor is lowered when the supply of labor grows as a result of mass immigration.

N/A	>They want an easier application process to keep people from having to  illegally come here, and for ICE to not put children in cages.   The process is hard on purpose. We want the most desirable immigrants, preferably with money and education. The whole "children in cages" meme is so tired as well. If they don't want to be put in jail, they are free to enter at a port of entry and apply for asylum, you get detained if you try to cross illegally. If you have kids with you, the kids cannot be legally held in captivity with adults, so they have to be separated if there is no other guardian to leave them with.  The usual response to this is "just let them await trial in the country", and then something like 40% never show up for trial and simply disappear. So the DNC platform isn't technically "open borders", but if you cross illegally, we'll just put you in the country and make you pinkie promise you'll show up to your court date.  >Those laws make it hard for poor people to vote, and disproportionately  so for minorities, specifically black Americans. Not everyone has a car,  and doesn't need to update their ID.   It doesn't have to be a drivers license, and it isn't that hard to get an ID. By the way, if you don't have an ID, you can't work above board, you can't take most forms of transportation, and you can't set up a bank account. Frankly, if you're that checked out of society, I don't want you voting anyway.	1586308109.0	fmqvqu7	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqurun	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqvqu7/
N/A	No, they'll tell you that immigration grows the economy, which it technically does. But again, economic growth doesn't mean that the average person is any better off.  If we're experiencing a boom (usually due to technological advances) and creating a bunch of new jobs, yes, we need plenty of warm bodies to fill those positions. If there aren't lots of new jobs being created, more people just means more competition for those jobs and lower wages.	1586307456.0	fmqup7r	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqtu25	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqup7r/

N/A	Look I appreciate the responses and the research, but if you have this underlying tone in your replies that there's a leftist movement censoring scientists from telling the truth then it's difficult to discuss this with you. This is an issue that extends far beyond race/genetic studies, it ranges across psychiatry, individual differences, many social sciences and population genetics. Although the only research you look at is race related because you're specifically searching for that, this debate surrounding social scientists and genetics is not race oriented.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261767981_Mind_the_Gap_Why_Many_Geneticists_and_Psychological_Scientists_Have_Discrepant_Views_About_Gene-Environment_Interaction_GXE_Research  If you approach this with a broader perspective there's a lot more research to look at. Looking at this from an aggressive political perspective where you search for literally any study with an abstract that may support your position and then link it (which is what you appear to be doing) results in completely misinterpreting research, which is what you are doing. If you want to actually explain why any of the research supports your view then go ahead, but I don't interperate the research you linked as supporting what you are saying.	1586472473.0	fmxv4p7	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmxthu0	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmxv4p7/

3gmlrz6y	>maybe you should abandon theory for 3 seconds and actually think about optics  You see, that "5%" of people who wouldn't care if their national identity faded away into nothingness are mostly in the first world, and they mostly had access to and completed some basic form of education. That's the key to abolishing the state, tradition and culture. Or rather, the key to abolishing the state as tradition and culture self-destruct. I understand your concerns about a virulent nationalist reactionary movement or series of movements that spark a war like in Yugoslavia, but that shouldn't happen if left-wing policies are applied gradually and with great caution. Polarization is a great opportunity for specially radical third positionists to emerge, and the left is usually responsible when that happens.	1586306244.0	fmqsqjk	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqq8vc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqsqjk/

"Die KPD tat nach Ansicht des deutschen Historikers Andreas Wirsching wenig bis nichts, um andere Wähler aus anderen Schichten zu gewinnen, im Gegenteil, der kleinbürgerliche Mittelstand wurde durch provokante Aktionen verprellt"  "At the 12th party congress of the KPD in June 1929, Thälmann polemicized against German social democracy "as the most active pioneer of German imperialism and its war policy against the Soviet Union". On the other hand, the KPD leadership publicly described National Socialism a few months before it came to power as merely a secondary peripheral phenomenon in the final phase of capitalist development. The central committee of the KPD adopted Radek's "national Bolshevik" tactic, and leading German communists made repeated attempts to attract supporters from the radical right-wing supporters.  The ethnic writer and later member of the Reichstag of the NSDAP Ernst Graf zu Reventlow was invited to expand his positions in the Red Flag. The KPD propaganda took advantage of the anti-Semitic mood, called for a fight against "the Jewish capitalists", distributed leaflets with slogans such as: "Down with the Jewish Republic" in millions of copies and Ruth Fischer from the KPD board even called vulgar-hysterical once to the physical  Violence against Jews: "Kick away the Jewish capitalists, hang them on the lanterns, trample them"."

Even after the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship, the Comintern, which declared "the political line and organizational policy" of the KPD "with Comrade Thälmann at the helm" as "completely correct", stuck to this thesis.  In May 1933, the KPD declared:   "The complete elimination of the social fascists from the state apparatus, the brutal repression of the social democratic organization and its press do not change the fact that they continue to be the main social pillar of the capitalist dictatorship."    At the end of 1933, the KPD leader Fritz Heckert demanded that the struggle against the "fascist bourgeoisie" be carried out "not together with the Social Democratic Party, but against it"."

jda63	It wasn't a hard transition. Hunters still hunted and eventually became animal herders (still animal work) and gatherers became farmers (still plant work). A comparison to a society from over a thousand years ago is hardly an apt parallel hence my banal yet true response.  Rather than answering a question with a question, what kind of jobs are going to be available for the eventual loss of employment from AI? Unlike gatherer -> farmer, truckers aren't going to become car driver. UBI is a bandaid but that bandaid will be festering without a quick response.

37y1v	Yes - the idea was very much that the GOP would support more immigration in order to hold their ground on the relevant social issues of the day like gay marriage, abortion, etc.  And it kind of made sense - they used to be the free-market, pro-business, pro-globalization party after all.   But instead, they did the opposite and chose to hold their ground on immigration, and tack left a bit on social issues, which in retrospect seems to have been the right call for them. "Culture," as you put it, seems to be much more important to the Republican base than the free market ideals the Republican establishment used to espouse.	1586377132.0	fmtq9ku	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmtc9nt	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmtq9ku/
37y1v	Hispanic immigrants aren't centrist, they lean right on the political axis, and yet they vote Democrat. They do this because they're forced to choose between a Democratic party whose social and economic values don't exactly align with their own, and a Republican party which openly antagonizes and scapegoats them. It's an easy decision.  If the Republican party were to cut out the xenophobic shit, publicly reach out to Hispanics, and cede some ground on the immigration issues that matter so much to them, they'd absolutely capture a good chunk of the Hispanic vote. They gave it a half-assed try with McCain, but their white Republican base hated it, Hispanics didn't buy it, and it failed miserably.   It won't happen again - the Republican party has picked its side on the immigration issue, and Hispanics are moving further left and deeper into the Democratic party each year.	1586731441.0	fn80n1j	t3_fwnwft	t1_fn7vwvm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fn80n1j/

Generally, I’ve noticed that non-european/american and non whites generally vote pragmatically rather than ideologically. They vote for what benefits them most as individuals, which is why you have illegal Mexicans that hate LGBT and communists, thump their bibles, and believe in traditional gender roles voting for/supporting the DNC, which has effectively become belligerent to any sort of traditional belief. When it comes down to it, they’re more concerned with the social programs and the possibility amnesty rather than the ideology behind those ideas.	1586316715.0	fmr8xr8	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqn4pi	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmr8xr8/

My point was that the only reason the wages lower in the first place for the low unskilled jobs is because a. there isnt a minimum wage and b. we live in a system in which maximising profits is preffered over maximising human happiness, so if the business owners can get away with paying people less they will.	1586341418.0	fmrznv0	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqtblv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrznv0/

120nmb	I'm glad we agree on the 1200 not being enough for normal people lol. I have huge problems with the stimulus myself. I already linked what I thought would've been better (I would have also been much more happy with a major UBI). I mainly took issue with the fact that you implied that the simulation, the act of injecting much needed money into the economy right now, was wrong. Also, I would say that many businesses need help right now because the economy is stopped and if we just let them die, it will be worse than if we didn't "bail them out" (although because it isn't really the companies fault coronavirus ruined the economy) because we don't want a depression. We want businesses to stay afloat so they can hop back to it when we start going outside again. Although, I would be perfectly fine if cruises died and never came back because fuck them for flying foreign flags to avoid regulations and contributing to the poor health of the planet. Also >Libertarians in congress like Amash and Massie were the only ones to speak out how this was the largest transfer of wealth in history.  I don't know what you mean to communicate by saying this? If you are saying how this is bad b/c it bails out corporations by a lot. 1. Yeah because our economy is service-based and so they are hurting (not that I like corporations or think the bill is perfect, just pointing out how we want them to not fire people) and 2.

f1ukb	Monopolies are created and enforced by the government. Collusion is just voluntary agreements between companies, making each of them more vulnerable to competitors, also often done by companies already protected by the government. Half the anti-competitive practices were government caused problems, the other half were ones that will make an industry less competitive temporarily (to the benefit of customers), but will not really affect that industry long term. The market works out the bad actors.

And you wouldn't kill people indiscriminately, you influence local private law enforcement to keep tabs on your detractors and arrest them on trumped up charges when they do anything wrong.

2gcwfq6i	Relevant though. In my vision of an ancap society we still get the final say with our guns in our hands and our tyrants in our trees. There wouldn't be any police to help him. He would have to put together his own private protection, and we would simply stalk his people and take them out till he was vulnerable enough to be taken out himself. Basically Bezos would be safe while his protection would be picked off. Once his protection realized no one is protecting them, they would resign out of fear and leave bezos exposed to pay for his wealth hording and tyranny.  The Ancap would carry out it's own justice. It's who we are deep down. So sure, get wealthy, but getting too wealthy? Be careful, you don't have the police state to watch your back.  I agree though. Greed leads to a fear of loss which leads to authoritarianism to protect what you have. All the more reason to root it out as an anarchy society.	1586294229.0	fmq7c8i	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq6ffz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq7c8i/

I finished tertiary education, during which I've interacted with about 400 people. Out of those only 1 was THAT kind of left, and even he was more in love with an idealization of Che Guevara and Ceausescu more than anything (which, by the way, means you still cling to some nationalistic beliefs).

N/A	The SPD became an enemy of the KPD because the SPD were Nazi sympathizers. The KPD boycotted many of the Nazi's law sessions while the SPD attended and further legitimized Hitler's role as Chancellor.  Furthermore the SPD often condemned the KPD for assassinating Nazis leaders. The KPD publicly lynched the top SA official and the SPD refused to voice any support for this move.  Tell me, why would the KPD cooperate with Nazi enablers? At the time the SPD publicly said that it was not worried that Hitler would become a dictator, they said this at a time when KPD heroes were being killed for being the sole legitimate opposition to the Nazis.  You have much more reading to do. Your source is desperately trying to hide the fact that the SPD was as instrumental as the German Conservative Party to the rise of Hitler and the NSDAP.	1586298020.0	fmqedaf	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq8vvj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqedaf/
N/A	What is your source for your quotes? I tried googling them but found nothing.  Which is funny because the SPD were the biggest defenders of Nazis as whenever there would be news about KPD members lynching Nazis it was always the SPD that was the quickest to condemn "political violence" and protect the legitimacy of the Nazi party.  This is how the KPD and the Nazi party fought :  >The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent.  After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into  the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat  action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later  the Berlin headquarters of the [Communist Party of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany) (KPD) itself. In September [Goebbels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goebbels) led his men into [Neukölln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuk%C3%B6lln), a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.   >   >Dwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal  means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia  resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany  further into a potential civil war. By this time both sides marched into  each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks  continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was  assassinated on 1 August.   >   >On the evening of 14 January 1930, at around ten o'clock, [Horst Wessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Wessel) was fatally shot at point-blank range in the face by two members of the KPD in [Friedrichshain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshain).[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power#cite_note-FOOTNOTESiemens20133-60)  The attack occurred after an argument with his landlady who was a  member of the KPD, and contacted one of her Rotfront friends, Albert  Hochter, who shot Wessel.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBurleigh2000118%E2%80%93119-61) Wessel had penned a song months before which would become a Nazi anthem as the [*Horst-Wessel-Lied*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst-Wessel-Lied).  Goebbels seized upon the attack (and the weeks Wessel spent on his  deathbed) to publicize the song, and the funeral was used as an  anti-Communist propaganda opportunity for the Nazis.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEvans2003266%E2%80%93268-62)  &#x200B;  THIS is how you fight Nazis! You go out to the streets and kill every motherfucker wearing a swastika!  Meanwhile how did the SPD fight the Nazis? By legitimizing them at every opportunity  >Even SPD politician [Kurt Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schumacher)  trivialized Hitler as a "Dekorationsstück" ("piece of  scenery/decoration") of the new government. German newspapers wrote  that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its  political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be  impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was "a  barrier, over which violence cannot proceed" and because of the German  nation being proud of "the freedom of speech and thought".  The KPD was going out in public lynching Nazis and warning everybody about the dangers of Nazism, while the SPD was publicly defending Hitler by saying that he wasn't a real threat at all.  The KPD's decision to turn against the SPD was the right one, as cooperation with Nazi enablers is unacceptable.

5nkkx	The real reason:  It takes like 10 years to build a new nuclear reactor and it's EXTREMELY expensive and capital intensive. It then takes like 50 years to break even on the initial investment.   In 50 years we're going to be turbofucked already. And renewables are going down in price every year. It's better and faster at this point to just invest in better battery and renewable tech.   It's also good because renewable tech has the promise to help us shift to a decentralized grid which is more effective at addressing the problems of energy management.	1586323667.0	fmrhv1h	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq9vwr	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrhv1h/

3e8283c	What exactly do you mean by that? Do you think we're going to run out of fuel, or that plants would take too long to build? Because neither of those are the case (and the second wouldn't make sense as a counterargument even if true), especially with gen 4 reactors we won't run out of fuel in the next thousands of years and when it comes to building time, firstly trying to accomplish the same with wind/solar would take much longer than builing nuclear plants (not even to mention the grid and storage needed) and the time it takes to build those plants can be drastically decreased if wanted. Not to mention that this kind of reasoning wouldn't make sense in the first place.  Sidenote: gen 4 concepts like the Traveling-wave- or molten-salt-reactor allow for great miniaturaziation (after all, the MSR was first designed to power planes), so decentralizations isn't an issue.	1586372528.0	fmtgxoy	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmsb8jn	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmtgxoy/

12024o	Nationalism to me does not intrinsically mean you consider others as inferior or that you're necessarily the best. It's just that you recognize and celebrate your own culture, and that you find polticial means to improve the condition of the whole of your people, of the collective.   I think one should also make a distinction between the nationalism of a nation-state and that of a minority people in a larger political entity. The latter needs to unite and fight against oppression and assimilation and Nationalism is a powerful ideology to unite them in that goal. This is my case, my people is a minority which is not "free" yet and leads a battle to preserve its culture under the yoke of a more powerful one. We are still fighting to obtain our independence and big business did everything in its power to prevent that from happening, along with the larger political entity. Our nationalism is founded in that idea of collective fight to preserve our culture and make life better for the whole of our people rather than a will to find ourselves as superior to all other cultures.   Nationalism had been the catalysor of small colonized nation wanting to obtain their independence in the 1970s. If you don't see yourselves as a people and as a nation, and if you don't trust your people to take hands of his destiny, you wouldn't fight for that endeavour. You would try to mimic the colonizer as much as possible and try to benefit, too, from their symbolic power. Nationalism will continue to be a driving force for small nations that want to preserve their fragile cultures in a world of porous borders and American imperialism. In this context, I think it's important that nationalism perdure, for the sake of cultural diversity.	1587940563.0	fook4sw	t3_fwnwft	t1_foo38ed	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fook4sw/

N/A	Just because you don’t get a criminal charge for an illegal border crossing doesn’t mean you don’t get deported. You just don’t end up with fucking criminal charges and fines when you’re desperately fleeing to a country to provide for your family because you’re broke as fuck.   Listen I’m not at all about just opening up the borders and letting people run in and do whatever they want. But this isn’t a de facto open border and exaggerating the situation by declaring emergencies, having the president openly talking shit about immigrants on TV, declaring a national emergency, and telling us Mexico would pay for the wall is all in line with a xenophobic playbook that tells you “OMG Democrat’s want open borders” which is absolute horse shit. I’ll happily advocate to not have any individuals caught illegally crossing released into the US because I know it’s happened but I also think we need to be prepared to process these people humanely and accept that this is a way of life in a desperate world. Not act like these are all just criminals and that Mexicans are somehow beneath us.

Automation will only drive this further in the coming decade.

3f6fp6o2	I don't think you know what I am actually talking about then. I am aware of Germany's right wing as I live here. And by living in the eastern parts I see it even more often. The "left" of Germany are mostly just some progressive neo-libs. They are socially left but economically in the center. If you say anything positive about socialism here you often get bashed for it because "MuH sOcIaLiSm CaUsEd ThE wAlL". While ignoring the sanctions and also the attempts to buy east Germans into west Germany by offering them tons of money, work, a home and so on. Germany's right wing mostly consists of socially conservative people that are also in the center economically, except a few examples that want to actually remove the welfare state. The AFD actually proposed that the people should just safe money for when they are older and want to remove pension all together. But most don't know about it as the AFD hides it in their party program and only mentions it very shortly. They say that they are there for the people but at the end of the day all they want is power.   And don't think the right wingers are the only ones unhappy about what our government did in the refugee crysis. A lot of leftists were for intense border controls and huge integration efforts. By that many refugees would have been incouraged to integrate and to be a part of our culture for the time they are here. But instead of doing that we met them with hate, and what do you do if all you see is rejection? You stay with your people in your culture and don't integrate. By that you obviously don't know the norms and maybe even get bad ideas. I have some good examples: in my class we had 2 refugees, and be was sat next to the quiet kid and the other one next to the problem kid, you can probably guess where this will go. The one next to the quiet kid learned the language quickly and got good grades and became a generally good student and basically adapted to our culture. Meanwhile the ones next to the problem kid barely learned anything as the problem kid always told him to so some shit and told him that we do that here and so on and at the end he had to leave the school. It is always a question of social contacts and who teaches you.	1586348471.0	fms70b7	t3_fwnwft	t1_fms4eil	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fms70b7/

3s56dpzq	a common and general example today would be that the time you have to wait for your money after selling a good or service generally scales with how much market power the company you're selling to has. in b2b transactions it's usually 30 days, but if you're selling to someone like a car manufacturer or an arms manufacturer, it goes up to 90 days and even beyond that.  Another more general example would be how the budding consumer electronics industry in africa of the 80s and 90s was destroyed by western companies selling at very low prices when they entered the market. Once the home-grown industry died, they raised their prices to more sustainable levels. This pattern is fairly common. Another example of that would be nestle's formula sales.  If you want specific examples with clear proof, you'll have to look through court documents of the various government agencies and courts overseeing competition laws. I am sorry but going through that shit is way too tedious for a reddit comment.	1586420047.0	fmvka0v	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmv4jxu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmvka0v/
2mpaai3f	>Monopolies are created and enforced by the government.  *State* monopolies are created in certain industries to ensure constancy of supply, such as public transport. In the case of public transport as an example, a state monopoly is a good thing, as the state will provide public transport to remote, rural areas despite the fact that such services lose the state body money. They do this because their primary motive is not profit, instead it is to supply a vital service to as many citizens as possible. If such an industry is privatised, any good business will logically cease supplying services to areas where the supply of public transport is not profitable, and thus certain citizens suffer from a lack of an important service.  The supply of essential services by *state monopolies* is the only positive example of the use of monopoly power.  >  Collusion is just voluntary agreements between companies, making each of them more vulnerable to competitors, also often done by companies already protected by the government.  This is wrong on so many levels. Collusion is a secretive and often illegal agreement between companies to engage in anti competitive practices in order to maintain or increase their market share.   >making each of them more vulnerable to competitors  What??? It does the exact opposite. The whole purpose is that firms recognize that by acting almost as branches of one large monopoly instead of as individual companies they are less vulnerable to rival firms as they can co-ordinate efforts to hurt their competitors. That is literally the entire point of collusion.  >often done by companies already protected by the government  Don't even know what this is supposed to mean, to be honest.  >Half the anti-competitive practices were government caused problems, the other half were ones that will make an industry less competitive temporarily (to the benefit of customers), but will not really affect that industry long term.   What are you even getting at here? Firstly, your statements are completely baseless. What anti competitive practices? Where? Half of what? What's your source on this?   >make an industry less competitive temporarily (to the benefit of customers), but will not really affect that industry long term.   Do you have an example of this? When has a market seen a temporary monopoly by a private company which has benefited consumers in the short term before the industry returned to a more competitive structure in the long term? When has this ever happened? How could it? It goes against all economic theory.  >The market works out the bad actors.  This is one I would really love to hear you explain. How does the market do this? What do you define as a "bad actor"?  >Do you have any specific example that doesn't involve government protection?  Any specific example of a company that wields market power over other companies and individuals? See any oligopoly market. Coca Cola, Google, Apple, Amazon, the list goes on and on. In some cases this is relatively harmless, in others it is terrifying.

We have just enough regulation to give pretty much every drug manufacturer and healthcare distributor an artificial monopoly, but not enough regulation to stop them from using those monopolies to bend the consumer over and repeatedly buttfuck them for profits.  &nbsp;  However, if we're going to talk about deregulation as a possible solution to the problem, it's important to first recognize why our current regulation came into being. I know that America has never truly been Laissez-Faire, but before the FDA was created we largely let market forces determine medical prices. And in that time, there was an abundance of abuses of the consumer, from toxic chemicals being sold as cure-alls to the horrors of the meat packing plants.   &nbsp;  The basic supply and demand model used in econ 101 only works to regulate industry on the assumption that consumers are fully informed, fully capable of choosing between various products, and fully rational. None of these are ever truly the case, least of all when it comes to food and medicine. How can an individual consumer be expected to inspect the manufacturing facilities of every hot dog company to make sure they aren't buying rat shit? How can a patient bleeding out in an ambulance be expected to choose which hospital they end up at? How can you expect every consumer to be an expert doctor, fully aware of all the myriad toxins to the human body and able to avoid the many attempts at medical charlatanry? Clearly, some regulation is necessary. And, you're right that this limited regulation creates opportunities for abuse. But the answer isn't to roll back what regulation we have, it's to impose more, while also working to make our government more democratic and representative of the interests of the people.	1586294081.0	fmq72er	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmq2qvz	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmq72er/

N/A	> interest under the guise of ideology. Or do you still believe the US invaded Iraq due to WMDs  I would argue that it had more to do with Nationalistic status designed to protect the dominance of the United States on the world stage. Same with Vietnam and the Korean war.  Nationalism and Nationalistic interests are still ideological, the Russians tried the same thing in Afghanistan and failed.   If you want to argue it was purely oil and lobbying from the oil industry in America that would be a hard sell because then that would be a reason as to why there shouldn't be a centralized Monopoly on violence that sells its wars through Nationalism to the people.     >many wars throughout history were fought for the sake gaining power. And in Ancapistan doesn't money equal power?  Force equals power, it always has. Power is just the domination of another individual against their will. It's difficult to say money is truly power when money can simply buy services. IE if you consent to something because I offered you money that's still consenual and I haven't dominated you or taken away your freedom of choice.  If someone takes a gun to your head and forced you to do something they have used power over you to get what they wished for.   > you influence local private law enforcement to keep tabs on your detractors and arrest them on trumped up charges when they do anything wrong  You mean like what happens in the US because the only law enforcement is based off a centralized system?  In the US if we find out police are corrupt the centralized system is the only way to deal with it. There are no other options on the other hand if my community of 1000 people find out that the people we pay to protect us are betraying us and violating the NAP, they are punished by the community either through exile or retaliation.

3gmlrz6y	>I just don't believe it, and it's simply not true for any culture except america maybe, and even there it's very limited.  You're clearly not very familiar with Southern European politics then. Obviously not everyone is a communist here (Spain), but there are a lot of them (and almost no tankies!). Right now we're suffering from an embarrassing reactionary movement that threatens our public institutions, but it's influence decreases as their initial momentum is lost. Even though the left doesn't vote much, our current government includes the Socialist Party (the main left-wing party) and a battery of parties with a ton of eurocoms (that occupy two ministries) and other anti-capitalists sparkled around.  But these parties usually don't do what you'd expect socialist or communists to do, they're just cowardly socdems that bow before corporations. The Socialist Party has been hated by most of the left since the 80's, when they left behind marxism for socialdemocracy. Most people are generally socially progressive and very critical of Spanish culture, Catholic religion and monarchy (atheism and republicanism have been increasing rapidly during the last couple of decades).  That's why I think that you're wrong, my country is likely ready for starting to forget about tradition and both my political environment and personal experiences tend to confirm that. And our Portugese neighbors are even redder, it's the only democratic country I know of with a strong communist party (in Spain the communist party only has influence because it's in a huge pre-electoral coalition and they got lucky with the ministries).  Also, the US isn't exactly a bastion of progress. Dems would be considered centrists while Republicans would probably be called fascists by the general public.	1586308503.0	fmqwdsg	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqu5zs	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqwdsg/

5nkkx	Iccp estimations are that the world needs to be carbon neutral by 2050 in order to keep warming under 2 degrees. In order to meet that criteria in a way that doesn't totally destroy developing nations, we have to get developed nations to that point by 2030.  It takes like 10 years to build the reactors and an immense amount of spending capital upfront.  I'd be fine with that as part of a green new deal project but it's very hard to even get the more reasonable stuff through.  Nuke reactors are really only built and monitored by the State for obvious reasons. Barring a WWII sized centralization project its going to be hard to do. We're talking expropriation or printing money at the rate of near hyperinflation levels to get that to happen.  Imo the nuclear power talking point is just a sticking point that people yell from their armchairs as a way to defer more fully engaging with the issue. Which is understandable when facing the full reality of the oncoming climate disaster would probably be enough to drive most people  people to stick a gun in their mouth.   Estimates of yearly deaths caused by climate change by 2100 is 1.5 million IF we keep it under 2 degrees. If. That's the best case scenario. Shits pretty bleak. Even if we get carbon neutral we're looking at something like 3 centuries of continued warming as it's an aggregate process with delayed response. Active geoengineering projects might work but that's not exactly something you want to bet on.  As I said I'm pro nuke but I don't buy this talking point as a real objection to the green new deal. It's simply an excuse to not engage.	1586385076.0	fmu5q2p	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmtgxoy	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmu5q2p/

As a Mexican American, every average Hispanic I've spoken too lists GOP anti immigrant rhetoric as the reason they vote Democrat. You then have a couple liberals. Of the Hispanics who vote GOP, they do so as single issue voters voting pro life, unless the candidate is highly anti immigrant, then they stay home. The only reliable GOP Hispanics right now are anti immigrant Hispanics or older Cubans.

53hf9urq	Well see you just don’t know that you agree on the problem.  The problem that tucker keeps saying through the links in this thread is that people work for markets, markets don’t work for people.   The question for debate is: do you think that the ability to raise a family has been limited? And if so do you think greater ability to raise a family would lead to happier people?  When I hear on reddit that people need a living wage, and free health care, and you think about the why, it is essentially this. Markets aren’t working for people. People are working for markets. One of the videos posted in this thread had tucker suggest exactly that. This is the problem everyone seems to agree on. Now we need to know how to solve it.

Huxley’s “Brave New World” called it Soma, a drug you took every day that made you find enjoyment/happiness where it never should have been.    American society is eerily similar to Brave New World now.  Marijuana legalization is 100% a bad sign I beleive.  Especially the way it’s being handled with pricing, taxing, recreation vs. medical.  It’s a fucking joke.

f1ukb	What's the advantage of a single company cornering a market? If they raise prices then it incentivizes more people to start up small companies and compete. In which case the large company would either have to lower prices to try and outcompete (which will benefit consumers), or the large company would continuously buy the smaller companies (which would quickly bankrupt them).   If a large company was in the business of buying up every smaller competing company, then I'd quickly get into the business of making and selling smaller competing companies. That model is unsustainable for the largest company.	1587309322.0	fnw170i	t3_fwnwft	t1_fnv56yq	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fnw170i/
3e8283c	The same economic principle always applies, may it be minimum or maximum wage: either it doesn't influence the market (aka the bar is below or above the prices assigned by the market itself) or you hamper your own citizens (aka the governmental bar limits employment, thus creates market failures).   If the minimum wage is higher than the assigned price for certain employment, you push those people into unemployment (because its less costly to simply not employ those people) and if the maximum wage is lower than what the market is willing to pay, big corps will move those jobs to other countries, which smaller corps can't afford, thus subsidize big corps with a few more steps.   Those are just simple examples to make the inherent problem obvious. But governmentally assigned prices generally don't offer benefits, quite the opposite. What might sound nice at first glance, mostly does quite the opposite. Economics might sound like something very basic, but even rather simple principles often look counterintuitive on first glance. Its rather common to see people who want to achieve one thing, actually working against their incentive because of the lack of knowledge.	1586327799.0	fmrmfs6	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrknhc	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrmfs6/

I don't invest in stocks of a company because they overpay their management (this would lessen my revenue, so heck no), but rather because the management does a good job (and if I misjudged I'll lose money, which is perfectly fine).   The problem you'll see is that your countries economy declines and you'll be worse of in the long run.

Power is just the domination of another individual against their will. It's difficult to say money is truly power when money can simply buy services. IE if you consent to something because I offered you money that's still consenual and I haven't dominated you or taken away your freedom of choice.  What if your family is starving and you can't afford food. Someone tells you to do what he says and he'll pay you a lot of money. He doesn't have a gun pointed at your head but are you going to refuse him? Maybe you will, because you have your principles but can you gurantee even 50% of the people in that situation would refuse? Money might not be able to force people to comply, but economic stress combined with monetary incentives can allow you to influence a lot of people. And more people means more force.   > In the US if we find out police are corrupt the centralized system is the only way to deal with it.

Why would a person be subject to his peers when he can just switch to a different community? Move 100 miles away and people probably never even heard of your town.

N/A	>Also I don't really see how they supported the nazis.   I gave you one example, they attended the law sessions of the Nazis and refused to boycott Hitler's new government, further legitimizing his rule. The Nazis did take power through democracy, true, but in order for them to reach that far they had to pull off illegal shit behind the scenes, which forced the hand of Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor.   Such a government is illegitimate. You do not become accessory to its oppression. From as early as 1931 the SPD should've teamed up with the KPD and declare all out civil war against the Nazis, but the SPD refused to. Instead it continued to diminish public fears about Hitler and participated in his official government as being a token opposition.   I admit I went overboard when I said the SPD were Nazi sympathizers. I don't necessarily believe that. But I definitely believe that they ended up being Nazi enablers by refusing to take up arms against the Nazis like the KPD did.  Hitler was a monster, he could not be stopped through judicial and legislative means. The only thing you could use against the NSDAP was their own medicine, political violence.

5c70cu7	Because we don’t subsidize nuclear power like we do coal and oil. If we dumped the same amount of money into them as we do for those they’d be a hell of a lot less more expensive.   Nixon had a plan to be fully nuclear by 1980, he just had to be an idiot about the election.   Obama cut a plan initiated by W that would have increased the amount of nuclear power plants in the US.   Like rail transit the upfront costs are great but the benefits far out weigh the costs. Besides there’s a lot of useless regulations we could get rid of to streamline the process.	1586341032.0	fmrzag8	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrhyet	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrzag8/

Our ability to live a modern lifestyle would be impossible limited antibiotics, farmers would lose massive income, steel would be diminished, lack of the majority of motherboards and other computer parts and our economy would collapse. Meanwhile the CCP would gladly cull its citizens until they achieved economic balance again while forcing the African countries they have been grooming into producing their food.   The CCP would storm Taiwan and Hong Kong and would support North Korea entering into South Korea. I doubt either would stop until they reached the majority of the pacific islands including Japan.  Russia has been drooling to get back the old Soviet territory. Look at the proxy wars and political plots it continues to carry out in Ukraine, Syria, Northern Africa, Iran.  There is a reason the Pentagon sees the biggest threats to national security are Global Warming, Malicious States, pandemics, then lastly terrorism.

5ylfr1ja	Most likely the jobs that will spring out of it will be all tech based. For low level work you’ll have analysts, admins, service maintenance (bot management), due to increased digitization you’ll need far deeper levels of security, database management......literally every single tech job will require more and more workers. All of these jobs require an associates or higher....or something similar like private sector certificates.  Also while city—>city shipping will be partly automated it won’t be 100% automated for security reasons, legal liability, and on demand maintenance. Most likely you’ll have one driver leading a fleet of automated trucks. But within the city itself you’ll have far more “last mile” human drivers, now you can automate that for small packages with drones, but that’s costly and you’ll just have to hire a shit ton of people to manage that as well; air traffic, programmer, admins, techs, etc   Because the cost of shipping due to automation will drop like a fucking rock, so it will give everyone more purchasing power. You’ll see consumer spending shift to areas and those areas need more workers.   The problem is there will be a fuckton of jobs; but the vaste majority of those jobs will require higher levels of cognitive ability.

3gmlrz6y	>demolition of churches  This is pretty much what destroyed the Second Republic and gave us the civil war and fascist regime that fucked up our economy for good. The left is sometimes too leftist.  >Didn't realise the spanish general public is retarded. Fascism is, by definition, anti-capitalist and anti-communist.  Well yes, but no. Communism is, by definition, opposed to cults of personality and exploitation of the workers, but look at the USSR... To be fair, Franco was a national-syndicalist, which are kind of fascists but also aren't, and inside national-syndicalism he was a Francoist, which is kind of lika a national-syndicalist... Except it totally isn't.  Fascism in general is an incoherent Frankenstein set of movements that originally had a set of ideals but that were purged by a certain sector of populists within the movement, like Hitler or Franco, who then managed to then take control of their countries. Francoism was basically a government of the rich over the poor, the nobility over the working class (which was the actual material conflict that sparked the civil war, Spain was undergoing the agrarian reform that happened in many other countries in the 1800s and since the nobiity was figuratively beheaded as the king was exiled, they feared losing what remained of their power. Religion and politics were just a facade to mobilize the army). Our current class dynamics are still dominated by the heritage of the feudal system because our liberal revolutions weren't powerful enough to change our economy, as it happened in the UK or France.  Because of these historical peculiarities, the Spanish concept of fascism is "monarchist capitalism with anger issues".  In regars to where in Spain I'm from, I'm going to tell you that I'm pretty much surrounded by fascists (which is not relevant in a national scale because the Autonomous Community in which I live has a very sparse population). To the east I have a bunch of rabid Vasque nationalists with a fuckton of socialists (not socdems, hardcore socialists) and anarchists as allies (the CNT is just a shell of its former self tbh) for some obscure reasons that I am yet to understand. In the West you can find Ancapistan after passing through Nowhere (Asturias). So yeah, that's my close environment and where most people I interact with come from.

lp3i6iy	Proof that he is a neonazi, please. How come you know he is a neonazi but don't even know him? Furthermore you act like this was the only thing I used to underline my position. You act as though the SPD did nothing which is bs. The SPD was the only party in the Reichstag that acted against him, maybe not with the measures of your choice but they did. Also there's no denial in how the KPD did a lot of dumb shit. Yes they fought the nazis but I was arguing about how their dumb leftist infighting only hindered effectively opposing Hitler. Obviously they weren't really effective. You won't succeed against someone who claims the communists are the actual baddies by denouncing anyone with a different political view and upsetting the middle class. No non stalinist will join the fight when you can't even leave your ideology aside to join forces with other nazi opponents.

1x3p2l1u	Well, that's the general gist, though not a true definition.  Here's the definitions:  Definition of patriotism  : love for or devotion to one's country   Definition of nationalism  1: loyalty and devotion to a nationespecially : a sense of national consciousness (see CONSCIOUSNESS sense 1c) exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups   See the difference? Love and loyalty mean very different things.

The banks will pay back the loans with some meager interest, or they will default. Either way, the fed makes money. So yes, they can create as much money as the country needs, whenever they have to (bottomless pit), lowering the value of the dollar when it gets too high, like in times of recession or crisis. When the dolllar starts to rebound, they can then re-value it again.	1586355996.0	fmsi8ox	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmsctlb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmsi8ox/

I’m not arguing about a group of 100 neckbeard “anarchists” on the “far left” who are pro gun.    As you say, the US lies further right than many countries. Consequently the US has some of the most lax gun laws in the world.   There are two major political parties, one further to the left and one further to the right. Nearly every active politician in the left party pushes for greater gun control, “assault weapons” ban, etc. Meanwhile, nearly every politician in the right party is against these measures.    How is this an argument? Pulling a Karl Marx quote or referencing obscure fringe groups with no representation in our government is irrelevant to the reality of the modern position that the left takes on guns.	1586307268.0	fmque70	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqt84d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmque70/

N/A	>The SPD was the only party in the Reichstag that acted against him  That is EXACTLY my argument against the SPD. Hitler's Reichstag was illegitimate and a farce.

He pointed at the SPD and showed how they were participating in his new government, even though their opposition meant nothing as they only held 20% of the Reichstag's seats and could never beat the NSDAP and Conservative party's votes.  When democracy has been hijacked, you take up arms.

They and the KPD had a lot of things in common, but it was the SPD's refusal to turn to war that made the KPD denounce the SPD.

As for rural communities producing energy, sure most of the stuff needed for energy production is mined in small mining towns, but most of the actual power stations are in cities or in towns around it. Either way most rural communities aren't self-sufficent in the their energy use. To be honest I'm not sure how that would work and why it would be a good thing.

[This vid gives a good idea about his actual liquidity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MeRN7LE1LQ).   But I kinda agree with you on the point of everyone having to pay equally (taxes). The problem here is, that our overabundance of governmental influence on the economy and redundant laws offer the wealthy more possibilities to cheat the system, creating a diadvantage to their competitors.   Thats why imo we need a very lean but strong state: few but easily applyable taxes for example. Instead of more convoluted taxes which offer even more loopholes to be abused, we need something like VAT (Value-added tax) or Land-Tax. Otherwise as long as a country introduces complicated taxes, this allways favor bigger corporations, simply because they can afford the overhead instead of their smaller competitors.

3e8283c	Very good question, but actually I'd harshly disagree with limiting or any restriction on inheritance.   A simple mind-experiment to evaluate my stance: what would be the incentive of "any wealth after you're dead will highly diminish in value if not lost at all"?  One would be incetivized to "waste" their wealth or cheat the system because your offspring wouldn't benefit from it anyways. What does this mean in reality? More nepotism and corruption because people would spend their money in their lifetime instead of inherenting it to better the life of their offspring just a few years before they die or just get rid of the money because its lost anyways. Either you pay officials (eveyone has a price) to benefit your offspring or you simply buy more yachts and private jets or whatever.   Whats actually bad about someone inheriting their parents wealth having to invest it just as their predecessors did with the risk of losing it or gaining a revenue by generating wealth for others?  Surely I'd be happy if 2 world wars haven't diminished the wealth of my ancestors, but thats life and its about taking risks and gaining revenue or losing it. But generally the amount of wealth flexibility nowadays is greater than ever before (and we certainly should work on increasing that).	1586336225.0	fmrus26	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrs53k	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrus26/

Yeah, and under Ancap people would be free to accumulate as much power as they want. Human society weren't always composed of large countries but whether it is human nature or something else, history has shown that over time larger and larger human societies snowball into civilizations. Even if you achieve a decentralized state, human history has shown that human society tends towards centralized power. Thus shouldn't we be finding ways to check that power instead of imagining a society where people tend to not want to accumulate power?  > No greed is part of human nature, using force against innocent people is anti social though.

j5y3u	I mean this is chain reaction 101. You can make a nuke by putting 42kg of uranium-235 in a sphere. So the simplest nuke you can make is two half-sphere of u235, and when you want it to go boom you push them together. The hard part is by far making the U-235 to begin with, but once you add that a starter nuke is easy enough that given the u235 in say pellet form you could likely make one with medieval tech.   You underestimate the loyalty money can buy. "either you comply and get a million dollar bonus or a pay a million dollars to a PMC to disappear you".

enh3n	Yes obviously. And when a poor person moves from one country to another they don't instantly become less poor. But whenever the government initiates force in order to restrict the flow of commodities, whether they be raw materials or consumer products or labor or capital, it creates artificial inefficiencies that make everyone net poorer.  Your argument about GDP per capita is fundamentally not responsive to my point, which is that jobs are not zero sum, because the history of the world shows us that more people --> more jobs. How many more jobs exist today than in 1800? Where did they come from?

Nah I jest, but it’s sad to see individuals receive so much credit for the manual labour of the employees they lay off before they spend a penny of their own hoarded wealth.

ez4h7	Well I’d argue that this system, whilst your points are valid, invalidates your claim that we all have equal opportunity.   I’d actually counter it by suggesting spending money in your lifetime should be how money works. A human generates an income and uses it for their lifespan, if that same human is avoiding taxes, systematically profiting off many people and then leaving that wealth for his son to carry on the tradition, you’re just left with the corrupt hellhole of elite families and ruling classes.   I personally think tax would be top priority, fix the system, harshly punish offenders and close loopholes. Then look towards what happens when people become richer than entire countries (a phenomenon reserved mainly for kings before now and we know how monarchy turned out).   My stance on inheritance however is that people should be allowed to help their future generations but when it only takes a few generations and interest rates to ensure massive wealth gaps in society that the wealthy didn’t even work to attain, you have a serious problem with equal opportunity.	1586337326.0	fmrvtwl	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrus26	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrvtwl/

14xsjg	That is an oversimplified understanding of supply and demand. There is no real thing called market forces, market forces are an abstraction of the sum of many individual actions and is itself not the total of all actions. Anti-immigrants are always trying to decrease demand instead of increasing supply, strange no? Who controls wages? Bosses. Why does increased labor supply decrease wages? Because bosses will do anything and everything to pay you shit, even if they can easily afford to pay you double or triple. Decreasing the labor supply is about forcing them to pay you more at the expense of other working class people. But why throw working class people under the bus? If you want to force bosses to pay you more, raise the minimum wage, better yet, make the factory owned by the workers instead of the lazy bosses who make you do all the work while they keep all the money paying you only enough to survive.	1586459925.0	fmx7lwx	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmvo790	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmx7lwx/

3e8283c	>Well I’d argue that this system, whilst your points are valid, invalidates your claim that we all have equal opportunity.  Actually we never had and never will have "equal opportunity" when it comes to upbringing. Wealth isn't even the main offender but rather the mindset of parents. Your parents could be as rich as can be, but if they are anti vaxx religious nutjobs homeschooling their children, you'd be worse off than a low-income child with a reasonable upbringing.    Imo our goal as a society should be to "uplift" and open possibilities as much as possible instead of hampering those having an advantage.   Why developing inconcievable tax laws & co. which only steals our lifetime (or drives us towards crime) instead of figuring out a way which could benefit everyone the most. Imo a "voucher-system" would be a nice idea when it comes to schooling: every child gets such a voucher and it benefits the school they're using. Thus making private and government schools not only affordable but also competing on a level playing field and which ever provides a better service in a certain area will benefit from a good service, while the competitors have an incentive to improve.	1586339110.0	fmrxhfq	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrvtwl	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrxhfq/

When people with different cultures and different ethnicities enter your country, ethnic tension is what you're gonna get.

I don't give a shit what language you speak or food you eat or media you consume, etc. As long as you aren't a selfish person (among other traits), then you're fine. That includes native citizens, they must also be culturally purified to rid them of consumerism, racism / xenophobia (as technical term, not an sjw blanket), etc. If you care about what your neighbor eats or speaks, you are culturally inferior.   And this is a worldwide standard, discrimination against Christians in the Muslim world must be fought, discrimination among Africans must be fought, etc.	1586467189.0	fmxlfdk	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmxix2w	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmxlfdk/

3e8283c	I'm german and my view on legalizing drugs changed radically ("legalize it all" is my current stance). So blunts for all without fearing ones government. Though my reasoning for that is that free markets are always more efficient and transparent than black markets, resulting in lower prices and better quality.   When it comes to the current pandemic, I'm much more scared about mid to long term economic problems and an increase in general govermental influence on everyday life. I know some people who are close to bancruptcy because they can't keep their bar or shop afloat due to current policies. They are not exploiting their employees afaik but the business they dedicated their life to is going tits up taking all their employees with them, which is pretty sad imo.	1586340346.0	fmrymn4	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrwmeb	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrymn4/
b7otb	So have you found a better source to the charity claim? The crux of one of your arguments is that food security is a solved issue already and people can't be compelled to act against their values by using it.  > They've tried failed plus if people do it voluntarily it's fine. If you're a part of some community voluntarily no one is going to break it up by force cause people won't care. The problem becomes when someone uses force to impose their will on another individual.  Who is going to come break it up? There is no central power regulating things anymore. Is a hundred smaller communities going to band together? Human history has shown that while this may work a few times, large centralized states will eventually form.  > The Police and the courts at least in the US are here to protect the status quo by force. There's a reason no president has ever been imprisoned, it's how it works in practically every state.  The President and elected politicians don't control the police and courts? If politicians are representatives of the people, they should have tarred and feathered Bush because politicians also control the police and courts.	1586366650.0	fmt4bjx	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqx0ev	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmt4bjx/

j5y3u	Yes it's true. But it seems to me that whenever you get a great system with strong worker protections and good regulations it all gets corrupted and finishes in a hell hole as time passes by. And it's also a horribly difficult, almost impossible system to implement for the developing world.  And in the end the corrupting forces that lead to the breakdown of protections are all inherent to capitalism. So it seems to me that well controlled capitalism is a myth.

3s40woms	Ah, but integrate into what exactly? Your specific culture? Religion, language, politic? Why do you think they didn't come to your country legaly, and why does that prevent them from integrating or educating themselves? I agree that some are great people, and some are not. Just like the people already in place. And choosing to break the law should not be the answer, but are the laws in place just? I dont think you and I will agree at this point. We're touching on borders and nations again, which I consider broken concepts to begin with.	1586310455.0	fmqzinp	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmqyelm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmqzinp/
ez4h7	This is the point though, the good people who don’t exploit their employees are more susceptible to situations like that. I also agree, legalise everything, let the people make their own choices and mistakes (but chastise those that abuse this, such as parents spending child benefits on drugs).   I currently work for a small company who is dealing with the same pressure, one thing I’ve noticed is they’re in full preservation mode. Their sole focus is maintaining the business and I respect that. But they’ve also shown how little they actually consider the employees situations/feelings when the chips are down.   We’ve all got a lot to lose here, just some have a lot more to lose and others can afford to lose a lot more. Ideally we’d have a basic standard of care/living that everyone deserves and then the extras on top of that would pay off.   I don’t think I’ll ever justify shareholders etc being millionaires purely just trading investments in companies, the values they earn for the work they give back to society is far too skewed for me to ever think the system is remotely acceptable.	1586341181.0	fmrzfoa	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmrymn4	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmrzfoa/

14xsjg	Atomization, individualism, and lack of community is everything I stand against. Just cause people are different from you doesn't mean you are alienated from each other. Millions of people successfully have strong community bonds to people completely different to each other when it comes to superficial things like food, language, media, etc. Cultures will never blend into one, here's too many people over too far a distance for culture to do that, and it doesn't need to. The only thing that matters are values such as valuing family, community, selflessness, faith, etc. I don't care about any nation, only Faith, Truth and the well being of ALL people.	1586483163.0	fmycrzn	t3_fwnwft	t1_fmxvolv	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fmycrzn/
14xsjg	1. You're necroposting. This comment is over 2 months old.   2. The material reason would be because Hispanics are more likely to have a connection to immigration, by family, friends, etc.   Also, it's not that Hispanics are the odd ones out, rather the only ethnic group (minus the couple exceptions in every group) that wants to restrict immigration are Republican whites who are so mixed or estranged from their foreign heritage that they latch on to an exclusive imaginary identity they call American.   There's also ingroup outgroup bias among Hispanics like any other group, but most Hispanics are originally divided among the 22 Spanish speaking nations (1 of which is in Europe, in case you forgot), due to the varied culture and history among them. The concept of Hispanic and Latino only gained prominence because "whites" (it's funny seeing Europeans call you guys mutts) lumped them all together and became very hostile towards them, so Latinos otherwise divided united against a common threat that aimed to purge them of their presence and heritage.   Anyway, what you've said is no argument, I have gotten into arguments defending Arab immigration into Mexico because I simply am not an ethnonationalist, I care about people because they're people not because they're "part of my tribe".   Nationalism is a barbaric, primitive, degenerate ideology, childish, ignorant, delusional and Satanic. And now even some wokies are becoming ethnonationalists. What we need is to turn to God and love thy neighbor and have proper education and discipline regarding the faith and stamping out heretics. It pains me that American prots engage in all this nationalist or nationalist adjacent activity. We need a strong unified Christian voice, but when I seek refuge from the evil of the left, all I see is evil people on the right who have never known God yet use His name all the time, desecrating it with their false witness.	1592420383.0	fv5ghv0	t3_fwnwft	t1_fv5cg34	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/fwnwft/peak_auth_unity_achieved/fv5ghv0/

N/A	Integrate into American society like my family did. Both sides are immigrants. Learned English, became academics and educated workers. These poor saps have no skills, and just run away from the problems in their countries. They should wait in line to become a citizen LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES. And the laws of America exist to protect the American people. They exist to enable the American way of life. Where any immigrant can take a loan, get skilled, and become a contributor to society. Furthermore, why should my tax money go to support people who want to reap the rewards of my nation without immersing themselves in it LEGALLY? I don't know how you can be AUTHleft of you are against borders and nations. I think your right that we disagree but I'll end on this note; in the time before nation and border, wandering tribes would just waltz in to a civilized zone and take what they want.

3s40woms	A interesting take, I appreciate this conversation truly. I'm auth mostly as a means to an end I suppose. But when I say nations and borders are broken, that because I believe in a global government. We are all one people that should abide by the same laws and guidelines. People should be able to move from one place to any other; borders are arbitrary lines we've drawn because they follow the path of greed and corruption. People flee from their one broken corner of the world to another, why not fix the problem everywhere and it becomes a moot point. Culture is a made up concept we use to divide ourselves. A broken notion of culture, and intense greed and corruption from a poor leadership is what led to the fall of rome, since you like that analogy. I have no interest in citizenship or the "American way of life". I want better for all people everywhere, and if some need to be let's say persuaded of what that is, so be it. I believe that fulfills my auth quota for the day.

Also no, it's not way more complicated than I give it credit. Its literally nothing, absolutely nothing more than a cylinder with a hole in it being fired at a solid cylinder through a barrel. The only special thing about it is the material with which they are made, nothing else.

3lkrmg7s	From what I've gathered, Biden isn't actually senile but rather a weird fucking fella and has been this way for decades. I've got a question from an outside the USA perspective - seeing as Biden was Obama's VP, wouldn't Biden be good since he probably has similar views which makes him as unlikely to cause the end of the world as Obama was?  I'm asking mostly because that's how we rate american presidents over here. Trump is a big no-no because we've been re-prepping the bunkers every other day since he was elected.	1587081547.0	fnn00qu	t3_g2nqak	t3_g2nqak	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn00qu/

3rz8x	We didn't choose Biden. Biden was forced on us by a corrupt DNC in collusion with the media and the corporate interests that control them both.   They were terrified that the citizens would actually be allowed to choose for themselves someone who represents their interests in opposition to the big money power structure that the old guard Dempcratic establishment represents.   They made it clear that they would rather see 4 more years of Trump than allow a genuine populist progressive who's  life's work has been to stand up for  the other 99% while trying to reign in the corporate capture that's infected our govenment.  Despite this naked corruption,  the Right is far more Corrupt. That's why I'm still going to vote for Biden. After all, what choice do I have? This country as envisioned by our founders will cease to exist if Trump is re-elected. The amount of damage he's done already is astounding and the amount of people brainwashed by his lies and Fox News propaganda is even more astounding.  The DNC made a terrible mistake by forcing Biden on us. Its the same mistake they made in 2016, but this time they chose a weaker candidate and Trump has *much* more power.   I hope to God Biden can somehow beat Trump, but, despite what current polls say, Trump is going to crush him in debates and probably win in the end.   So, when trump gets re-elected,  anybody who tries to tell you it was the fault of Bernie or the so called 'Bernie Bros' or the progressive party or anybody else for that matter is cometely full of shit. The DNC forcing a weak candidate down out throats and working to thwart the will of the people  is 95% of the problem. Their strategy was an abysmal failure in 2016 and their doubling down with an even weaker version this time.   Fucking idiots.	1587125822.0	fnoi8y1	t3_g2nqak	t3_g2nqak	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnoi8y1/

17922t5s	I would really like Bernie supporters and Trump supporters to get along better, and I’d like them to vote for him but that’s not even what we all need. I’d be happy just with getting along better. I have no idea how to do that, how to make a point that the other side will understand, but I’m pretty sure faking sympathy or a common cause to print anger voting isn’t going to help.   Hopefully all you Bernie supporters aren’t having to deal with too much of this, and hopefully you know that some of us Trump supporters aren’t trying to scam you. We have a lot of negative things to say about things you commonly believe, but that doesn’t mean we have a negative view of you individually. There’s a lot of you who I like and I used to be into Bernie, too, there’s no hate for you here.	1587088401.0	fnnb5ig	t3_g2nqak	t3_g2nqak	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnb5ig/

There do seem to *actually* be some dudes in green too fucking stupid to understand how the American political system works, as well. It's almost certainly hard for most people here to even get their heads around this, but there is plenty of stupid on all sides of politics. These jokers needs to work on reforming the America political system before they worry about anything else, and the only way to do that is from within a mainstream political party.

When you dare admit that you want something "other" than D or R, you get bullied mercilessly, so this is the part where people chime in and blame the Bernie supporters for every possible negative outcome.  Biden is the "only one" who can beat Trump, though, so I don't know what everybody's worried about.

31egwxhl	The crazy part... they really did pick Biden though.  Picking a presidental candidate is not about the base voting together- it's about earning middle of the road "swing" voters that actually *can* be swayed over party lines.  All Trump's campaign has to do is flood social media with compliation videos of Joe smelling young girl's hair right before the polls- and boom, 4 four more  years of orange reality TV show host as president.  So winnint American politics in 2020 will boil down to: "Say what you want about Trump, he's not going to sensually smell your daughter's hair."

You can't run a campaign based on the idea that half the voters you're courting "don't have any other choice" and then get mad when they choose not to vote or to vote against you to spite you.    also worth mentioning that if you're in a blue state then voting green party could help them get funding and ballot slots in future elections and help start to fix our broken 2 party system.	1587085077.0	fnn5vaf	t3_g2nqak	t3_g2nqak	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn5vaf/

The right couldn’t have asked for anything better, the left wants to fracture and create a new progressive party, the progressives want to spite Biden and are willing to accept any lie or misrepresentation of facts they come across to justify it, any reason to say I told you so.

5c42lkcz	It’s not a terrible idea for some to want Biden to lose. While some believe 4 more years of Trump could be the “end”, many others recognize that enough checks and balances exist to check Trump for 4 more years and not electing Biden would give them a legitimate chance to finally, once and for all, definitively show the DNC that the future of their party depends on progressive ideas.   I don’t agree with this outlook, but it’s one that exists and 4 years is closer than 8 years. Some just want the DNC to burn down to rebuild from the ashes and the fastest way to do that is reject HRC and Biden against Trump.	1587084467.0	fnn4w2g	t3_g2nqak	t3_g2nqak	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn4w2g/

N/A	No, that's how REDDIT treats elections. Most people don't give a shit, especially in the US. Everyone is trying to live their life. It's why reelection rates in the house and senate are absurdly high. The person with the more recognized name usually wins, which is why participants do everything in their power to boost the campaign funds. Bernie started off shot in the foot by going against Obama's VP.  What kills elections in the US is the apathy. It's what keeps this old generation in iron-gripped power.

5cruqt42	We effectively have more than 2 parties.  The democrats are really a coalition of workers voters, environmental voters, and progressive voters who group together despite very stark differences.  The republicans are really a coalition of religious voters, pro business voters, and nationalist voters who vote together despite very stark differences.  Some years, the progressive voters win the left coalitions primary (Eg Obama), some years the environmentalists win the left coalitions primary (eg al gore), and some years the workers win the left primary (eg Biden).  The same is true of religious, business, and nationalist voters on the right (Bush, Romney and Trump respectively).  Splitting the groups formally won’t change much because they’ll just canvas together and coalesce together anyway.

N/A	Biden mismanaging the recovery from this depression and letting a savvy Republican ride into the White House on a wave of populism is more against my interests than Trump and Co. mismanaging the recovery and giving the Dems an entire generation of voters.

You'll see a lot more posts about left unity though and people will plead to suck it up and vote for the lesser of two evils but eh whatever.	1587084172.0	fnn4ern	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmtq1q	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn4ern/
yqoav	Yes, that is exactly right, if you ask the majority of voters in the primaries election.    Is this some sort of Socratic question I am too American to get?    I briefly checked your post history, to see if you were a fellow American asking a sarcastic question.  Sounds like you aren't.  I gotta ask, what are you?  Belarusian?  Russian?  I see you mentioned 'tabor gypsies'.  I know what drums/tabors are, and I know what gypsies are, in general.  But what are 'tabor gypsies'?	1587083396.0	fnn34nr	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn00qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn34nr/
zb161	While you're right on the end of the world front, Biden was Obama's pick because he was so status quo and safe, basically to show the American public that he would play ball by having a more moderate vice president.	1587095265.0	fnnllah	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn00qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnllah/
2ylm4fi4	Probably. He’s also no where near as inflammatory as Trump.	1587083154.0	fnn2q79	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn00qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn2q79/
unodp	Actually, US presidents (and candidates) usually pick VP's with differing views on some level to widen their appeal (for example, Pence had way More extreme conservative values than Trump), because a lot of people will be very happy with their guy as 'just' the VP.	1587116563.0	fno8x32	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn00qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fno8x32/
N/A	Dude go look up any video of Biden speaking from when he was Obama’s VP. He gives off the cuff interviews where he seems very normal, level headed, and can talk at length with no stammer or weird mistakes like forgetting names/dates/locations. He can do precisely none of that today. He’s going through steep, rapid onset cognitive decline and the fact that the media barely comment on it is downright Orwellian. Biden is leaning on teleprompters hard whenever he does speak now, limits his engagements/speaking length, and gets agitated by any amount of pushback and flies off the handle (ironically this is a positive, americans eat that shit up) ... its not good evidence of mental health though.   Biden is frustrated by his own mental fog and it increasingly shows. If youve dealt with old guys going through the first phase of mental sundown this is exactly how it plays out - they get angry, confused, defensive etc and try to cover up the fact they’re forgetting shit because they don’t want to process it.	1587098016.0	fnnpetu	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn00qu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnpetu/

d39js	Math  The more you vote for third party the more you hurt the people you most like (or least dislike)  Also, it's not like parties are unchanging in their policies, enough people want something the mainstream politicians will change what they say before people swap their votes.	1587078863.0	fnmvbx3	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmqhwk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmvbx3/
6d8ao	Because until we actually change the system, voting third party is the same as signing up for 4-8 years of the side you like the least.	1587078655.0	fnmuyhq	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmqhwk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmuyhq/
hnd6u	We have seen a few third party candidates spring up and steal enough votes to spoil elections, and they promptly lost all their support when their voters saw the other side win.  Most politicians would rather work within one of the two parties to get their ideas into mainstream dialogue rather than push the country the opposite way by getting someone ideologically further away from themselves voted in.  The way American politics work the president holds a lot of political influence based on what their priorities are outside of their actual executive power.  Congress didn't want a shutdown over the border wall last year, but Trump forced them to do it.  What that means is someone like Bernie can get a weekly meeting and a couple allies in cabinet positions and have infinitely more power a year from now than if he ran independent, got Trump elected, and pissed off 75% of democrats.  Its political suicide to run third party, the democrats would never take Sanders back, the only way it works is if they actually manage to win, but the current political divisions and the electoral college system guarantees that won't happen.	1587081279.0	fnmzk6b	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmqhwk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmzk6b/
lpvv5xs	Part of the reason is that getting on a ballot as a third party in many elections is a chore in itself. Some states require you to bring them thousands of signatures before your campaign begins to show there's even enough public interest to feature you as a contender.	1587079143.0	fnmvtsp	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmqhwk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmvtsp/
nlfwe	The reason we don’t vote third parties is due to the first past the post system. Shit will always smother a third or multi party system. We need to educate people who electoral systems so one day maybe we can change it. But that would require our education to stop focusing solely on grooming workers versus making good and aware politically engaged citizens...	1587080448.0	fnmy4vq	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmqhwk	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmy4vq/

5lla5	I feel bad whenever I see these memes because on primary day a bunch of friends and I took work off and got together to go vote. But we decided to hit a brunch first, and 5 or 6 bloody marys in it became obvious that we needed to find some cocaine if we were gonna sober up and make it to the polls. We headed on over to the gentrifying section of town and found us a low information voter who could hook that up, but he didn't take Venmo (?) so we had to go to an ATM. But then our driver got a message on Grindr he'd been waiting for and decided to just go do a quick blow n' go first, so we had no choice but to make that little side quest. We get there and the dude opens the door in the dopest fursuit I'd ever seen. He invited us all up to his apt to rail some ketamine while our friend sucked him off, which was super chill I thought. Anyway queue all of us getting lost in an epic k hole, lol. At some point I realized that we should just ask Grindr dude if he had coke too, and he agreed that it was fucked up how People of Marginalization don't always have access to Venmo as that should obviously be a human right. Turns out he did have some blow, but he said we could only do it if we agreed to sit there and come up with fursonas. I don't really identify as a furry but was pretty happy with my character's design, right up until the Grindr dude added a swastika arm band to him. I don't know why a fox would want to gas the jews, but I did know that if I wanted to go vote for the Bern that I HAD to get wired first, so I regrettably allowed it. The only problem was that his coke was laced with fentanyl, so three of us OD'd on the spot (not me though because I take oxys for my fibromyalgia).  Anyway then we had to make another side quest to visit the hospital, but the three dudes who OD'd were 30-somethings who still worked in the food services industry and didn't have health insurance. I convinced our other friend to lie about their names and socials, but they all died anyway so in the end it didn't really matter. But it did remind me of why it's so important to get the Bern in office, as the whole thing never would've happened if drugs were legal and if healthcare were free. So basically Republicans murdered three of my friends as we were trying to vote. If that's not voter suppression I don't know what is.  Anyway while we were in the ER waiting room I managed to snag a bottle of adderal out of this woman's purse (she looked like a super bougie Karen so I'm sure she didn't really need them). We each took four or five 20 milis which should have been plenty to get us to the polling place, but once we showed up the line was like 2 hours long and we were tweaking pretty hard. It was almost 9 by then, and liquor stores were closing (thanks, conservatives! /s). We ducked out real quick to go grab some booze for later, but then this super hot trans girl I've been talking to hit me up on Fetlife and wanted to see my new fursona. Except I didn't have the drawing, it was still back at the furry's house, and I really didn't want to keep her waiting so we headed back there instead. The whole thing was super frustrating. We really need to change the law and make it where you can just vote through Venmo. It's fucking bullshit how hard they make it to vote.	1587116112.0	fno8iii	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn0t61	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fno8iii/

32duad4	**Game theory**  Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.  ***  ^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)	1587096426.0	fnnn8i8	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnnn893	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnn8i8/

Or when anti-marijuana people fight to get people elected who will legalize it so we'll all realize it's the devils grass.

ankku	It's the belief that instead of trying to prevent all the horrors of late stage capitalism, you should accelerate it by voting for the worst and most extreme leaders so people get more oppressed and revolt faster. The believers of accelerationism believes the end of capitalism and it being overtaken by their ideology is inevitable and they might as well rush it along.  I personally don't buy into it and find it quite harmful, even if many of them have the same end-goal as myself they end up working against ourselves, and empowering your enemies doesn't do anyone any favours.

Progressives can barely get a foot-hold in the democratic party and the party leadership openly mocks progressive policies as "pie in the sky" because they know that, the way our system is set up, they don't have to concede power to the left because the left cannot abandon the democratic party *because* the two-party system only offers the death cult republicans as the only other other viable option.

pl8ldor	A coalition of several parties (this would mean progressives and moderates would still need to work together but they could still disagree with eachother and stick to their base), but they wouldn't need to share the same party and a 2-round (first round everyone can come in here in Brazil we had 13 people running for pres, second round only the 2 most popular candidates run) election system with the popular vote or at least [proportional EC allocation](https://www.270towin.com/alternative-electoral-college-allocation-methods/gaming_pvs_2016.png). Granted this does have it's instabilities if the parties in the coalition decide they don't want to work together anymore, see Israel or Italy and the 2 most popular candidates running mean that Trump-style campaigns are much harder to pull off since the 2 most popular candidates are almost always center left and center right which is pretty similar to how things work now, only less explicitly.	1587095016.0	fnnl8dq	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnnb5x8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnl8dq/

dt4ii	On the one hand you could have a conversation about social policies which would be good (although trump isn’t exactly small government republican so it’s not the best matchup against Bernie). On the other hand, it would prove that populism is the most effective way to win the presidency which I don’t think is good and usually leads to increased authoritarianism (some Bernie supporters wanted him to pass all of his promises as executive orders which would be insane).	1587080497.0	fnmy7w0	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmtzbw	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmy7w0/

2qr3yqy	As stated in my previous comment, I'm a Bernie supporter. We all need to realize that this is perhaps the best man in the Senate, with an immpecible track history and political agenda. Bernie Sanders is a model American and a patriot.  It is very unlikely he is trying to betray America, as per Bernie subreddits. If our public knowledge is proficient in understanding, then it is worth assuming Bernie Sanders is correct about his indorcement. I'm sure you've seen the statistics of how poor of a person Donald Trump is, both in policy and personality. He is the equivalent of [Mr. Wonderful](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Leary) (Kevin O'Leary) in terms of competence for his job, and how they are both walking advertisements for their businesses. That is not someone we want running our country. As a journalist, I get very frightened by the erosion of our public rights and the dismantlement of checks and balances that previously held in past decades. He is a democratic threat, and a major reason why Reporters Without Borders, Freedom House, and other organizations continually rate the US as declining in stability, freedom of press, and freedom of speech. Trump also ranks near-bottom in economic handling, especially with the months of employment and health progression that was lost due to his mismanagement and deceit with COVID-19. He has helped the death toll reached the numbers it has, and is another reason why he is [one of the weakest presidents to ever exist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States).  The enemy is not the DNC, Biden, or even Trump. Its a soft-rigged system full of neocruel ideas promoting corruption and fraudulence. These problems will only be exasperated by 4 more years of a man who has yet to benefit the working class.  Edit: Adolf Hitler brought his party into power by democracy, with a few cruel caveats. Nothing we don't see modernized today. Flair up.	1587074900.0	fnmnzxj	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmndst	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnmnzxj/

3rz8x	Because, as usual, it's the lesser of two evils and this time, as bad as Biden is, he is many orders of magnitude less evil than Trump. I would personally like to see our current form of government remain intact rather than devolve into an Authoritarian dictatorship. It was bad enough that before Trump we had already let our government become an oligarchy. Neither Democrats nor Republicans will tolerate any threat to the oligarchy. After all, that's where they derive their power. Besides, Trump has like 18 credible rape allegations against him and can't even form a coherent sentence let alone finish one. Have you ever tried reading an actual transcript of his out loud? Here, try it, Its fun!  > Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, okay, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you're a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, okay, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it's true! — but when you're a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that's why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we're a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it's not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it's four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven't figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it's gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.

qjjs1	First off, flair up. Second, Trump is has been doing long-term damage to US democracy for too long already. Four more years of filling courts with hard-right judges (potentially even another Supreme Court justice), tearing apart the rule of law, furthering partisanship to even more absurd degrees, etc. is just too much.  Plus, if Trump gets voted out it will be the absolute funniest shit in decades.

4v804	> But arent you also screwing your chances to ever get a progressive candidate in the future by just complying?  I get where you're coming from, and I'm right with you with some anger over this, but there's a number of arguments that I've heard that have convinced me now is not the time for this type of strategic voting (if you want to call it that) - for the record, I fucking HATE having to argue for biden, but here it is:   1. supreme court justices. if trump gets to appoint another 1-2 conservative judges, even if we get progressives in after him they'll never get to do anything with the supreme court stacked for the next few decades  2. census is in 2020/redistricting is a big deal that massively influences later elections*  3. global warming. literally a ticking time bomb and trump is dismantling what little protections we had, biden's plan isn't as good as sander's but it's better than going in the WRONG direction.   4.

After 4 years under Trump presidency Democrats pushed for one of the worst candidates to ever disgrace an election because they think all they need to do to win is nominate someone slightly less terrible than Trump and as long as voters keep playing their game, they're gonna keep winning. The only way to win is to not play.

N/A	Based, I’m all for sports and played them growing up and loved football and track in high school and think they are great for young men learning teamwork and work ethic as well as a good outlet. Pro sports where people just sit on their ass on a couch and worship athletes while being a fat slob themselves is a major factor in the degeneration of American society  Plus for a grown man to care so much about a ball game meant for adolescents is pathetic and infantilizing. Casually watching is chill but there are so many losers covers in tattoos of nfl teams and autistically researching and memorizing facts and shit. These fans have an unhealthy relationship in that they worship some team often not even from their own city or region with overpaid plays who don’t know or give a shit about them and are usually not even from the region of the team they represent. Sports leagues began as the most physicals talented of cities or regions forming a team to compete against one another with an organic local fan base but have degraded into a capitalist dopamine fest that rots their fans minds and bodies through complacency and feelings of triumph from something they took no part in.  Also I think things such as the World Cup and the olympics are different and are great in nature but have been degraded by globalization (ie: the French National team).	1587098460.0	fnnq03f	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn9pjg	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnq03f/

So many people don't even understand what's going on when you get down to it, they just follow the crowd, whatever that crowd is.	1587101841.0	fnnu6mb	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn72gu	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnu6mb/
q71ud	The biggest problem with people who make this argument is that they can’t comprehend the idea of something being both true and propaganda.  Did pete give 40,000 dollars to a company called “shadow inc” that was also commissioned to make an app to record the Iowa results? Yes. Did that 100% mean he cheated? No. Does it make it look like he cheated? Yes.

21p8rryg	Hello yes I'd like to report a bruh moment  >Lol, Pete was a cheater...  The Iowa Democratic Party literally came out and said they would not fix the arithmetic that unfairly gave more delegates to Pete to prevent Bernie Sanders from winning the state...  The discrepancy was like 4 pledged delegates while Sanders got demolished.   >ALSO,  Pete gave over $40,000 to the company who literally made the app that "recorded" the results.  That company does all kinds of political tech stuff, namely textbanking and data integration. That $40k was for services rendered.  Or maybe you're right and the DNC really did want to cause the most spectacular and conspicuous possible flop, in order to put their thumb on the scale for the 'establishment' 35 year old with zero federal office experience.	1587095268.0	fnnllfz	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn71i8	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnnllfz/

j7jk0	> The pro Bernie subs are nakedly Trump subs at this point  I'm glad other people are aware of this. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if /r/OurPresident was filled with Russian influence agents like /r/T_D was in 2016. It seems conspiratorial, but we know this happened before and the head of the Congressional Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, says the Russian influence campaign is still going on.  **Edit:** Like, I'm especially skeptical when it comes to posts about this lady, Tara Reade, who accused Biden of sexual assault. I take those allegations seriously and it's something Biden should have to answer for, but it's hard to know if all these memes about it are coming from bitter Bernie supporters, Trump supporters, or Russian bots.	1587092091.0	fnngw81	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn2ktm	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnngw81/

N/A	I mean, the way I see it, his biggest problem was that the majority of candidates supported Biden on super Tuesday. If he had won Super Tuesday, I think he would’ve had a good shot, but after Super Tuesday it became obvious that Bernie had lost his chance, and that there wasn’t a way for him to win. That’s why I think you saw that large margin, not because no one would ever vote for him, but because a lot of people gave up on voting for him.	1587082426.0	fnn1iau	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnn16hj	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnn1iau/

17t5me	I got called dumb for suggesting this once. The topic was party corruption (non-US). They said it would be easier to bribe individual politicians. At least they would have to bribe a majority instead of a couple key figures who tell others to get in line or say goodbye to their careers next election.   People vote for the party instead of the candidate. Independents don't run on equal grounds with party candidates. Considering party candidates are approved by or easily manipulated by some party figures, some non-elected, instead of the people; the system is corrupt. With a well thought out election process it would be better than what it is now.	1587109387.0	fno27ri	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmzq2d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fno27ri/

N/A	Washington and others were opposed to parties fearing it would destroy the nation just as it had leading up to the English civil war. Jefferson thought people would naturally factionalize anyway. This is the inherent contradiction in any group decision process, eventually any monolithic system (whether it's no party or two) will come to an irreconcilable crisis where people have to compromise something to come to a resolution. I don't know if the solution is more parties or none, but two isn't working.	1587144837.0	fnpfzf3	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnmzq2d	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnpfzf3/

1q4qv83j	Accelerationism is where you try to accelerate the collapse of your government so it will be better afterward?  I hope you're not serious.  That would only make things worse, when the ultra-wealthy stop the charade and just take direct control of everything.  The two-party system is a result of our voting method.  There are lots of countries in the world that use better voting methods, which don't result in a polarized two-party system.  It doesn't require collapsing the government.	1587149123.0	fnpoimc	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnosu4z	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnpoimc/
wsqz1	I would add that a two party system can happen under different voting systems too. Here in Australia, we use instant runoff voting for the House of Representatives, and Single Transferrable Vote for the Senate. We've basically ended up with a two party system (third parties and independents do win some seats, but not many). Part of it is that in the House of Representatives, a party has to win 76 (out of 151) seats to form government. If no party wins that amount, a coalition must be formed. Because of that, most people tend to vote for one of the two major parties.	1587128791.0	fnom758	t3_g2nqak	t1_fnolqs1	/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/g2nqak/bustin_makes_me_feel_good/fnom758/
