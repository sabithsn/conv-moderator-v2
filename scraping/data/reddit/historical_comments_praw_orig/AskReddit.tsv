N/A	I have a nonrelaxing pelvic floor, and it's ruining my life. It's a rare condition where the muscles that are supposed to relax when you poop paradoxically contract, so you're basically pushing against yourself instead of pushing the poop out. I have been to 4 doctors and 3 pelvic floor physical therapists and nothing has helped me. I feel hopeless at this point.	1546433173.0	ed2plxr	t3_ablzuq	t3_ablzuq	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2plxr/

N/A	Oh my goodness. I am so happy there is a thread about this. It’s necessary for me to preface what I’m about to say with the admission that I suffer from IBS, which makes my physical being quite uncomfortable, sometimes for days into weeks. When I woke up this morning, I had a glorious bowel movement that was painless and (dare I say) clean.

N/A	The great deception is coming. Do not take the mark of the lying beast behind the system. Satan wants to kill mankind. God loves you and wants you to live and be blessed. Read the Bible about what will happen soon in the world. An evil tyrannic one world government is being set up. Save yourselves snd your relatives. They will promise peace but after a short time of peace they will be brutal tyrant killers. Revelation 22:14“Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. 15Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. Make no mistake Jesus Christ is returning to Judge every person according to their works. Repent of evil.

So immediately after the happy New Years and toasts I ran to the bathroom and had explosive diarrhea.   2019 purged the remainder of 2018 from my body. Time to start fresh. 	1546385816.0	ed1lyjy	t3_ablzuq	t3_ablzuq	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1lyjy/

4tckz	I'm reading this thread with interest.  I have Crohn's and am in remission, but I usually go at least 3 times a day (or usually some time after I eat).  I've never understood people who have a 'schedule', like a morning poo. Or can hold it in all day or for numerous days. When I have to go I usually have around 5 minutes to find a toilet from 'hmm I need to go' to 'yepp need to go'.  I've realised I've tailored my behaviour as a child and young adult around this. Normally my family get up and go after a meal, but I linger. I've since realised it's because I usually need to go a short while after eating. I hate eating before events or walks. I don't snack, and never have breakfast unless it's a small thing like fruit or a smoothie. I eat at home/work and later in the day. I take flexible jobs with essentially unlimited breaks. I prefer aisle seats and hate public transport, and panic when I feel trapped or far from a bathroom.	1546386559.0	ed1mv51	t3_ablzuq	t3_ablzuq	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1mv51/

15n9pc	Well the girl I spent the better half of the last year being on and off with had recently settled down and started becoming romantically involved. I even had dinner with her father yesterday before we went to her friends, while we were there, Things didn't mix well, and I was oblivious to it, We left early after. As we're going home she tells me everyone in the room were in a group chat talking about me and some of the things I was saying, which I thought was going okay, since girlyfriends friends boyfriend and I were laughing an joking. But I was wrong, long story short, she ended things on account I don't get along with her friends and she doesn't feel the same about me all the time... so upset and slightly buzzed from the drinking I stayed at her place, slept om the couch, left then proceeded to drive home, (hour away )depression ate a WaWa hoagie, Cheesecake smoothie, McDonald's $1 cheese burger, a lot of water and now a large Boneless spare rib from China Delight..... I'll shit when I finally stop moping around in my car not wanting to go inside and shit then go back to life without her.	1546388448.0	ed1p5gq	t3_ablzuq	t3_ablzuq	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1p5gq/

Now she's playing and about to go to bed and I've had to take a shit since Olive Garden, but I have to wait until I can put her down to bed in a bit...

4t0114x	Because when I eat too much takeaway over a 2 or 3 day period I get completely backed up. New Year’s Eve was Monday. It’s now 2:21pm on Wednesday.   To add: on Saturday I had a McDonald’s breakfast, kfc for lunch and red rooster for dinner. Sunday was a Guzman Y Gomez breakfast, Hungry Jacks for lunch and dinner. No breakfast on Monday, but lunch was hungry jacks and dinner was pizza.   My New Years resolution is to go back vegetarian so I was having a disgusting last hurrah.

sxwo8	Hi I’m pooping my first poop of the year, and that’s the reason I’m reading this post on Reddit. Happy 2019 everybody.  Edit- The reason I didn’t poop sooner was because “the feeling” hit me earlier while I was playing a video game online and I couldn’t just walk away. I held it in and after a little bit I didn’t feel like I needed to poop anymore so I just forgot about it.  But... my farts have been *rancid*. I made a joke that they’ve been pushing past a turd and it struck me that that’s actually what was happening. So just now I decided to sit on the toilet and thus far it has been a glorious shit:   2+ hours into January 2nd, 2019.	1546420024.0	ed2i542	t3_ablzuq	t3_ablzuq	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2i542/

n8htn	Just had my first poop of the new year. I seem to get constipated easily. Going a whole 2 days before pooping isn't uncommon for me. I also got back home from Hawaii on Sunday, so I'm still settling back into my regular sleep schedule. (Ain't no schedule for pooping. My butt goes when it decides it wants to. Fortunately not while I'm sleeping.)	1546475055.0	ed46f8d	t3_ablzuq	t3_ablzuq	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed46f8d/

I knew a woman on methadone who became so constipated she stopped pooping and didn't do anything about it until she started vomiting up shit and almost died.

7bcaymy	I struggled with this problem so bad that I would shit once or twice a month when I was a kid and I had to be completely naked.  Like 5 or so years ago I had issues with laxative and enema abuse because of it, it was the only way I could “regularly” go or else be uncomfortably constipated forever.  The thing that helped me was getting my digestive system to a point where it senses when I eat and immediately starts workin on the business.  I would envision the food moving through me and going “down” and I would do breathing exercises to relax.  Eventually I managed to train myself completely.  It’s totally possible.   When you’re anxious about pooping, you breathe differently, and your body gets the wrong signal and doesn’t wanna “let down.”  Next time you’re on the toilet and really have to go but feel too shy, sit up straight and take a deep, slow breath, hold it, then let it out.  Repeat until your stomach starts cramping, then just think about how it feels to go.  I firmly believe that our brains have the power to alter our system behaviors.  If you keep sending the right signal, eventually it’ll be received.  ETA:  I seriously cannot stress how much squatty potties help.  Just saying.	1546445710.0	ed31oys	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1dhh6	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed31oys/

mqfnd	Where at? I was puking all day saturday..I couldn't keep down even water and thought my skin looked a strange color so I thought I should go to the doctor..Was extremely weak too. Some anti-vomit/nausea medicine and an IV and I felt better in a few hours.  I kinda wonder if I actually should have gone or if I should have toughened it out for 24 hours and hoped to get better.. I have no one to take care of me while I'm sick and I was worried of becoming "too sick" too..  -edit.. I live in socal seems to be going around the US?..Weird thing is that I hardly go out and get in contact with people. Like I can pinpoint exactly where I got it from and when.. Which was when I went out for some fast food on friday night..It was my favorite place so maybe one of the employees got sick a few days earlier and didn't wash enough? or a customer got sick and their sick germs were all over the place.. I do know the norovirus is extremely contagious..  Was also wondering if I should call them and tell them I got the stomach flu from their place or not..	1546385586.0	ed1loin	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1dqvy	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1loin/

10o84u	I had that same bug. It hit me Wednesday night last week. I was fortunate not to vomit, I hate vomiting.   But I shit a stream for 4 hours last Wednesday night, most of the day Thursday I slept (14+ hours) and didn't feel quite right most of the day Saturday and Sunday. Early in the hours of Monday AM, I farted in my sleep and I felt it, I shit myself with a liquid fart, and proceeded to have a relapse of diahrea for another 2 hours. Fortunately, I caught just a small bit of it and didn't make any mess outside of my sleep shorts. I felt terrible Monday, and put myself on the BRAT (Bananas, Applesauce, Rice, Toast) diet for the day yesterday, and today I feel like a new man.

I remember on the 7th night or so I finally noticed I hadnt shit yet and wondered if I was gonna be okay.

59tqq	Sounds like you're trying to make the right changes for your health. I hope you'll make it out, and have the chance to keep working on yourself. You can get away with a lot when you're younger, but it starts to catch up with you, even when your numbers were all "good" in your 20s and 30s. I had to lose a lot of weight in my 20s, and I'm still far from perfect, but I know how hard it is to make some of those changes.  You can do it. Don't let this setback get you down. Do what you need to do for your health. I fucked up a lot, but it's the cumulative effect that makes the difference. Don't give up! You'll get through this, and 2019 is going to be awesome for you.	1546388049.0	ed1oouf	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1f3kw	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1oouf/

p7t6diu	Yep after my husband had surgery for a perforated stomach they gave him so much morphine that combined with his GI issues caused him to become incredibly backed up. You could smell it on his breath! Lucky he didn’t quite get to the point of throwing it up, but he had to have surgery again to remove a lot of it (according to the surgeon it was like concrete) and take super strong laxatives every day (basically the stuff they give you before a colonoscopy) just to get everything moving. 	1546395164.0	ed1wwmj	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1o9id	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1wwmj/

19k48zwo	It's called parauriesis. The worst I've ever had it was on a catamaran snorkeling tour on my honeymoon. One camp toilet for men, one for women, eighty people on the tour, every time I tried, I could see the people waiting through the door slats getting impatient. It got so bad that I cried. I suspect part of why it was so severe was because I had to sign a contract when we started on the tour that I wouldn't pee on the reef. Ultimately I was just honest with everyone about why I was so distressed and everyone was really super nice to me. The captain snuck into the hold and found a couple of pre-mixed alcoholic drinks for me to "loosen me up" and it eventually worked. unfortunately I wasn't tell out to go back into the water at that point, cos I'd had booze!

I stopped puking and could hold down a little water after about 18 hours, but the diarrhea lasted for about 32 hours.

4e7l8	It is not only SoCal. I live in Europe. A few weeks ago, my little one came from the nursery vomiting and with diarrhea. He was OK within 24 hours after some anti-vomit medication. However, about 36 hours after his first symptoms, my wife, older daughter and I got sick. I was spared from vomiting but had a fever. The others had it from both ends, but no fever. I guess, we have one lively bug enjoying itself in the wild.  	1546433733.0	ed2q0bn	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1loin	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2q0bn/

Rehydrated and ate on the 1st and was back to work today but it was brutal for those 24 hours.    My roommate had the same thing last week so it is probably stomach flu and not food poisoning.	1546504108.0	ed4ziii	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1loin	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed4ziii/

ftcrm	There was some thread on here a few days ago about eating pizza crust as an adult because you paid for it. This resonates much more with me.

N/A	I need to visit a Thai restaurant. The Japanese joint I go to isn't spicy anymore. They have the choice of mild medium and hot, I ask for hot and I hardly get a tingle. So I have to always ask them to make it hotter than they're supposed to, even then I don't get the spiciness I crave. 	1546384806.0	ed1kqbl	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1iu15	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1kqbl/

e6n5l	Ha! On the 30th, we went to a place that was running a special where you could get ghost pepper cheese in place of any cheese on the menu. I was actually kind of disappointed... I mean, it was spicy, but not the tears-inducing gut-wrench I was expecting from the waitress's description and the poor dude at the next table.  Taking a shit on the 31st, though...

jlens	I can't even with this. Last time I went to a Thai place, I asked for it "as hot as you can make it." They delivered. It was the spiciest food that had ever passed my lips.  I felt *nothing* in the tailpipe. Something is wrong with one of us.	1546389180.0	ed1q0y5	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1iu15	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1q0y5/
2koprfht	I used to do Thai hot on my pad Thai. One time, they went a bit zany. After a Thai tea, I thought all would be well. The next day, I spent an hour in the bathroom during a family gathering, and I thought my butthole was an oil fire. It was such pain.

g0x4u	That's uncanny, same exact thing happened to me last week right down to it being my usual Thai and the shifting definition of medium.

247n9qcp	The guy who runs the Thai joint I hit has been upping what "hot" is steadily ever since I said I wasn't big on his medium plus. He's trying to get me to say uncle and go back to medium plus. I won't give in. We are past extra hot at this point. It's bright orange and the first bite is an immediate "oh shit". I will not surrender. Until the day comes that it's so hot I physically cannot take a second bite, he will not win.	1546397399.0	ed1zg9b	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1iu15	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1zg9b/

There was this one kid who took all of his Soldier Fuel bars out of the MREs, and asked other kids for their Soldier Fuel bars. He took them all and ate them at the same time so he wouldn't have to shit for the next three days, and at the end of the exercise he sat in the portapotty for like fourty minutes and destroyed it with his anus. 	1546386864.0	ed1n8hr	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1in4r	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1n8hr/

li6jf	Every time I tell this story, people say I'm misremembering and it couldn't have possibly happened, but let's see how it goes this time:  As a kid, I decided I hated pooping. What I really hated was wiping, because the toilet paper never came back clean. I remember I counted and wiped 15 times once, still not clean. At some point, you just give up and deal with any possible skid marks in your undies.  So, I decided I just wasn't going to poop anymore. I was going to hold it in forever. I didn't manage that, but I went a month without pooping. I remember being positive I was going to shit my pants at one point during my attempt, but I managed to hold it in.  I didn't have any health problems or anything, I was fine the entire time. And this is why people say it can't have happened, because you wouldn't be fine after not shitting for a month. But, I swear on everything, I remember not pooping for a month.  Anyway, that's my story about not pooping for a long time.	1546396416.0	ed1yc4b	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1in4r	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1yc4b/

6rxo1	When I was a kid, I went to a Christian camp and didn't poop for almost an entire week because of poop anxiety. I couldn't hold it any longer and had to give in. I pooped the longest/biggest poop I have ever done in my entire life, even up to this point, over a decade later. It must have been 2 feet long, no exaggeration. It stuck out of the water and I was too afraid to flush it down, worried that it might clog the toilet. I left it there for some poor soul to find and possibly marvel at my creation.	1546405452.0	ed27x4z	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1in4r	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed27x4z/

c2t2p	Very much so. I don't want to give to many details about the accident in case this blows up but I broke my right big toe, right tibula plateau, and the 6th rib on my right side. I was also informed that they found 3 old fractures in my spine.  I was sent home to wait for an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon on Dec 17th who decided my leg needed surgery within 15 minutes of seeing my xray. then I had to go get an CT scan of my leg on Dec 26th which I had to hand carry to the surgeon on Dec 27th. So she could get a better idea of how much damage was done to my leg. Once I saw her she decided on what to do within 30 min.  Now I had multiple CT scans on most of my body as well as dozens of xrays which the doctors at the hospital did not find my injuries bad enough to admit me to the hospital the night of my accident. Now on Dec 31st I went into surgery where they put two plates and several screws into my leg. I am not going to be able to put weight on my leg for 8 weeks.	1546388964.0	ed1prmq	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1n9ol	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1prmq/

6lzbw	Just refreshed myself on the topic and found out why shit comes out  Fecal vomiting occurs when the bowel is obstructed for some reason, and intestinal contents cannot move normally. Peristaltic waves occur in an attempt to decompress the intestine, and the strong contractions of the intestinal muscles push the contents backwards through the pyloric sphincter into the stomach, where they are then vomited.[3]  Fecal vomiting can also occur in cats.[5]  Fecal vomiting does not include vomiting of the proximal small intestine contents, which commonly occurs during vomiting.[6]  It sounds like the shit from the large intestine is actually pushed backwards from contractions in an attempt to free stuff up but it ends up moving its way all the way to the stomach. It's apparently normal to have the stuff from your small intestine come out when you are doing normal everyday vomiting and it becomes fecal vomiting when the contents of the large intestine make their way to your stomach	1546389395.0	ed1qa60	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1q0ze	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1qa60/
6lzbw	Get miralax or the generic version of it (you'll want the generic since it's cheaper) with propylene glycol as the active ingredient. It's not a stimulant laxative and instead works by drawing water into the intestine which will soften your poop. Because of this, you can take it daily without consequences unlike other laxatives which will cause your bowels to not function well without the drug and it is very safe. It might take a day or two after taking it to work, but if you take it daily your shit will become regular and will become the consistency of soft serve ice cream. You can shit a pound of shit in like 2 seconds when you take that stuff regularly because it comes out so easily lol.   I used to be on methadone maintenance years ago, which is how I knew the shit vomit lady, and made a couple trips to the ER myself and had crap shoved up my butt there before I found miralax and never had a problem again. I have become a proponent for the stuff ever since.   The main reason you get constipated on opiates is because your intestines relax on them and stop pushing as much (there's opiate receptors in them so they pretty much get high too in a way, it's also why opiates make people nauseous at first as that relaxation can cause nausea to those not used to it) and while your poop sits there your body is constantly drawing the water out of it until it's so hard that it can't really move. Propylene glycol fixes the root of the problem by forcing your body to push water back into them so your poop can soak it in and become soft again, so soft that it can freely move through them even with them being relaxed from the opiates	1546390879.0	ed1s0k0	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1rpl2	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1s0k0/

bqg50ft	Had a coworker that couldn’t poop in the stall if anyone else was in the bathroom.  He confided this in me.  One day, I decided since I make a nickel, boss makes a dime, I was gonna poop on company time.  Entered the bathroom, one stall occupied, nbd, I’ll just use the other.  As soon as I sit down I hear the other person get up to leave. I call my poop-shy friends name out softly followed by a few fake coughs to save myself from any potential awkwardness of it not being him.  He then calls my name out in return.  He ends up being comfortable enough to do his duty.  It was a beautiful moment.  Maybe I’ve found my calling?	1546402899.0	ed25ddu	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1wghe	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed25ddu/

N/A	My ex-gf used to get the need to poop when she got excited.   It’d be like- “Omagawd you’re taking me to that fancy place I LOVE?! (Squeaking noises here, sometimes accompanied by small but rapid claps, and bouncing on the spot) WAIT I need to poop now...”  I could always tell when she was truly over the top excited because she’d jump up and down and then do a little fart. She was a tiny tiny girl so it was always small and squeaky. I found it cute at the time because I was enamoured with her. 	1546414853.0	ed2f6ix	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1wghe	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2f6ix/

ls9byff	I felt bad about going to the ER a couple months ago when I had a crazy stomach bug that left me a mess. Even when the worst of it passed, I couldn’t keep down water and I just felt weaker by the minute. I literally apologized to the triage nurse and the intake nurse for maybe wasting their time, but then I passed out in triage.  So... probably a good idea to go!  The IV worked miracles and it wasn’t until I got a ton of fluids in me did I realize how bad I’d been earlier. Dehydration sneaks up on you and kicks your ass from behind. I’m honestly afraid of what would have happened if I’d just gone to take a nap like I wanted to instead of dragging my ass to the ER. 	1546413402.0	ed2e9qe	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1ofvc	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2e9qe/

13izc4	I love spicy food and go out of my way to get super spicy food. Never had the spicy shits until a friend tricked me into eating a glob of "devil's blood" hot sauce which is 900,000 scoville heat units (pure capsaicin for reference is 16 million and a habanero sauce is typically 10-20K) and then my ass felt like it was on fire for 3 days.

qgfgan8	For me just coffee, and tobacco products help... I used to have a morning ritual where I’d grab coffee and some greasy McDonalds breakfast, eat my food, continue to drink coffee whilst smoking, get to work and maybe have another smoke, by then my day at work is just starting and i got a few minutes to spare and I’m ready to drop a bomb, if not I throw in a dip or some LL chew and get busy and within an hour (usually less) the bomb is ready, and god damn do I miss that ritual and the feeling of starting my day on base...

72ei0	Fuck, when I got my wisdom teeth removed they gave me Tylenol 3s. At first I didn't poop for a few days because that's when I was taking the meds regularly for pain.

c22nxah	My friend gave me laxative tea when I told her I was having surgery and told me a horror story about how she was on opiates after a surgery and became super backed up.

N/A	Omg you better be taking stool softeners. I felt like that on it and ended up with an X-ray that had well defined poo-bricks in my intestines. That medicine is full of lies when it tells you you don’t feel constipated.   I had an infection from surgery being treated but they gave me medicine for the poo-bricks and said “this will make it easier for you to go”.  They didn’t tell me it was ex-lax and I was high as a kite and didn’t ask what it was.  I shit me pajama pants in my fiancé’s car on the way home. Had to go strip to commando pajamas in a Walgreens bathroom. Dark times. Successful marriage.

g7csb	It sounds like you've got lazy bowel syndrome or IBS-C, but yes, get that checked by a professional because that's not normal (or healthy).

It's a typo because he is high as a goddamn kite on painkillers.

3dsrl04w	When I was a sophomore in high school, I decided to use the school bathroom.Normally, I would never do this for 2 reasons. 1, I hate using public bathrooms period. Unless I cleaned it, it's disgusting. 2, I've had bowel issues all my life where I wont be able to go for a week at  a time, sometimes longer (I've gotten much better with this in recent years.) Now, unfortunately, I had been 2 weeks since I had gone and my body decided the time to go was 11am on a Wednesday in the middle of class. I get a pass, head to restroom, and very quickly remove several pounds of trash from my body. But, here's the thing. As the poop was moving out, it stopped. I suddenly realized it had hit the bottom of the toilet but there was still poop connected IN ME. So I had to slowly stand up while STILL POOPING to finish. It came about two to three inches over the lid and was literally steaming. I freaked out, washed my hands and got out of the bathroom before anyone else showed up to see my child in the toilet. To this day, my largest shit, and one of the most terrifying things I've ever seen. (Also, it wasn't thin. The width matched the length. Don't ask how I didn't need medical attention after that, cause i have no clue)	1556479630.0	em0421u	t3_ablzuq	t1_ejxami8	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/em0421u/

ics9a	I had it around this time last year. Woke up one morning with this nasty knot in my stomach. Felt like gas or IBS cramps that wouldnt wane. Sat on the toilet because I figured it was an IBS flare and it would pass explosively. Instead found myself face deep in the trash can next to the toilet in about .003 seconds. Both ends became biohazards later in the day. Luckily it only lasted about 12 hours like that. Wake up - puke/Shit - sip water / eat bread - go back to sleep - repeat every few hours all day. 	1546406047.0	ed28ikk	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1m58u	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed28ikk/

ics9a	I think my closest spout with extreme dehydration involved alcohol as well. Camping in Orange Beach, AL in mid July, decided to get drunk. Went to bed drunk, about 80 degrees at night. I woke up feeling like absolute dog shit, and felt like absolute dog shit until days after I got home. The 8 hour ride home was fighting waves of nausea and shits, and a couple days after getting back home I finally felt better.

N/A	Man, I'm so glad I looked up tips before my surgery. I knew I'd be on oxy so I started taking a stool softener the night before. It was such a big help.

14ktso	I was given some kind of oxy when I had my tonsils removed at 27 years old, I will never forget the horror that was opiate constipation. I remember not being able to eat anything but ice cream for 2 weeks and when I finally tried pooping I had to put on a glove and dig the shit out of my ass piece by piece with my fingers. It was literally a brick of shit in me that no amount of water and laxatives would soften up. 10/10 would never do opiates again	1546398173.0	ed20bp8	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1qmkp	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed20bp8/

yl9hg	After I had knee surgery when I was 13, didn’t poop for well over a week. When I went I was on the toilet for I think like 45 minutes.

N/A	Same thing happened to me but because I ate nothing but McDonald's for two weeks straight. At the end of the second week it had been 6 days since I last shit with the urge finally hitting me. I kid you not I was on the toilet for 5 hours straight pushing, sweating, crying, and cursing with the shit not so much as peaking out for a second. By the end of it my legs were heavily shaking, I was covered in a cold sweat, and close to collapsing. Finally my shit breached and everything shot out in less than two seconds with me yelling in triumph. I looked down and what I saw was the largest turd I have ever seen with a diameter closer to 4 inches than 3 and easily over two feet.  I honestly think it was over 4 courics. Since that day I haven't touched fast food out of fear of reinacting that horrible day. 	1546401681.0	ed243sh	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1qmkp	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed243sh/
b9t7g	I totally feel you on that. Broke my lower back in 2011 and was released from the hospital after 3 days. Within 4 hours of being home I have this horrendous pain that I could only explain as being in labor. Get rushed back to the hospital turns out I’m constipated.   Hadn’t pooped in 4 days at that point. Get readmitted as they’re concerned about making sure I go. After 3 more days of not pooping my mom breaks down and goes in the bathroom, tells the nurse the shit in the toilet is mine so I can be released. 3 more days pass and I’m finally getting somewhere. Mid shit my mom screams at me that we have to go as she booked an appointment at a hair salon for me to get my hair washed. Thankfully my step dad told her to shut up and let me poo. After 2 hours of pushing, I finally get a meteor size shit that’s unflushable, think Randy Marsh from South Park. Proudest and most painful poo of my life. 	1546403169.0	ed25ndt	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1qmkp	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed25ndt/

9781j	Most laxatives don't work great when you have that issue, they are very rapid so you'll get all the stomach pain like you have diarrhea but you will still be blocked by a solid piece of stool holding everything in (horrible experience). The best option is to use magnesium citrate, get the bottled stuff from Walmart ($0.99 in cherry or lemon). It will work in about 12 hours and it kind of moistens your colon so it comes out smoothly. Don't over do it, only drink a quarter of the bottle and then another quarter if it hasn't worked after 12 hours. 	1546392677.0	ed1u37l	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1qtcb	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1u37l/

ezalg	The best meds for OIC (opioid induced constipation)** is a stimulant laxative taken with a stool softener. This will makes your poos softer and retain more water, and the stimulant will get your bowels moving giving you the urge to shit. Opioids slow down your GI tract, and that causes your poos to stay in your system longer, sucking all the moisture out of them. That makes your poo really hard and painful to pass.   Stimulant laxative and stool softener!  **Edit: The **BEST** meds for OIC medicines made specifically for constipation caused by opioids, namely methylnaltrexone, etc..	1546394792.0	ed1whdh	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1qtcb	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1whdh/

6lzbw	It doesn't really matter what time of day you take it. You just need to figure out what works for you. If you take it too often it will let you know because your poop will become too runny and then you know to dial it back some. Depending on what type of opiate you are on you could get away with once every few days or even just when you see your poop is getting harder again and coming out less effectively if you want to go that route. If you completely stop taking the stuff you can actually watch as your poop starts getting harder and harder up until it turns into the little hard pebbles that I'm sure you've experienced before lol. If you are on something like a high maintenance dose of methadone you may want to take the stuff very regularly or daily because methadone has such a high half life that it gives your intestines no off period from not functioning well. The stuff is very safe and doesn't affect your digestive system in the future since it only adds water to it so the only important thing is just figuring out what works for you. I would suggest just taking the recommended dose once per day and going from there to see what you need	1546412893.0	ed2dxq0	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed2dnk5	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2dxq0/

6lzbw	It wouldn't help too much (but can always help a little with constipation, just not enough to counteract strong opiates) because the main problem is that there are opiate receptors in your actual intestines that get activated when you take the painkillers. This causes the intestines to relax and stop moving waste through efficiently. The longer they sit there the more water the body absorbs from the poop and the harder it gets. You can take a drug, or it's generic counterpart, like miralax though which forces the body to draw water into the intestines countering this drying up of the poop. If you take it regularly it will draw enough water into the intestines regularly to make it soft enough that even with them being relaxed it will still move through them with no issue. There's also a newer drug out that is like narcan but it only acts on the intestine's opiate receptors from what I understand. This causes them not to become activated and allows them to act almost as if you aren't even taking opiates while your brain still gets the full analgesic effect of them. I am not sure how effective that one is though and haven't read about it much	1546408105.0	ed2adfs	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed2a30o	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2adfs/

wh2sf	We're within an hour now, for the first time on our safari. This close to a poem, we find relatively few comments, yet the upvotes are already in the low thousands, which is good news for us- we are *definitely* on the trail of the lesser-spotted Popular Poet.   If you listen carefully, very carefully, you will detect no hint of the poets' proximity. This is because they work via digital text, a long-range system invented by their ancestors and taught to their young.   It may not look like much, but these arrangements of short letter-groups are the height of sophistication. Their brevity belies a memetic boisterousness that captures the attention of nearby minds (*receptive* minds, at least) and attracts them, much like bees to a colourful flower. Having drawn them in with this dazzling display, the Popular Poet then provides a nutritious delivery of humorous and insightful content.   This truly is a modern marvel. 	1546395673.0	ed1xhk7	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1jyd7	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1xhk7/

New guys love the concept of getting to eat MREs, they'll devour like 3 per day......until they're 3-4 days in and they havnt taken a shit. Freaks them out. Then when we get back and get a greasy meal and some down time you see them running to an outhouse and come out limping.

N/A	You most definitely don’t have toxic megacolon after 1 week on a mostly liquid diet haha so no worries, didn’t mean to scare you. An average opiate addict not taking a shit for a week is literally common place, a very small amount/rarely it occurs. Honestly, just take magnesium citrate (has to be the citrate version) double or even triple the singular dose and you will take a shit within 8 hours for absolute sure.  And it’s actually really good for you (the magnesium) as well as a great laxative. Also maybe by some stool softeners and maybe another week laxative but you’ll be fine man trust.  Didn’t mean to scare you haha:    Edit: whoops didn’t realize you weren’t the guy constipated from oxy and this is ongoing. Well I recommend the same, maybe incorporating a daily dose of magnesium citrate into your diet. It can’t hurt to talk to your doctor because this is odd bowel behaviour but I wouldn’t say it’s at all an emergency if you’ve been dealing with it for months/year. So whenever you get time, why not bring it to your doctor. You gotta consider how much waste your body gets through poop so constipation can have a bunch of other side effects you may not even realize are from it.  	1546401916.0	ed24cjl	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed2458t	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed24cjl/

g4kbkze	I was constipated as a kid for a few weeks,  my intestines started to hurt so bad I couldn't take it no more.  When i finally told my parents and they took me to the doctor's,  he said I was days from dying.  I was transported to the clinical centre with an ambulance and emptied with the procedure.  Apparently my guts were 100% full. 2 full toilets of crap.  The guy who did the procedure,  said:" Now it's the time to take your life into your hands so we don't meet each other again.

ath2y	Yes you are skinny because you actually eat less than you need, there is less space so you feel less hungry. You may be eating shit but without realising it your calorie intake is not enough/your body has trouble taking up the nourishment because the intestine is already full lol. I would recommend at least talking with a doctor about it. You are so used to it so you don't feel what is the consequences but if you solve it you would probably feel a lot better.	1546385771.0	ed1lwi2	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1l5u1	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1lwi2/

There may he developed culture that does this due to improper types or use of bidets. But it isnt normal by any means to the rest of the world.  In fact it doesnt make much sense. If youre going to have a bidet, just get one that doesnt make you stick your hand in human shit.  The point of a bidet is being cleaner, not even dirtier than no wipe at all.  Imagine shaking hands with someone who wiped their ass with their own hand just a few minutes prior.  Wow dude. Just wow.	1550428100.0	egoblc6	t3_ablzuq	t1_egl8htt	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/egoblc6/

N/A	The best thing about my university is it’s quite old and is many separate buildings, so there’s a lot of random toilets tucked away in places that aren’t very busy. You could poop for an hour and no one would know. The downside is they’re all unisex, which I think is great ethically, but it means that I have to touch a public toilet seat to put it down cause all the blokes leave them up. Personally think we should encourage sit down wees in unisex toilets but that’s just me. 	1546434857.0	ed2qtkk	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed24xp4	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2qtkk/

Green tea. usually contains around 25 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce serving. It's about half of the amount of caffeine found in a typical cup of black tea and one-quarter of the amount found in a typical cup of coffee.  https://www.thespruceeats.com/caffeine-in-coffee-tea-cola-765276	1546414880.0	ed2f76b	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed298f6	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed2f76b/

gygdp	I mean, I’ve tried several things to increase my frequency. It doesn’t matter what my current lifestyle is. If I’m a lazy POS, don’t exercise and subsist on McDonald’s and Coca Cola, I don’t poop. If I exercise several times a week, drink water constantly, and eat mostly fruits and vegetables, I don’t poop. When I was younger, my mom had me mixing Metamucil in prune juice and, you guessed it, I still didn’t poop. This has literally been since birth. I used to projectile vomit when I got too full as a baby because it sure as hell wasn’t coming out the other end. When I was 7 I was on a heart monitor for a few weeks because the doctors didn’t believe just gas could be causing the pain I was in.

d9an7	It really bothers me how irresponsible doctors are with pain meds. And I’m talking both sides of the coin—handing out oxy like sweets to people who don’t even need it, or refusing to even give a few codeine combo pills for serious but non-chronic pain. It's like they don’t want to think about the actual situation at hand.  I consider it the mark of a lazy practitioner. If they refuse to consider the specifics of our pain, why should we trust that they’re going to seriously consider the specifics of our other ailments?	1546394066.0	ed1vo2b	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1v03o	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1vo2b/
d9an7	I think I may have read the same study, & it was definitely interesting.  While I don’t doubt the finding in general, I do have reservations about it.  Anecdote 1: Personally I have never found paracetamol to be analgesic in the slightest, for any form of pain. No effect whatsoever. Until my mid-teens I thought painkillers you could get outside hospitals were pure placebos, because all I had was Panadol. Ibuprofen was a revelation. (Weirdly enough I'd never tried aspirin.)  Anecdote 2: I’m not especially sensitive around my teeth. I sometimes forego anaesthetic when getting fillings. I got three wisdom teeth out a while back, in two rounds. The first round I was fine with ibuprofen. The second round (two teeth) I needed ibuprofen+codeine, & it was totally effective at only 400+25.6 mg, where ibuprofen alone hadn’t helped much at 1200 mg (800 + 400 an hour or so later). I admit I didn’t try mixing in the paracetamol, because I hadn’t read that article yet, but still, that's a pretty low dose of opiates for total relief. By the the afternoon of the second day I was back on 400 mg ibuprofen & by the end of the third day I didn’t need anything.  Finally, 800 mg of paracetamol 3 times a day is a lot of paracetamol. That shit's bad for your liver.	1546401331.0	ed23qax	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed20l3v	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed23qax/

e4q3w	It will be rough, but there are ways to make it easier. 1) humidifier. Unless you live in a place where nothing is ever truly dry, it will help. Keep it by the bed. 2) stay hydrated. Don’t give yourself water poisoning, but you do not want to dry out. Small sips. 3) set an alarm for your pain meds. 2 pills every 6 hours? Set your alarm for every 6 hours, even in the middle of the night. You do NOT want to wait until you feel pain to take them. 4) McDonald’s vanilla ice cream. 5) seriously, take it easy. Relax. Don’t exert yourself.  6) **Follow your doctor’s orders!!**  You very well could have a super easy recovery where this advice seems like it was overkill, but luck favors the prepared. Hope it helps :)  E: forgot to add, I was.. 32? 31?

yhkbd	Not the original person you asked, but I hope I can help since I had my tonsillectomy less than two weeks ago!  Make sure you ask your dr for liquid pain meds in case they haven’t already mentioned them.  Get an ice collar/ice pack for your neck.  LOTS of water, dehydration makes the pain worse. I also drank a bunch of coconut water in place of meals for the first few days for extra hydration and sugar.  No dairy, it can make your mucus thicker and hurt you more when swallowing.  Try sleeping with pillows propping you up so you’re not lying completely flat, it can help keep your throat less dry. I’m not sure how much this helped, but I kept a humidifier in my room.  Hope you have a speedy recovery :) Not gonna sugarcoat it, it’s pretty painful at times. But definitely try to get some extra water/soft food in your system once your pain meds kick in! It’s pretty terrible drinking water when the meds wear off and you have to wait to take them again	1546402750.0	ed257uf	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed229ee	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed257uf/
roea2	I had 4 severely impacted wisdom teeth that had to be removed under sedation - my Dad is an excellent dentist and he felt it had to be done by an oral surgeon, instead of him doing it free - that also resulted in my jaw dislocating on one side.

sqz02tl	I agree. The case with the jaw is another exception. I had 4 normal wisdom teeth pulled out by a normal surgeon.

snt2b	I got constipated after giving birth. I was drinking about double what I normally do, but apparently being in the aircon 24/7 and breastfeeding meant that I was dehydrated, even though I was drinking about 3 litres of fluid a day. When one of the nurses asked me if I had "moved my bowels" since the birth I told her no ... it was 4 days since the birth. She looked alarmed and got me some laxatives. I went the next day and honest to God, it felt like I was giving birth again. Biggest poop I've ever dropped. 	1546392672.0	ed1u303	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1mqcb	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1u303/

ath2y	Junkfood have a lot of energy in it which makes sense because you want as energy dense food as possible when you eat smaller amounts/the intestines gets less to work with. And yes the grease does fuck with your stomach which could lead to why you take so long time. I'm no expert I'm just someone on the internet with similar issues so it's better to talk to a doctor about it. I have a genetic disorder that most likely is behind it but it's pretty rare so I have gone through all the other steps to find out why first, which is why I know more than I want about it lol.  Adjusting food is the easiest to check first at least and something you can do on your own. Fiber is obvious important, for an example whole wheat bread/pasta etc. Don't overdo anything though, less junk food and more whole wheat stuff but don't base your entire life around it eating nothing else. 	1546386565.0	ed1mvf3	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1m8fm	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1mvf3/

2k6bbyuc	So why dont you use toilet paper?  Toilet culture is one thing. You have shit all over your hand.  Why not use a bar of soap? That would make way more sense. The liquid soap isnt doing anything to keep your hand clean. Theres a reasom the rest of the world doesnt wipe their ass eith their hand. Theres a reason the lady on that show who did became a meme. And here you are letting her take all the fall when youre a shit hander too.  Do you scrape out your finger nails afterward, followed by washing your hands by soaking them in alcohol?  If not, you are spreading feces everywhere  I mean come on. You specifically wipe with your left hand so you dont shake hands with your shit smearing hand. Good god these asian countries man.    Edit: Reading this article you sent me. Why couldnt they supply toilet paper? Makes no sense. You know how many peoples shit has been coated onto the plastic scoop youre dipping your shit coated hand in?  And youre pouring all of those people's shit onto your own ass. Which is far from hygenic and disgusting at best.  Im glad you atleast have a bidet now because the scoop is a shit method. Why not just use the hose? Why a plastic scoop?

1u72qbmc	(I can imagine that. I've done a two short stays for small stuff, usually driving on a suspended license, and a couple late nights for missed court dates, and different jails do it differently, but I always hate when I see a toilet in a cell just completely open to the air, with no barrier whatsoever. I'm like c'mon assholes, at least put a low wall in front of it like some jails have. Some cells come with toilet barriers, some don't.  That would certainly make me not want to take a crap, no matter how much I needed to.  When I stayed two weeks in one jail in a larger four-person cell we either waited until when we could be alone in the cell and everyone else was out, during open time, or held a blanket around ourselves. I just waited until I was by myself and tried to go quickly, lol. In another jail they had a single stall off the main area, so that's what most of us would use in that one, unless they didn't have someone else in their cell with them.)  Same thing happened to me though first time I went to boot camp. I didn't shit for over a week. Normally I'm pretty regular. But the bathrooms weren't very private and only had curtains in front of toilets that let little peekaboo view pockets in the sides, (not that anyone was looking I hope), so that probably had something to do with it.	1546403858.0	ed26dat	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1uag1	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed26dat/

That's why optometrist will recommend that you not introduce water to contact lenses, unless absolutely necessary. They want you to use contact solution to clean or disinfect the lenses. This is very true for people that wear hard lenses, as those lenses are reused for extended periods of time.	1546391075.0	ed1s8o4	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1m82y	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1s8o4/

in3nbu8	I had an ex who would smoke to induce a bowel movement.  I've always chalked it up to other things - she'd have her breaks at the same times everyday, leading to a regular 'poop phase,' which just so happened to be her 'smoke phase.'  I would likewise assume most people have daily coffee routines as well (such as breakfast time, afternoon tea, after dinner) leading to further correlation but not an actual cause.  The smell of coffee is part of that 'phase' of day, so - well, must be poop time.  That said individual is on a poop-routine (a pooptine, if you will) further encourages this as their bowels are full.  That I wake up when the sun comes up whether my curtains are drawn or not has less to do with some extra-sensory perception of solar radiation on the roof and a lot more to do with my routine being diurnal.  Similar thing with the shower - even if I go to the toilet right before hopping in the shower, I feel the need to whizz because for *years* hot water on my shoulders means time for a piss.	1546403231.0	ed25poi	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed21oe7	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed25poi/

w80177w	Doctor here. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s usually saved as a very very last resort (after enemas fail). Don’t worry, lots and lots of lube is used.  Fun fact: it’s the one of the things they “let” the medical student do. (More like force) Fortunately, I survived my medical training without having to do one. Probably because I have huge hands.	1546392787.0	ed1u7qa	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1nyb8	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1u7qa/

ic9lh	I did this after having my baby.  Poop spoon upthread reminded me that I considered doing that.  Used my finger instead.  Picked away at some, and the pressure collapsed the poop onto itself until I pooped.  No fucking fun at all.  When picking at your poop is the best option you know you are fucked.  That was after the laxatives I finally asked for.	1546397471.0	ed1zj7r	t3_ablzuq	t1_ed1nyb8	/r/AskReddit/comments/ablzuq/people_who_havent_pooped_in_2019_yet_why_are_you/ed1zj7r/

97hfo	I’m definitely down with the idea that I might just have a good regular poop time, that JUST HAPPENS to coincide with first morning coffee time, I sometimes wondered if that might be the case. Or as you suggest, if the smell/first sip of coffee just suggests “it’s poop time” and the body makes it happen.   I’m not sure I’ve ever typed the words “poop time” together, and certainly not twice in quick succession, so thanks — this has been fun.

wrrnu	No. I might not like finding gore, but I prefer the current version. I think it becomes a bigger debate than I would like. There's fine art, medical photos and tattoos that are not purely for sexual titillation, amongst others, that shouldn't be called porn but still fit NSFW. Surgery photos can be flagged as porn,  someone might flag it gore, even if it's just stitches.   I like some repetitive posts because I might have missed the first post, but being able to see a repetitive flag might be cool as long is does not result in downvoting those posts excessively.	1611864924.0	gl51giu	t3_l7530r	t3_l7530r	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl51giu/

dvbh3	Actually, I wish the mods of AskReddit would pretty much figure out the questions that get repeated all the time, and just make a schedule for them. I love to see interesting questions, but fuck do I hate having to see repeat questions, sometimes a week apart.  I get that not everyone is on here has read some of the more interesting, nay historical, responses to some questions.  And sometimes people have new responses to common questions.  But fuck mods, actually do your job and figure out some way to fix these issues.  Especially for people trying to basically karma farm off the questions/responses.	1611866854.0	gl56upa	t3_l7530r	t3_l7530r	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl56upa/

12iytv	I’d rather there be more effort done on limiting and punishing reposts, and consistency among mod teams. As right now reposts on some subreddits are atrocious, and some mod teams are hot garbage and controlling which makes the ones just doing their work look bad.    Beyond that I think you need 3 NSFW filters: one for adult content (porn and the like), one for violence and gore, and one more as a just a general nsfw tag that isn’t porn or gore but not really safe	1611867102.0	gl57jvs	t3_l7530r	t3_l7530r	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl57jvs/

51xuaa8q	The titles usually indicate what the post will be. I'm 14 years old and understand what I'm gonna look at when clicking a link. All it takes is reading the title, which sub you are in, and if it's nsfw.   I also have a below average iq. Basically you can call me mildly retarded and I have papers to prove it. People here always want to be politically correct instead of just using common sense.  Let's start a damn revolution cause we are bored instead of using common sense.

3d8uh4x2	Is there any reason why they haven't done this yet? It seems like an easy enough feature to roll out-- granted, I know next to nothing about web design or coding, so I could be completely wrong. But from an outsider's perspective it doesn't seem that hard to add another tag that functions identically to the current NSFW tag, just with a different name. Aren't there already subs that do this, with a NSFL (not-safe-for-life) tag in addition to the regular NSFW tag? People have vocally shown support for this idea for a while, and I literally don't understand why it hasn't happened.	1611872645.0	gl5msh5	t3_l7530r	t3_l7530r	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl5msh5/

6e4yj8pq	Make them all searchable.  Make them all where the visibility can be turned on and off in desktop and more importantly in the mobile app: Implement an "On/Off" switch like "NSFW" currently is.   These features i'm sure would certainly help to resolve the issue of accidently viewing certain things: (sensitive subjects, gore, porn or inappropriate language material) in front unsuitable witnesses (parents, boss, friends, partner) or on monitored wifi servers by employers or educators. Making the change into a physical button switch would save alot of user time and ultimately would leave more time for browsing.	1611885772.0	gl6gv29	t3_l7530r	t3_l7530r	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl6gv29/

Wait, you mean they're not going away? Well that's still bullshit. I shouldn't have to check a box to be a dick! Fuck Reddit. They aren't shit. I love Parreddit. It's new and improved Parlor and Reddit mix where you can shit on somebody's face while driving over a cat with a fucking Nazi Flag draped across your unshaven scrote. That's where I wanna spend my time parusing. I mean who doesn't want that, like all the time?!? Damn thought police. Wanting me to see no brains or dislodged eyeballs unless what? I ask them to show me that shit? I mean what the fuck? Arrrgghhhh! I'm so mad I'm gonna put my horns on and ram my head through a blue wall. Not like a Congressmembers office but just like any blue wall I can find that's obviously not concrete.  That'll teach en to fuck with the insurrectionist horn licking Proud Patties. Yeah patties bc they taste good. Yeah. Ohhhhhh yeah. Patties. I like parties like also and too n stuff.   Bro I would so sue Reddit for those minutes. You will never. And I mean NEVER get those 3-5 minutes back. That's not right.  And just to help other more sensitive or traumatized ppl feel able to search without having a PTSD induced panic attack?!?! I mean who do they think they are? Reddit users??? They don't count! Only the team mfers who see and say everything count! Oh yeah!!!! [And yes I mean oh yeah in the vain of the Kool Aid man].  You bust that wall down bro. Bust it down for the rights of bros everywhere not to have to consider ANYONE but themselves. Ever. Yeah. Oh fuck yeah. That's what I'm talking about!

N/A	Frankly I think adding a GORE tag would make the subject easier for they who dislike gore to avoid   I think sometimes we forget to separate ourselves from others through means of "common" identification, that we aren't the single things which exist online or through digital representation and I think, from that fact, we shut out things like gore not from spite or from enmity but rather from either our inability to face ourselves or from fear of coincidental association   And I think a GORE tag would make separation a mite easier  I mean, double-checkin's fine but   Shouldn't have to, right?	1611944743.0	gl9peys	t3_l7530r	t3_l7530r	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl9peys/

adfm4	It fucking angers me how bad reddit is at hypotheticals. I love the hypotheticals game, I played it with my friends all the time. But somehow when reddit plays the hypotheticals game, it's like "you get all the money and power you want in the world, you get a beautiful home anywhere on the world, and every woman on earth will instantly fall in love with you. But your farts smell 20% worse. Do you do it?" and somehow 50,000 people upvote it. Makes me really angry.

For a simple example, making it illegal to drive over the age of 75 is age discrimination and infringes on the rights of the individual by disregarding individual ability.

cgaxw	Agreed, especially because some forums make you use the NSFW for non sexual nudity as well, which is 100% fine and happens all the time in my own profession (costume designer)  Some places, like r/crochet and (I think) r/sewing, make you put NSFW tags on stuff like bikinis and underwear sewing, even if you don't see much skin. I personally don't care if my kids see a boob or two, as  long as they/the other person doesn't care- since lockdown they've become pretty used to people standing in our living room in their underwear.   I'm also European so culturally it's not such a big deal.    But I miss all those posts that I love and find useful, because normally I have all NSFW blocked, because gore or violence I very much mind the kids seeing by accident.  I mind *a lot* if they see gore.  I personally hate that movies/tv seem to rate implied sex as rated R and literally someone being killed on screen as rated G.  Insane.  Think about if it was real life: your kids walk in on you having sex? They'll get over it/not even know what they're seeing at the time/not care.  Your kids walk in one someone they know being killed? (Remember, kids can't distinguish fantasy/reality the way adults can.). They will be traumatized for life.    The fact that we have to clump truly horrifying gore with a person wearing a bikini is insane.	1611868187.0	gl5anth	t3_l7530r	t1_gl4tb1n	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl5anth/

13q1r2m3	This! I swear to God I end up wasting more time reading or scrolling past repetitive comments complaining about reposts then I do reading or scrolling past posts I've already seen. Especially since most of the time the repost is the first time I've even seen it. It's almost as if not everyone on Reddit has seen every post when it was first uploaded. Of course there are reposts. I bet a lot of reposters didn't even see the original like most of the people who upvoted the repost. I'd even go so far as to say people reposting the better posts actually makes Reddit more enjoyable for all but the most addicted redditors who spend all their time here in order to encounter all the oc when it's oc.	1611870541.0	gl5h7ny	t3_l7530r	t1_gl57sem	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl5h7ny/

3601e	A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist  ”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”  At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.  ”How old is this rock, pinhead?”  The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”  ”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”  The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!  The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.  The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  ^(This copypasta is not mine, I borrowed it from a post I saved a long time ago)	1611873444.0	gl5oqpx	t3_l7530r	t1_gl55xd0	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl5oqpx/
8bdho	What's this you've said to me, my good friend? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.	1611876491.0	gl5vxgk	t3_l7530r	t1_gl55xd0	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl5vxgk/

7ixqyevg	A highly trained operator wouldn't make internet threats. Instead, he would quietly utilize his resources to track the person down. Once he obtained a grid (location), he would then schedule some leave days (if the location is of a vast distance) to QUIETLY move into position and wait for his intended target. Once the target is down and his objective complete, he will then make his way back to the installation. Because he did everything "quietly" no one will ever know, and the intended target's death will forever remain a mystery...	1621323213.0	gyjldzl	t3_l7530r	t1_gl55xd0	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gyjldzl/

Nobody needs a psycho-social calamity as a role model. Jesus fucking christ I hate organized religions and i 100% think yeezus might have saved more lives than christ cost  Yall be murdering infidels since long before anyone asked you to. Long before it was cool. And long since we all told you to fucking chill, stop raping children murdering your cult followers. It's not a good look. And then you rape children. Woops! I got better! About part of it! I guess. Maybe? Cant I rape several kids a year? I'm the representative of God, you know. Its gods will. I'll rape them quietly.. god wills it! God wills it!! Stop hurting me!!"   Jokes on you. Preacher never gets beat. You just let him rape your children, as if it was right. Yes.

5f1yw	As an antifa communist, i think Nazis and fascism are a little bit more than "boogeymen", you know? After all, they were the group of people who both advocated for and committed horrible acts like forcing other people's boogers inside your nose!  "Boogeymen" is the word we use to refer to the group of people who advocated *against* this horrible practise. It's a common mistake! Boogeymen (or as we say in the community, "Booger Folks") are actually really compassionate and kind people! You've probably met a lot of us throughout your life and never knew it.

tbjz8	The way of adapting would be about half of all birds dying. So yes it will adapt, but maybe not at the pace we would want. Removing all mosquitoes or any common insect is removing a massive biomass from the ecosystem. I would not be surprised if that killed more people than mosquitoes have.  I'm totally with you though, life always finds a way here on earth. It just can be a deadly way sometimes and it really has to be one way or another.	1611937635.0	gl95ew0	t3_l7530r	t1_gl7b3yj	/r/AskReddit/comments/l7530r/how_would_you_feel_about_reddit_adding_3_nsfw/gl95ew0/

k2nhv	It would be better if they had to live *with* their lowest salaried employee for a month or two, imo.    In their house, dinner with the family, travel to and from work together, same lunch, kids with homework, the works.  Building that relation would imo do much more for this problem than just "experiencing below your normal standard of living before returning to it"..

5lq7pogi	There was this similar themed show in Hongkong and Mainland China years ago.  They swapped billionare with bottom feeders, let the rich do the basical job, on the lowest salary, to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort.   Nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere, regardless of how hard they worked, even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society.  There was only despair, and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense.  It stirred big debate among the society back then, and I think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled .  There was also another show in China, swapping senior political figures with community level council workers, to see how good they could do in each other's posts. The mayors were flooded by the angry mobs who kept asking for more and more benefits that were impossible to fullfil, by the end had to admit the amount of work at basic community level was too much to archieve anywhere.  The show also got cancelled quite soon after a few episodes.	1581074912.0	fgs78x5	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs78x5/

g7cnr	It’s more than just the money. It’s the lack of security these people endure. Not knowing if you’ll lose your job tomorrow and having no savings. Being kicked out of your home. An unexpected bill you can’t afford, which may lead to increasing debt.   Putting these rich people in a “poor” lifestyle for a month isn’t enough. Even if they lost their money and homes, they’ll have such a huge network that they’ll be back on their feet in the time it takes for us peons to earn enough to eat for a week. They can never truly understand what it’s like to be poor or ever face that reality again.   So what would happen? It’d be a completely self-serving advert about how “now I realise that we need to do more for our employees.” The workers get a small vanity bonus, probably give an immigrant worker with limited English a car, pat themselves on the back. Then two weeks later, we’ve all forgotten about the show and they’ll go back to their old ways.	1581074791.0	fgs75do	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs75do/

cqyej	Lots of rich people voluntarily go on vacation to third world countries. The catch is, they know they have a way out and an end date.   I'd be interested to watch a show where the CEO had to personally be financially responsible for the welfare of 50% of their lowest payed employees for 10 years, and their net growth percentage equalled their bonus every year, with a big bonus if both the company and the employees were profitable at the end.	1581072488.0	fgs5fcp	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs5fcp/

15lxlh	I'd do more than a month and without any contact to rich buddies either. If it's a month, I think a lot would just buy rice and beans every day and go "See? It's super easy to be poor! You just need to make economical choices! I've proven myself right!" Longer than that and they'll really have to get used to how their lowest paid employees live. Would they learn a lesson? Maybe. Likely not. They still have a mansion to come back home to. They'll give their lowest paid people a one time bonus or maybe they'll drag one out in front of a camera to give them a fancy car so their own reputation gets better. And then they won't change anything else.	1581073076.0	fgs5uif	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs5uif/

evimx	They wouldn't have any trouble. Most of them are self made and most have a large number of financial skills that 99% of people don't. They'd micro their finances and come out better off than most people.  You think someone like Jeff Bezos, or Bill Gates, or Elon Musk couldn't handle it? Or what about Warren Buffet? The dude is already living a modest life.  A lot of dumbasses in the comments seem to fail to realize that a lot of these billionaires were already in a super shitty position before, and pulled themselves out of it.

r9kgl	You should watch Undercover Billionaire on Discovery (not to be confused with Undercover Boss). Billionaire Glenn Stearns moves to Erie PA with just $100, a truck and no contacts and has to make a company valued at $1 million in 90 days. He also can't mention who he is to anyone. It's pretty much exactly like you are describing and insanely entertaining.	1581078461.0	fgsafyc	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsafyc/

ici2o	No.   Slumming is not living your entire life in a slum.    Here is what will happen:   - Fake billionaires like Trump will come to this show. Real billionaires will probably not.   - those who appear on this show will brag about how they are self made and their employees could make do with even less.    - We will find out, like Naked and Afraid, that outside of cameras these billionaires were living in their luxury RVs , sipping martinis and having affairs.	1581089676.0	fgsp76o	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsp76o/

They wouldn't have to truly live like a person does who lives hand to mouth every day of their lives.

11d5zx	As Jarvis Cocker said  " But still you'll never get it right 'Cause when you're laid in bed at night Watching roaches climb the wall If you called your Dad he could stop it all, yeah  You'll never live like common people"  Even in a miracle situation where a show like this wasn't obviously rigged and legitimately did have the CEO go for a month on a low salary without any support they'd still know at the back of their mind they can walk away any time. This would make the poor situation they're in possible to cope with as they know for a fact there's an exit to the misery which on screen would translate to them happily getting on with it and the perception that it isn't so bad for the common worker.  The only way it would really work is if you tricked the CEO into really believing they'd lost their entire fortune. Then you'd see them totally fall apart.	1581076017.0	fgs8690	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8690/
3evakwj	I’ll be a contrarian here and say that I bet they would be able to thrive.

2j7po5p2	I support raising the minimum wage and the concept definitely resonates, but the show concept is not going to be life-changing for anyone involved.  I will brace for the down-votes, but I don't understand why we fault people for making a lot of money (as long as they do it honestly). The dark secret of any executive, athlete, artist, actor, etc. who makes an exceptional amount of money is that this is what the market will pay them. The CEO of company X likely has a skill set that is very useful for planning corporate strategy that few people have and that takes decades to develop (understanding of finance, ability to read market trends, skill negotiating partnerships and labor agreements). If they are good at this, the company and its shareholders (if they're publicly traded) will also benefit. So, this is in many ways an investment.  As for the workers who earn less, we should raise the minimum wage. But, they too are free to seek employment elsewhere if someone will pay them more money. It doesn't make sense getting angry at market dynamics.  If any company were to apply a policy overnight that "we are going to pay our CEO the same as our assembly line workers, you would likely see that company go bankrupt soon as because the only people willing to do that job at that price, probably don't have the experience to do it wisely. All the qualified candidates took jobs at your competitor's factories where they were offered more. Same is true for basketball, or any other sport. People pay you money because they believe you'll make them money.  Edit: Clarified thought on workers' wages	1581074639.0	fgs714k	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs714k/
13xlam	Simple: they would immediately be promoted.  Most of the rich people aren't rich because they win lotteries or anything, being rich is a mix of luck and skills. Of course if you're born in rural Zimbabwe you won't become rich, but if your life is circulating between bartending job and watching Netflix, then it's not lack of luck that's keeping you away from being successful, it's your lazy ass.	1581075481.0	fgs7pq8	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs7pq8/

eb6ge5e	No.  Because I'm not an angry socialist, I'm a capitalist.  But I'd like to watch one of a hundred documentaries where a guy has a good idea, works 18 hours a day for a decade while everyone else is getting safe jobs, goes a hundred million in debt, hires a kick-ass creative team, turns it into something world-changing, then all you infantile bitches have to acknowledge becoming a billionaire is hard as fuck and they usually deserve their money.    If you would like the titles to those documentaries, open your refrigerator, look in your garage, or check the name of the device you're reading this on.  However, the germ of your premise, I agree with.  People should be paid a fair wage.  Stop stroking your dicks to the idea of a billionaire with a flat tire.  I find no enjoyment at the idea of you trying to make your own baby food with a hand masher, or using whale oil to read from the bible for one hour per night.  Billionaires created those luxuries for you, and now you pay pennies for them, you filthy, miserable, spoiled pricks.  (also, fuck Trump, he never contributed a fucking thing to our society except turmoil, so don't paint me with that brush).	1581077169.0	fgs973f	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs973f/

ipclw	No, reason being there is no chance it would be real. Giving the amount of money CEOs(by that I mean a real CEO of a big corporation not some random entrepreneur) make in a month I'd doubt any TV network would be able to afford to pay one enough to agree to participate. It would probably cost more than a famous hollywood actor. Regardless, I'd be more interested in seeing the shareholders be a part of this than the CEO, the shareholders I consider the real assholes since the CEOs(unless they own the majority of shares) are forced to act the way it's most beneficial to the shareholders.	1581072725.0	fgs5ld9	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs5ld9/

axja	Yeah, actually. You'd have to get medieval making sure they don't cheat. You could go to companies and swap their worst and best paid employees round.  What would happen? A lot of them would die. They would be swapping places with someone who lives in a very different part of town and they would stick out like a billionaire in Compton. They would be surprised to discover how little time they have left once they have to commute, possibly get the kids from school, shop, cook, tidy up etc. I think some would discover they like having neighbours.

7ag7k	No. The billionaire CEO would go to a bank and get a loan to maintain a strong bank of money and likely find ways to invest that money to supplment their pay. The billionaire would immediately go try and negotiate higher salary. And might try leveraging any real estate assets for things like a HELOC or cash out refinance.   The show would turn into "watch billionaires show how poor people are only poor because they are dumb."

aewpz	I wouldn't watch because I fucking hate reality TV. That said, I think it'd be pretty boring. Predictable even.  But I think they'd do fine. There's no way they'd be in a job risk situation, so that issue is out the door, and that's probably the biggest one other then financials.   The kinda people who get to that level often have above-average financial management skills. They'd certainly have an extremely different lifestyle for the period, but I don't think they'd be scrimping for money. And the thing a lot of people sometimes fail to understand...especially in the cases of people who built their financial empires...these are the kinds of people who work *constantly*. Even on holiday they are not really on holiday. And just because they're not doing manual labor or filing paperwork all day doesn't mean they work less...having the weight of a large company, or multiple companies and all the shareholders, legal structures, accounting regulations, etc is a *lot* to have on your shoulders. They have to constantly be on top of things or shit goes south in a hurry.  Now, if the person in question had certain personality characteristics or...issues (ie addictions), that might make things much more interesting. But also remember this...the financial sector is built on cocaine...lots and lots of cocaine. Mountains of cocaine. Continental plates of cocaine.  What I'm saying is...don't do cocaine.

gyr64	No.  Not a bit.  As compelling as the schadenfreude is, it wholly misses all the relevant points.  Basically, watching a billionaire temporarily inconvenience themselves by larping as a poor person would just be salt in the wound.  Because as much as reality TV would play up their misery, it's all bullshit.  Because they'd never REALLY be in any danger.  They'd never REALLY be one bad month away from homelessness.  They'd never REALLY be at risk of dying because they can't pay for medicine.  They'd never REALLY be worrying that they can't eat this week because they want to be able to feed their kids.  They'd never REALLY be at the complete mercy of some petty manager who is ten years younger than them and half as educated and who smugly lords power over them about the pettiest shit possible like whether or not they ask permission to go to the bathroom despite being a grown adult.  And they will never REALLY have to swallow their actual pride and take his arrogant power trip because without their steady paycheck they might actually die.  NO billionaire can or will ever be in that position and pretending that they can  understand it because they have to eat some gas station food for lunch for a few weeks is deeply insulting to everyone who has to deal with that shit every day of their lives.  And the fact that they have to deal with that shit every day of their lives BECAUSE that same billionaire can't be bothered to pay people a living wage or treat them with dignity or imagine them complexly is only adding insult to literal economic injury.  This would be just like undercover boss:  some dipshit rich person pretends to be poor and has a magical awakening moment when they realize that poor people are just like everyone else and then at the end of the episode it's revealed i a dramatic moment where the rich person gives 3 people a ton of  money and we act like that makes up for how shitty the lives of all their other employees are.  Meanwhile, that rich dipshit just got millions in free advertising and can write all those donations off as a business expense.  &#x200B;  This rich person porn fetish is repugnant in the extreme and it's time for it to die.

The guy knows that no matter what after 30 days he gets to go back to nibbling on caviar while floating on his yacht in the carribean (note: caviar is the pet nickname he has for his misstress, who is also a supermodel.)   Part of poverty is the crushing hopelessness of it. That no matter what you do this is your life and there is no hope of it ever getting better. If your car dies, it stays dead, if you get sick you get to choose which of your utility bills you arent paying so you can afford the doctor's visit, with the added benifit that a single missed day of work means that you can't afford to both pay for rent and buy groceries.  Do you gamble and see if it clears up on its own against the chance it gets so bad you can't work at all? Do you become delinquent on the power bill, the water bill, or thr rent? Which one will give you enough sympathy to not ruin you if you grovel and beg convincingly enough? Will your boss give you paid time off to see the doctor, or do you have to try to find one who works outside of 9-5 working hours who is also not going to charge you the equivalent of a month's salary just to show up in his waiting room?	1581127172.0	fguqmcj	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fguqmcj/

28e1hue8	I know this may be too late, but come on guys. This is stupid. Just do 5 seconds of research.  About 68% percent of today's billionaires are self made entrepreneurs   9/10 of the world's richest people are self made.  What does this mean? They do know what it's like. They likely were working their *sses off in a garage to start their companies, making less money than you probably. Even CEOs elected by a board were broke college students at one point. So I hate to tell you, but this isn't the Boss Baby, and billionaires aren't just born CEOs. They either made it themselves or were elected by a board of directors at age 30 or smth.  Don't like companies and corruption? I got news for you. You can't fix it by posting about how billionaires suck on Reddit. If 68 percent of billionaires are self made, you can be too. Start a company. Maybe go to business college. Get your employees the treatment YOU want. Seize the day	1589735110.0	fqxnosi	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fqxnosi/
3d9n8u0w	Let’s assume he’s a self made billionaire. If so, then he’s probably got a good idea of how to live cheap. Most of the millionaires I know started poor. They’re some of the thriftiest people I know.  So: billionaire, on his own. He takes the cheapest apartment he can find. He has access to every program his employee is on (so he has the same resources.) He probably buys rice and beans and canned items for food. Figures out the best way to commute so he uses the least amount of money. Makes sure to save a few dollars every week.   Then, he figures out his schedule. On his day off he offers tutoring in math/speech/whatever. It’s not much, but he can save that. Maybe he offers babysitting. But he doesn’t waste a second.  He ends the month with a few hundred in savings. The show is canceled without ever airing. Why?  Because there is a MAJOR psychological factor to poverty! And there is an EDUCATION aspect to poverty. They’ve actually done things like this. They’ve found that some wealthy people spend less per week than some really poor people. They’ve found that when a rich person is given a minimum wage salary, they use it much more wisely.   As for why the show is canceled... it’s the exact opposite of what anyone wants to see. No one wants to see a rich man ‘prove’ that you can get out of poverty with dedication and hard work. It makes people feel guilty and bad and feeds into the inferiority complex that fuels much of poverty. It isn’t inspiring; it’s embarrassing.  My grandparents built themselves up from absolutely nothing. Two of them actually became really wealthy. My parents, who are now wealthy, know how to live frugally. Every rich person I know, who became rich in their own lifetime, can live on very little. They may not enjoy it, but they can.   And, more importantly, they know they can build themselves up. Most people in poverty don’t know that, and many lack the education necessary to build themselves up, even if they did know it was possible. (And by ‘know’ I mean internally, not consciously.)   Poverty is complex, but putting a rich man into poverty would just prove it’s beatable. And that isn’t a narrative people these days want to hear.	1593390036.0	fwbhmso	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fwbhmso/

yk73v	Yes, I would love a show like that, as long as they are housed in a setting that equals about half of their net pay, for rent and utilities, which will come out of their weekly pay before the show starts to house them.  Based upon half of their net income (I have paid up to 65% at times) The producers will have to find them an apartment share or one room to rent somewhere that is paid for beforehand for the length of the show.   And if they can't afford car payments and insurance out of the remainder of their net income, they have to use public transportation or a bicycle or walk or ride share etc to get back and forth to work, grocery shopping, etc.   And, being able to afford a cellphone is out of the income also, can be a part of their utility expenses, If they can afford it.

3qvv3uzc	I have seen a British show where someone senior in the company goes undercover and does a normal job at the bottom of the ladder. Under the pretence it is being filmed as any old regular new starter. It did actually lead to quite a few changes - one was the night shift stacking shelves in a supermarket weren't allowed to *talk* as it was felt it affected productivity. It might have, but it was miserable and people weren't sticking around because of it.   They didn't try and live on minimum wage, but I have seen politicians do that - I forget his name but a Tory MP lived on the dole for a while years ago.	1581073479.0	fgs65ce	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs65ce/

58lysykd	a billionaire doesn't necessarily need to be rich in the traditional sense. In most cases of Silicon Valley/Startup Billionaires, these people have less liquidity than even minimum wage workers. Their net worth/fortune usually stems only from the valuation/stock they hold in the company. In early stages, no stocks can be sold and the company runs at a loss. This, in turn, means that he can't liquidate stock for cash and he needs to pay himself a dollar a month salary while his employees make regular paychecks. He basically only has paper money and no actual cash he can spend. A billionaire can, and is often, be poorer than his lowest paid employee.	1581074927.0	fgs79dd	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs79dd/

CEO finds the spirit of Christmas, shit, I mean, admits to error of his ways, touches a poor person with own hands, everyone lives happily ever after and we don’t need to change the problem of rising income inequality as long as we continue to hand pick one random poor person worthy of inspiration porn and raise them above their status to keep the rest of the naughty poor people in line.	1581078539.0	fgsaiuy	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsaiuy/

4wrg1	A month is just a vacation roughing it.  A year. And not being able to leverage any of their existing contacts or circles for anything.  Plus at least one medical condition far more common to the lowest-level employee social strata than to the CEO strata, and artificially recreated lower levels of health (exhaustion, constant irritation, minor aches and pains, more easily caught flu etc). Plus not being able to do anything which would rely on knowledge the low-level employee probably wouldn't have (tertiary degree knowledge, knowledge of esoteric law or business dealings, etc).  And give them the worst existing supervisor/boss in the company. One who is utterly ignorant of who the CEO is.  And don't just have them live somewhere low-class and shit. Make them have horrible roommates in order to be able to afford anywhere to live. Make them have to buy and eat lower-income food, and wear lower-income clothes, and constantly fight petty bureaucracies they have no power over.  And then tell them at about the nine-month mark that they'll be doing another year of this.

3ppfr5oe	One major issue is they still have the skills and knowledge of their privileged life.  Regardless of the long-term effects or degrees, with the skills and knowledge they already have they can jump ahead leaps and bounds.  This means they won't learn a meaningful lesson.    For example, I teach students who are well off, but many of their parents dislike or distrust modern tech.  I have to teach them over and over how to make a copy of a google doc into their own drive.  It's a basic skill a lot of us take for granted, but without the ability to navigate modern tech due to lack of opportunity and access, we don't learn it.    The wealthy have those skills and will probably succeed regardless without learning anything of how the rest of the world has to live.	1581079434.0	fgsbg7n	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsbg7n/

pq9tc	I honestly think this would have the opposite effect that most would want to see.   Being in this situation becomes more difficult as time goes on. Month after month of struggling takes a far bigger mental toll. You never seem to make any progress and day to day you feel that as long as you can minimize the amount you fall back, that is the "win ".    You throw someone in the ring of a company they know a good deal about,  mentally fresh,  and has the light at the end of the tunnel to get out? Think they be put in a situation that they could be more successful than the average person in the situation.  Which would give more fire to "pulling yourself up by the bootstraps ".   I am not saying that all CEOs would be better off,  more that we would have a cherry picked situation and that would be spun into minimum wage people are lazy.

Risking a kidney infection and hospitalization because they cant afford to take off work or pay a copay to see a dr for a uti, let alone the cost of meds.  They wouldn't understand the hopelessness and exhaustion of grinding every single day only getting deeper into the hole with no end in sight.    They would show a rich person dismayed at the cost of groceries. It would be a parody of what millions of Americans go through every day.	1581081392.0	fgsdn7q	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsdn7q/
1icny333	  I would watch it if they were on an equal informational and emotional footing as their lowest paid employee.    For instance had to adopt the same diet, habits, friend/family group obligations ,appearance. have no access to any websites or networks that employee does not use. Could not use knowedge beyond the scope of their lowest paid employee, have to spend an equal amount of time sitting idle as it would take for their lowest paid employee to learn though traditional course work and incurr the same costs all while working to access savings plans financial instruments and the like.   All this coupled with medical injection of drugs to emulate the emotional state and cortisol levels of the lowest paid worker. Throw in a leg brace or repetitive motion injury to emulate the health of the lowest paid worker.

The guy who told me about it said his l”kid” got sick, they had no babysitter, had to call off work to take care of them. Then they needed govt assistance but office for applications only open 9-5 and they worked two jobs and couldn’t take time off because they had called off because of sick kid. So didn’t get govt assistance, then ppl say “well there’s help you’re just not using it” ended up losing house, and so forth. The guy who is a professional and successful himself, said he was moved to tears by the end. He felt frustrated, helpless.

4d6go	One issue is that the CEO in the lowered position knows, if suddenly they are diagnosed with cancer, the experiment will be over and they'll get the care they need.  They know if the worker is laid off, they experiment would be over, and they'll return to their comfort.  If the CEO has their parents or children suddenly fall ill and need something, they have the resources to help them.  None of this is true for the common worker.  The common worker experiences a level of stress over finances, health, and family unlike anything the CEO experiences.  That stress wears on you, and the fatigue is one more factor that keeps people from moving up in employment and finances.  The best indicator of success in the US isn't your IQ or how hard you work.  It's what zip code your parents live in.	1581086157.0	fgsjulp	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsjulp/

N/A	I would watch it but I doubt it would change the CEO's outlook at all. Many of them know their employees struggle but they don't care at all. I think they'd just use it as an opportunity for a PR campaign. They'd probably just talk a lot about how "they at Company X care about their employees" and then at the end they might give everyone a raise that is equal to the rate of inflation so there's really no raise	1581086629.0	fgskj1h	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgskj1h/

2hrts0wl	It wouldn’t really give a full picture of how a poor person lives to the billionaire.  Poverty compounds over time.  You can’t afford to get your teeth regularly cleaned so it becomes a huge bill when they’re rotten.  You need to buy a car?  It’s $10k.  If you had the cash, you could offer $8500 and get it.  But you don’t, so you have to finance it and it ends up costing you $14900 over the next 3 years.  You paid nearly double for it because you can afford it less.	1581086831.0	fgsktoj	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsktoj/
N/A	How about a show where the lowest paid employee has to do the CEOs job for three months with their pay? How would they handle trade negotiations, negotiations with labor (give them all they want), shortages of materials, increasing regulations, reporting to stockholders why the company is losing money.    The drop in stock price that means the company doesn’t have the money to invest in improvements to keep up with the competition so it has to borrow more and more money, then eventually shuts down because the CEO at the competition overseas or across the country is sharper and takes their business. Then the employee-turned-CEO has to face all their colleagues and explain why they don’t have jobs anymore.    Who would watch that?	1581086960.0	fgsl0ms	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsl0ms/

4ocdf	It would backfire.  See, even though the CEOs would be slumming it on low financial resources, they would still be treated better than "regular" workers, because everyone would know who they were. It's not that the jobs themselves are hard, at the bottom. We're not talking about trapeze performances or nuclear physics research. What makes it difficult is (a) being treated like garbage by everyone, and (b) the hopelessness of knowing that it will never improve.  He would have to do mildly unpleasant work, and would bask in the glory of condescension, but he would still be treated like a CEO and the only thing that would happen is that he'd finish his month and then bloviate about how he did the workers' jobs better than they could.  Make it 5 years and give his immediate manager the power to fire him– meaning he'll be out on the streets for the remainder of that time– and then you have a concept.  All of this is evidently true because, in the U.S., almost all of the wealthy claim to be self-made. And, sure, most of these people successful before they receive their inheritances, but that's because they benefit so much from who their daddies are. They can take real risks at work because no one is going to fire then, and they get careers handed to them as everyone seeks favor from the big guy from whose pecker they came.	1581087120.0	fgsl936	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsl936/

b5pof5h	Not unless the billionaire thinks it's a permanent "demotion."   Anyone can hang in there if they know that the suffering will end.   The point that needs to be driven home is that for millions of people there is no end. That IS their permanent reality.   Endless toil in a system that seems designed to frustrate their best efforts to pull themselves up will reveal the billionaire's true character.	1581087167.0	fgslbnh	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgslbnh/

This feeling of restlessness, constant stress checking if you can afford enough food this month or if you can fuel up your car is the thing that REALLY fucks you up when you're poor, and that's not a feeling youll ever get in just a month, because in the end the rich guy can just look forward to when the experiment ends and live on as before.

2dhuxsd8	The billionaire might have a “hard time”, but he has the knowledge that at the end of the month, he will be back in his comfy life and that alone is going to demolish the meaning of this experiment.

5d5ge	It won't matter, however long the experience is, it's just that, an experience.  they'll always have their money to look forward to going back to, they know that if it gets too tough, they can quit and go back to living luxurious, they know that no matter how much they endure, it's not their house, it's not their lives, they won't really have to worry, do you think they will fear becoming homeless? do you think they'll feel the weight of debt? the sheer panic when your rent goes up one week, which causes you to go overdrawn at the bank, which leads to daily charges, which compound and grow bigger and bigger, leading to more things being unable to be paid for, having to choose between food for the week, or paying for hot water, choosing between electric to keep what you have from spoiling or if you can live on what you have while you try and pay the bill that keeps you from being homeless? watching whatever income you DO have being taken automatically to pay debt collectors, which leads to more debt... they won't starve or freeze to death in a council flat, only to be found when neighbors complain about the smell, they wont face the insurmountable wall of beauracracy, debt and judgement that they have to dance for every month to get a payment from the goverment, they won't have any of this... they'll have a jolly time playing urban survivalist and they'll have some stories to tell their other rich friends or personal trainer when they get back to THEIR real world.  having no end in sight is what makes it real, and no TV show will truly capture that crushing perpetual darkness that comes with living like this. 75% of suicides globally are in low or middle income countries, because for poor people, there is no real way out, there is no "give up" that will return them to their mansion and holidays, cars, carefree lives, there is only living through it, or ending it.	1581090383.0	fgsqby3	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsqby3/

16tdj1	The problem with poverty is that there's no visible way out. You feel you'll be poor forever.   It's not very radical for rich people, even very rich people, to be poor for a few years voluntarily. We call that "college". They don't develop empathy or change their views, they think they "earned" their way out when they graduate and get a job at their dad's company and buy an apartment in New York, and tell stories about having been poor for four years at Brown or Yale. And they were poor, genuinely, they had a low income, they had to shop carefully. That's not uncommon. I went to school with people like that. Drove shitty cars, ate cheap, all of it. But if you know there's a hundred million bucks waiting when you graduate it's more like poverty cosplay than really being poor.	1581092469.0	fgstqjk	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgstqjk/

4axkr	Maybe, but it'd have to be some rules:   * True lowest salary * The CEO couldn't have access to their other assets. As in to do this, they'd have a new and separate checking account, only with their earned wages, debit card, and if necessary, checks.  * If the CEO drove an 'average' car, I'd let them keep it. If they drove a high end car, they could either keep using it and deal with repairs and higher cost of ownership, or downgrade to an 'average' car with less costs. If in a city, they can use public transport or car. * Be subject to all rules and regulations of a new hire regarding time off and absences. * This part I'm not sure how to negotiate, but if the CEO had expenses that came from being at a CEO level, that entry level people wouldn't have, those expenses would have to be paused. Like a country club or expensive membership, for example. Property taxes/mortgages would still come out of their assets. * They'd have to get new housing and live like a regular person, be it apartment or small house, whatever they could afford. They can bring the basics/essentials but then a stipulation about leaving nicer/luxury items behind. Perhaps have a challenge where they can repurchase these items if they save up for it. * This would only work of the CEO is unknown and not likely to be recognized; like Bill Gates doing janitorial work or Jeff Bezos doing a warehouse job isn't going to work. * Stipulation that the CEO can't fire someone because the CEO had a personal problem. This is not the same as a negligent or shitty employee, this is like 'I'm the CEO and I wasn't treated right, who do they think they are, fire them' butthurt CEO protection. * Longer time period, at least 6 months, or even up to a year. More fun would be if the CEO didn't know how long the experiment was going to be.	1581092575.0	fgstx16	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgstx16/
5e0mc	So, unlike the life of a low paid employee, the billionaire would know what’s awaiting them at the end of the month, and, unless they suffer temporary amnesia, it’s just another fauxreality show, meant to normalize billionaires in the eyes of those that they exploit.

But it would go just like any other reality TV show, which are all scripted and break their own rules. A billionaire could buy as much cheating as he wants, and use a raft of NDAs to keep it under wraps. He'd live exactly as usual except for 2 hours a week while the camera is rolling. Then they'd edit it to make it look like he suffered great adversity, but actually handled it great and was able to improve his situation through cleverness and hard work.	1581092677.0	fgsu35f	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsu35f/

51e9toc2	Im imagining they are a 60 to 80 hr a week worker, but they think that's how they got where they are, when it's half of it. They don't know about all the peole working as hard and getting nowhere. They don't know it was luck.  Since anyone can essentially go camping for a month, they love it. They aren't genuinely worried about paying for their kids school , paying medical expenses if they get sick, or spiraling into debt if their car breaks. It's one month, they have a great worry free time and learn nothing. They just cherry pick quaint plebian experiences and give an exit interview about how beautiful life is, for everyone.	1581093109.0	fgsutei	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsutei/

Just like the rich and famous going to jail or prison for this or that.  "Oh no so and so is going to prison!" but like this idea they have very short jail stays compared to average crime doer, so back to the so old lifestyle after 3 months and their rep isn't even damaged, see Martha Stewart, unlike an average person who looses so much they have and future opportunities.	1581093721.0	fgsvuq1	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsvuq1/

gskd3	Literally nothing would happen. The main problem here isn't the greed of the heads of corporations. But the fact that in many cases minimum wage is not a living wage. Any business large or small is about maximizing profit, if you were a landlord would you lower the asking price by 2 times the market price, because someone can't afford it, says they have nowhere to go? If you have an unskilled worker who works an uncomplicated work, no possible threat to his health at work and little to none responsibility, why would you pay him more than a minimum wage? Again, the main problem is that minimum wage in most cases is a starvation wage.	1581093931.0	fgsw7hy	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsw7hy/

3ls80lqa	Mark Zuckerberg gets a job at Wal-mart. Designs an app between shifts. Becomes a multi-millionaire again.  The issue is many billionaire CEOs have technical skills and supernatural drive they can use to overcome this scenario. The idea many of these guys are mere figureheads doing nothing but racking up golden parachutes and not adding major value is misguided. They often have skills and drive far beyond that of minimum wage workers, not to even mention the qualifications and education. Any of them are overqualified to MANAGE a Wal-Mart.  I would still watch such a show because it would be fascinating to see what they do, but I'd hope the showrunners don't put limits on their ability to be entrepreneurial or invest their money in certain ways.	1581093956.0	fgsw8wz	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsw8wz/

bng1o	I’d also like to see an investment made billionaire have to survive for at least three months on the wage of the lowest paid employee of all the companies they’ve become rich from.  If any of the companies they made their billions from are pharmaceutical or health insurance or anything like that, then they have to experience at least 6 months at the lowest wage of said company’a employees WHILE trying to afford the drugs or coverage the company offers. Especially those with kids.   If any of the companies they became rich from are known polluters, then they have to exist on the median income and typical health coverage of the residents affected by the pollution, in the area affected by the pollution, for at least a year. Maybe two.	1581099858.0	fgt65jw	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgt65jw/

Housing and all (single employees lol)  That way they understand the process of saving, paying for rent, food, services, yourself and see what they can do about their lifestyle with the money they have left after every pay check.   Of course they will never get the full effect of the reality out there because they know they will go back to their castle, but 3 months of stress and anxiety when you’ve been so monetarily entitled could be crushing. And they can learn something from that crash.   The lower payed employee swapping gets to live 3 months in a sick ass vacation retreat home.

N/A	There is an interesting book called [Nickle and Dimed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_and_Dimed) written by Barbara Ehrenreich in the late 90s. She's a middle class journalist who goes undercover working a series of mimnimum wage jobs in America and drawing the conclusion that,    "all low-wage workers, recipients of government or charitable services like welfare, food, and health care, are not simply living off the generosity of others. Instead, she suggests, we live off their generosity:  “ When someone works for less pay than she can live on … she has made a great sacrifice for you … The "working poor" … are in fact the major philanthropists of our society. They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stock prices high. To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone."	1581102961.0	fgtd8le	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgtd8le/

4w5g2mwl	Usually when studies/experiments like this are done, the person either quits out of frustration really quickly and never speaks of it again, or they just barely scrap by and at the end go "HA, see, I'm paying you PLENTY!! Stop complaining!!".......   ........ not realizing that just one month is not nearly enough to get a true picture of what being poor/in poverty is really like. **These experiments have a fundemental flaw: the rich CEO/whoever will always know that if something goes wrong, they can just end the experiment.** They will always have the safety cushion of their piles of money to go back to, they will always know they have connections to call up and come help them. There is no way to authentically replicate to these people the stress, the panic, the unending dread of being on the constant brink of disaster, with no backup, no safety cushion.   Because at the end of the day, no matter what happens during the study, they can always go home, and they know it.   It can, sometimes, provide at least a *little* insight into what day-to-day life can be like living on low wages, even if the looming terror/dread can't be replicated. If the production was honest, and they included a part near the end where they explain to the CEO (and the audience) that this little experiment is only a fraction of what it's like to suffer through poverty...........

Even if it did, after one episode the CEO of whatever network company would probably get offended and cancel the show instantly!	1581108649.0	fgtsd5h	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgtsd5h/

20ykus8	They'd built a tight budget and stick to it. They'd minimize costs (sell the car, buy bus pass), purchase cheaper food and limit additional typical poor person expenses (like eating McDonalds beyond your budget).  It's easy enough to go and do this if you're just trying to make a point for a month, more difficult if this is your entire life and just want some kind of escape once in a while (eating out, nicer car than you should afford etc). I feel it'd turn into a show saying "Rich people would stay rich because they're better."  The real show is getting poor people and giving them the CEO salary. Titties, Jet Skis, Whores, lavish trips to crazy places, that's what I wanna see.	1581109255.0	fgttyct	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgttyct/

4rv6gyd3	Well, the condition states WITHOUT ACCESS to any other resources other than that of the employee. I'm positive the billionaire will be assasinated or kidnapped by the second episode. I mean it sounds like the perfect time to strike as bodyguards cannot be affored to plesbians like us, so they count as a resource beyond reach. Then the TV crew will do their damndest to keep the show running by turning it into a Pseudo NCIS episode where they must rescue the billionare before time runs out. They will then discover the person behind the kidnapping was none other but the CEO's uncle who stands to inherit the CEO's fortune when he dies and thought this would be the perfect opportunity to take them out. The uncle will then decide to kill both the CEO and himself but at the last second the cameraman sacrificed the camera to save the CEO by bludgeoning the mad uncle to death. The last episode of the series will not air as the footage was lost to save the CEO. Then the CEo will pay the cameraman to become his personal bodyguard and the film crew will be hired as detectives for their amazing work.

51t5q2iu	What would happen? Not much, NBD; most people can live frugally for the odd month, maybe even few months- they can live like a "poor person" because they know that soon it will end, they know this for sure, not because they need to tell themselves something that has a strong possibility of never happening or never happening any time soon.   &#x200B;  Try a few years- try a few years and then the idea that it may never end- that you may have to live like that and Every. Single. Day, and every night of every day and that the landlord or debt you hold may not get paid back so you cannot say to your debtors that you'll be able to pay them back just please wait for a bit, because not only would that risk being all lies, but your word carries no weight because you've no way to prove this, and yes, because they fear the debt never being paid back or any time soon, those debts will carry high interest. It's not personal; it's business.   And try the additional costs that often come due to or are the cause of being poor; the disabilities, the long term health conditions, or people they have to care for. Or the lack of literal intelligence, or chronic lack of confidence no doubt caused or added to by a childhood of facing the consequences of being shy, or not clever enough or having the "right" family or even having the "right" skin tone.   Lets see how they handle that. Only you'll never know, because they will never be there and for many or (I'd argue;) for most; they've never ever known.   I don't say all of this, by the way, because I'm not all of those things myself, I have and do experience some of them and yet I still struggle financially- yet I know well of others who experience far worse, who wont even be the least paying employee because they bottomed out far before they could even gain employment by a company that may offer regular work and live from daily pay in cash (because they can't get a bank account as they have no fixed address). I see people in these positions daily, as someone with a role, I support many of them myself and yet it's often the tip of the iceberg when you consider paid employees in a company able to finance staff who get as much as the minimum wage, it's sadly the tip of a big iceberg, and yet the people I meet and work to support, often are supported by those who are lowest paid. It isn't just those who are the least able to support themselves who experience lives like I've described; it's their families who shoulder the lives they experience, who daily, hourly, minute by minute are never far from in thought. That is a cost someone in extreme wealth will never be able to take on as someone "living on minimum wage" will ever really experience, because they know that some day soon they will walk away and they wont look back- they can try, but they will give up and probably shockingly quite soon on, will forget all about, even if they try not to.  &#x200B;  So in answer to your question what would happen? Very little, very very little.	1581125734.0	fguog44	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fguog44/

Look, while you are Netflix and chilling there is someone working hard for that position, you are out at the club partying while someone is indoor working, getting depression and anxiety from too much thought about what if it doesn't work, then in 10-15 years when they find what they were looking for (success according to themselves) your lazy ass is here judging them for not being able to tolerate a minimum wage, like what gives you the right to judge them, they busted their ass for it while you were partying and snoozing.

5bqa52rp	I think those billionaire CEOs spend many hours in their companies, sometimes like 80 a week or even more. So maybe only the place where they sleep would look different.  The other question is wether they could still afford doing their job cause when you work all day you obviously have no time for cooking, buying groceries, looking after one's children and so on. So working THAT much may not even work out. So if they really job switched that would be better maybe (not for the company though 😂).   Then I guess the biggest thing for the CEO would be copying with the loads of spare time they suddenly have.	1581148688.0	fgvgeqe	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgvgeqe/
pchwz	If it is just a month, nothing of consequence will happen.  They'll "get by" on a tiny amount of money, then mug at the camera: "See, it's easy, I can do it, why can't you?"  Ignoring the fact that in one months time they didn't have to worry about rent, or other bills, and likely had food already in storage that they didn't have to pay for.  If the show were to follow a CEO who has to go an entire *year* on their lowest paid employee's wage, and they start out, literally, homeless and have to find a place to live *first* with only a single weeks paycheck in their pocket, we'd see all sorts of ways they try to cheat the system, rather than use their "skills" to better themselves on a tiny income.  I think a series that follows a CEO living poor for a year would be more entertaining than one that follows a CEO living poor for a month.	1581152476.0	fgvsgxt	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgvsgxt/

N/A	This reminds me of a paper I had to write for class a few years back. We had to read an entire book where the author lived in different areas and would take note of how little she made and how much harder life was and where her money was going to. We then had to compare it to an article where Gwyneth Paltrow had a very small grocery budget every time she went to the store to "see how hard some people have it." She was fine. It changed 0 in her perspective and she merely concluded "wow some people do have it harder. oh well" That's kinda the same way I see this idea. Best case scenario, the rich people will just go "wow, some people do have it harder.

k03axai	No, because it would immediately get hammed up, overly-dramatized in editing, and eventually scripted so that every episode has a happy ending and a “wow golly gee I sure learned my lesson.” It’d become more propaganda for the billionaire than a study of the power class conditions.

63j2j3ri	They'd pretend to be fine, knowing they'd escape before they had to really suffer poverty. It's easy to accept being poor when it's temporary. Look how many rich people go on safaris and shit and spend a week or month intentionally living like poor people. Inside they hate that shit. But they pretend it's humbling and go right back to being rich assholes. The show would convince idiot's that wealthy people were learning how to empathize with them, while in reality they know how bad it is, they don't care because it's not their problem. America is entirely running on a system where the people with all the money are continually trying to convince those with almost no money that there is no problem or inequality.	1586732303.0	fn824ap	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fn824ap/

Back in IT now, but still working there each Saturday, because it keeps me fit and down to earth.  It was really an eye opener to see how many good people nowadays work so hard for a salary, that doesn't even make you enough for paying all bills.

They would just keep bit chin about how they employees are Makin mistakes and Goin against their company standards and after that month they would make a managing meeting to empilement even stronger quality control tools.	1595964811.0	fzjluke	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fzjluke/

48aq2otk	It depends on who they are.   Some CEO's started out life in a very different position.   I'm not a CEO but I'm pretty financially stable, I grew up super poor and I would be super fine. especially if I knew it was only for a few months.

13dt3d	I think most people would be rather disappointed from such a show.   * There is just a handful of Billionaire CEOs (which usually means those people are also the founders of their firm). They started somewhere low.  * People that work that hard to get to this position, such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, etc. often give me the impression to be rather humble people. I made the experience to get in contact with people with an extreme fortune. Overwhelmingly, those people were quite humble people. For example, there was this guy from Denmark who funded an IT company and whose fortune was estimated to be around 50-100 Million Euros. He was a really nice guy, he financially supported our tennis club and used to drive our team on the weekends to outbound league games. A friend of mine lives in the same neighbourhood as the former Mercedes CEO. And that guy seems to be the most down to earth person in his private life. * Moreover, in such jobs you are probably used to extreme pressure, expectations of others and total shit shows. Just think of Elon Musk, sleeping in his factory (assuming this wasn't simply a marketing gag). Therefore I think they would manage and stay cool even if they hate it.   However, I would love to see a TV show in which the parents of rich heirs tell their children that - if they want to have their heritage - they need to prove for one year that they can live on an Amazon worker paycheck. I think that would make for much better entertainment.	1581076563.0	fgs8nfq	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8nfq/
12xb0o	A lot of owner-CEO's came e.g. Jobs or Bezos came from less than well-to-do families, so for then this would be nothing more than a 'throwback Thursday'. For the 'hired CEO' types with a diploma from a good school, they might have come from upper (middle) class families or low-income families so I bet they won't be that far removed from reality -although they may have come a long way since then. Most CEOs have an unbelievable work ethic, otherwise they would not have gotten that far.  Would this experience open their eyes to troubles faced by their employees? Perhaps. But to me this reeks like part schadenfreude and part poverty-porn and is useless reality tv.  Tons of companies force executive level managers to begin working at shop floor/at the bottom of the company ranks - even for a few months- before switching to the role they were hired for. This program should be stimulated across different industries if possible. But keep reality TV out of it.	1581076847.0	fgs8wmx	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8wmx/

yp8q6	The COO of one of my past jobs was dumbfounded when he found out some employees went to Hawaii on vacation after yearly bonuses and was concerned the staff was getting too much in compensation.  She had to remind him that normal people don’t fly first class or stay in 5-star hotels or pay for their au pair to go with them. When she told him the difference in cost compared to his vacation, he was shocked by how “little” people were able to spend to take the trip and dropped the issue.

3zhs1yg	It's a misconception that billionaires only have money in their corner.  They have a large network of relationships with other wealthy and powerful people. They are surrounded by people who owe them favors or desire to ingratiate themselves.  They often have the benefit of the kind of learning that you only get from wasting vast sums of money. They have tremendous optimism, which comes from eating steak every night instead of 2-minute noodles.  They usually have dress sense and appearance that opens doors, rather than closing them.  Finally they have the supreme confidence of someone who has 'made it.' It causes them to walk differently and talk differently and get a different reaction from others.  The show would have to find a way to nullify these advantages to have any kind of chance of teaching them anything. Money is not their only advantage.	1581075260.0	fgs7j3a	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs7j3a/

ldjhu6z	No. Why would that be interesting? You make it sound like billionaire CEOs have never known the "other side" when in fact most came from modest backgrounds themselves. Look at all the billionaire CEOs in the world. Most are founders and they started out as founders of worthless companies and normal jobs just like everyone else.  They might no longer be used to it, but it's not like when you show kids born in 2007 old technology.

qfbi5	I'd love to watch it.   What would happen depends on the individual billionaire.   Everyone seems to assume it would end in disaster because without infinite billionaire resources the CEO would fail abysmally.   However, many of these billionaires *worked* their way to the top and they only made it because of their resourcefulness. There are plenty of examples of people having founded their own little business from scratch and grown it into multimillion enterprises.   The scenario set by the OP would simply take them back to where they started and I reckon many would cope very well.	1581076716.0	fgs8sbq	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8sbq/

N/A	Remember, that's not an issue for a rich person, as they know they are still rich, and that they don't need a salary at all, ever.  Such a job would need to be physically dangerous, humiliating or very boring to get them out of the comfort zone.  But, why would they do this? Would they win lots of money at the end if they succeed? If not, why would they do it? And if they get lots of money, they are actually not a "lowest paid employee", rather they will be even richer (but not by much, relatively speaking).  The only reason I can see anyone would do this would be as a media stunt, like Ice Bucket Challenge and similar.	1581075920.0	fgs837w	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs837w/

The tech ones, especially, often grew up middle class so they'd probably do as well as any middle class background person suddenly forced to live on minimum wage. Some of the old ones would probably have trouble though, just because they are old and their life skills are from 60 years ago.

3me1aq93	We had a show like that. Kind of. It was a challenge for the people in our government, to live on minimum wage, but it only applied to food, they subtracted the money for "rent and utilities" and then the rest was money they had to spend on food for a week. Most of them said they won't do it. three or so people tried..  They bought ramen noodles or made soup that they could eat several days. It was years ago, I don't remember most of it.   They seemed to think of it as a fun challenge, but they agreed that it's hard to eat the same thing over and over again. Nothing came of it though. They went back to their lives and the minimum wage didn't increase much over the years.   Bottom line is - they did not want to  1. Be filmed in their homes. 2. Live below their standard.   Years later - their salaries increased because "they deserved it for the hours of work, and that other governments earn more".   It was a mess, and people were angry and sad.	1581076166.0	fgs8ax3	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8ax3/

13bfbfho	So wait, does the employee have to be paid at all in order for their salary to count? Like, if the company has an unpaid intern, would the CEO be broke the entire time?   What about labor in foreign countries? Say, the company employs workers in other countries because minimum wages there are much lower, would the CEO have to live with that kind of money?   As for what I think would happen:   1. CEO thinks they can just live off of the stuff they bought prior to the experiment.  2. CEO realizes that they can´t access their house or anything anymore.  3. CEO begs their employees to let them stay on their couch or something.  4. CEO promises, on camera, to raise minimum wages after the experiment is over to get employees to let them stay with them.  5. After the experiment is over the CEO either keeps their promise or has their lawyer use an excuse like "impaired judgement" to let them get out of their promise.  6. In the first case, employee morale is boosted and the company makes much more money, which improves the nation´s overall economy.  7. In the second case, the entire minimum wage class quits on the spot, the company crumbles, and the CEO realizes their mistake.	1581076358.0	fgs8gwp	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8gwp/

3x11sj2k	There's already been shows like this in the uk. Remember 20ish years ago ian duncan smith lived in a tower block for a week. It was before i took proper interest in politics so i dont remember it well, pretty sure he couldn't make ends meet and had to stop wearing his suit around the estate so he didn't get opened up like a tin of beans. There's been a few documentaries like this over the years where usually right of centre people try to make out you can live happily on benefits and afaik they never can. Interesting to watch them fail and not change their views a bit though.	1581076558.0	fgs8n93	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8n93/

Then, he wakes back up in his regular life as a changed man and the ending sequence is him walking into the office complimenting and helping people, then he asks out a girl and they kiss and then the credits play.	1581076567.0	fgs8nj8	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8nj8/

391c6aru	We kinda have this in my country, not CEO's but just really rich people.  In the show "steenrijk, straatarm" ("filthy rich, dirt poor") people switch lives, homes, and allowance. One episode a woman with her own French haute-couture shoe company switched with a family that lived off of 50 bucks a person a week. And she made it work too!  She had to take on the activities of the family, such as playing soccer like the mom did and charity work they did for their community. Meanwhile the poor family lived in her french mansion, with an allowance of about 2500 a person a week. They went to disney, the louvre and had breakfast and dinner out every day. They also take on the activities she did, such as going to the spa once a week and shopping for new shoes (they got to keep everything)    I really love this concept and i'm glad this show actually does do it justice	1581076683.0	fgs8rb3	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs8rb3/

11cvdy	I remember watching a documentary where a CEO did this. He stepped down (temporarily) to work a minimum wage job within his company and had his wife come along with him. He didn’t have kids so he asked to borrow his niece and nephew for it. He was struggling a lot. They weren’t living in a good part of town or in a good apartment. They were late on rent and I remember someone got sick and he couldn’t afford for whoever it was to go to the hospital (apparently he didn’t know his employees didn’t have health insurance or it wasn’t enough insurance? I can’t remember). Once he went back to his role as CEO of the company, I remember him raising the wages and finding health insurance for all of his employees.   I just can’t remember who or what it was called. I was a teenager when I watched this. I think.

He made like 2,500 in a week using a strategy where he goes to a dump and looks for salvageable tires, then sells them, he would then go to a car dealership and ask if he can buy any cars there trying to get rid of, he would haggle them down a lot then fix the car up and re sell it for more money. In a month he bought a home and re furnished it and sold it. Then bought a restaurant and started a brand that does bbq.

5qaxt	Sort of like Undercover Billionaire?   That guy abandoned his wealth and had 3 or 6 months to accumulate a net worth of $1 million by starting businesses.   There were some good lessons sprinkled in the shows. Especially about fostering relationships and identifying opportunities.   Too bad everything about it was fake. He sold junk tires from the ditch for thousands of dollars, got an apartment with zero references, zero security deposit, no job, just first month rent. He had health insurance. He got brick and mortar business owners to give him personal tours and job interviews. Even had one walk the streets during a parade to sell crap just to split the profits.  The show was a total fake and thus unwatchable.	1581077290.0	fgs9b2o	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9b2o/

g1zb8	Your premise is that the CEO would be shocked into realizing what shit pay their lowest paid employees employees earn.  In reality, the CEO already knows that that pay is shit.  They pay these low wages because IT IS LEGAL, and that their competitors will pay the lowest pay possible for those positions, and to stay competitive and profitable, our example CEO must also pay shit wages.  At companies that have a patent on popular products, they are more likely to pay much higher wages, as the price competition is not there.	1581077415.0	fgs9faz	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9faz/

wdqpq	That CEO probably has already lived a life like that before tho.   I know the former CEO of [company I won't mention for fear of doxxing and protection of privacy] used to sell rabbits as a child to make money. He happened to also be very clever at inventing things.   My Dad who owns a small business used to work 80 hours a week trying to keep it profitable and so my Mom could be a SAHM. He started the company in high school and kept it going through college and graduate school until now as a grandfather.   I have a few more personal anecdotes, but none of them start out with: They graduated college and had businesses handed to then. There is more a theme of right place, right time, right risk that happens but not without the right amount of work over a long period of time.	1581077465.0	fgs9gyz	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9gyz/

5fmq9	no. even if you could find one to sign up they would always know their "situation" is extremely temporary and never truly understand the predicament. the show would end with them predictably agreeing how awful it is and maybe throw a pittance here or there for propaganda and making themselves look and feel better before resuming being rich while the dickheads who watch it think 'what nice people they are'. sounds fucking awful and will solve nothing.	1581077538.0	fgs9jew	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9jew/

8bd1t	Most people aren't complete mavericks and without some sort of support. If you cut off "any other resources" then you really don't get the full experience of whatever that lowest paid worker is, because like most people, they've got some sort of family or friends, or even public services that can help them.  It might make for some smooth brained TV watching, but it's not exactly how most people live.	1581077545.0	fgs9jmj	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9jmj/
df30a	The issue with these is that there's the knowledge they *will* go back to their resources when it's done. I don't know if just a month would be long enough to really hit home about it. Maybe three to six months, or ideally a whole year, would be something worth looking at. But you have to make it a long enough stretch that they won't just be mildly frustrated for awhile and then just suck it up. Hitting no money or having nothing at the end of the month isn't an issue for them since that's when it's over. It has to be long enough to allow their to be consequences for not having the access.  And also have them not just call off the whole thing.	1581077546.0	fgs9jnw	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9jnw/

98u3l	I've said before that before anyone can join Congress or any of the higher up branches of our government, that they need to live for one year on the system. One whole year. That's signing up for medical benefits through your state, going through the hiring process for a cashier job or whatever, and living on minimum wage.   I believe a lot would change. If you do it for a week or a month or even three months, chances are you can really stick it out and just count down the days. You can't if it's a year. A year would make a solid impact.

nbr5tyf	Nah, it'd be boring due to it being impossible.  No one would sign up or it'd be extremely fake.  They've built up to where they are and wouldnt be able to do anything.    They already moved on past their starter home.  No way they could afford their mortgage.    If it was like their life was on pause and they had to live like their lowest paid employee.  Most of them were there once, so yeah, I think it'd be a meh.    I'd like to see the opposite.  Lower paid employees have to love the life of their ceo and perform at the same level.

Having bills pile up and pile up then fate takes another dump on your doorstep. How would they understand what it's like to work hard at your job, year after year, being promised a pay rise or a promotion and it never coming. How would they understand the despair of another year where you don't even get inflation, despite working your ass off. Not being able to go on holiday- ever. Being scared to lose your job. Worry about rent, the kids, that operation someone desperately needs,  real worries not a month of pretending to be poor.  &#x200B;  Make a show where they have all their treasure piles taken away from them.

One month with a billion dollars at the end is hardly comparable to what the working poor go through. There is no real job/housing/food/health care insecurity. No worry that he will have to work the same shitty job for decades until he's dead because he can't save for retirement. No making hard choices about what he can provide for his family.

4x7m52d5	Don't know if this was mentioned here. But in the Netherlands we had a series where millionaires swapped lives with normal people for a week.   They both got an amount of money to spend that they would normally spend in a week and the schedule was swapped too. It was a really cool show. And most millionaires gave presents and money at the end of the week to the other family.   The lower income family could go on shopping sprees and everything and they usually felt guilty about spending so much money on unnecessary things. But they kind of felt like they were on an all inclusive vacation. But they also had a great time with their kids and wanted to spend more time with their kids after this and manage their time better.   The millionaires usually came up with really creative ways to spend the money wisely and some even had some left over by the end of the week and shared tips with the lower income family as to how they did that. Also see how they sometimes maybe neglected the family because of their job too and were now closer because they actually sat down to do board games. Instead of just giving them whatever they wanted. They also saw that their kids usually didn't care about all the cool gadgets at home if they got to play outside for example, with the neighbors and such.    Really cool show.	1581077848.0	fgs9u8z	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9u8z/

They have an end date that they can get out of it.  Anyone can survive hardship for a short time.  This would backfire i think.  People start pointing to this CEO saying, "He did it!

15yiye	There is a TV concept in The Netherlands/ Belgium. I am not sure if this is used in other countries as well.   Imagine having a "rich" family and a "poor" family. The members of the "rich" family has to move to the house of the "poor" family and survive with their average week budget for a week. The "poor" family goes in the opposite direction, living in the house of the "rich" with their avg week budget.  I did not have watched it, but I know that it got aired because of some media attention on that matter.	1581077856.0	fgs9ui6	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgs9ui6/

They get random events simulating living on that wage long-term.  Say, on day 4 their fridge is broken. They can stop buying perishables, eat out, or pay for a new one. Day 17, their car gets a flat.

In reality it was all semi-scripted collusion with the show, earn some easy publicity for the company, and now the ceo has a hitlist of people who crossed him, which they're now going to 'trim'.

N/A	Nothing would. They'd just be resourceful with whatever they had.  It's like saying "I want to see someone who has a house and a job be homeless" - ordinary people without drug issues and/or mental health issues are typically resourceful enough to solve their problems and issues.  You don't learn what it's like to be homeless or on a low income like this because the people who are on low incomes typically have problems that the billionaire is unlikely to share - problems that are far deeper and more significant than "not having money" and, without these problems he or she would simply do better in the same situation.  You cannot tell a poor person "stop being poor" but the reverse is the same - you cannot tell a resourceful, intelligent motivated individual "stop being rich"  Plenty of rich people lose fortunes and recreate them. Equally your average lottery winner makes a complete fuck up of being rich and they often end up penniless again.	1581078207.0	fgsa6t4	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsa6t4/

4ac44	Make it a billionaire or heck even a millionaire that inherited their wealth rather than one that is self made, that would be infinitely more entertaining.   For the self made ones not only have they probably had to deal with this stuff at some point in their lives, but they also have the security of knowing they'll only have to deal with it for a set period of time.  How would you even entice someone with that level of wealth to participate in something like this?	1581078237.0	fgsa7xl	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsa7xl/
6b7i2	There is a lot more to being rich or poor than that. How about not even having the minimum salary but a slightly higher one that you were able to get because of a University degree... except now they also have 100k in student debt.   Then give them a kid or two, alimony payments because their SO isnt fit to raise children. Maybe also give them a medical condition, and one of the kids needs regular $100 epipens and hospital checkups.  Then take away all their networking rich buddies and other support systems.  You dont even need to be the lowest salary to experience a crippling poor lifestyle. The lowest salary probably doesnt have 6 figure student debt hanging off their back.  And it's not just people who took Japanese studies, or women's lib, communications, etc. When I graduated, there were tons of people with computer science degrees, and even engineering degrees that had to work at minimum wage for a few years until they finally got their foot into the door at their degree career, and that foot in the door played like $20/hr.  Someone making 20 per hr with 6 figure loan debt, because they "did everything right" is often in a worse position than someone making 8 per hr straight out of high school.  We think of the poor as high school dropouts. But  it's really 90% of people who did the right thing, and didn't have jobs that matched inflating secondary education costs, even in respected fields.	1581078240.0	fgsa80t	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsa80t/

qlex1	Asking sociopathic  alpha-types to prove they can get through it? They’ll just do it with a stiff upper lip to show that “hard work” is all it takes, and if they’re especially good at lying to themselves and low in empathy may even end up solidifying their Darwinistic views on society whilst on a platform that enables them to convince some of the masses of their thinking as opposed to existing as an opportunity for them to learn the value of the dollar and empathize.

verq9	Undercover Billionaire with Glenn Stearns was kinda close to this.  It was a decent series, seemed more genuine than other reality shows.  They give him $100, a cell phone (no contacts), and an old truck.  They drop him off in a city he is unfamiliar with and he grinds it out to survive and eventually build a business worth $1 million dollars....within 90 days.

78fcw	The thing is that even in that context, the CEO would have no idea what it's like to be that employee. The CEO will know the entire time that it's only for a limited amount of time and will benefit feel the despair that comes along with living a life where you don't know if you're going to be about to make rent next month. They'll never feel the insecurity of "what happens if I get sick and can't afford medical bills"? They'll never really know what it's like to be poor, even if they lived it for a year or more. The CEO knows that at the end of the day, they can always go back to their "normal" life if things get too hard.	1581078551.0	fgsajae	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsajae/

119wcl	Reading some of the comments, I think the best suggestion is: the CEO doesn't know how long the experience will be.

6flh2	How many billionaire CEO's are there? You don't have many people to choose from for undercover bosses, let alone this idea.  I think it would be cool, but no-one would do it. those that did would see the outcome being "well those who don't get paid much need to work harder" of they would think "wow these low paid staff are unreliable, let's fire them and replace them with machines!"  It would be entertaining, but the only ones that would bite probably pay a fair wage, or were people that rose through the ranks so would be able to handle day to day.

4dh8uqhy	A month? Don't be dumb. Even to suggest only 1 month is evidence whoever thought this up has no connection to reality. This sounds like a rich guy trying to get his reality show on TV.   It's real easy to power through anything for a month. It's when you aren't sure if you will make it through a year or 2 that reality sets in. To do anything for a "billionaire" to relate, they have to feel like their billions are gone never to return. To embrace the dispair of having nothing and no hope of getting anything. And the loss of dignity having society run you down around every corner. To actually get injured and not be able to afford a doctor so that broken bone heals incorrectly having to deal with a life long consequence.  Even just asking this hypothetical question is so disconnected from reality it makes the OP look like a child who's never been responsible for paying bills.   You want a show pitch? Find a dirt poor person who doesn't complain about being dirt poor and does what they need to survive.  Then make that guy a billionaire for a year and see what he does with it. A humble respectful peasant is more beneficial to society than a "woke" billionaire so far disconnected he has to pretend to be poor to feel what it's like to be where 90% of the population is every day, every month, every year.

mizim	Since they are otherwise the CEO, they probably come to work the entire time without calling off, wouldn't cause one minute of drama, and everyone watching the show would make fun of them because executive management is supposed to be the best at every job within that company and the CEO would probably suck at whatever they are supposed to do.

[Rich Mate Poor Mate by RTHK] (https://podcast.rthk.hk/podcast/item.php?pid=324&eid=15687&year=2011&lang=zh-CN). Episodes 2-1 to 2-3 are the more relevant ones.  There should be English subtitles.   For background, Hong Kong has a population of about 7.5 million. We have the highest Rolls Royces and Ferraris per capita (bear in mind we have a 120% tax on vehicles). Second largest market for Swiss watches after the US. Third largest importer of diamonds after India and USA. 6th in terms of number of billionaires (right behind literal countries), or second after NYC.  And one of the highest income inequalities in the world.

9jbea	I mean I would watch it because it sounds interesting, but I would say however that a lot of these people if they aren't paying a better wage already will only go on the show for publicity and then for even better publicity will hike their employees wages up while crying "oh I didn't know/forgot how hard it was, oh how so terrible yada yada".

kkn77	For me it depends on the billionaire or wealthy person picked. For the ones who scraped and clawed their way from the bottom already, I don't want to see it because I know for a fact that they can white knuckle their way into it again.  But the ones who had the "silver spoon" lifestyle from the get go. Absolutely I'd watch it. While I know these are typically smart and resourceful people, there is just simply facets of being poor that these people cannot possibly fathom having to deal with and being poor has a way of draining your energy and mental fortitude like nothing I've ever experienced. I genuinely had it good for most of my life but in college and just afterward it was a rough go.

8ejgo	That doesn't go far enough. It needs to be more than just an equivalent salary - it needs to be an equivalent job too. Make the CEO actually work in a low paid job, for an unrelated company (ie, not the company they are CEO of, not a supplier or customer or neighbour, not one where a friend or family member works, etc). Make them live in a flat or houseshare which is "affordable" for the new salary they are recieving. Make them buy all the clothes they are going to be wearing for the length of the program on a miniscule budget. And make them do it for 6 months, not 1 month.	1581078826.0	fgsatf5	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsatf5/

2y0mf0xx	Well, they probably will find it very difficult, unenjoyable, possibly unbearable, but it's not proving a point. These are people that are payed to move shit around and do the grunt work. I'm in school right now, I work minimum wage at a garden centre, I'm not complaining because all I do is stock shelves and move stuff around the warehouse, that doesn't warrant a large salary. I don't expect to stay here for ever I'll move up as I finish university but I'll never complain about being on minimum wage as a store assistant. I don't run a damn company.  There is also a slight undertone that these people have never worked minimum wage jobs and don't understand, and that they don't deserve their wealth. Sure some have inherited it, but many have worked up from the bottom, or are entrepreneurs or have invented something. I think the hate we as a society have for the rich is so toxic and childish.

2q7cu9n7	Don't think so. It would just be watching someone living life with good cashflow live with less for a month.  &#x200B;  What would be interesting would be to take a Ceo, Board Member, Politician etc that comes from the well off background and has a high networth and make it a larger documentary. Follow their life and get a glimpse over a year or so and then move them to the opposite for a year. But how would that practically go? I don't think it's feasible.   But that's kinda what you would need to really capture the pay-check to paycheck or more constant longterm struggles.  &#x200B;  Like follow them where they instead are in a situation where they longterm have to make the sacrifices that would remove them from that situation. The type of people who constantly have to take the bad choice now rather than the good choice in three months because there is an emergency. If you buy cheap you have to buy twice but because of life they don't really have that option.  &#x200B;  But then even so are they allowed to try and make more? Hustle and see if they can improve? Would they have to cut off their contact net? Etc? I think these things would make it so a show like this isn't possible and so we wouldn't truly get to capture and see the summary of that experience in the end.	1581078944.0	fgsaxsx	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsaxsx/

Popular opinion is that CEOs are spoiled, bratty men, disconnected from the efforts of everyday life, when in reality the type of character that manages to attain such a place in these hyper-competitive hierarchies is almost always exceptionally driven, resourceful and intelligent.  I’ve worked in both upper management and bottom-rung positions, the difference is staggering. Like comparing children to to adults.

Lastly, on glitch in the matrix, on you tube, as well as on Reddit, there was a kid who got beat up senior year of high school and woke up with ten years worth of memories where he married his dream girl and had kids and one day this lamp looked really funny, as in odd, and he spent three days staring at it, freaking his wife out, so she left with the kids and than lamp kinda sucked him and he woke up bloodied and beaten on the pavement back in highschool.

174htm	I’ve often thought about doing this with members of Congress..Their pay should be based on the median income in their district or state. They get no health care and no government benefits. No access to campaign money, and can’t work in lobbying for ten years after they leave Congress. Their bank accounts would be monitored because they would not be allowed any other source of compensation unless approved by the members of their districts.

uga3bvh	We have kind of this show here in belgium and the netherlands, where a poor family and a rich family (allthough no bilionnaires) trade places for a week. They live in eachothers houses and have to survive using the weekly budget of the other family.  Its fun to watch once but its basicly the same every week. The poor family feels so out of place that they always say they are happy to go back to their own house, and the rich family calls it 'eye-opening' but I think that feelings fades away rather quickly.	1581079523.0	fgsbjmz	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsbjmz/

At the end of the experience they both get to decide if they'd like to go back to their "old life". If they both say yes, then they go back. If only one says yes, they split their lives in two, so they can both get the 'best of both worlds'.

7a28p	Depends on the person and how he made his billions. Everyone who made them themselves would have zero problem with this challenge and would actually thrive (Type 1). Those who grew up in money would be just as interesting to watch, however for the exact opposite reason (Type 2).  I expect any Type 1 person even with fake credentials would get a better job very fast. It would be interesting to see how they make the most of it.  For Type 2 the more interesting part would be to watch them suffer :).  However if they are in any way involved with managing their money actively they would be losing an astronomical amount of money in that month and it would make very little sense for any billionaire to participate in such a format.

N/A	I think it's an irrelevant exercise because the billionaire wouldn't up their lowest salary after the month is over. Why would they? 1) They don't control the pay at that level 2) We're talking about living on 1 person's pay, not a household income 3) The billionaire understands that if you want more then you earn it 4) Working at that level would likely seem like a vacation to the billionaire compared to what they had to accomplish to get to where they are.   In fact, there's a good chance they'll lower the minimum pay if legally able to.	1581079770.0	fgsbtae	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsbtae/

If it was up to me, I would just ask them to simply live how they live. The routine without changing anything. Everybody is built differently so they should adhere to the needs of their employees and not a what if. They can do that after the series. Roadblocks would be challenging travel time, denied leaves, unannounced overtime, abrupt shift changes and if possible on a struggling branch that corporate is pressuring.  Twist would be is multiple mistakes that he would intentionally make. Plus a corporate mistake that would create tension around him.

4ih7xfe0	Completely meaningless, they still have the peace of mind of knowing they'll return to their secure and excessive lifestyle after the month. At best it's a PR stunt to humanize the kind of psychopath who was willing to exploit enough people to amass a billion to begin with.  It's completely different than living your life in constant poverty and under the constant stress of the threat of losing the roof over your head or being able to feed and clothe your children.     Make it a year, add some conditions to be able to return to their old life (if they lose the roof over their head they'll never get to return to the old lifestyle, which is the statistical reality for the average person who becomes homeless) so there's some actual pressure on them and then we can get somewhere.	1581080086.0	fgsc5vs	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsc5vs/

1936xetf	It's surprisingly easy for rich people to live poor, as long as it's temporary.  You don't buy new clothes that month, don't go on holiday, don't get your car serviced, eat a bit more simply and come out feeling you have won.  Then do all your occasional big expenses the next month. Even if it's longer than a month, it's fine to do it as long as you can batch up the expenses to handle afterwards.  What the CEOs wouldn't get is the experience of living permanently like that, month after month after year, never replacing broken stuff, with no "afterwards" in sight.	1581080187.0	fgsc9we	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsc9we/

3hwpo	Honestly? They would probably say something like “wow, this is hard!” And give their employees a $1 raise and financial education. But the overarching theme would be that the billionaire is able to do ok on that salary. Why? Because poverty is doable for a month. You can live a month eating beans and rice and walking places if you know that I a few weeks you’ll get to have a steak and a butler again. The hard part of poverty is eating beans and rice knowing that this is your life forever, and an unexpected disease or car crash could destroy your life.	1581080193.0	fgsca5w	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsca5w/

157rvn	Do they still have to do their regular job? Because they then won‘t have the time to live with so little money. Neither would they even want to. Being a CEO is basically a 24/7 babysitter job, with the baby costing them millions in damages if they fuck up.  I understand the sentiment that greedy CEOs earn a shitton for exploiting the people below them, but neither does that fit all CEOs, nor is it always a cushy job like so many people imagine.   A CEO should earn more than their employees, why else would one want their often risky jobs? Would you want to decide on the fate of your company and, by extension, your employees for 2000$ a month?   Business strategies are what makes and breaks a company. And you don‘t want someone with no stakes in it making these strategies.   IMO a CEO should earn not more than a certain fixed multitude of their meanest worker. Whether that multitude is determined by some factor like the ratio of superior to inferior positions in this company or some other method I wouldn’t know.  Someone with more business sense than me ought to think of sth better.	1581080212.0	fgscaxj	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgscaxj/

N/A	I'd tweak it a bit. Make the billionaire CEO take the place of a minimum wage employee in their own company for half a year (standard TV season), while that employee gets a 6 month vacation and a modest sum of money to live off of during that time (modest being far more than they would've made while working.   Then, make it a competition. If the CEO doesn't make it to the end of 6 months, he/she has to raise the bar for employees in their company. And the employee has access to a team of investors and advisors, and has to try making that money they get grow rather than shrink. If it grows, they can keep any growth money. If it shrinks, they have to live off what remains, no additional funds will be provided.	1581080437.0	fgscjwo	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgscjwo/

4dhjary0	He will earn one million for participating this show after its end. The stocks of his company will rise.

One month on the lowest salary" and this book will become a bestseller, which will bring him a lot of money.

He'll praise how great his job is and the working environment he is in.  It's going to be a great corporate advertisement.  Being him working as the 'lowest paid' employee and him talking to his employees showing empathy and trying to take care their troubles after he's out of the show would be a good PR strategy also.	1581080561.0	fgscoz1	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgscoz1/

However, let’s assume the billionaire CEO has a multinational company and his lowest paid employee is some kid or something, in a third world, war torn country... that’d be entertaining as shit.

34vmdfza	Just a month? That’s not long enough for the sense that things really aren’t ever getting better to set in, to erase the hope that there’s something brighter just on the other side. Only a month? That’s not long enough for them to lose sight of what kind of life they’re going right back to. It’s not long enough to adapt to actually being poor (given that their lowest paid employee is in range of being poor). It’s not long enough to watch their friend groups shift based on how well they’re doing and them slowly quit interacting with you because you’re... well just not doing as well as they are. All safety nets are still in place. It’s only a month after all.   It’s not long enough to watch your life slip through your fingers as you toil away on someone else’s project and hold your dreams at bay for sometime later like around the holidays but you know very well that won’t be the case.    A month of being poor isn’t long enough to impact your credit score and limit your mobility. A month of being poor is an insulting “let’s pretend we’re like the natives darling” romp in the park. We are long past the “Aw shucks guess I learned my lesson” smirks.  Zero lessons learned and thank god we never have to do that again. Can you imagine? Why don’t they just get better jobs?    It’s also not long enough to wonder how you’re going to pay for medical bills on the shit insurance you’ve been thrust by said company. Nor is it long enough to be blindsided by medical needs.

This motivation alone would keep people smiling the entire time no matter what happened. Then they would say "see, anyone could do it". They might get the point after a year living that way, but I doubt it.   What we need is another labor movement. Less work hours. Better benefits. Being able to squirrel away more than 20$ a week because of living paycheck to paycheck. Having to blow the 20$ a week you have saved on fixing your vehicle to continue to go to work to try and start your retirement savings over again. At the very least, stop giving tax breaks to the rich and corporations. Instead give them to small business owners to encourage start ups.

qfi4n	Russia actually has a [show like this. ](https://secret-m.friday.ru/) The only difference being that the millionaire is being thrown into a tiny town for 3 days with no money at all and has to survive. They present themselves as bloggers and seek people in need of help, whom they help financially or otherwise at the end of the show, when they reveal themselves.  Be it PR or genuine reaction, most of the millionaires are shocked by the living conditions that people outside major cities live in. They always say something cliche like "I'm a different person now". I wouldn't say I trust them but it is kinda interesting nonetheless.  You can generally divide millionaires into two categories: those who accumulated their wealth over long period of time and hardwork and lucky ones and/or those who inherited it. I believe first ones could cope with the conditions in the OP, whereas the latter would panic and give up soon.	1581081060.0	fgsd94g	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsd94g/

ipbja	On Discovery Channel, there was a miniseries called Undercover Billionaire (not Undercover Boss).  The premise is putting a billionaire in a small town for three months, with a cheap pickup truck, phone with no contacts, and $100. No job or social support or other resources different from what everyone has access to.   The goal isn't to just survive, the goal is to build a company with a million dollar valuation within 90 days, without telling anyone who he is or using special resources.   And sure, he doesn't have children to support or chronic disease or outstanding debt, but for a reality tv show they do a reasonable job of documenting real events rather than inventing drama. I'd recommend it, and I'd like to talk to people about the show's strengths and flaws.  So yes, it's a good premise for a show, and I think plenty of CEOs would achieve success beyond minimum-wage survival.	1581081137.0	fgsdcdw	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsdcdw/
cmorx	I remember Pioneer House on PBS a few years ago. The concept was three families were supposed to set up a homestead to be ready to survive the winter, and were set out with no technology or modern conveniences. The producers and historians were portrayed as being sticklers for historical accuracy. One if the families was very wealthy in the modern world.  This family was filmed breaking a lot of the historical guidelines. They acquired a modern mattress, they smuggled makeup and toiletries, the kids went to a nearby modern house and used electronics, and there were other things they did that I don't recall off memory. The point is that they found a way around the reality show rules. They bent the rules to their benefit, and it made good television, so the producers obviously didn't boot them off.  I feel like the show concept you pitch would end up in the same pathway. The concept is great. If it was true to life, it would be a great show. However, someone who is wealthy and is put in a pretend situation for that short time period, will find a way, a loophole, which might take away from the "reality".  But the concept would be great. What would really be good is that there would be 'finalists', where the person would be 1 of 5 chosen, but none of them would know who would be finally chosen, and they wouldn't know when their time would start (just like real life, where you can lose your job overnight-and headhunters aren't available).	1581081137.0	fgsdceo	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsdceo/
8c2bj	I would definitely watch, but what most people don’t seem to understand is that most people who have achieved that level is success are extremely resourceful. For the most part, they would do just fine and would be able to work through most of the problems being thrown out here.  These are some of the most driven, competitive people on Earth. Do you honestly think because they are facing challenges they haven’t had to deal with before that they would just rollover?

wuvbh	I know people like to paint billionaires as these super delicate little beings that have had everything handed to them and have no idea how to survive in the ‘real world’, but that’s so far from reality it’s absurd.    What I think would happen is that they’d be fine.  The overwhelming vast majority of successful,  rich people got there because their disciplined, smart, and scrappy as hell.  I’m sure you could find some trust fund child out there that may make the show work, but it would be extremely boring otherwise.

5fo6s	The CEO is going to have inherent knowledge and ability to navigate the situation a lot easier than many low wage earners. Low wage earners aren't experiencing this in a vacuum and are regularly lacking financial literacy or the luxury to plan longterm, especially if they have kids/are a single parent etc  The show would be a feel-goody sanctimonious ABC show where the boss would "really reflect on how difficult things are". There's be some emotional ups and downs, long gazes into the distance, probably some tears.  But if you want substance, have one where they need to find an apartment, rent it out, and fend for themselves for a year.

Dumping them in a scenario that could have been made a bit easier on them had that made better choices isn't quite the same.   Shit luck happens to some people, and it sucks. Other people make their own shit luck.	1581081320.0	fgsdk5p	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsdk5p/

vxt9g	Day 1, Everything is going fine, it's not so bad.  Day 2, Runs out of money, buys in beans. Can't manage money, so even when being frugal runs out of cash.  Day 3, How can anyone live like this.  Day 4, Billionaire walks off set. No lesson learned.  In the uk two politicians made a bet that one of them couldn't live on min wage. The bet was promptly taken and the pro right wing politician who took part completely changed his tune.  There was also a tory politician who family swapped with a family in poverty. She promptly broke the rules by sneaking in £50 in her bra.	1581081343.0	fgsdl3r	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsdl3r/
1uhpp0p4	I think pay would stay the same. In big companies a lot of the decisions about turning up late to work or not meeting quota are enforced by middle management.   Middle management is where dreams of corporate success go to die. You have asslicks who have 0 experience but have charmed their way to a position of power over others and abuse that power because they have an entitlement complex. Then you have people who have been working in middle management forever and can't get the next promotion so take it out on those below them.   It's those people that make work intolerable. Those people that give you poor scores in annual reviews which deny you the next role. I think the biggest change would be the exodus of middle management and changes to corporate structure as they clear the deadwood and provide opportunities for growth in their workforce.	1581081346.0	fgsdl8i	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsdl8i/

In the first place, he is a billionaire, he doesn't have to do any demeaning shit, by his or our standards, and wouldn't even star in such a show.

They get 1000 to start for finding an apartment and some other startup expenses. If their bank account ever hits 00.00 they lose the company. If they quit to find another,job they lose the company.

They pick up their scraps, take a lesson or two and start again with a smile.  Now you want people who would have a breakdown?

5pw64	No - with few exceptions, most billionaires weren't born billionaires or even millionaires. Some of those, who were born into money, had intelligent parents who made the kid work his way up like they had. And some of the kids broke away from their parents and made it up the chain themselves.  I doubt that you would get many billionaires to agree to such a thing. Those who had golden ladders would never consider it and those who worked their way up have "been there - done that" with no desire to go back.	1581082116.0	fgseij7	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgseij7/

r098i	As appealing as this idea might seem.  A show like this on television produced backed by some large network would only serve the billionaire class by helping launder their reputations.    Same thing goes for philanthropy - used to divert attention away from the business practices that made them the billions in the first place.  and the lengths they will go to avoid paying taxes.    We don’t need any more highly edited / staged TV shows that give the average viewer the impression that the billionaire class really cares about the cheap labor that helped make them so rich.  Americans were already duped with the Trillion dollar corporate tax cuts they were told would lead to higher wages, better equipment, and more good-paying jobs in general.  Most of the money went to share buy-backs which reward Executives with their lucrative stock options and share-price/EPS based compensation incentives.	1581082344.0	fgsesq6	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsesq6/

4or47	Didnt the supersize me guy do something like this on minimum wage? I remember it being a farce when his wife kept having medical issues after a week and they pretty much said it was impossible to live like that.   The problem with these concepts is that unless they're familiar with how to survive in poverty, they'll fail colossally and fast. They throw their hands up and say "this is just not doable for me" then go back to their unreal lives of luxury. Maybe dole out some vacations for the cameras and then go back to exploiting people.   The grind is real. Skipping meals is real, calling in sick a day before payday because you only have enough gas to get to work one more time is real, visiting a food bank is real and demeaning, and asking for help when you've asked many times before is embarrassingly shameful but also real as hell.	1581082410.0	fgsevp7	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsevp7/

taj3q	It wasn't for a full month, but there was a British show where they did this sort of thing - making people with the opposite lives live with the other person for a day or two.  The millionaire business owner moved in with a single mum of two or three children living on benefits alone. He only ate baked beans on toast, and they had no frills at all. When they moved in with him they had chef cooked meals, an indoor swimming pool, saw his Ferraris etc.  Interestingly, the millionaire actually liked living like them for the couple of days, purely because it was a break. He did nothing, didn't have to think about work, and relaxed - whereas you saw that when he was at home he was working constantly, with people calling him with various issues in the business all the time as he was somewhat of a micro manager.  So he actually enjoyed the break living extremely frugally - though he was the first to make the comment that it was only because it was a short break that he knew was ending! It was interesting though to see how both of them relaxed in the other person's lifestyle, whilst worrying about every detail of their own when living in theirs.	1581082498.0	fgsezhn	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsezhn/

It's baked into how they're structured.  After that month they'd go back to their comfortable life with a new story to tell their friends how they persevered.  They'd probably exaggerate at how bad they had it (not that they'd really have the same emotional strains as their actual lowest paid employees,) and their friends would 'respect,' them for doing it. It would still change nothing.  Even if you had one with a soul for stewardship and helping others (in which case how'd they get to be CEO?) they still wouldn't be able to enact change for the better of their workforce due to their shareholders.  The faceless legion that promotes this callous thinking of 'more profits no matter the cost,' would never let anything get in between them and their dividend.

4d4zromo	No. As others have said it would be more insulting to their employees and a self serving novelty for the billionaire to piece themselves superior.  Look at it like this:  If you told me I had to live off minimum wage for a month and then I'd magically be guaranteed to become a billionaire, I'd be more than happy to eat beans and rice every meal, show up to work if I get sick, work 80 hours each week (I've done it) or 7 days a week, wrap up in blankets instead of using central heating, pretty much everything people at the bottom deal with in reality. I'd live homeless on the streets for a month if it would make me a billionaire.  There would be no fear for them, that's the difference. And when the little experiment is over they get to brag how strong they are and everyone below them deserve to stay there because it's all their own fault.	1581082991.0	fgsflvg	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsflvg/

13tu2v	It would never work.  The one thing that would happen is that it would turn into a huge PR campaign for billionaires.  Because, even if you made them do it for, let's say 3 months, it wouldn't ever be a challenge. Because, no matter how difficult for them it might be, how hard it would be for them to pull it off, especially for people born into wealth and who are too far disconnected from the reality of the lower classes today, it would still fail.  And it's for one simple reason; they only need to do it for a *finite*, set amount of time. Deep down, they would be like "Only 3 months of this and I can go back to my wealth while looking like a hero". That's the problem here. They'd put that effort for an ample amount of time, and then they are done, they win the PR stunt, get media attention and can pat themselves on the back, feeling good about "surviving" living as the lowest of the low.  If we all had a choice of living 3 months on minimum wage with no external support in exchange for media praise and then going to accumulated wealth, *we would all do it*.  Even worse, while some people wouldn't manage to succeed the challenge, those who do would just use it as a propaganda tool against the poor for daring to complain about the struggles of poor people. I can imagine a couple of billionaires who would willingly sign up, do the challenge, win, and then use it against them, because, at the end of the day, they know that, no matter how difficult, humiliating and tough this was, tney only need to do it for a small amount of time, and only once.  Meanwhile, the real poor people would just get screwed. I would never want to swap a poor person and launch them into accumulated wealth, for many reasons:  1.) Many people who are dirt poor are poor because they lack the willpower or are simply too stupid to save up money. Not every person is poor due to circumstance, some people are poor because they are unable to manage their finances.  2.) To me, giving a poor person a taste of wealth and ostentatious lifestyle for an amount of time and them forcing them back into their impoverished life is just a cruel joke.  3.) Not many people can manage their accumulated wealth. Just look at lottery winners.  So, in theory, it seems like a nice idea, but in practice, it wouldn't solve anything.	1581083004.0	fgsfmg9	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsfmg9/

tv4ndxp	A bit late to the party, but it wouldn't work, and it's not one-sided.  Let's start with the obvious — stability. Living in poverty isn't hard because you don't have cash for N (although, there are different levels of poverty if we're being specific). Living in relative poverty is hard because of the risks you're facing. Any unexpected bill or financial trouble (losing the job) can send you spiraling down back to rock bottom just as you're desperately trying to build your life back up.  Up next — despair. A friend of mine is struggling with that in particular. It's just about being far, far removed from your goals. Knowing that you're so indebted to life (not talking about credit debt here) that you can never pay it back is devastating. He's struggling with severe back and other health issues, and they're only getting worse just as he's beginning to enter adulthood. And there's just no hope for him if he keeps doing what he's doing.  And just for context, experience. Most young people tend to lack experience and understanding of the world they live in. A bit of advice would go a long way for many. I've literally known a guy who really believed he could do nothing about his employer holding his salary for 8 months (the guy was a student / intern at the time). Like it didn't budge until he literally came in with an ultimatum, which got him his money, though reasonably he didn't keep working there.  tl;dr on this side of the equation is that the so-called billionaire wouldn't be able to experience despair, knowing they have a safe place to return to. Not having that safe place and any ability to reach the life of your dreams (which for many of us is just... the basics we start with, really) is the thing that can beat you to the ground and keep you there.  \--  Now, on the other hand, that test wouldn't be thoroughly realistic for the billionaire. I mean obviously, there are times our lives take a drastic downward turn, but for most of those living in poverty these days it's a lifestyle they slowly eased into.  What I'm saying is that if an individual was plunged into that sort of lifestyle, it'd just lead to a massive breakdown. So yeah, that experiment just wouldn't really work as the downhill road to poverty is the journey of surrendering your principles and pride little by little until you turn to the only escape that you have in your life, not really caring about what comes next.	1581083182.0	fgsfum9	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsfum9/
xwkka	It's not a problem to go one month on almost no money. You just rent a bunch of library books and eat a lot of rice and vegetables. The problem is to go like that for fifty years and more, with no hope of it ever getting any better, trying to have relationships, family, education, dignity, and sense that your life has meaning and value.	1581083182.0	fgsfumi	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsfumi/
cucy9	Based on what I've seen on "Undercover Boss," these CEOs can't last a day in their employee's shoes. They'd get fired for incompetence, damaging goods, not meeting quotas, and/or putting the other employees in harm's way. On occasions when they acknowledge that poor management has caused an issue, the boss runs outside, calls up someone in management, and tells them "you better get out here and fix this."   I think if they retain their power/authority to "phone a district manager" and actually fix the working conditions, and we got to see the work environment steadily improve over three months, that'd be okay. But their immediate supervisors would probably want them fired within hours.	1581083193.0	fgsfv59	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsfv59/

49eirf4y	Theres a show in Poland and Russia where women swap lives. So a rich city woman has to take on the role of a dirt poor farm woman. They get a budget each day and have to live in eachothers homes. The rich usually dont even own the right clothes for farm work and the farmer usually is overwhelmed by the lifestyle, often doesnt enjoy every aspect and is sometimes more closed minded to trying new things. The 2 sides sit down together at the end of it and share their experience. Its hard for people to adapt to a lifestyle especially if you were born into one. The show is quite entertaining and one with a millionaire would be too but it needs to be over a longer period of time since the 2 sides are never swapped long enough to understand eachothers lifestyle.	1581083224.0	fgsfwj4	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsfwj4/

Some, like Warren Buffet, are extremely aaware and pay their employees EXCEPTIONALLY well, his secretary makes 450,000/yr. BUT, others have just completely lost touch, as well most aren't aware of salaries of the bottom most employees. That's below their eye level when doing their life.

In pretty much any business the lowest paid employee usually has a roof over their heads, has a smart phone, and has salable merchandise like a television.    Believe it or not, most CEOs and business founders weren't born rich, most of them worked their way up from somewhere in the middle class.	1581083341.0	fgsg1v0	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsg1v0/

But the CEO of the last two companies I've worked for started at the lowest paid positions in those respective companies and worked their way up. 1 started off as a janitor/delivery guy and the other a file clerk.  Those who have had a silver spoon in their mouths all their lives and inherited the position or were hired/rewarded the position because of social status in the high-end snooty community, yes, would love to see them have to do so.

The experiment really needs 4-7 months for the full effect of feeling your savings becoming debts and experiencing the sporadic moments of dread when you thought you could afford something but then your car breaks down and your pet needs to go to the vet and your roof starts leaking days after the outlandish purchase, but your next payday is 3 weeks away.	1581083457.0	fgsg79t	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsg79t/

The reason Space-X does exist is because he wanted a space ship from Russia and they spit on his feet.

I would like to see everyone who makes over a million show their taxes and explain what they do with their money.

kett2	I say this every time this subject comes up: this *would not* turn out the way people think it would. What I think is more likely to happen is the rich person would believe they were treated unfairly; that the whole experiment is really just some sort of revenge being taken out on them. They’d become paranoid and resent everything and everyone because they’d feel like everyone is in on some big plan to torture them. It wouldn’t actually occur to them that this is just normal life, and the girl behind the cash register saying “have a nice day” after she takes 60% of you net pay for a few items, isn’t a part of some grand scheme to do you harm.   I think the rich person in this experiment would come out the other end with a strong(er) hatred towards the poor and working class. From then on, they’ll do what they can to “get back” at the people that put them through that hell.	1581083882.0	fgsgqzs	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsgqzs/

3al0oi8	This entire comment thread is filled with the poisonous thoughts that keep the poor in a poor situation.   I can from less than nothing... Went 3 months straight without my family being able to put lunch money in my account at school... Their combined income was too much to get assistance for me to be able to eat lunch... And they're combined spending (most of it to "show love to others" including my brother and I) was so exorbitant that we never had any money... Then something inevitable would happen -a furnace goes out, the cars broke down, shitty things happened... And BAM no money to put food on the table...   You see it was decisions that made my family poor... Not the fact my mother worked for less than minimum wage at 2 jobs.   If you keep trying to say "put a self-made millionaire into my situation and see how she can manage it." The difference between those that are self-made success stories and the people that are vindictively commenting, is that the Self-Made category is used to starting with nothing and making the incredible sacrifices to get themselves out of their situations.  The Truth that many will not want to hear - it's never about how much you make... It's always about how much you spend on the things that you can control... If you change your perspective... You will change your life and escape the crushing burden of debt-induced slavery. Worth noting... This is not a quick process nor is it easy... That's why most people never do it. I hope - for your sake - you can stop believing you are a victim and start realizing that you can overcome it with better decisions.

5k95z027	One of two things. In scenario 1 this is a kid who was born into money. He won't understand budget or anything else and it will be one hell of a struggle just to get himself fat and you can forget about him making any of his electrical payments or rent. On the other hand in scenario 2 you have a self-made billionaire someone who actually came up from nothing. These people like Bill Gates will easily be able to work and live on that small salary and still put a little bit of money away and begin to plan how turn what little they can put away into a much larger investment and begin building their empire again from the ground up. Either story would be fascinating to watch.

They would end up malnurished, or maybe homeless but with food in their belly, assuming they could pull off the full 30 days in the first place. I think most would quit before the 30 days was even up, since most CEOs clearly don't have any idea what it's like to sacrifice necessities.  One rule though: their credit goes straight down to 500. It doesn't count if they put everything on credit and pay it off after they get access to their giant bank account again. Poor people don't have luxuries like a good credit score.	1581084267.0	fgsh8tx	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsh8tx/

8wosf	So, the CEOs end up having to move back in with their parents??? I'd love to see that!!!! ......Or even better!! Their other option is to afford themselves while finding a spouse that is financially much more successful than they are, just so they can afford their monthly bills. Then they realize that they can't help their parents or kids with anything because even being told they are a full time employee they only get hours like 15-29 hours so they qualify for not being a full-time with health and financial benefits. Then like an older twist on reality game shows, at the end they have to decide whether to go back to being CEO with his/her CEO family (and leave their new girlfriend/new wife) or stay with with their new spouse and try to rebuild their lives from scratch.   I'd actually watch this show, and probably cry at the end, and I'm the guy whose life inspired this post.  Edit: My brain forgot to add the part where the name of the show would be a play off the CEO's name each season. For example, the name of the show itself could be called Richest Lows, and if the first season was Bill Gates, it would be called Richest Lows: Hills and Gates. And the show runners would get to finish an entire season if the rich man quit early by following the rich person as their rich self, who would have to commit themselves to lobbying for the poor. Only if they made it through the entire season as a poor one climbing their ladder, would they be able to avoid lobbying for improving the lower class (in a real way).	1581084340.0	fgshcdt	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgshcdt/

y14h0	I think the essence of this is already captured in programmes like Undercover Boss - serving as an eye-opener to senior execs while providing entertaining viewing.  I'm not convinced that extending the time period or living arrangements to a month or even a year would make much difference. The empathic perspective has already been established - extending it to any finite period won't synthesize the experience of being PERMANENTLY stuck in that employee's position. To quote Pulp's 'Common People' :  "Pretend you never went to school But still you'll never get it right 'Cause when you're laid in bed at night Watching roaches climb the wall If you called your Dad he could stop it all, yeah".	1581084415.0	fgshfz8	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgshfz8/

361en87y	I think you'd have to do it like over a year as like a documentary really. I think you'd struggle to find any boss willing to do it, but I think the main issue I have as someone working on a minimum wage is the struggle of knowing it might not get better and this might be how my life is. If you're a billionaire who knows that worst comes to worst he can go back to his house with money, I feel like he would be experiencing half the lifestyle of a minimum wage worker.

e7bfa	The issue with this while it seems like a good idea on the surface, they still won't be able to emulate the utter despair of not knowing if you're going to be able to survive the next month or the one after.  It might help give some executives a glimpse into their employees live and change it for the better, but honestly for some they'd probably say things like "Rice and beans, it's quite nice I could live off this all the time no problem" and bash the employee for having luxuries if they can't afford to live.

He lives his life a certain way and has principles of where he spends his money and what extravagances he allows himself with it. Taking his billions away doesn't change that.  I could definitely see some of the generational wealth or royalty/political power families having problems. Look at Paris Hilton's show where she had to live on a farm with her friend.

15hmlf	It could backfire. A lot of CEOs will just have the same attitude as begpackers - one begpacker would become homeless in areas of poverty then stay with random families, and he would then blog about how humble the family was and how pure it was that they shared their limited food with a stranger, how it was an emotional life changing experience blah blah. He would give nothing in return, just take take take. Then assign some sort of purity and piety with poor, saying things like "they are happier with less". A very arrogant wealthy person forgets that the world has changed, their idea of poverty is "no iPhone" when in reality many poor people have phones. An iPhone costs less than a band-aid and benedryl at a hospital. Some wealthy people believe that they need a large gap between wealthy and poor (Jeff Bezos) so they will just look for the perceived positives without looking at how these lives can improve.	1581084999.0	fgsi8cf	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsi8cf/

5xy5v	I was just talking about a show with the somewhat of the opposite concept to a friend of mine. We were wondering what it would be like to have a show where a random person is given the typical entourage of an A-list celebrity. Meaning they'd have like a head of staff and then the people the staff manage, a stylist, a driver -- any kind of miscellaneous staff that A-listers need to exist as people and run their households while they're out doing their celebrity thing.   It'd be cool to hear from people in the industry that make these celebrities' lives tick, and show normal people that celebrities need people to do almost everything as far as running their lives. We'd really get to see that celebrities have more hours in their day to work and exercise and go to photoshoots when they're not bogged down with the mundane of washing dishes and picking kids up from school.	1581085025.0	fgsi9jk	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsi9jk/

h6h2v	I wouldn't watch it at all. The chances of them actually learning anything are pretty low.  They won't ever feel the real dread because the motivation for it will never be there. No matter how obnoxious it gets to eat rice and beans for a couple months, they'll know that if shit gets a little too real, they can stop it with a snap of their fingers. No one is going to let Jeff Bezos die from a disease he can't afford to treat or let whichever Koch brother is still alive go into ketoacidosis because he had to cut his insulin dose in half to try to make it through the month.  Them learning anything if they're working at their own company is the most laughable part. Does anyone not know what the billionaire that owns their company looks like? And no matter how strictly they're ordered to treat him just like everyone else, does anyone really think the manager is going to corner him up and yell at him for an hour because he was distracted by the abscess tooth he's been in pain from for a month but can't afford to fix knowing they'll be back to being the owner again in a few months?

And then here comes a pizza delivery, as if it softened the blow of time away from our family & the rough day we would inevitably have.

It’s a grind. A way of dealing with life that someone very wealthy cannot understand during any limited period of time.  Unless you go all in.  No TV cameras, first of all. It can’t be a show. That will give you special treatment.  Drop the billionaire off, somewhere he is completely unknown.  With $200.  He has to get a job and find a place to live.

4f0qu	There was a show similar to this with Morgan Spurlock, called 30 days like 10 years ago.  "30 Days was an American reality television show on the FX cable network in the United States, created and hosted by Morgan Spurlock. In each episode, Spurlock, or some other person or group of people, spend 30 days immersing themselves in a particular lifestyle with which they are unfamiliar (e.g. working for minimum wage, being in prison, a Christian living as a Muslim etc.), while discussing related social issues. As in Spurlock's film, Super Size Me, there are a number of rules unique to each situation which must be followed during each such experiment. At least one episode each season has featured Spurlock as the person spending the month in the particular lifestyle."  The one episode I can remember watching had Spurlock living on minimum wage, and went on to show him getting hurt at one of the day labor jobs he had. Since he didn't have health insurance, and couldn't afford much, he had to go to free clinics (ended up being turned away and had to keep going back to try and get in). That caused him to miss work, which meant less money... so on and so forth.  He realizes how bad that life sucked, and ended up providing health insurance for his whole production crew as well as promising better wages.	1581085433.0	fgsitqv	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsitqv/

jgnj1	It's been done:   "Undercover Billionaire" is a new TV show that premiered on Discovery on August 6 at 10 p.m., in which the entrepreneur Glenn Stearns tries to **create a million**\-**dollar** company in **90 days** in Erie, Pennsylvania, without his previous contacts or capital." He starts off with a 100 bucks and a 20 year old pickup.

Although the billionaire's experience would be affected the entire time by the knowledge that once it was over they could go back to their cushy life, which of course is not the case for us little people.

8gcvd	I don't think it would give a fair simulation of extreme poverty.  1. Even if they aren't getting enough calories they won't starve to death in a month if they eat a four meals a week. Health impacts of malnutrition or low quality fooda aren't going to be big over a month.  2. The billionaire, even if they have kids won't being them with them on the adventure and won't have to support them. Thus, they don't have to worry about feeding and clothing them.  3. it is hard to get evicted in a month, so even if they lose their job, which they won't. They will still avoid the stress and financial burden of being homeless especially with a family.  4. If they or a family member gets sick or injured he knows that they will get medical care. They have a lifetime of good nutrition, great medical care, and mental health support.  5. Clothing and cars don't get worn and broken within a month. If the engine makes a funny noise you can usually wait a month.  6. They will go into it with no debt and they know any debt they do will be taken care of at the end of the month.  7. Mentally it is easy to get through a month knowing that at the end of 30 days, you'll be fine. A life sentence of crushing poverty is very different mentally and physically.    tl;dr It would be more like a 30 camping adventure than actual poverty.	1581086035.0	fgsjoeu	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsjoeu/

4flws	1) Reality TV is fake, so what's the point?  2) This is some dystopian shit. You have no hope of escaping your hellscape of a life, so tune in to watch oligarch get pranked.  3) What is the incentive for any billionaire to do this? I don't see how any show could have the production budget to entice a billionaire to humiliate themselves for a month or more.  4) Do they get housing, transportation, and other necessities to start? Otherwise the show would just be them sleeping in the cold a few nights and then sucking dick to get drug money.  Which isn't a terrible show idea.  5) Maybe have the CEO and employee switch places? Then you could cut from the CEO trying to figure out a microwave to the employee doing King Ralph antics. Or maybe the employer has a come-to-jesus month and vows to fix everything at the end of the month. But then they find out the employee used the time to completely liquidate their fortune.

5o8kn	Why should a CEO have to do this?  The lower wage workers are there for a reason. Whether it be lack of education or lack of experience. The entitlement of people today thinking they should make what a CEO makes is unreal. The lower wage positions need to be filled so they don't get outsourced. Not everyone is going to make 100k a year, people need to learn to live on the wage they make. To many people are what I call 30k millionaires. They make a wage that is livable but want to have all the toys of someone who makes 3x as much as them. It's all because of social media too, it's very easy to post yourself in a Porsche. But your followers will never know you're leasing it and that you can barely afford it, let alone that you're not putting any money in the bank at the end of the month.	1581086055.0	fgsjpf1	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsjpf1/

7q4si	The thing they won't experience though is the loss of hope. After their time, they get to return to their normal life. When you believe you'll be nothing other than poor, you lose hope, and that's a miserable place to be in life. It also gets worse as you get older. Being poor at 20 is different than being poor at 50. At 20, you have time to fix your life and come out on top. At 50, you have less energy, often health issues, and no one wants to hire an entry-level 50-year-old in anything (if you try to change jobs to help your situation).  Sometimes, even when you're experienced you can get age discrimination because there's just no way to keep pace with youth.	1581086390.0	fgsk6jx	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsk6jx/

xmr4jr	We have to have real stakes for a billionaire though.

They wouldn't have a lifetime of bad habits and negative emotional responses to money and budgeting that poverty beats into you.

14ztsp9	This idea reminds me of "Undercover Boss", except the boss doesn't get the employee's pay. It's kinda nice to see them have to do the tasks of the employee. I work in a store, and sooo many tasks are put on us that is's impossible to accomplish everything. The tools we need to do what we need to are in short supply, often not in working order, or not even right for doing the job. I'd LOVE to see the highest level of management come and actually attempt to do what they are asking of us.

Billionaires like elong musk get to stay though hes pretty cool.	1581086818.0	fgskt0b	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgskt0b/

2eo38ezy	But Elon has been there. He’d probably start another genius company and become a billionaire again.  So now he’s double billionaire.  All hail Papa Musk	1581086834.0	fgsktv9	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsktv9/

38jtf	.  A founding CEO? They probably worked all the jobs along the way to building the corporation, they have no trouble doing the working level tasks, maybe rusty at it now, but they did it all. A professional executive that got put in the CEOs position would be a different scenario. Also, if a CEO came from a working class background they will have some jobs they did as teenagers just like everyone else and know that working level. If the CEO got there from a wealthy background and well placed family network then they will fail at the low tasks because they never did those nor similar jobs.  .	1581086841.0	fgsku7m	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgsku7m/

7zf13	What would happen? The CEO would be like “damn this fucking sucks. I’m glad I got a higher education, worked my ass off 80 hour a week, sacrificed time with my family, and dealt with a stressful job so that I had qualifications leading to positions beyond the lowest paid one at this company.”	1581086875.0	fgskw0q	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgskw0q/

yszrv	I remember when Gwenyth Paltrow did that food bank challenge and bought a load of limes and shit, took her two days before she was seen in a resturant. That said it does depend on the billionare, I hate to burst reddits rich-guy hate boner (actually what am I saying I love doing that) but a majority CEOs work damn hard, put the hours in and don't have time for luxuries anyway. To get a billion you have to put in the hours and work which would translate.    What I would watch is a few of those trustfund child twats doing something like this, they'd crumble in a day.	1581086894.0	fgskx1w	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgskx1w/
si5p3vw	No I would not watch it. He would be followed by a camera crew and his mindset would probably not mach that of his lowest paid employee.His lowest paid employee would likely have a family to care for or they may be in debt. The CEO would have none of that.  I feel this show would be something similar to Undercover Boss where the billionaire is shown in the best light possible and they would walk away without really changing.	1581086898.0	fgskxai	t3_f08dxb	t3_f08dxb	/r/AskReddit/comments/f08dxb/would_you_watch_a_show_where_a_billionaire_ceo/fgskxai/
