The administration never changed hands because it was a fraud! Stop the steal!!!	<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to understand, Shitlord; The protected need protection from the unprotected, so they want to make the unprotected get the same protection that isn&#39;t protecting the protected..... or something.

No he conned them alright - he said he’s not mentally impaired or too old. He has done nothing and botched every single issue. He’s been unable to talk to any media and his handlers manage him.

Guys I can't keep up. We knew the virus wasn't real last year but now it's very real and deadly. Help please go Trumbo Brandon bad!	Satan: I'll make sure Trump burns along with you!	0.482
When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn’t the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don’t believe in god as you have stated as it’s just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a “leftist stooge” either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	He refused to get the vaccine.

How dare you assign gender!  Fucking bigot!  /s	That said; I agree completely, if you want the vaccine you should be allowed to get it, and if you don't want it you shouldn't be forced.	0.641
The administration changed hands, just not legitimately. Nothing can be done now. Shoring up election integrity has been and should continue to be a priority for the right going forward.	<p>That being said, if your kids are naive enough to be easily persuaded by tv shows and television commercials, it&#39;s because they&#39;re either very young, or it&#39;s because you failed to teach them how to do their own research and form their own opinions about things they see on tv.</p>	0.453

I don't even think the person in question knows the answer to that.	But the TLDR is that I think she’s way underrated and catches a lot of flak for disagreeing with Trump on foreign policy and politely resigning. She still maintains positive relations with Trump, didn’t endorse against him or revolt and stayed team GOP,  has an American dream story rising from a local family owned clothing story as the daughter of immigrants to youngest governor in South Carolina history, and happens to have a strong foreign policy background, which is going to strengthen her case in 2024 considering we have the worst foreign policy president in modern US history in office right now. Not to mention she’d shore up the women, college educated, and Indian vote.	0.658

Listen she’s a gigantic piece of shit, but she was never charged with assaulting a police officer.	As for the mRNA based vaccines it's actually a misconception that this is new technology. While it is true on a relative scale mRNA is newer than the traditional approach it has actually been studied for decades. In fact they have used mRNA in the treatment of cancer and have yet to see any issues.	0.656
And the title is wrong lmao, she was never charged with assaulting police. That’s my point; it’s a sensationalist title. She’s a massive piece of shit who deserves jail time, but she was never charged with assaulting police officers.	<p>One of the things I liked about Trump is that he was willing to do this on many fronts.</p>	0.525
So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.	<p>the deal breaker in voting for Biden (even though he wasn&#39;t my ideal choice) was his stronger policy fighting COVID</p>	0.694

Didn't you hear? They changed the definition of vaccine again to "any injectable solution which increases your bodies ability to pay Pf!zer"	So, I'll ask again.

Repent to your imaginary God so that I'll accept your conservative human values?

There is no such thing as 100%. Even the best medical procedures aren’t 100%. Even the best bullet proof vests don’t stop all bullets. Only fucking idiots like yourself think it’s all of nothing.

You're right, it's not political. Why are we putting those struggling with a mental disorder on pedestals while shooting down those that speak the truth?

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing. For the week ending December 23rd, almost 199,000 child COVID-19 cases were reported, a 50% increase over the weekly new cases the beginning of December. Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000. Since the first week of September, there have been over 2.5 million additional child cases.  Sick kids isn't a subject that comes with a lot of comedic through-lines.

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.  The concept of conservatism is that people mind their own business and don't look to harm others right?  Okay great, mind your business and get your second hand smoke out of my personal space, aka get out of my face.  You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.  Vaccinated or not, if you're spreading it to me and my family by behaving in an unsafe manner, then you're not being a conservative.  You're forcing something on me.

Don't be selfish and think that the only rights and freedoms that matter are your own, especially because they are in direct conflict with mine and others.  Are you one of those conservative in name only people who does the "rules for thee but not for me!" bullcrap?  You just stated that loving thy neighbor isn't a conservative tenant?!?!

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they’ve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don’t have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it’s effects, then make another choice and see it’s effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it…it doesn’t make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest. Add in the fact that you can’t sue companies for vaccine injuries, you’re asking for Foul Play.	There are charges brought, but you’d also probably not hear about those. It depends on what they were actually doing: https://www.npr.org/2020/09/05/909245646/review-of-federal-charges-in-portland-unrest-show-most-are-misdemeanors	0.567

If I trespass in your house I lose a lot of protections, freedoms,, and rights because again, it's your house.  When I send my vaccinated kids to school and another parent sends their unvaccinated covid positive kid to school, they are harming my children.

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There’s small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it’s just so important for us to remember that we’re protecting ourselves, but we’re also protecting those little ones who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing: US pediatric hospital admissions for Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334 children have been admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services. 	Bigger question, what will biden do?</p>	0.701

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.

The easy rebuttal to that is that the election wasn’t between Republican and Democrats, but between populist and establishment groups.

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn’t have voted in person if mail in ballots weren’t an option  It excludes the fact that it isn’t just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn’t be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.

That didn’t happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don’t start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don’t try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies.

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	<p>There are surveillance videos of shoplifters holding calculators to make sure they don’t exceed $950.</p>	0.499

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?

That was enough for the country to decide private ownership of firearms wasn’t worth the risks.

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.  The important point here though is that no elected official should tell registered American citizens that they can't vote -- a basic and fundamental American right -- just 'cause they came from this or that "blue" state. FFS that woman is an embarrassment.	This is exactly the point and takes the argument away from liberals that if you’re against the mandate you *must* be anti-vaxx and/or science denying. Mandates are implemented to force compliance and have repercussions. The mandate isn’t saving ppl, the vaccine is. Slapping a mandate on it only allows the government to punish non-compliance.	0.728

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.

Hey, if you’re on board to have the government ban smoking, then I’m with you all the way.

That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn’t know much about Covid, and when we weren’t prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they’re helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don’t get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	> She's 15. 15 year olds do dangerous stupid and malicious shit all the time, sometimes with disastrous consequences.	0.512

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*. That would help slow the spread - if you have the vaccine, you’re less likely to get Covid if exposed to it.   It’s been clear for a long time that you can still get sick if you get the flu shot (it’s a good analogy here, since Covid and the flu are pretty similar).

You’re right, I’m sorry for attacking you.

Of course there are some cases where Covid gets a foothold because of a weakened immune system because of something else, but the data is pretty confident that the number is accurate.	<p>travelled to a place he&#39;s never been</p>	0.466

And, you're posting meme level content that a 14 year can rip apart.   1.)  No one (who knows what they're talking about) ever said vaccinated couldn't spread COVID.  They did say they spread it at a lower rate than unvaccinated and that remains true.  There has never, ever been a 100% effective vaccine.  The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	Therefore, socialism is bad.	0.697

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that “Honor the Confederacy”. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can’t find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don’t want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don’t represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it’s hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>Same here; this is awesome, that it has continued year after year.

Hopefully the second test comes back negative as well so she can then immediately get the second shot, giving her the 90% immunity it’s supposed to have instead of the ~30% after just the first shot. She has multiple underlying conditions that would make Covid extremely dangerous for her. I’ve been terrified for her this entire past year, since she’s an essential worker so has been in the thick of it since the beginning. I have issues with anxiety and a panic disorder so it really hasn’t helped things mentally for me heh, I don’t think I could survive if anything were to happen to her, we’ve been married for 25 years.

You seem to have misread something. I didn't say that the southern states flipped and voted Republican forever and always ever since. I said the Republicans dominated Presidential elections, then Democrats changed their strategy to target cities and that split the votes within states to states would not be voting mostly 1 single direction anymore, they were contested from both sides. You have provided no information that changes that.

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn’t have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn’t “leaving behind” her constituents, because she’s still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she’s traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don’t even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn’t a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to “own the libs” and it’s straight up awful.	<p>The fact that he’s going along with this is a pretty clear self admittance that he is in fact nothing more than a figure head for those that are running the country from the Whitehouse.</p>	0.543

One thing that I know matters, but wouldn&#39;t know how to factor is charisma. Popularity would come close, but I don&#39;t know exactly how I would compare it. Obama was very charismatic, and Trump was popular (speech turnouts).

Reaganite Republicans have continued cutting taxes to “unleash” “entrepreneurship,” but the rich people thus favored keep turning into Democrats. Loudoun County, Virginia, now the richest U.S. county, was until recently a rock-solid Republican place. George W. Bush won it by 16 points in 2000. But Barack Obama took an 8-point victory in 2008, Hillary Clinton won it by 17 in 2016, and Joe Biden won it by 24 in 2020—a 40-point shift in two decades. In the weeks leading up to December’s finance reports on the pair of Georgia Senate runoffs, the Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, each raised more money than both of the Republican candidates. There are still vestiges of the old dispensation: One of the Republican candidates, Kelly Loeffler, wife of the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, had donated $23 million of her own money.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here’s my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say “Well I’m a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women’s bathroom.” It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women’s bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead.

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright?

My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	<p>Then it Californiated and it’s gone to hell.

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you’ve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	<p>Also, notice how any Trump supporting sub reddit is banned for no other reason than supporting Trump.

Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they’re good at what they do? That is literally socialism.

I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.    All of my colleagues have been vaccinated, as well as a significant amount of the other hospital workers.  The only people we see getting sick are generally the ones who are unvaccinated.  Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.  Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	<p>The absence of liability in case a vaccine presents side effects later down the line in tandem with the gradual closing of rights for the unvaccinated is completely odious. Personal responsibility should be at the core of all of it: if you want to make the decision to vaccinate then good for you, it&#39;s a decision I believe to be correct - however, if you don&#39;t want the vaccine you pose no risk to me and should have every right to live the same way I do.</p>	0.675
She posted unverified data and tried to sell it as truth of COVID crimes or something from the context of different articles.

However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn’t you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others?

excellent answer, beats the whole 'left' is crazy no matter what they do replies I have gotten...Do you really think Greene is insterested in having an open and honest debate about anything? that isnt what twitter is there for in the first place(I dont agree with them blocking people, just like I dont agree with the crappy mods here doing the exact same thing).

I would like nothing more than to see an open debate between all the healthcare professionals (including) those that had their social media accounts shut down due to "misinformation".

Pit every medical professional against one another in an open debate about Covid-19 and Vaccines, let the American people decide who to believe.

Well, becides Rand Paul arguing with Tony Fuaci, I have not seen these debates take place on national TV. I read articles from CNN, MSNBC, Reuters, Fox, NY Times and a host of other media outlets. I think we can agree the left has the advantage when it comes to mainstream media, that causes a lot of frustration among the Right when it comes to being able to have their voice heard.   I'm simply advocating for an end to censorship, regardless of what platform you're on.	Also why are you talking about illicit drugs? I said marijuana in states where it is legal.	0.498

Last I checked, Twitter is a publicly traded company with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders and is not bound by the Constitution to protect, preserve, or promote any or all speech as it is not an arm of the government. MTG, or anyone for that matter, has as much a right to a twitter account as she does to a Planet Fitness membership in Des Moines IA.   It sounds like two things happened:  1: she fucked around.  2: she found out.  On a separate note: failing to recognize CrossFit cougars like MTG and drunk range bunnies like Boebert for the grifters they are is going to fuck the GOP a lot harder than that dipshit Biden could manage in 3 terms with Congress and a 21 seat SCOTUS in his pocket. If Boebert and MTG are the future of the party, then Alex Jones deserves to be the chairman.	<p>They had a lot of mic issues during Mudvayne&#39;s bit but that band put their heart into the performance.

My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn’t fascistic.   There is a long history of countries - including the US - requiring foreigners who are entering a sovereign nation - to present medical records, including proof of vaccination.

How is this rejecting history?

DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.

But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	<p>The vaccine doesn&#39;t stop the spread.

I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them.

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have “his due.” There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	YOU. ARE.

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.

Conservative "blue dog" Democrats (which I was back in the 90s/early 00s) basically are incompatible with the modern Democratic party because we can't support their current brand of blatant anti-Liberalism.

Also stop projecting, it's annoying as fuck. I listed 4 things with taxation being one of them.

Otherwise I think I'm done chatting since you obviously don't even know what they thing you're promoting is  Edit: and no that is not the only form of socialism. It's redistribution of wealth. Not shared ownership (which is either socialism or communism)	People think of California and New York as solid blue states, but that’s a recent phenomenon. For example, both of those states voted for Reagan. California even voted for George HW Bush. And if you look at governorships, it gets even more interesting. Over the past century, California has spend a lot more time with Republican Governors and Lieutenant Governors and Attorneys General and Secretaries of State and so on. The California executive offices have spent far more time under red control than under blue control. The solid blue California you see today only came about pretty recently. Remember, this is a state that had Ronald Reagan as its governor for 8 years, and that was during the 60s and 70s, the real formative years that laid the groundwork for Silicon Valley to emerge. To give you an example, in the 44 years from 1967 to 2011, the Governor was a Republican for 32 of those years vs a Democrat for only 12.	0.722

The technology has to be developed and deemed viable before it takes effect anyway, and if not by a certain date, an explanation as to why it's unfeasible has to be given.     Louis Rossmann did a good job explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg)     Just because we understand the lunacy of the left doesn't mean we should be careless in our criticism of them.

If I were you I’d go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not?

Yes, a Fox News video. We should definitely base our opinions and world view off of anecdata.

Sweetheart, don't hurt yourself too much tripping over your propaganda. Democrats would love nothing more than print at home ballots and drop boxes. Voting rights for illegals and maybe let's just throw online voting. You're pathetic because you've been so brainwashed to think that you're so virtuous that you think we are the ones outside the circle. Save me the propaganda, I wasn't born in the us.

I know exactly what's happening, perhaps YOU'RE the snowflake here with your hurt feelings and constantly having to worry about what next big corrupt thing your party will be guilty of next. Just because the corporate media isn't broadcasting the truth, doesn't give you the excuse to be stupid.	<p>Dude, you suck at this.  Seriously.</p>	0.443
First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights’ worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you’re never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they’re actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they’re saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I’ll paste from another reply:  “I can tell you, the argument isn’t that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?”	My first comment to you was arguing the vaccine’s main efficacy as defined by reduced hospitalizations, and that it’s not guaranteed to prevent a positive covid test.

As far as voter fraud goes that’s purely “what if’s” too, correct?   Why did we need the voting rights act in the first place? At some point, not that long ago, the south was very willing to suppress the vote of minorities. Did it end? When? When someone has shown they aren’t willing to play fair (targeted closures of voting precincts), maybe you tread carefully after.

State employees would obviously require valid government ID to be hired, so again, that's a moot point.	I don't Germany was a good country.

> not moot at all just another example of republicans trying to suppress the vote as with the NC example.  Again.  To get a student ID, the student needs a state-issued ID.

Couldn’t the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven’t had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I’m going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don’t see it because we don’t have transparency on either side. It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side.   It’s not about POLITICIANS, it’s about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can’t let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They’re all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	<p>Vacations are political now?</p>	0.538
We just don’t see it, or hear it, because we don’t talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say “the leftists” or “the democrats”, not the looters.   Just like democrats say “the republicans that stormed the capitol”. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It’s Red or Blue only, and there’s no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say “hey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b”.

Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted “go home”, they would have listened?

While I still like some Republican views, I’m more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I’m not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn’t criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - “the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable”. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It’s about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of “go home”. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don’t think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you’re a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	<p>If you disagree, okay.  That&#39;s fine.  But talk about why, instead.  It helps everyone to see and understand all opinions, so if you have some, the original comment there is a great kickstart for it.</p>	0.567

Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I’m general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it’s a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it’s a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it’s a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics?

So on that same side, do you think there were no republicans that utilized the rioting and looting for their own benefit? Or exacerbated it?   Again, those people that were at the capitol and looters are not democrats or republicans. They’re anarchists. They’re terrorists. And they’re people that do not know how to handle situations rationally.

You’re right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said “I know you’re hurt and this was stolen from us.” He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn’t have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  “[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)”  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that’s not the part we’re taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It’s a political game. It’s hard to go back and find tweets that aren’t in the news, but I’m sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	<li><p>Russia is in no position to fight a war, they have a GDP smaller than a lot of our states by themselves, most of their equipment is out of date by decades and they&#39;d gain nothing by attacking us.</p></li>	0.563

I’ll donate $20 to the [Animal Welfare Institute](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/best-animal-charities/) (who is one of the highest rated charities worldwide) if you can name 50% of the party this is cooperating,excluding Liz Cheney, who has always supported it participating than yes. I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it’s non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying “all” was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that’s just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they’ll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It’s okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I’ll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	<p>Plus, obviously need to pay for snow removal, infrastructure and other things which cost money. I think our local city officials have done a good job with what they get and since we only get 300k from the state to pay towards our school here, they must do really well with the money we pay towards that, unlike other schools in the bigger cities which get a huge amount from the state.</p>	0.488
Because it’s a super easy thing to criticize even for a Republican, but none of you will. Talk ill about the politicians who did nothing, aren’t cooperating, or are arguing against it.

Why do you assume that I’m for defunding, and also why do you think defunding means removal of officers? Why do you think that all democrats have the same view point? We don’t.

Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.

It’s the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren’t allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn’t cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you’re dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren’t blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately.

Boosted death rate is under 0.5 per 100,000 for all weeks displayed, while unvaccinated ranges between 1.7 and 7.6 per 100,000.

Such shortsightedness. Many children are born into circumstances that are absolutely not appropriate. Ignoring the obvious (rape etc.), it makes absolutely zero sense to compel a woman to carry to term. You might have a point of America actually gave a shit about children’s welfare beyond this argument, but you’re severely lacking in any kind of appropriate support for mothers, childcare provisions, accessible healthcare etc.  Be against abortion by all means, but it’s an absolute joke to call it genocide.

It’s difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you’d look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.

Right, so by you’re logic you’re quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can’t support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it’s acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It’s the ‘parents responsibility’ to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they’ll suddenly ‘get it’ and do a good job… but they’re not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	<p>Now I get annoyed and turn the TV off, or just watch old gameshows and sitcoms from 30 years ago.</p>	0.477

So I’m presuming you support policies that help mothers/fathers provide the best possible car for the child once it is born? I presume you’d fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves? Or is it some binary thing of “alive or dead” where quality of that life means fuck all?  If you fully support the above, then we may disagree but I could see your stance. If you’re of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you’re not pro life at all, you’re pro control and don’t care about welfare of the child at all.

Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.

 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‘unwanted’ children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I’m not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that’s been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, “Some believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.” His citation: Freakonomics. “Whether accurate or not,” he continued, “these observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.”  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It’s an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don’t think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn’t very policy-relevant. If you’re pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful….      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that’s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you’re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s’ can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument’s moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	<p>Then you look at the liberal media and see a fucking headline of “Biden win proved by audit” with absolutely nothing to back it up and the typical liberal crowd rushed to laugh it off. </p>	0.663

Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	<p><em>The former President</em> endorses the election fraud conspiracies.

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.

He&#39;s literally doing his job by reaching across the aisle and showing support for someone who I&#39;m sure he personally despises because he&#39;s mature enough to recognize that even if you hate someone, you can still agree sometimes. Meanwhile, she&#39;s spouting hate and divisiveness needlessly. She really is acting like a child, and deserves all the hate she&#39;s getting for it because she is genuinely a shitty, disgusting human being, and this tweet reaction makes that abundantly clear.</p>	0.535
Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it’s very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It’s a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you’re sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you’re worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn’t that also change the probability of killing someone?	So you want him to pay additional federal taxes on assets as well as unrealized gains that contribute to the bulk of his net worth?	0.578

It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	<p><em>probably should add an /s to point out I&#39;m kidding</em></p>	0.586

Nope. Are you claiming all those 5 million were from unvaccinated? How about the fact that there have been more deaths since Biden took over as there was when Trump was President, and Biden has had the vaccine with over half the United States  vaccinated?

First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	<p>I guess I’m just more fiscally conservative than most and look at Trump as a failure because he raised the national debt almost as much as Obama despite being in office for 4 less years.</p>	0.633
In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption.

This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	Source?	1.0
The issue that I have is that your choice does effect others.  For each surge that we had, our hospitals were clogged full of unvaccinated people.  We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.     As a physician I know that the current vaccine is still highly effective in keeping people from hospitalization and death.  Hopefully this will give us time for the production of the more effective medication.	<p>If we&#39;re under martial law, we&#39;re already enemies, sweetheart.</p>	0.475
I do think they have somewhat of a point. For example, the trend of people not vaccinating their children in recent years has brought about small outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, etc.	<p>This is definitely getting more into the realm of opinion than classical definitions of corruption, but I think that it you&#39;re still in office you shouldn&#39;t operate under the impression that people care so much about your life, story, or ideas that they&#39;d want to read them en masse. Additionally, if you&#39;re still in office you are serving the people, they aren&#39;t serving you.

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They’ll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape.

I’ve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I’d like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you’ve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I’m sure you’re a great man. I’m not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don’t think that. What I’m saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is “loose.” Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can’t rely on the father for financial support and can’t support a child alone.   Please don’t meet me with hate. Please don’t abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.	<p>I have conservative beliefs, but that’s about as far as it goes.

 No one was charged *yet*	<p>I just think it’s time for someone who may be more palatable to the general public as a whole.

Well if your grandma made the pipe bombs, then she should be arrested and the situation should be investigate why so many trumpers have been found inside past police barriers.    Every BLM that damaged a building should also be held accountable.  See how easy that was.  Everyone should be held accountable for their actions.  Instead you deflect, deflect, deflect.  I'll let the Minneapolis police and Minneapolis politicians handle their city.  I want federal investigations on what happens in federal buildings.

It took forever to actually get a response for the problem and the President of the United States wasn't ever even who called for reinforcements. Apparently getting him to provide his half-assed message to tell his own followers to leave the capital was its own project that required a great deal of pressure. This shouldn't need to be said, but just because somebody acts like a dictator doesn't mean they're a rolemodel.	The fact of the matter is conservatives aren't being fired because they are conservatives. Which conservative views got her fired? What is happening is conservatives are more likely to say offensive and inaccurate statements that reflect poorly on themselves and whoever they work for.	0.559
Name another US prez that publicly insisted to his base that an election was “fake” and “rigged”.  That right there to me is a huge red flag. I don’t understand why you don’t see that as particularly heinous. Yeah, that in and of itself is, admittedly, not direct evidence for the claim of insurrection, but it certainly lays the groundwork.   Does the damage that rhetoric caused to the foundation of our democracy not concern you?	Prop guns don’t shoot bullets.	0.575

The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.' "  https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-effort-live-updates/2021/01/11/955631105/impeachment-resolution-cites-trumps-incitement-of-capitol-insurrection  That sure seems like evidence to me.	1. people who are good at their job and don't want to see anything change because they know they'll earn less	0.566

Almost like an investigation is needed....	As far as the other shit, good for her and the fuckery she is involved in.

Let’s be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what “side” they’re on. So don’t try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I’m not.   But you’re trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn’t be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn’t clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to “protest” a “stolen” election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	<p>Lol if I was being paid to sit at home, or go to work for EQUAL pay, or even a little more, I&#39;d stay at home. </p>	0.427

First of all, things are already chaos, you can thank Trump and his cronies for that.  Second, I couldn’t notice your lack of defense for Trump’s quote of “if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.” Care to perform your mental gymnastics for me to justify that one? Just curious.	<p>I just find it funny that Bernie ran on “This country wasn’t progressive enough under Obama” while Trump and a lot of the Rs ran under “Obama was a far left communist and turned the country into a left wing shithole”</p>	0.475

This is literally part of the findings of the 1/6th committee. Getting Trump to tell his supporters to leave the capital was a big ask that was at best half-assed.

This is a bad bill and sad to see such support in the comments.  Paternity can't be proven at conception. So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.  This is going to be abused to hell and back, with seemingly no course for action for when the wrong man is held accountable.   A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.   Smart policy needs to incentivize parents to stay together.	<p>The funniest jokes are those that have some truth to them.</p>	0.435

You do know that your body doesn't know why it's producing the injected spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine, right? This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	<p>This goover needs to sit down.

Sorry but last time I checked if you had Covid wether they were bad symptoms or not, you stayed home. Vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting Covid or spreading it.

1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it’s future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	>  The text of the constitution is important but the Supreme Court can interpret the constitution however it wants and can decide what it means	0.586

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nNFvr8xaA4"">Same thing from a different camera.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.  Plain and simple.	<p>Fox news, on the other hand, have cultivated an extremely dedicated cultish type base on the right. They watch Fox constantly while the left tends to read more.

But the vaccine doesn't actually stop the spread. You transmit it just the same.	It's remarkable. These people face a fraction of the (corporate media) scrutiny, yet still get unmasked.

You seem like you would fit well in my new sub r/ComplexPeople. I hope plugging subreddits are allowed in this sub…   Anyway, I noticed that you may be conservative leaning since you lurk on this sub, yet aren’t afraid to question the legitimacy of particular things. Not everyone has to agree with everything a political affiliation just says, and it is very important for us to freely state opinions or ask questions regarding particular worldly topics.  r/ComplexPeople promotes the idea that people are complex and are able to share viewpoints from multiple political parties. It promotes free thought and respectful debate or discussion between those who may agree with you and those who do not. Being condescending is not allowed, and members must conduct themselves professionally. The sub is aimed to help rational minded people effectively learn of each others viewpoints and live harmoniously regardless if viewpoints are opposed. If you’re interested in these sentiments, I would love for you to join to help make Reddit and this world a better place!  PS: I apologize for the shameless copy and pasting. I just really do think this new sub can be beneficial for the reddit community.	<p>I think the House Republicans’ unconscionable failure to act on their own against MTG kind of forced the Dems’ hand though.

Big Pharma lobbying against weed is based on 100% bullshit.    They don't care about recreational marijuana use.  Their issue is with people who sell medical marijuana using unscientific claims.  Big Pharma complains about herbal supplements, snake oil, holistic medicine.  They have to spend money and pay the US government to make their medicine prescribable by doctors. They have companies like Amway.  Medical marijuana industry wants more lax FDA regulation than Big Pharma gets.  Their issue is not with weed but with the herbal supplement and vitamin market, giving weed products FDA medical labels without the years of research to back them.   They don't care about recreational marijuana use, they welcome it.  It will creates more customers for them in the long run.  From what I've heard they lobby in favor of recreational marijuana deregulation because they think it will make the medical marijuana lobby go away.	What's the big deal with a blowjob?

> At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.  None of this was behind closed doors. Most of it was index fund ETFs which I was told was supposed to be the only allowable investment by this sub, and the rest of it was after the completely public bill text was unsurprisingly passed.  What a bullshit hit piece. It's talking about the ROI on 6 individual trades not his actual portfolio.  > But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%.  The S&P ETFs he bought way out performed this purchase by nearly double. After BA opted for private funding rather than the offered public funding.

Answer:👇  Sadly, it’s the West that’s been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia’s doorstep.  Putin hasn’t been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It’s been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What’s happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‘RESPONDED’ by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets’ military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America’s nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn’t having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn’t fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we’re a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.👇  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	<p>How are people this stupid?

Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	<p>Completely agree about politicians.

This actually makes sense because I have always thought that Jan 21st 2023 Biden is removed from office or steps down on his own.  That way whoever is VP would be able to run 2 more times for a total of 10 years, but then they picked Harris as the VP who is super unlikeable.  But if they put Harris in the Supreme Court then they can get anyone else as VP and then President in 2023.  It is all working out.	It should be obvious that those Trump supporters that stormed DC, while being Trump supporters, do not accurately represent the majority of current Trump supporters, let alone all people who simply voted for Trump (some of whom simply found Trump the lesser of two evils, whether I disagree with their decision or not – and I do).	0.551
Nice dismissal	Now let's look at the article. The article picks up this 54,259 number and reports it as ""shocking"" but generally acknowledges that this number is not meaningful. But oh the headline: ""Wisconsin 2020 Election Investigation Finds More Illegal Votes Were Cast Than Biden's Margin of Victory"".  The law firm absolutely did not find that there were this many ""illegal"" votes. They have a section that addresses illegal voting actually, titled ""We found limited instances in which ineligible persons voted or attempted tocast ballots"". Note that they say that people ""attempted"" to vote? They note that 300 people attempted to vote illegally. All but 132 of these were rejected by state officials. 130 of these votes were registered to people whose address were PO Boxes which I guess is illegal in Wisconsin and 2 were from people may be dead.	0.643

From what I've read is that this all happened because of an interview .... They asked the whole community if they should do an interview and most of their users said no... We shouldn't do any interviews.... And that mod in the video basically said well I'm still going to do the interview with fox...hence the video... And when the community said... Why did you do the interview we voted on not to do any interviews and you sent the worst person to represent us the way they spoke dressed and gave anti work a bad name  The mods in the subreddit decided to ban everyone who spoke about it with the reason being trolls, right wingers, left wingers, brigadiers, and transphobes .... Soo much so that the community started making other subreddits because of this... And to protect themselves and not lose anyone else... They privated the sub to themselves....

One day the UAW went on strike and shuttered the factory.  The local radio station interviewed one of the picketers who, I kid you not, stated they were on strike for &quot;job security.&quot;  Imagine... walking off the job for job security.  Assinine.  Anyhow, a few months later, the factory closed for good, and all of those jobs the factory supported, both indirectly and directly, were wiped out.  I&#39;m told the factory was relocated to Mexico, but who knows.  These days, I often think about Mr. Striking For Job Security and if he realizes the irony of it all.

I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court."

Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.

Irony	There is nothing shameful or invidious about this. To put economic survival and the needs of one’s family first, is not selfish or irresponsible.

Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare.

Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.

Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.

Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few. He also expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. These are all things that all Republicans and even many Democrats vehemently attack.      Eisenhower was not an outlier among Republicans. Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards. These are all things we now deem "liberal," or "socialist," but they were widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike only a couple of decades ago.	<p>Dude just lies all the time like when he supported red flag laws then lied about never supporting them when he had his ass rammed in on it.</p>	0.621
You are mixing two different stories.

Everyone was going home and then they were told they couldn't, and had to keep counting through the night.  Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.     Look at all the wild claims that have been made and how many have panned out?  zero.  Meanwhile look at the actually caught fraud, mostly people double voting  and mostly republican.

I don't come here often anymore.  I think American politics are lost.	Poverty will never be eliminated. Regardless, the issue I see with all of the current socialist pushes is all about funding. You will never be able to convince me that the rich (wherever the definition of “rich” seems to fall that day) should be taxed in excess of 50%+ to cover all of these social programs. Success should not be punished. If you take a look at everyone’s favorite country to bring into this argument, Sweden taxes the poor and middle class at a disproportionate amount to the taxes on their wealthier classes. That is part of their compromise to keep people from revolting against their taxes (which at one point reached above 100% in some cases) to pay for the socialist programs. They pulled back on some of their programs and restructured their taxes such that people are still incentivized to succeed but they still have access to voucher systems where needed.	0.586
Biden had some foreign experience that Obama lacked, but he was also generally known for his gaffes.   Biden wasn't even on the short list to be Obama's VP.  That's tells you right there he wasn't chosen because he was the best or obvious pick.  And Biden didn't expect it either.     This was all rewritten in the media over the following years to try and recast the Biden pick as the obvious choice and shore up both Obama and Biden.

Fundamentally there is nothing wrong with an adult male having sex with a 13 year old female. *If the female is of reproductive age, and is willing, its just nature.*   Chimps, our closest relative, often give birth to their first baby at the age of 13-14, orangutans are generally 13-15.

I can hear the guitar riff just reading this	<p>I think that ship has sailed though.  The constitution is treated like a religious document these days and any suggestion of changing it is met with hostility.  It&#39;s been 50 years since the last real amendment (I&#39;m not counting the 27th as it was proposed in 1789).  Also, it seems like folks would rather weaponize the Supreme Court against each other rather than consider the foundational question of whether the Supreme Court should have that much power in the first place.

PLEASE SHARE!!! I found this on Candace Owens fan page on mewe.   Copying from a Post on official FB page. This MUST be considered…  The question is what to do once you're there... From 17 years experience as a Federal Gov't Witness... I've written and amended 14 laws in Canada to protect children from predators (including brought in Amber Alert with MLA Heather Forsyth) I can tell you Trudeau and his partners need to be removed from office.... No and, ifs or buts!  This is because I've seen his and his family's game plan far too many times in action!  He'll make a deal with you. He'll remove the mandates and let you feel a victory. He'll align and redirect the narrative temporarily... The spin doctors will be put to work big time!   But then the experimental jabs true death numbers will be shared. Trudeau will say, 'Omg!!! See what happened when we relaxed the mandates! Deaths are now through the ceiling!' (which they already are but it's being hidden from us as part of their next step) Trudeau will say, 'I need to protect you!!! We need manditory injections!' This is their plan...   The elite families are 10 steps ahead.  So please. Do not just 'ask' for him to change his mind... Instead, 'inform' him Canadians have lost confidence in his ability to run the country. Demand the RCMP charge Trudeau criminally for crimes against humanity and remove him from office.  Otherwise the moment you leave back for your homes, (feeling that false sense victory) a month or two will pass and then we'll be right back where Australia is at...  This is The World's Assigned Leader's plan after all. To relax mandates worldwide, only to come back stronger with the true numbers of deaths (caused by the jabs, but they won't tell us that. They'll say it was the vi rus mutationb again) We need to think 11 moves ahead.   :heart:️Think long term. Think removal from power period. Xo Much love Carrie Kohan National Child Advocate :heart:️.

Aight I’m convinced you’re a troll because after looking at even a bit of your profile you’re not Christian at all, but I’ll humor you. All of the members of Sabbath grew up and remain religious, mostly part of the Anglican Church, but their lead lyricist, Geezer Butler, is catholic. Any religious person who listens to them can see that in their lyrics and know that their “dark” persona, is just a persona, not sac religious or anti-god. Educate yourself	I can give you an example of a project happening right in my backyard: Alaskan Way in Seattle. They're redoing the whole boulevard to revitalize the Seattle waterfront. This is a project over a decade in the making which involved debates between civil engineers from all sorts of different fields. [City Beautiful did a great video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4La-8egv1bk). There were 76 different projects proposed and the city had to consider a huge number of interests such as pedestrian traffic, bicycle lanes, ferry traffic, bus traffic, monorail access, business traffic, shipyard  traffic, park space, local business space, and a whole load of other concerns.	0.559

That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it’s just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It’s also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don’t make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn’t want them, can’t adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That’d be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that’s their and only their decision. But first, it’s often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they’re often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren’t their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they’ve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one’s health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone’s personal circumstances (that also aren’t any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	<p>About six months later she started feeling guilty and confessed they had consensual sex and she accused him of that in an attempt to save her marriage.

Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.

i have a theory that all this school shooting stuff is happening because of the school's own Zero tolerance policy on violence. If you are being bullied and stand up for yourself , you get in trouble. If you get bullied and ask the school for help, their response is you need to learn to deal with it-no support, no trouble for the bully, nothing. So they create an incubator for pain and suffering with zero way out (if you were treated this badly at work you would quit, but it's not legal to do that with school). Then they're all surprised that the kid freaks out and shoots the place up.	<p>And the tweet about &quot;Aren&#39;t they all vaccinated&quot; is dumb because the vaccine isn&#39;t mandatory yet for military.

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take “global perspectives,” which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn’t have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who’s a minority or has a “unique world view” (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I’m mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn’t speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it’s a threat - including stuff like “global perspectives” classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn’t have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn’t need any video/audio evidence of it and I’m a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	<p>He was absolutely right. Marxists are taking over the different structures.

They are.. i own a glock 17 gen 5 moa and it came with 3 magazines that hold up to 16 rounds each . Which is kinda to low in my opinion.  I looked it up and you can get 50 round drum mags for glocks…  Thing is not that democrats care about our safety, it takes more than one shot to put down a potential threat.  Say some one breaks into my home with the intent to harm my family , if i manage to not miss my first few shots due to adrenaline dump and i hit my target, unless its a headshot then one or two hits wont always stop a person… this is why you hear from the left that “so and so cop shot a guy 7 to 8 times” well thats because they keep shooting till the threat is neutralized.  People who don’t own guns i think do not understand that one bullet is not enough to stop a threat. And im willing to bet part of that is thanks to movies.	<p>But now that these grandchildren have peace and prosperity, not having to work, living in comfort, they don’t even bother thinking for themselves anymore.

Page 23 paraphrased to:  &#x200B;  In particular, vaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein, the envelope of the virus, which is a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people. In the long term, the vaccinated are far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein, even if they have already been infected and cured once or more.    The unvaccinated, on the other hand, will gain lasting (if not permanent) immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being naturally infected with it even once.

I was raised in a low income household. Like well below the poverty line. I lived in a shit neighborhood with lots of crime. I’ve ducked to avoid bullets in drive by shootings that I had nothing to do with, just because of the area I was living in. *I get it.* The idea that I should have to give up a portion of what I worked for to people that are going through the *exact same shit* that I went through, just because I’m white and they aren’t is absurd. There is absolutely *nothing* preventing a black person who is in the same situation that I was from bringing themselves up to the same one I’m currently in. If you can point out the law, policy, etc that expressly prohibits a black person from getting the same job as me, maintaining the same financial habits as me, etc… then I’ll be right there with you… but you won’t be able to find that law, policy, etc because it doesn’t exist. In fact, half of my coworkers, who make just as much or more than I do, are black… and none of them seem to feel oppressed… not even the ones living in the hood, who are working towards getting out of that situation (like I did) instead of blaming everything on racism.	0.684

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   “You only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.” Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let’s be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao’s China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	<p>If you disagree, okay.  That&#39;s fine.  But talk about why, instead.

So you're all cool if I stop here by with left leaning opinions? I'm not going to get insta-banned?  Awesome.  Let's see...  Tax cuts for the wealthy are bad for the economy. Capitalist business owners who pay workers less than the value of what they produce are leeches mooching off of poorer people who create the actual value. Abortion wouldn't be as common if "pro-life" advocates instead advocated for universal health care, universal free access to birth control, and sex education in every school, but if Republican politicians actually supported that they'd lose single-issue voters so it will never happen. The Republican Party has no real platform and has completely succumb to Trumpism which is little more than a cult of personality around a failed elitist millionaire who doesn't care about anyone who isn't currently kissing his ass. Critical Race Theory hasn't ever been taught in elementary schools. Banning books you disagree with isn't going to stop your kid from eventually realizing they're gay or transgender if that's who they really are and you not accepting them as they are makes you the freak, not them.

Being fed blind nationalism and nostalgia of the “good ol’ days” that if only we manufactured at home, we’d get great quality products is a false narrative in my experience as there is every counter-incentive to not do that and make things cheap.

I don’t take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it. I really lucked out not becoming a meth head or a heroin addict becuase most of the folks that grew up making fun of me and picking on me for being “retarded” ended up having crippling addictions and are still living in the home town we grew up in blaming everyone else for their downfalls. I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I’m proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning. Tenure should be something earned not handed to because a curriculum applied by the counsel. I am deeply scarred because of the actions of that one teacher and was almost on the path of those I previously mentioned. I mean no foul with my comments and hold no animosity. I do wish you the best in life.	<p>He even voted for Biden.</p>	0.674

Just stop already you loser troll. Everyone’s accepted nothing has worked except you and stupid people like you are doubling down.	<p>It&#39;s seriously common for people to be more likely to succeed when you have more income in your life.  A two person household is more likely to have more money. A two person household is more likely to split responsibilities and costs, so the single income family doesn&#39;t have an absent parent. The two person household is likely to succeed because two are more likely to afford things. However, if you isolate the family and compare those families with familial communities, it breaks down to even less. I&#39;ve worked with kids who have large families who all help each other out, even if mom is single and those kids thrive where others don&#39;t. On the other side, children who suffer from abuse fail to grow in achievement while their counterparts continue to grow without them. Years and decades can be lost because of physical or mental abuse from a parent. Abused children are more likely to get into crime or prostitution.  While a single mother with a connected family will most likely do just fine.</p>	0.485

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics.

"Women" seem to only exist now during short periods where it's politically convenient, like say abortion debates or attempting to smear a Republican supreme court justice.  Other than that, "women" magically disappear until the next time they are needed to be weaponized.	<p>Recently I spent the summer doing a lot of hiking and as the school year started a few weeks ago I found it very alien walking around town and knowing that the thousands of children and teens were there, but all were tightly compartmentalized into a few strangely small brick boxes called &quot;schools.&quot; None of them were outside in the sun, or out on the street. I was roaming the streets for miles and every so often I come across one of these little nurseries that the kids are housed in. I came to wonder if children in Africa who grow up farming or mining aren&#39;t having a more beneficial upbringing than the kids being locked in a big brick facility for the first two decades of their life. At least those African child miners are getting sunlight. It is hard to express this sentiment; I am quite estranged from social mores.

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	<p>However, the unfortunate part is that there are many, many stories where it is taught to students as a fact, that assertions are made that things ARE this way, that America IS systemically racist (not was, which I would obviously agree with), and the rise of stories about seemingly unrelated things being racist ( <a href=""https://savejersey.com/2019/07/everything-is-racist-list-things-objects-people-political-correctness/"">https://savejersey.com/2019/07/everything-is-racist-list-things-objects-people-political-correctness/</a>) evidences the pervasiveness of a view that &quot;the system&quot; of almost anything perpetuates that racism.	0.611

I don’t agree. And honestly you missed the second part of my comment which was even the praise is on outward appearances. Good, smart women are being whittled down to how clean and pretty they look. Most girls that are pretty know it and would much rather have a compliment that praises their intelligence.  So that being said, I think we agree that it doesn’t take 1,000,000 to praise or insult somebody. Good roasts are concise. And cartoons are lazy and hyperbolic. And hyperboles are weak.

There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why? Because at that point, there might only be a few white supremacists, but 1 is too many.  If you see a group of 10 people, and 1 of them is dressed like a nazi and no one is kicking that person out, or telling them to at the very least fuck off, there is a group of 10 nazis.

That's what is sad in our age. Revolution like the ones we can read in our history book can't never happen again. So there's no scenario in which we can take up arms and win - the result would be the total opposite.

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution’s Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	<p>Where I live, it is forced,or you can’t live in society.  That is not ok in my opinion to take away choice.   Work, flying, train, school, coffee shop all require vaccine to participate under health mandate. Is that about health or punishment?  Debatable.

Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	<p>early in the pandemic  </p>	0.564

Again, the numbers would disagree: NBA and NHL playoffs competed for fans’ attention last week, but a game between the U.S. and Mexican national soccer teams drew more American TV viewers than all but one other sporting event…Some 3.9 million people tuned into Univision on Sunday…The match earned a bigger audience than any NBA playoff game on ESPN or TNT last week, except for a Thursday night matchup…More people also watched the U.S.-Mexico faceoff than the New York Islanders’ defeat of the Boston Bruins in the NHL’s playoffs Saturday (at 2.3 million viewers), or Simone Biles’ seventh U.S. gymnastics championship win Sunday (at 2.1 million viewers).	0.531

“Obvious sings of voter fraud and irregularities”  Ok mr. Trump. Where is the proof?   Trump needs to get out of politics.

You wanna hear some real stupidity? People commenting things like “stupidity knows no bounds” in a conservative sub when you’ll go to a dem sub and see the exact same comments there. If you picked 10 random comments in both subs and got rid of the obvious words that’d give it away, no one would be able to accurately say which sub the comments came from because they’re all the same comments.   C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb” C: “They’re dumb” D: “They’re dumb”  Back and forth forever and ever.   Politics are fucking stupid.   Another thing that drives me nuts is when I see “they’re hypocrites!” I see the same comment in both subs. And the funny thing is THEY’RE BOTH RIGHT AT ALL TIMES BUT NO ONE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHEN THEY DO IT! “Well, we’re being hypocrites right now because they’re hypocrites” but they were hypocrites because the other side was hypocritical and so on forever and ever and ever.   It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don’t actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	<p>You&#39;re entitled to your opinion but there&#39;s really no argument to make.

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy.

Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated. The government should be responsible for allowing a cost-free path to the middle class, because:  1. That increases the country's worker output 2. Increases tax revenue 3. Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth. If we keep going this route, people will need to be housed by their jobs, and that's just the start of it. We're quickly approaching the endgame here.	😁	0.512

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	So your claiming that the midterm elections were rigged too? Even Trump wasn’t claiming that.	0.737
I keep talking to people saying the same thing about federal politicians being corrupt. Of course they're corrupt, people don't pay attention to elections. Our government structure is relatively good, and our representation is relatively fair, so we have the ability to elect good politicians. But a lot of people just don't care, which is one issue. Another issue is too much corporate money in politics, obviously.  And it sounds like your solution is to burn it all down and start new... How about we start electing good politicians that pass policies we want like universal health care?	Yet we are the crazies.	0.577

What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water.

According to his old profile Dave Zegarac is a far left, violent, extremist associated with antifa types.   https://web.archive.org/web/20210905065814/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave\_Zegarac   "His song lyrics deal primarily with anarchist politics.\[3\] Zegarac is an outspoken vegan and long time Anti-racist activist." -- antifa terrorist they should edit this to be.   Seems like he is just like the racist terrorist that killed kids at the christmas parade last year in Waukesha and the racist terrorist in Charlottesville a few years ago.   The far left needs to start calling out these people or they are all extremists and racists by association -- following the standards of discourse set by Trudeau, Singh and the CBC.   Typical example of the left being far out of control and turning to violence and terror over and over again.

It's not full communist, the citizens pay into these systems usually at a graduated rate depending on age. And citizens should get teeth cleanings and doctor's checkups, because it costs less overall when preemptive maintenance is done. And if offered free, it is even more convincing to do it. Government should be there to push citizens in the right direction to get the most efficiency out of them, which involves responsibility over health, because individuals are pretty terrible at maintaining their own health. The US is filled with fat fucks that don't realize they're usually the ones that put the most strain and expenses on our healthcare. This would help with that.

While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	<p>And if you get yourself or your kids vaccinated at this point - with a vaccine that doesn’t even work against Omicron - you are worse than a fool.</p>	0.714

Much better than forcing them to work by tying healthcare to work, right?

Maybe I should rephrase this: the government sponsored a program that loaners promised would guarantee success to a lot of vulnerable people, and is causing a significant portion of younger generations to have a much lower percentage of wealth.

I haven't looked into that literature, but I'm very familiar with and greatly admire Michael Oakeshotte's work on conservatism. He is ideal in my mind, at least, when it comes to my framework of how to govern:   Mitigate disasters. Pass policies proven to work.  That is Oakeshotte's ideals in a nutshell. And I completely agree, that's what conservatism should be. In terms of mitigating disaster, switching government types is probably pretty high on the list of probable disasters. Small, incremental changes are probably better.  Anyway, I've got my own mindset of conservatism, and I know for a fact that switching government styles is probably pretty fucking stupid and anti-conservative.	<p>It is all a scam and a sham.</p>	0.542

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	<p>Protecting the public from human garbage.</p>	0.433

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it’s primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn’t bother to let science validate first.  But you can’t argue with or change the mind of nature.  It will act the way it does, and the results will follow.	And the creatures all have fled	0.511

This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.   And idk what you mean by massively devaluing college degrees...

Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game.

You said they got 5 Billion in revenue from announcing him.  They did not.  Market valuation is not revenue.  I didn't say market share valuation means nothing.  Not even remotely close did I say that.  I said that's not 5 Billion in revenue...because it isn't.   C. Spotify has been in the podcast game for a very long time.  Their biggest leap actually happened when they grabbed The Ringer.  D. You getting angry over you misunderstanding the difference between market valuation and revenue is not only funny, but proves the point I was making.

Edit 2: my apologies for unintentionally blowing over your first sentence. Heroes? *Heroes!?* They've worked us short staffed, with no goddamned protection for several months, but it's ok, SURE. It's ok because they spent 250 on a banner that says GYROS WIRK HERE YAY PRAYS DEM and buy us pizza. We are overworked, understaffed, and underpaid. Nurses are quitting in droves. CNAs too.

Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	Furthermore—hot take here, and probably worth a downvote for anyone who’s fond of knee-jerk reactions—the way someone uses a word matters. I’ve known older people who have used the N-word with a neutral connotation. It’s weird. Presumably a cultural thing they grew up with.

The ultra wealthy have almost always been liberal. They aren’t a victim of “wokeism”, it’s just that when you have *that* much money, where losing 10s of millions hardly makes a dent, you turn to philanthropy, expansion, and doing your best to right the societal wrongs. There’s also a difference between “spouting left bullshit” and general decency, responsibility, and respect. Advocating for diversity, advocating for environmental friendliness, advocating for equal rights is not a sided issue, it’s general human decency.	<p>So how is that not hypocritical when conservatives embraced “social welfare programs” in the form of $1,400 check?

Hey he said it, not me.	<p>Just one anecdote: there used to be a chrysler factory  outside of St. Louis when I moved to the area 15-ish years ago.  One day the UAW went on strike and shuttered the factory.  The local radio station interviewed one of the picketers who, I kid you not, stated they were on strike for &quot;job security.&quot;  Imagine... walking off the job for job security.  Assinine.  Anyhow, a few months later, the factory closed for good, and all of those jobs the factory supported, both indirectly and directly, were wiped out.  I&#39;m told the factory was relocated to Mexico, but who knows.  These days, I often think about Mr. Striking For Job Security and if he realizes the irony of it all.  I also wonder about all the other people whose livlihoods were lost because of him and those who thought like him.  Such is the price of union avarice.</p>	0.471

Far as I know there isn't a law prohibiting carrying fuel.   The Ottawa chief of police stated they've ramped up stopping, charging, ticketing people bringing in fuel.

Just got over being sick with covid despite being vaccinated. My unvaccinated wife was not significantly more sick.  Leftoids: stop fucking pushing this nonsense. This vaccine WILL NOT eradicate covid, nor will the next one, or the next after that. The only thing it will do is keep *some* people out of the hospital who might have a severe case. You can still get it, you can still spread it, you can still die from it. Stop buying this bullshit that unvaccinated people are a threat and are standing against this fantastical "end of covid" fantasy you have.	“Everything woke turns to shit” -Trump	0.603

I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	Tell the Governor to quit worrying about re-election photos like this one and save his fucking state.	0.529

Yes. I recently watched an interview of this trans (f-m) Ugandan LGBTQ advocate who faced off against a baffled moderator and a local pastor. The pastor sounded like a condescending,  hostile nutjob while the activist, who explained she was just advocating for "human rights," was so polite and patient that she started to made so much sense. I had to stop and remind myself that just because she seems like a very nice, decent person and just because the pastor is a total maniac, that doesn't mean she represents the right side of the debate.

I work with people from central and south America.. Tell you right now. They aren't stealing jobs anyone wants. They're doing the jobs no one will do..   Some of the toughest, kindest family oriented people.  One woman legally got into the United States left her children in Honduras and for the next 8 years saved every fucking penny she could raising 60k and getting her children into the states just so they could work in motels cleaning up after people that have no respect, accuse them of being illegal.   I've been listening to my grandfather rant about dems and libs trying to take away our guns and Mexicans coming into America illegally, raping and stealing our jobs. No one has taken anyone's guns.. Ever.   What jobs? Not high paying jobs.. Maybe doing roofing, painting and landscaping.. Busting they're asses to make sure Americans are comfortable.   Trump... Is a criminal that has admitted multiple times he wants to fuck his daughter, he lies, he belittles everyone, he doesn't pay his taxes, he's stuck up...

You’re 100% correct. All my experiences with Central American immigrants have been positive. The vast majority of them are hard working family people.

The Olympic Committees' decision to expand the definition of women to include men who use Anti-Androgens and who call themselves women will only increase the number of female competitors and necessarily increase the level of competition.

The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	<p>“One student is a male with red hair and a fairly prominent hooked nose,” wrote Monger. “His hair was pretty long (just below the bottom of his ears) and is pretty thick and wavy.

The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb 😁😁😁  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am 😈 Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.	<p>Good luck this winter.  </p>	0.436

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years.

The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	<p>I just worry Trump could take things a bit too far, and this time it’ll be DeSantis’ future that is ruined.

I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don’t know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn’t tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don’t think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that’s not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don’t know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It’s also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we’ve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn’t be. This is concerning.

However, the free market also dictates that companies are allowed to require you to have the vaccine as a term of employment (for the reasons above, but mostly due to cost and liability).

Reminds me of when the Ukrainian government banned helmets in early 2014, just before the revolution.

Where did I say it was ok? I just said it was legal. Also, this isn’t a violation of the first amendment. That amendment prevents the government from stifling your speech, not private corporations.

But now that I mentioned capital, let's recall every big corporation jumping on the BLM bandwagon.  Suddenly every corp had BLM messaging on their website.  Kamala Harris started a bail fund for BLM rioters, OK.  Look man, if the federal government, local mayors, and every big corporation supports your "protest," then it's a fake astroturfed protest in service of capital.	We then get rid of Kamala.

As for the birds, people have shot down blackhawks with dumb fire RPGs so it aint like they are flying stealth kit. The got prop planes and blackhawks, not very scary. Pretending they have somehow become more of a threat to anyone but their own populace (who they were successfully dominating prior to our invasion) is asinine.

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country. You are making up lies about a massive movement just like the democrats are doing about the truckers.

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	<p>Plumbers and electricians should not have to pay the taxes required to bail out morons who made bad life decisions.</p>	0.506

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	2) She has kids in VA schools, so she would absolutely know what the truth is	0.466

Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	> If they can, we can.	0.516
