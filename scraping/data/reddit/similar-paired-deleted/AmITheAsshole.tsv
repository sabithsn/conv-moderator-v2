I think NAH.  You definitely did the right thing. Becoming homeless just so one day your sister can have a house is not practical.  However I kind of get how your sister feels? It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	My sister (female minor) is the youngest out of 7 children. I (Female minor) am the second youngest. My sister is well.... I don't really know how to really describe her. She can come off as shy to the public but is chaotic at home, Its almost as if she has two different personalities to certain type of people which I can understand.  Since she is the youngest, she is viewed as the 'baby'. I hardly see her as that. Me and my sister are three years apart if that helps.	0.83

It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	<p>These two things don&#39;t go together and the fact they are treating it like Sammi being herself is because this is what they know. It IS herself she&#39;s been doing it since she was 8 that&#39;s 7 years almost half her life. If this is her reaction finding out your going to have a baby think what she will do if/when you get married.</p>	0.811

That means you were around the age of 22 while she was 6.  Your daughter isn’t going to see her as a mother. </p></li>	0.81
I think NAH.  You definitely did the right thing. Becoming homeless just so one day your sister can have a house is not practical.  However I kind of get how your sister feels? It's basically the only thing she had so I understand her being upset.	<p>Brief history of why I feel the way I do. My mom lost her mom at 25. Leaving three little girls behind ages 12,13,14. My mom was the older; and with that being said she had to care for them at the time I was around 6. My mom was married and had my little brother as well. My aunts came along to live with us. Through this time I didn’t think much of it but the only thing I noticed is that she wasn’t there for me like she was for their sisters. As I got older and in high school i began to resent my aunts more being a teenager and not thinking right. I resented my mom more because she was always with them she wouldn’t do anything with me only her sisters. Mind you my biological dad isn’t in the picture I grew up with my step dad. So I did feel very alone at times. Like I had no parents. One day I told her “I understand they lost their mom and I’m sorry I really am, but why did I have to loose mine too”. </p>	0.806
Hope she gets over you you selfish suck.	When my mother passed away, she said some very rude and cruel things to my father which were pretty unforgivable.  Then when my father passed away, she made the comment that she wished the rest of us had never been born because then she could have everything and we didn't deserve anything.  These things weren't said in the heat of the moment during an argument.  She just kind  of blurted them out.  I continued my mediator role with the mantra that I don't have to like her but I do need to be polite.	0.919

Hope she gets over you you selfish suck.	Here's where I'm confused. On several occasions my wife has demanded an apology from me for sleeping with M and I have been unable to provide her with one because I simply don't feel sorry for what I did. As stated, we were separated and seeing other people. At the time I felt that she had ruined our marriage and turned my life upside down by her actions and that I had no duty not to sleep with her friends. Today things are certainly very different, but I don't feel sorry for what my past-self did in those prior circumstances. My wife seems to get more and more upset every time she brings it up and I refuse to apologize for it.  Is what I did back then wrong? AITA for not apologizing? Much thanks.	0.915
Hope she gets over you you selfish suck.	My sister asked me to leave and I left because I felt it would be to awkward to stay with what happened. I yelled at my husband for being so insensitive for my sister who was going through a hard time;. My husband was upset and said he wasn't going to hide it forever to please one person. I said that was true but at the funeral? What was he thinking. My sister and now my husband and apparently my family are all pissed at me for causing a problem that I had nothing to do with in the first place.	0.913

Holy shit that sucks, I’ve seen a lot of people mocking Scottish culture and it’s honestly so shitty.

And I'm guessing he didn't do everything he could when she started having trouble. He sounds like he might well be one of the many men for whom ""in sickness and in health"" really only means in health. Women stay when men get sick. Men leave. Without a support system, it's likely your mother struggled ever more and is now in a very different place than she might otherwise have been. You can't know for sure, obviously, but	0.882

That's terrible 😧	<p>This isn’t ‘joke’ behaviour. This was sexual harassment and assault in your home. Of course you felt nauseous. Of course you felt trapped. Of course you were scared. Hon, I’d have been terrified too. Like, putting a chair under my door and having three locks kinda of terrified. It’s not okay and you should never, ever have to tolerate this. And seriously, never do again. </p>	0.882

That's terrible 😧	Until we were woken in the middle of the night (2am?) by squeaking sounds.  Yep, you guessed it, they were ""being intimate"" on the broken bed I told Cole he couldn't even SLEEP in.  And it was VIGOROUS.   The rooms shared a wall, it was obvious.  My husband and I were both furious (he knows how much the bed means to me) and we knocked on the door and kicked Cole and Ruby out then and there.  They were VERY angry.	0.861

That's terrible 😧	<p>I dont know at all why their approval.of complaints was necessary with the screaming kids, either, though having said that, as well as complaining to one father, you probably should have directed your complaint there to the hotel. If that happens again, or just as a general request when booking/checking in, ask the person at reception to put you in a room away from families because you sleep during the day and have been disturbed by rowdy kids before. Receptionists allocating rooms for upcoming stays will have a lost of requests they&#39;ll seek to prioritise. Save for it being a one corridor hotel, they should be able to put you in a quieter room; it&#39;s the same idea as putting guests attending a wedding in a function room in a hotel to sleep in the rooms.where function room noise might disturb regular sleepers, if they know you sleep during the day, they can likely accommodate somewhere more suitable for your stays.</p>	0.857

We had quite a big argument which ruined our relationship. I apologised afterwards but he has never tried to make amends. We have spoken once or twice at family events, and I now live on the other side of the country and my girlfriend is pregnant with our child. My family told my Uncle that she was expecting and all of a sudden he is telling my Mum that he ""feels really bad about what happened"" and is sending money/presents for the baby. I don't feel comfortable with this as we have no relationship and I am considering telling him that he needs to stop as he can't just walk back into my life now that I'm having a child, but I am worried about disrupting the peace.

Between that time I’ve found out the type of person he his. For example, he barely takes care of his daughter and leaves his mom taking care of her. Also, he started dating a new girl and lied to her about when his divorce was finalized. Now he’s screwing over his ex-wife by not abiding by the terms of his divorce decree. He also was a pain killer addict who just recovered recently after a 3 month binge/restart of use. He also always talks about how much money his making every time he sees me. It’s super odd and annoying.	0.924

You seriously did your daughter wrong even when she was just a 6 year old. Try to see her not as a manipulator but a daughter who needed a mother.

YTA. It would be different if your two daughters were younger but they’re more than capable of acting independently. They should be allowed to meet your new baby before 2 weeks & also see you before then. I feel you’re treating them like they’re extended family. At the end of the day, it is your choice who sees your new child but I think as your child’s siblings they should be one of the first people to meet them.	Sometimes people without dysfunctional families realllllyyy don't understand it until they experience it themselves- which he just did- and live & learn.

Your girlfriend needs a lot of accomodations that you aren't in a position to offer, and that I think most people would find unreasonable *or* untenable. This is compounded by what others perceive, including myself, by sense of entitlement revolving around her moving into your space and immediately claiming the entire residence as *her* safe space.

You owe your daughter an explanation for your truly bizarre behavior and an apology for putting her in what was essential an no win situation for her.

If you didn't want a child, then you shouldn't have stayed in your marriage, OR you should have had some serious adult conversations with your wife instead of just acquiescing to what she wanted.  Having a kid is a two person conversation in a marriage - and it's something you should have both agreed upon.	0.902

Another thing is, had the dad told his daughter directly that she had to home at 10 instead of acting like the boyfriend is the babysitter, it would have been more reasonable. I don’t think you should be having or even want that much control over your adult children, but then he would have at least been talking directly to her and realizing that she’s the one responsible for her own actions and when she gets home, not her boyfriend, regardless of the fact that he’s driving, she has a voice, she’s her own person, and she needs to be responsible for answering to her father, not her boyfriend</p>	0.892

Ultimately, this is completely your decision, but I think you have to (preferably after seeing a counsellor or therapist) think about it alone, without your mother and uncle&#39;s outside influence/manipulation, and decide what&#39;s best for you and just weigh the consequences. If you do tell Eve, recognize that she might decide to cut everyone out of her life, and if you don&#39;t tell her, take into consideration that she might find out herself one day and cut everyone out of her life and might feel betrayed by your biological parents and you. Also if you don&#39;t tell her, just be sure that keeping this from her won&#39;t negatively affect your mental health and that you won&#39;t be as anxious and distraught as you are right now.</p>	0.888

It is actually *very* easy to fire a tenured teacher, however, you have to notify the state when you do and this almost always triggers a state level investigation into the school.  The state is the one that grants the teacher tenure, so when you want to fire one the state says ""Wait a minute, you trusted this person enough to give them tenure and now you are firing them.  What other bad decisions have you made?""	0.862

YTA. get her some help with her night terrors, and stop being a dick. Honestly man, fuck you.	So, recently I found out one of my boyfriends (I am in a 3 person relationship) is a registered sexual offender bc 10 years ago he talked to a guy on Grindr who hid the fact he was underage from him and he ended up getting into trouble because of it. He never met up with this guy and never did anything sexual with him and they never sent a nude pictures or anything bc my boyfriend was in a relationship at the time. The only reason he was on Grindr was because his relationship was abusive and he needed an escape. When I tried to explain this all to my best friend she didn’t listen to anything I said and tried telling me my boyfriends are dangerous and unsafe and made me choose her or them. Long story short I am hiding my relationship with them from her now and she thinks we broke up and told me when I told her we broke up that she couldn’t talk to me bc she would be too mad and not supportive. Now I just don’t see her as my best friend and kinda hate her for it and idk if that is right because she had my best interests in mind. So, AITA?	0.822
First of all I am glad that in all this mess the dads are competent at least. That is awsome and well done to both your dad and Bob for doing exactly what needs to bee done.  OP you are a child, a grown child, but you mom's kid, not your mom's servant or live in nanny. Your younger siblings should have never been your responsibility and it was extremely kind if you to devote so much time in raising them. But no OP, your mom should either have a nanny or at least pay you to professionally watch them. That's time taken out of your day, studies and productive time you could spend creatively and with friends as teens should do.  Not to mention how your mom puts her boyfriend over her own child, takes away her personal space and allows said boyfriend to massively overstep here. You've been civil and way more mature than your grown ass adult mother! You did the right thing and removed yourself from an unpleasant situation.   She decided to procreate about 10+ years since she had you and she should have been mothering her own kids instead of passing that role to her teenage daughter who should be out having fun with her friends being a "stupid" teenager with nit a care in the world. You should be allowed to do mistakes at this age, explore the world, sneak a ship of beer and find that to be the coolest thing you can do, being "sooo baaaaad". But actually just being young, and allowed to be a child and live without major responsibilities for as long as you can. I'm 27, turning 28 and I can't believe how fast 10 years past me by. Feels like yesterday I was being so baaaaad telling my mom I'll just go downtown and actually going to hang out with boys in the next town over, feeling that's so cool and edgy or whatever teens call it in 2021.  Your and incredible daughter and sister! NTA, your mom 5/5 assholes! she should grow up and take care of her own responsibilities!	<p>I never once said he was right. All I said was that keeping it in their orbit, as a reminder of this incident, was a bad move and selling it online to a stranger would have been a better move. All of the stuff that you said only matters if she is at her breaking point and wants out because, let&#39;s be real here, he doesn&#39;t seem mature enough to be an adult about this and is more than likely going to be around the nephew/aunt in some capacity. Most families don&#39;t cut off assholes, they just suck it up and deal with them. What you said makes sense logically but, how often does logic work out in real life? Very rarely.</p>	0.854

It might not be as black and white if you actually really wanted to be there but worried if it's unfair to wronged sister. But you don't want to.

And you're obviously a waste of oxygen	Of course that's my BS theory of middle children, not some profound psychological revelation, and all children and families are different, but it's something I strongly feel influences that lost middle child feel. As a pudding-potato baby/pregnancy , they don't have any anchor marking them as 'special' by default like first/last/oops/late lamb/multiple does. So it's all on their personality. If they turn out to be a menace, have issues, be amazing at sport/academically, they earn that position, but normal kids are just then...kids, and they didn't get that default first/last/'special' pregnancy status to give them memorability before they developed as children It's ALL on who they turn out to be, which may just be a normal person.	0.786

And you're obviously a waste of oxygen	<p>Other piercings are not like standard earring piercings.

And you're obviously a waste of oxygen	<p>So, IDK, unless you&#39;re around there 24/7 or you talk very intimately with the kids all the time, I do think you might be a bit TA. You&#39;re all over this thread saying that you have no idea what these kids&#39; actual level of educational attainment is, you just assume it&#39;s low because the seven-year-old and the 10-year-old don&#39;t write stories. The only piece of information you have is that your 12-year-old niece is doing age-appropriate reading and writing. Your sister had to ban you quizzing her kids (a wildly inappropriate thing to be doing, good lord). You obviously don&#39;t like or approve of how she&#39;s raising her kids, and you&#39;re entitled to feel that way and absolutely shouldn&#39;t unschool your kids. But you describe your nieces and nephew as nice, well-presented, normal children who you believe to be uneducated because you can&#39;t see them getting educated, not because you&#39;re talking to them and actually getting a sense that they are not educated. Telling their mother that her kids are uneducated and being set up for failure is a pretty asshole move.</p>	0.773

Congratulations on getting rid of that whole person.  NTA, diets are problematic at the best of times and a night off every now and then is fine, you should be enjoying what you eat whether it is ‘healthy’ food or not.  Also, you don’t need another person to police what you put in your mouth, you are quite capable of doing that for yourself.  Alan seems to have mistaken boyfriend for prison guard, how dare he interfere with your food like that, and make humiliating comments in front of other people, not only is that incredibly rude it is also disrespectful and dismissive of you and your bodily autonomy.  He also doesn’t get to then expect you to pay for the food he stole from you, or the food he ordered to replace it.  At $10.00 that’s the cheapest couples etiquette lesson he’ll ever get, always supposing he actually learns from it.  By the way that doesn’t make you a gold digger, it makes him a jerk, although I suspect he was that long before the dinner.  P.s.  There is nothing wrong with being ‘on the heavier side’, if you are comfortable in your skin and healthy then it’s up to you whether or not you diet or splurge a little.	<p>Once those children are born, you&#39;ll be stuck there fighting an endless legal battle, because it seems like he&#39;s enabling her. Move back to your family if you can, and be sure to tell your family exactly why you&#39;re there. Tell your friends about her behavior too (not necessarily your plan to get away), so that way you&#39;ll have back up. The more people who know that she&#39;s crazy, probably the better.</p>	0.835

There are other ways to keep an eye on her besides going through her messages. For instance, request that she adds you as a friend on Facebook.. That way, you can see all of the people on her friends list and whether they have many mutual friends. If someone&#39;s grooming her, they&#39;ll have very few/no other mutual friends and probably a vague profile. Alternatively, perhaps ask Lisa if she can keep an eye on her sister..

Is he controlling in other aspects of your relationship too? Maybe he&#39;s too insecure to trust you, or maybe he&#39;s feeling left out as this is an activity that he cannot take part in. Either way he should learn to trust you, that he cannot control you and to give you some space of your own.

NTA.   He knows exactly what he did. Not only is your "boyfriend" if we can call him that, a pig...he is a jerk.   He obviously did it to get a rise out of you which not only proves that is an immature idiot but a petulant child as well.   That being said, the way you explain his little outburst seems so natural and instinctual of him that I totally believe you that he'd eat the same way at home.  Honestly why are you even with him? With how petty you make him seem I can't imagine he'd be any different or any sort of good guy material.  I'd imagine you'd be cleaning up after him a lot as well considering the slop he might leave behind after he eats. Not assuming anything but just making an educated guess.

I live 5 hours away so there’s nothing I can do about it. I told my mom as of now I don’t want to talk to her because I’m extremely upset with her. Supposedly she just walks around crying now, AITA?	0.89
Everyone witnessed these interactions, including the head of our team. They've all agreed to write statements, but she is arguing that the whole point is that everyone is against her due to her gender, so the statements can't be trusted.	<p>My mom recently bought my sister(17F) a new car with a $22k loan, my sister makes $600 a month and the loan and insurance is $500.

My (18M) girlfriend (32F) of six months has bad spending habits so I’m constantly giving her money. I always tell her she needs to pay me back because I’ve gotta start putting money to college. She gets angry by this but usually pays me back. However this time she got mad at me for expecting $200 back. She spent all her money on food and alcohol. Then she needed $200 to get her car towed after losing the keys so I had to give it to her. I told her before she accepted, like always, I need to be paid back. She told me it’s unfair to expect your partner to pay you back. She told me relationships are not transactional and that I need to learn that. I told her I’m not trying to be terrible for wanting to be paid back but I only make $8 an hour at McDonald’s. I’m graduating soon and will be entering college. I need my money. She makes much more than me. She’s a veterinary technician. She told me that I need to learn how to be better. Am I seriously wrong for expecting to be paid back?	0.877

I was supposed to stay the night with a friend but my abuser followed me around all night to make me uncomfortable and I just wanted to go home. I called my mom to come get me and she made every excuse why she wouldn’t drive the 20 minutes to come get me, even after I told her why. My friend’s mom wound up driving an hour out of her way to bring me home. To this day I still harbour anger and disappointment towards my mom for not saving me, and if this is the attitude you had towards an UBER RIDE, I’m sure your daughter will harbour similar anger unless you apologize.</p>	0.87
NTA, His girlfriend cheated on him multiple times and you were just making sure he didn't get roped into raising another mans child.	I lost my temper at her rudeness and screamed at her and told her that she was being rude, selfish and a very mean tempered person. I was angry prior to her screaming because one of the cupboard locks wasn't working and she had been the last one to use it. I told her that the cupboard lock hadn't been working and she told me that the cupboard lock hadn't been working since last to last week and it couldn't have been her because she doesn't even stay here. I screamed at her saying that she was lying and that couldn't have had happened since I'd had fixed it. She said that she didn't break it and she wasn't the only one living in the house and there must've been something wrong with the mechanism but I'm pretty sure that she was lying.	0.8

I was just a child and devasted. They had to take me out of school and into home schooling because i was so emotionally scarred. I still have fear of the hair salon.</p>	0.799

YTA you're a monster.	I haven't operated on 4 hours sleep since I was in grad school, and I felt like shit every time I did it (and never for more than a day or 2 max). I occasionally have trouble falling asleep, which causes me to get 5 or 6 hours instead of 7 or 8, and yes, I feel like crap the next day and need more sleep the following night just to get back to normal. After 7 nights of getting HALF the sleep I need I would probably just be completely miserable, headaches and moodiness and zero energy to even function.	0.876

YTA you're a monster.	Here is the part I’m having a problem with, though. Absolutely your DIL should not be calling you 15 times a day. Not at all reasonable. What is reasonable is her requesting that the child not nap three times a day. The reason is that that third nap is probably pushing their five-month-old into a much later bedtime, or possibly earlier wake ups at night, so DIL and your son are probably not getting the sleep that they do need to get.	0.835
Disagree, the girlfriend cheated on his son multiple times just because  his son is acting stupid doesn't mean the grandparent has to act stupid.	<p>Aside from both of our parents having dinner with us a few times this is the first time everyone will be in one space. I’m already worried about everything running smoothly without our families clashing, never mind adding a WWE styled drunken throw down out in a venue parking lot. I don’t want to have to worry about paying for any potential damages. I absolutely adore her family, but they go hard on the alcohol and it tends to get out of hand. She doesn’t seem to want to budge on this. I told her we could include her other family traditions like square dancing, but she’s insistent on the pig trough.</p>	0.83
Disagree, the girlfriend cheated on his son multiple times just because  his son is acting stupid doesn't mean the grandparent has to act stupid.	<p>We were all homeschooled (traditional-ish homeschooling, not unschooling, although fairly relaxed, from what I remember) through middle school and I&#39;m sure my aunts and uncles never saw me do a single bit of school work because we rigorously worked through it all in the mornings and did visitor stuff in the afternoons. And we could take our holidays whenever it was convenient for the family, so I&#39;m sure lots of family friends never saw us do a thing. Nevertheless, we all had excellent educations, did well in high school, and are now completely functional, normal adults with jobs requiring advanced and continuing education. </p>	0.83
Disagree, the girlfriend cheated on his son multiple times just because  his son is acting stupid doesn't mean the grandparent has to act stupid.	My partner is by his own admission domestically useless. When we started dating he was almost 30 and had literally never used a stove or actually cooked for himself. Now he can cook better than I can because there was no way I was going to do all of the cooking in our relationship so he learned (I still cook, we divide it pretty fairly). I love it when he gets credit for a well cooked meal. I’m so proud of him. Him being good at cooking doesn’t mean I’m suddenly worse at it.	0.823
Disagree, the girlfriend cheated on his son multiple times just because  his son is acting stupid doesn't mean the grandparent has to act stupid.	Dave has very little household obligation, I have only ever asked him to ensure he washes the dishes after dinner - however they are often left to mound up until there are none left clean. I have asked him to do other chores before but he says he can't for varying reasons. We both work for the same company, I work in an entertainment venue and Dave a food venue - I often work very unsociable hours (2-3am finish) and 60+ hour weeks alongside a degree. Dave expects me to cook every day, and would rather starve than make food for the two of us. Dave spends all of his spare time gaming/on discord which often upsets me as I don't know anybody in this country and he won't converse or spend time with me because in his words he ""values his spare time and wants to enjoy it"". We used to go on dates etc before we moved in together but now I feel like a babysitter and I'm miserable, he acts as though I'm trying to stop him talking to his friends and turn him into a slave but I just want some love, even if he just came to the supermarket with me I would be grateful as the hour long drive each way gets boring and carrying everything alone is a struggle.	0.822

His son is a moron. Why would you marry someone that cheated on you multiple times and at 21 years old now less. And how is he wrong to make sure that his son is being manipulated into raising someone else bio kid when his girlfriend has once again cheated on him multiple times?	<p>The fact that your new wife literally said she didn’t tell you because she knew how you’d react, but then said it wasn’t a big deal is showing you she doesn’t think your feelings are a big deal. She sounds incredibly selfish. I understand there are now kids in the picture and that’s got to make things rough for you, but this lady is only going to get worse.

Kudos to you to putting a quick stop to your mom trying to start the same cycle with your daughter. Your daughter is just a baby! Shut that shit down and go NC. To be honest it sounds like you will be better off that way since you still have to avoid her and your daughter will benefit too if you mom can&#39;t stop the abuse she put you through.

The time for being nice was over the second those cookoo clocks suggested that Kim be involved in your pregnancy. They may have been too cheap to pop for a surrogate, but they have no idea how expensive a court case and ongoing child support for twins is about to be. And Kim’s behavior will absolutely affect the amount of visitation Joe gets. One of your points of contention should be that Kim isn’t allowed anywhere near your children.</p>	0.877

Seriously everyone is just saying skip your sisters wedding. Doesn't your sister want you there?  Alfie is family to your sister. He is 9 and old enough to understand and to behave.

I can see how they&#39;d be reassuring to a newly pregnant, honeymoon phase teenager. But they still don&#39;t make any sense or explain anything. Take off the rose colored glasses and look at the situation objectively, girly. It almost sounds to me like the reason he got you pregnant was to piss her off and direct her anger at you instead of him. Pretty fucked up thing to do to the mother of your children in my opinion. He sounds like the type to use women up until he decides he wants a newer model.</p>	0.877

FUCK U OP AND  FUCK U REDDITERS	Do you think your wife doesn't already feel like shit? I guarantee she does. She already KNOWS she's letting you down and that makes her feel worse. She probably regrets quitting her job because that's what led to this. She probably already beats herself up, questions her self-worth, and wonders why you're still with her. Bottom line is she KNOWS how you feel and your lack of support isn't helping. It's this downward spiral that can be really fucking hard to pull yourself out of (source: been there, done that. More times than I care to count).	0.911
FUCK U OP AND  FUCK U REDDITERS	<p>Again, wtf! Your husband is delusional! How&#39;s she smarter than a therapist? Your stepdaughter has serious issues because of the trauma and while I feel bad for her, she&#39;s an adult now. She just can&#39;t keep doing this. She never got any help but instead, your husband coddled her and catered to her every need. He never got her the help she needed and made her a rude brat in the name of boundaries. Your husband is the biggest AH here. He was responsible for her and he failed to do right by her. He did everything wrong. He should&#39;ve been there for her but not the way he was. He should&#39;ve gotten her into therapy, himself into therapy and should&#39;ve dealt with this professionally, not by never saying no to her and creating a spoiled brat who behaves like a monster(that&#39;s her dad&#39;s fault more than hers). This trauma bond they have sounds toxic and unhealthy and honestly, I said before, you and your daughter will never be important to him, never. I am just saying. You can wait and waste 13 more years but that wouldn&#39;t change anything. I still can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve put up with this for 13 years, I would&#39;ve been out of this mess a long long time ago. I don&#39;t see him and anything changing. I just don&#39;t because your husband doesn&#39;t believe he&#39;s wrong or he ever was wrong, he doesn&#39;t believe Ella is or was ever wrong. I don&#39;t see him changing. I don&#39;t see him making your or your kid a priority ever. Ofc unless your husband gets help but again, therapists are not smart acc to him so...</p>	0.906

Literally anything I bought that wasn’t what she recommended she’d have something against and would get mad.At that point I had to put my foot down and remind her this is my kid. After my son was born the first weeks were chaotic. I don’t remember much except feeding him changing him and trying to get him to freakin sleep. It was exhausting that’s for sure. My sister did come over every so often and it was a huge help. Things are more calm now, have a better handle on him. She comes over everyday though and tries to stay all day. It’s nice that she’s trying to be here, but sometimes I just want alone time to bond with my son. I’ve told her to give me space, that hasn’t worked. </p>	0.872

I (f, just turned 18 last week) live with my mother and 4 siblings (ages ranged 5-12, all different fathers).

What do you get from creating fake stories on the internet?	Let's flip this on it's head.  BF's parents are naturists.  They come for a visit to OP and her BF and as soon as the door is closed they strip off and walk about in the nude.  They do it all the time at their house, they want to feel comfortable in their son's house, there's nothing sexual in it as they see nakedness as perfectly natural.  Is OP TA for saying she's uncomfortable when BF's dad stands chatting while she's relaxing on the sofa, eyeball to his balls?	0.797

Good, you are starting off the New Year well then!! What kind of idiot calls someone a gold digger over a $14 meal they didn’t even eat? SMH  The fact he put you down like that and treated you that way is such a major red flag - he was testing your boundaries to see what he could get away with, probably because if you had stayed, he would’ve escalated and become abusive. Good on you for being smart and getting out before any more damage is done. Abusers like to break people down over time, and it looks like that was what he was trying to do.	My fiancee and I are in a very similar situation. She makes almost $10/hr less than I do, and we had to finally have a conversation about it recently because she wanted to ""balance"" the percentages of our paychecks going into our shared household account--I'd put in $950 a month and she'd put in $750. What helped was talking bluntly about how she was valuing other input we were both making to the household--we were splitting the bills and such halfway, but I was spending much more on things like groceries or ""fun stuff"" (dining out, pizza night, etc.). I definitely think that if you're serious about each other, socking away the kind of money you are is respectable and shows a real commitment to a more peaceful golden years for you both. If she can't see that, then having a conversation about where she feels she's overpaying her share is going to be important going forward.	0.816

If you’re buying the house for her but you’re also married with adult children then I can see why she doesn’t want you on the deed. If you and your wife divorce, it is an asset that she could lose out on through no fault of her own. Essentially you’re paying for this relationship but she also has the right to protect herself.

I did just that a bit ago and he got annoyed as I said he would. It escalated a tiny bit, no yelling or anything but it was definitely a small fight.

He makes the company a good amount of money, so he rarely gets talked to when he breaks rules. He was “banned” from taking shifts after he decided he was taking a break from shifts for now, so basically my boss told me (and me only) that if he wants those certain shifts back that she will need to approve it before I schedule him. Again, she nor I never told him about this ban. Nor did we think about how to handle it when he would eventually ask again.</p>	0.917

I feel like your friend is correct morally, ethically and economically and they are not the asshole for pointing out the flaws of capitalism however they are the asshole for the way in which they went about it.	<p>She made a friend in school that she was spending an excessive amount of time with. Previously, she had been best friends with my daughter, and spent all her time with my daughter. After she met this friend, she suddenly wanted to spend all her time with her and not with her step-sister. This made my daughter extremely depressed and sad, and then I started noticing behaviors Annie was engaging in that she wasn&#39;t previously. Clearly this new friend was a bad influence, so I tried to encourage Annie to stop seeing this friend. Annie massively overreacted and we ended up in a shouting match with that ended with her walking out the door and leaving for five years.</p>	0.827
I feel like your friend is correct morally, ethically and economically and they are not the asshole for pointing out the flaws of capitalism however they are the asshole for the way in which they went about it.	But the main point is, she has talked extensively about, and i have seen firsthand, her mom's lack of boundaries and she literally moved an hour away *this week* to lessen her mom's involvement in her and heart kids life. Her mom sees the kids every other day and still demands more, then starts fights and arguments if told no. She also has drug and alcohol problems that have caused marriage, family, and social issues my friend's entire life and caused her emotional distress and trauma. She plays favorites between the girls, and it's noticeable to us and it'll be noticeable to the girls soon enough too, and overall they don't deserve to grow up in that environment.	0.807

Anyways, I'm 100% certain my sister and I had it worst, we received twice the amount of neglect and abuse (just because we are ""young girls"" and how it was only for our ""benefit""). Pretty sure I have developed years of trauma and anxiety from the neglect and abuse my siblings and I copped from her, so to say I love my mother is very much an understatement.	0.806

NTA at all. Does he realize how common it is to do that? The feeling of having to push is literally the same exact feeling of having a bowel movement, it’s literally nothing at all for any woman to be embarrassed about and I promise you the hospital staff doesn’t give a flying fuck about it.

NTA- What an ignorant prick. What happened to you is quite common and it’s not only something you shouldn’t be embarrassed about it’s also something he shouldn’t be making jokes about. Seriously, is he 12?	<p>I don&#39;t even understand how you can go <em>slower</em> than the limit then be all Pikachu face when other people try to overtake. Some of us have places to go and don&#39;t want to be stuck behind slow pacer like you, so either you drive normally or you just let people live their lives but you have <em>zero</em> right to road rage when you&#39;re the one choosing to drive slower than expected.</p>	0.862

Seriously, is he 12?	<p>These parents doing this are not traffic engineers, they didn&#39;t take into consideration whether creating a traffic bottleneck at one point on their section of street might actually cause cars to speed up once they get around the bottleneck, actually making things MORE dangerous for kids further down the street. Traffic engineers do traffic studies BEFORE putting in calming devices to make sure there are no unintended consequences, that&#39;s why it is illegal to create an obstruction on your own, even a temporary one, without a permit. Why do you think that when construction crews have to shut one side of the road down and alternate traffic on it (which is basically what these parents were doing), they have flagmen to direct traffic and control who takes which turns when? For SAFETY. Sticking a couple of cones out to block traffic in a haphazard uncontrolled manner is irresponsible and dangerous. People taking street safety into their own hands is the LAST thing that would make streets more safe.</p>	0.849

Same.  The nurse who taught my prenatal class said "you WILL poop" not "might'.	<p>Ultimately, you have a right to have your dad in your life in whatever form and to whatever extent works for both of you. That may be hurtful to your mom, and that&#39;s something to tread cautiously around, but she doesn&#39;t get to dictate your relationship. Keep her concerns in mind. While it shouldn&#39;t be a secret that you&#39;re in contact with your dad, you don&#39;t need to share things that will hurt her.

personally, my kids would always have a safe home with me no matter where they go. And i would never make my child pay rent in the one place that they are most comfortable. This world is already harsh and expensive to live in so why make it harder for your child over 350$? She didnt ask to be in this world. You should be teaching her the value of money and what it could do for her herself, not taking it from her for your own needs. Your responsibility is that home and them kids no matter what.	I guess I am coming at this from the perspective of a person who just sees too many children out here having sex like it’s no big deal. The normalization of abortion like it’s a trip to the dentist office. All these damaged kids looking for love and acceptance and having sex with anybody who pretends to love them. Like I could go on and on. But yeah I don’t have a problem at all with purity promises. I have a problem with double downing on ignorance. And that’s on both sides. Have your purity balls and galas for the kids and preteens and hope that it preserves their innocence for a couple of years. But TEACH them about their bodies and puberty and how it will effect them. Acknowledge that they will get horny and that there are going to be people who will willingly have sex with them with no thought of consequences. Teach them about safer sex and ADVISE abstinence. Teach them about STI’s and how rampant they are. Bust out the numbers if you have to. Google is your friend. And actually address abortions and what they actually are. Promote healthy respect and acceptance of their bodies and everything that comes with it.	0.833

My girlfriend has been working out lately, and she has been losing weight. To celebrate this achievement, I thought it would be nice to surprise her with some lingerie. So I went to Victoria’s Secret and got her some. I told her to close her eyes, and that I got her a surprise for her achievement. (She struggled initially to lose weight, but I was there as support so she knows I’ve noticed she made progress.) She was excited to open up her gift, but that stopped when she looked good at the lingerie. I got the wrong size, and got one size too big. She wasn’t thrilled about that. She asked me if I thought she was really that fat, but I tried explaining to her that I didn’t know her size; and that it was just an honest mistake. I asked her if she wants, I could return it for her size; but she didn’t want to. So am I the asshole for getting her lingerie in the wrong size?	0.82

So she's kept going, but now things are getting real - she's middle aged, divorced, and her kid is heading out into the world without her. She doesn't have a method for getting emotional reassurance from you, since she raised you to not need it or to not offer it, and you don't have a way of encountering her that can walk her through the agonizing transition of seeing your kids grow up and leave, finally not needing you.	0.827

Just under a carat is pretty dang small for an engagement ring. Nothing is wrong with that, but I can see why she would want an upgrade.  I would just talk to her and figure out what is in your budget. She’ll be able to get money back from trading in the old diamond.

I have an 11 year old daughter who as a baby refused to sleep anywhere but in my arms, and I allowed that... she’s 11 and still refuses to sleep in her own bed most nights, and doesn’t sleep well unless she’s directly next to me. So just know that these sleep habits developed this young, can most definitely stick long term.	0.865

I&#39;ve told him plenty of times that he needs to be quieter in the mornings but he doesn&#39;t seem to really care. So last night I went into the guestroom to sleep - as soon as I did this he started an argument about how dramatic I am and said he doesn&#39;t have to cater to me because it&#39;s his house. I explained to him that the only way I will get a good quality sleep is if I&#39;m in a separate bedroom but he began saying that I&#39;m his girlfriend not a housemate and I may as well go back home to my parents if I&#39;m going to sleep in the guest bedroom.

You don’t have to host houseguests if it’s not going to be a comfortable situation for everyone, but it’s rough on the guest when they’ve already arrived and you start piling on restrictions. On the other hand, Claire knows her dog best, so she — or the brother, on her behalf — might have been in the best position to start the conversation about its need for outdoor space, how much it sheds, etc., and to confirm that OP was prepared to accommodate their needs on terms they’d be comfortable with.EDIT: Just saw OP’s comment below that she DID specify these restrictions before the visit. So now I’m wondering whether this is really an issue between Claire and the brother — maybe Claire really doesn’t want to be there given the constraints, but didn’t feel like she could opt out of the trip or ask to stay elsewhere...152ResponderPremiarCompartirReportarGuardarSeguir  </p>	0.883

But demonising people who are choosing to wait for other options (such as novavax for one example)  or claiming that this mutation is the worst thing ever, is just not accurate.	<p>But even if there is an underlying cause, he is plenty old enough to say he doesn’t want to be in the picture or to find some other solution / compromise other than wasting everyone’s time.   And his mother... unless there is some uncontrollable underlying reason he cannot stand still, she should have been the first to suggest he get his act together.</p>	0.81

How could she say you have to make a decision to do one of the two? Just because they're family doesn't mean you're obligated to accommodate them. Don't give your sister your money. If you somehow do let her stay there...make sure you stick to not allowing the husband. Also, give her time frame of when she needs to leave. Possibly make her sign a contract too. Also, you're gonna be responsible for feeding and clothing them?! Like no. You are absolutely not the asshole here.	0.898

Honestly sounds like you don't even love her in the tiniest amount.  Saying that I can see how she reminds of your father with the "" learn to love me"" comment.

However, her mom also said that I should never have given her a twin themed gift anyways, implying that it was totally clueless and put way too much pressure on the parents, i.e. that I should have thought this might happen, and if I was a woman I'd have thought twice. Also she said implied it was tacky to give twins two of the same thing since they should be treated like individuals.

You don&#39;t want to find out if roomie has a petty vengeful streak or anything like that, which might come out if she sees a lock suddenly.

That's some good advice!! Thanks truly for your insight!	<p>As for if you’re TA, no, you’re not. You were protecting yourself. Your mother may be disappointed, but she doesn’t get to decide what size family you should have. I also find it infuriating when a woman wants one or no children, and everyone tells her she has to have children, as if she doesn’t know what she wants. When that person is your mother, it’s more complicated, but she is making this about her when it’s not. Surgery is always risky. Instead of being angry, she should be glad you’re okay.

Yeah, though it’s not evenly distributed. States like California with the most electric cars have the most renewable energy. The government just needs to go fully electric.	<p>Or ... you can bring the necklace to a jeweller and ask him to make two identical necklaces from your old one, in order to give one to each of your daughter. This is, in my opinion, the fairest option. Choosing one girl out of two to give something that valuable and meaningfull is cruel, and I would not consider this alteration to devalue your heritage. In fact, in my family/country, this is fairly common to change a little bit the jewels you get from your ancestors - because it doesn&#39;t fit right, or it is a little bit too old to be worn, or it is damaged by time ... consider this option, I think it would be a good idea.</p>	0.878

Yeah, though it’s not evenly distributed. States like California with the most electric cars have the most renewable energy. The government just needs to go fully electric.	I asked my youngest sister for it very nicely, explaining my plans for it.  She says ""actually I'm planning for this ring to become MY engagement ring, boyfriend is going to propose, so we'll get it repaired and the stone replaced!!!""  Well fine, I conceded, wouldn't stand in the way of her big plans for the ring.  So I let it go...	0.849
Yeah, though it’s not evenly distributed. States like California with the most electric cars have the most renewable energy. The government just needs to go fully electric.	Agreed! People like what they like and value what they value. My mom and aunts once got into a huge argument over something similar: they got my grandmother a nice ""mother's"" ring for Christmas, and my mom suggested a nice fountain pen for my grandfather. My aunts hated the idea of gifting him ""just a pen"" (though in price it was similar to the ring!) but my mom convinced them -- and my grandfather *loved* it, because he loved fountain pens!	0.843

Yes I agree, I think. I think I should have just not let the horniness take advantage of me and gain some of my own self control.	Op, you didn’t fail as a parent. I genuinely believe you raised a great kid but her gf obviously has something that explains her behavior. Who acts like that especially when a family member has died? So OP, saying no was a great choice. She needs to suck it up that not everything revolves around her. Don’t even pay attention to her when she comes back crawling. She needs to learn that she can’t act that way. Especially to her grieving mother. Don’t feel bad OP, she just needs to learn</p>	0.907
Yes I agree, I think. I think I should have just not let the horniness take advantage of me and gain some of my own self control.	<p>Even though you say you love your daughters equally, you don&#39;t really sound as though you particularly like your younger daughter on a personal level and you have nothing but resentment over her relationship with her father, and I can guarantee you she&#39;s already figured that out and was wondering why you set her up like that. All you&#39;ve done is alienate your child even more. You owe your daughter an explanation for your truly bizarre behavior and an apology for putting her in what was essential an no win situation for her. Then, if you really want to be closer to her, you&#39;ll put in the time and effort to actually get to know her as an individual instead of as a substitute for her sister.</p>	0.906

The older sister, and the mother for that matter, didn't do anything wrong (even you seem to see that they are victims), and I guaran-damn-tee that they were MORE hurt than you were.

She wants to know if she is the asshole for blowing up on her husband because he took a job with long hours and did not tell her. What financial reason would be important to know? If they were struggling for money, he could have told her that from the start. if there was a change in his hours from what he was told he could have said that when it happened. Yes, they had a deal he did not follow but the reason he is the AH is that he told her it would be soon when he knew it would be more than a year. He kept that information from her for what reason? </p>	0.888

I can contact his parents but I chose not to when it comes to discussing these things because the brother has already told them of all the negative things that he supposedly believes I am. I did give my boyfriend a college sweatshirt from my school and I would hope that when they're going through his things that they would ask if I'd like to have it, but the odds are looking slim. It's not so much about the material things for me as it is just preserving our relationship through our internet exchanges (we were long distance and especially during the pandemic you can imagine how heavily we relied on texting to communicate).	0.73
I said we don’t do public transport.	<p>Your time and money isn&#39;t owed to her, if she doesn&#39;t want to live like a broke college student she has to earn money.

I said we don’t do public transport.	<p>Also, as a child, your daughter was not capable of thinking about the dollar value of college.  It was absolutely your responsibility to save and plan and do the critical thinking for her back then.  Also, because of child labor laws, her getting a job only helps so much.  A lot of the stuff available to unskilled teenagers is low wage stuff like bagging groceries, which would earn you MAYBE $20k a year if you work full time (and even 20k is not happening in states where the minimum wage is less than $10/hr).  As a teenagers (14-17 year olds) there are rules about how many hours they can work per day and so on, further limiting her ability to save.</p>	0.853
I said we don’t do public transport.	<p>This girl makes minimum wage, leave her alone. Minimum wage workers don&#39;t owe you emotional labour.

Nobody gives stellar service 30 minutes before closing, literally nobody.</p>	0.851
I said we don’t do public transport.	Also, seems extremely tasteless to call a teenager struggling with mental health issues, putting in near full time hours, making low wages while preparing to tackle tens of thousands of dollars in college expenses ""fortunate"".

I said we don’t do public transport.	It sounds like you handled her just right. You were honest; you told her the price and why; you even told her you weren’t making any money on the cake, you were just covering your costs. She kept insisting. It doesn’t sound like you’re best friends, or even good friends, she just happens to be the first friend you made at your job. If you would get her a birthday gift anyway, you could make it the cake; that’s up to you. But if you wouldn’t normally buy her a birthday gift, or spend $35, you are under no obligation to do that. But that is up to you.	0.847

You do have to live with this person so it may be smart to see if there’s some other arrangement that can be made so it works out for all of you.

I honestly think you are the most insufferable, obnoxious person I have ever seen on reddit. And that includes Trumpers and anti-vax morons. You suck so fucking much it's literally insane.	One of our biggest fights was when he was asking for nudes and I told him I was in a bad mood so I told him not now. Then I asked him why we couldn&#39;t just have a normal conversation and he said that they were boring. I got so pissed, I told him he was just using me and that I don&#39;t give a fuck about him anymore and I don&#39;t care if he cries to sleep about it. Then I told him more messed up things that I regret so bad.	0.875

Our second big fight was when he said he didn&#39;t want to be in a relationship anymore because I was toxic and would rather stay fwbs. I was okay with it but after a while I told him I wanted to be more than that and he said he doesn&#39;t want the responsibilities of a relationship. I left him on read and he got annoyed and then I told him to stop texting me and then he unadded me. I then did something really stupid I texted on snap calling him a dumbass after he unadded me but I didn&#39;t think he would see it. Im pretty sure he did  and then he told me I just wanted attention from him and that im toxic and wants no emotional connection, which really hurt me.	0.862

I&#39;m the kind of person who would never take on other people&#39;s grudges for any reason. I think if they all just had an adult chat instead of brooding it would all be fine.

But take it from me; Many people out there are operating with a wholly different type of wiring. There is absolutely zero excuse for a person to treat you this way, even with severe depression. These types will toss you a kernel of kindness to keep you coming back, and then rip it away so they can maintain control and keep using you. He knows what he&#39;s doing.

The fact that it continued at all says he cares more about trying to get a laugh than your comfort, or that he&#39;s intentionally trying to make you uncomfortable. Neither one is ok.</p>	0.889

It's obviously a made up story, but in case it isn't : Esh.  1.Your daughters behaviour is the result of the treatment they got from you and your mistress/wife. None of you cared about how your relationship would affect their lives 2.You didn't cared that you ruined their life, brought a stranger into their lives and forced them to love her otherwise they were punished.  3.I don't blame your ex wife for hating you or sara.  4. Sara had no qualms in having an affair to a married man and ruining a marriage, while at the same time crying that your daughters didn't love her. I have no respect for women who have affairs with married men.	At first I thought esh but then I read some of OP&#39;s replies. Op was willing to have any relationship with Jane to form a bond but Jane wasn&#39;t willing to budge. So OP just remained respectful and nice. Jane just wanted the title of being a mom without understanding that children are their own people. I think if Jane really wanted a child to love, she would have been more cautious with how she went about talking to OP when they first met. I do feel bad for Jane because she probably got over excited. This reddit usually hates parents that are &quot;its my way or the highway&quot;, isn&#39;t that essentially what Jane did? It was either &quot;I&#39;m your mom or I&#39;m nothing to you&quot;, she made her bed now she needs to lie in it.</p>	0.913

If so, you can follow with ""It's possible that your mom, after finding out she's pregnant, and knowing that I wasn't ready to be a father, didn't want to burden me and decided it's best if she raised you alone. She might have thought it's the right thing to do, and she could be a loving parent to you on her own, which she was as you say. I know that in the end it wasn't the best choice she made, but she still loved you very much, and she did bring you to me, so I hope you'll cherish the bond and memories you had with your mom before she passed. I also hope we can build ours from now on.""	0.908

lmao. Because the only reason to respect women is to fuck them right? You sound dumb.	So I started my first office job after graduating university running the office side of a small engineering firm. I liked it at first and the pay jump was huge from my restaurant job ($11/hr to $15/hr) but now I spend at least 1/4 of my time just waiting for something to do since I finish all of my work quickly. My job pretty much entails entering data into reports, scheduling jobs, printing directions and maps for out engineers, and answering phones. We only average 5 or 6 calls that last between 5 to 10 minutes per day and after I finish my work I am basically sitting at my desk waiting for someone to call so I have another 15 minutes of work. I am the type who loves to be busy at work so I hate just sitting there playing on my phone next to the owner (he and I are in the same room about 5 feet from each other) for 2 hours per day.	0.795

I'm in a similar boat to you - I just started med school at age 30, and most of the other people in my class are in their early 20s. One of the biggest differences I've noticed is that my tolerance for this kind of behavior is lower. I think it's because I've worked professionally before, and learned how to interact with people of all different ages. I know now how to kindly redirect these kinds of conversations. Many of the younger students just haven't learned how to do this, so they pretend they are interested.	0.794

time to start saving...   they put their kid in debt over a petty punishment that no longer fits the crime.... they have a few years before that debt starts accruing interest to save to pay it off... I haven't seen anyone, op or otherwise even mention this that they can fully help their kid not be trapped under the mountain of debt they saddled on them. they don't seem to care though and if I was the daughter I would notice that.  either make amends. do your best to make your kid whole... or respect that they are going to want nothing to do with you in the future.	<p>So honestly, I can&#39;t give a judgement here based on the information alone. OP could be expected to drop her job, school and everything and be a caretaker, or she could pay rent...or other things that would make her Not TA. Her parents could also be supporting her fully and she has no immediate plans to move out or go to school or even get a job, and just expect to be taken care of while not having to help her sister...in which case the parents definitely aren&#39;t wrong for expecting her to pitch in. The way she complains about how weird and disgusting helping her sister is doesn&#39;t help her case at all, and points a bit towards the latter if I am honest.</p>	0.908

NTA	<p>Growing up I&#39;ve always dreamed  of what my wedding dress will look like. I went wedding dress shopping with friends although my fiance wanted to go with me like he always does but of course he couldn&#39;t. I purchased a really really nice wedding dress that I instantly fell in love with. It is perfect in every aspect and it only cost $400 that&#39;s a great deal since wedding dress tend to be expensive here. When I got back and was so thrilled my fiance asked to see it then asked how much it cost. When I told him he was in dismay and started complaining saying I wasted that much money on a colorless dress that I&#39;ll wear for just few hours and should&#39;ve bought a 150$ dress or less. I said no wedding dresses are huge deal to every bride. He argued about how weddings and everything that come with them are just part of the laws our society keeps enforcing on us and that only smart brides save money instead of blowing it all on... a dress.	0.86
NTA	<p>I wore the necklace my mum and nan (mum’s mum) wore for their weddings, it was actually gifted to my nan by my grandad on their wedding day.

It was my wedding day and I wore whatever I wanted.</p>	0.85

NTA. She is insecure	I think right now is not the time to stress about what your mother or SIL have to say, considering they're not even as involved in your life. And instead of asking how you're doing, SIL jumped to why the mother is upset. And while under appreciating you (all your life, I'm guessing), the mother cannot expect you to go out of the way to appreciate her presence while you're in a lot of pain. I mean everyone gets cranky after a hospital visit let alone a surgery, and caretakers (especially family) understand.	0.823
NTA. She is insecure	<p>For the record, my husband hates seeing doctors and going to hospitals but when I started bleeding he dropped everything he was doing at work and rushed to the high risk OB I was sent to so that I wasn&#39;t alone. He was there with me for the delivery even though blood and cutting into bodies freaks him out. I had a c-section. He got pale but he held it together.</p>	0.823
NTA. She is insecure	I understand that in a lot of cases some dogs and cats can&#39;t find homes due to health problems or severe behavioral issues (like bad agression) and there is no place for them so they need to be put down to end their suffering, but they think even loved animals in homes are suffering and need to be put down, and I can&#39;t stand by that. I rescued my rabbits and they are HAPPY.</p>	0.816

If you do decide to stay with him, I would suggest having him delete the pictures in front of you, including the back-ups) without giving him time to make more hidden copies).

You know that not everyone is going to dump Tony over what he did to you, but they also can&#39;t expect you to interact with him again.  Not starting a scene at major events you&#39;ll both be attending and avoiding him at those is the most that Roger and those in his situation can expect from you if they want to keep both you and Tony as friends.</p>	0.835

Going through your things, and especially reading your therapy journal, is a huge breach of trust, but then they also just delete things off your iPad because they're upset you caught them? Those are all things children should know not to do, let alone adults. Nothing you have done sounds in any way unreasonable, but even if you had given as good as you got that wouldn't have made their actions ok. Cutting your face out of their pictures was extremely childish, so I guess that scans with the rest of their behaviour.	0.831

Thanks you for your comment. Im already living my life, i just don’t want the money but I’m feeling really guilty depraving my family from it	We broke up for other reasons and I still embraced the Jewish religion. I remarried later to a catholic and it was all fine until they started up with the obsession with WWIi Germany. They were always watching the ""History aka Hitler"" channel. Obsessed with ""Hogans Heros"". Giving me a Christmas present of Rosetta stone german language. And constantly doing a fake German accent as if they were Sargeant Schultz from Hogan's  Heroes. They aren't trying to be mean or antisemitic, they just think they're funny but it got to the point when I could not stand it anymore and I screamed that I'm sick of the Hitler channel, sick of the German obsession and could they please stop it.because my children are Jewish and I'm a product of German non Nazi immigrants my S.O. got totally sensitive and said I was taking things the wrong way. Sorry, bit I'm totally not accepting someone who has no real German background suddenly being obsessed with WWII language and technology and constantly putting this in my face. Am I the asshole for telling them to.cut it out? I'm just so sick of this obsession they have. I embrace my German heritage but not the dark times that Germany wants to forget and rise above. I don't need to hear my partner talking on a fake dr. Strangelove accent every damn day!	0.735

Thanks for your comment. I don’t want the money for myself, and don’t really know a lot of charity i could give to..	Sorry for the rant I just see so many people want to “pick a side” it seems. And they completely ignore or forget what it was like to be teenagers, or worse they are ignorant to the fact that it IS different now. We are all exposed to so much hyper sexuality in media and marketing that it is practically impossible to raise a kid in the current modern world without them being exposed to sexuality in one way or the other. So we shouldn’t just ignore it and pretend that it doesn’t happen and that your kids are never going to be tempted mentally and physically to engage in sex. We should be teaching them that they are MORE and worth more than just the fleeting “pleasures of the flesh” lol.</p>	0.87
Thanks for your comment. I don’t want the money for myself, and don’t really know a lot of charity i could give to..	Parents can wish all they want but when they allow their kids to go uneducated on sex, they leave them ripe for the pickings. Wishing they won't have to teach their kids about sex won't make pedos disappear sadly. And those girls getting pregnant was their only indication of the sexual abuse according to sources. They would have continued to suffer if not otherwise. Their parents weren't paying attention and didn't think something horrible would happen to their kid until it did. How is that protecting them?	0.869
Thanks for your comment. I don’t want the money for myself, and don’t really know a lot of charity i could give to..	“Open adoptions” mean nothing and it’s absolute bullshit. The adoptive parents can close it at any time. With no repercussions. A lot of first parents are manipulated by the system or the adoptive parents into feeling like it’s the best thing when the only thing the adoptive parents care about is scoring a child, not what’s actually best for them. Adoption is always traumatic for the child, even if they’re an infant. Because it’s loss. It may not feel that way in an adult brain, especially not in the few cases where reunification truly is not what’s best, but it is.	0.869

Thanks for your comment but which one for example ?	<p>That said, I’m more disturbed by how little you seemed to care about the dog, or care about the dumping of it, and that your biggest regret about the date aspect is that you didn’t just lie so that you could get laid. It’s great what you’re doing for your nephew but excuse me if I don’t give you an all around ‘stand up guy’ award. For anyone not wanting their pet anymore, ffs just Google and call a few rescues first.</p>	0.904
Thanks for your comment but which one for example ?	<p>My husband thinks that they behaved poorly but that I shouldn’t have made a big deal about it. He doesn’t think that giving drugs to the dog and giving drugs to the baby is the same thing. I don’t want to apologize because the truth is I wouldn’t trust them if they couldn’t agree to that boundary- I am very conservative about what medications and supplements I take, what I give my dog, and plan to be the same way with my child. The fact that they gave our dog a medication to sedate him - and got very defensive about it-gives me cause for concern that they could not handle the potential difficulties of a young child. AITA for making a big deal out of this and not wanting to apologize?</p>	0.893
Thanks for your comment but which one for example ?	<p>The reason being is this situation -right- here. It would have MAYBE been fine if she did it once, but the number of times it&#39;s not shocking that you would react the way you did. Your wife is doing the same thing as asking a dog if they want a treat and than kicking them once they believe they are getting a treat. You wouldn&#39;t treat a dog like that, why would you let yourself be treated like that?   </p>	0.891

Thanks for your comment but which one for example ?	<p>Now I think she only tries to convince me because she looks after him when I go on vacation and if the labradors are in heat she is still stuck with the same problem. I am also not convinced about the cancer thing, I mean if it were the case, wouldn&#39;t the other vets have told me about this? And besides the cancer thing there isn&#39;t really a reason to do it imo. Besides any operation on an elderly dog is way harder, let alone an operation that isn&#39;t done that often as the ball thingy is very uncommon. </p>	0.889

no I'm not blaming the victim of anything and its asinine you would even suggest it. it's misdirection and deflection.	Last year my mum revealed she’d lied about who my dad was. Essentially my real dad was a lovely guy but she thought he was too sensitive for her so ran off with another man who she said was my dad and then told me that when they split up, didn’t want anything to do with me, making me feel it was my fault as a kid. She also made me feel like an inconvenience to her as I was growing up and was pretty unpleasant to me. After she told me about my dad, I said I needed space to process and She then proceeded to spend the following few months sending unpleasant messages to me until I blocked her, then she started on my children until they did the same. In March she eventually gave me a lame apology which felt too little too late and I’ve never accepted because it’s not addressed any of the issues, imagine a stroppy teen girl “fine I’m sorry!” type apology. I can’t accept it because it doesn’t mean anything, she just wants everything to go back to normal, but for me it never will. It’s completely reframed the unpleasantness I had from her as a kid from something where I felt (incorrectly) partly to blame to allowing me to see how awful she is. I can’t get over it. My wider family won’t speak to me because I won’t forget it all, brush it under the carpet etc. Even some of my friends say that she’s trying and maybe I could engage. I’m beginning to question if I’m being too harsh but I still feel her apology is not enough because she won’t acknowledge how awfully she’s behaved so by forgiving her, I’m approving her behaviour. AITA for not forgiving her?	0.889
no I'm not blaming the victim of anything and its asinine you would even suggest it. it's misdirection and deflection.	Back story to why I dislike George: I used to be good friends (like 8 yrs ago) with him early in my relationship with husband. We all worked together, but my husband got him the job bc they grew up together. George got in a relationship of his own and we were thrilled to meet his girlfriend but he cut off all contact with us. When my husband (at the time boyfriend) got ahold of him, George said he had told his girlfriend how stupid my husband is and that he was too embarrassed to have them meet. Our other coworkers asked George when he'd let us meet his girlfriend and he said ""you aren't my friends, you're my coworkers."" He quit the job shortly after. About a year later, George decided he missed my husband and invited us to meet the girlfriend. I was opposed bc George never apologized. My husband told me that's just how George has always been to him, and they've gotten in similar situations several times. I told him I don't need friends like that in my life so unless he apologized I wasn't interested in becoming friends again. Side note George and this girlfriend broke up shortly after we met them. George also vocalized some non-PC opinions to my husband that solidify my reasons to not rekindle a friendship, I don't like hateful people.	0.887

So, we were sitting together and my wife and I gave my mother in law her gifts since after dinner. Brother in law negatively commented on my gift but I pointed out that he didn't bring one for his mom. He said he didn't bother since I'm now acting like her son and since he's not always around so I'm more of a replacement for him. I didn't get what he meant I called him silly and told him it's not my fault he doesn't care enough about his mom to get her a present. He got offended and ""corrected"" saying ""just like you didn't care enough about your mom that you literally caused her death which was totally preventable"".	0.885

And again: she does NOT have the right to dictate how you should feel, feelings are the most personal, uncontrollable thing, and you should respect yours, as she also should.

This needs a serious discussion about her thought process. About why she thought this was okay. About why she felt she was entitled to control you like this instead of simply talking to you like an adult if she just wanted to play more with you. It needs a serious acknowledgment that what she did is beyond fucked up and a commitment that this will never happen again. It probably also needs her to be okay with you password protecting your stuff and her not touching your shit without direct supervision. She has clearly shown she can't be trusted with that privilege.	0.865
>the daughter should just get 40k because she should and you said so.  how bout because the person who the 40k belonged to said so?   everyone in this thread keeps conveniently forgetting it was already committed... and quite likely already promised to the daughter....	Because she's going through a really rough time and instead of making her feel better and trying to be flexible with my plans I just told her to figure it out basically. I don't think I was wrong in what I said, but I don't think I read the room. It's OK to have your own life and not drop everything for your roomate, but when they're having a tough time it's nice to put effort in and support them. I don't feel like I did that.	0.862

For reals? You talk shit about people and children saying they have diseases and shit just because of how they look.

He got offended and &quot;corrected&quot; saying &quot;just like you didn&#39;t care enough about your mom that you literally caused her death which was totally preventable&quot;.</p>	0.856

I guess she doesn't deserve the 40k her aunt was gifting her then because you say so person who wasn't even there for the event in question.	<p>I honestly don’t think she’s trying to cause drama, she just doesn’t get my style and is frustrated by it for the most part.</p>	0.893

I am unsure what you mean by <em>due to the reality if the world,</em> but just because you are unable to cut out a person that causes you pain doesn&#39;t mean Sister shouldn&#39;t be able to either.

I guess she doesn't deserve the 40k her aunt was gifting her then because you say so person who wasn't even there for the event in question.	I don't sympathise with her exclusivity at all - it screams insecurity. Also, I would re-question that statement of yours about her strong personality. Often times we perceive others to have a ""strong personality"" when they are simply too insecure to admit their mistake(s) or to back down.	0.887

ok. you've made enough points to me. I have nothing to say to you and would appreciate if you'd stop harassing me across this thread because I have a different opinion.	1. Applauding your son for not listening to his mother is crap. As a parent myself, it's low and undermines your wife's authority as a parent. You could have just as easily taken the big boy parent route and suggested he get the drink after. You instead took a route that belittled your wife in front of your child. Good luck with that. Just wait.	0.932

Your dad is acting very egocentric for not considering your complaints about the bully (stepsister, well maybe step-bully).

Yeah and now the person who committed is dead. People dont just have rainy day stashes of 40k to just hand out	<p>The sad truth is that now that he’s over 18, there is little that his parents can do to save him from the consequences of his actions. If he was still a minor, things could happen. But now, the only thing that could work is him having consequences for his behaviour. I’m watching my 23 year old niece being smacked around by life these days because her parents didn’t step up when she was younger. I literally told my sister ten years ago that this was not normal behaviour and that blaming it on hormones or just being a teenager would not help the situation. She’s been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but the I key treatment for it is cognitive behaviour therapy, which is hella uncomfortable and only works when the patient buys in to it and wants to change. </p>	0.903

People dont just have rainy day stashes of 40k to just hand out	I hope this doesn’t make me sound like a horrible person, but I’ve never bonded with my son the way I have with my daughter. In fact, in all honesty, I don’t feel connected to him at all. Not only that - and I know it sounds bizarre to say this about my own child - but he’s always scared and unsettled me. From the time he was about 5, I’ve felt like something is just off. And his actions have proven me right. I’d have to write a book to explain every terrible thing he’s done, but to put it simply, I fully believe he’s a psychopath. He has no empathy or regard for other people and his behavior has never been normal. I’ve never directly admitted this to anyone but my husband.	0.899

The acoustics of the apartments is such that he can hear the movement in your apartment. You shouldn&#39;t have to overly restrict your and your kids&#39; movement, just to accommodate him. But similarly for him, it&#39;s not great to hear banging around constantly either. You&#39;ve tried to reduce the noise, but there&#39;s only so much you can do.

Their punishment was no graduation party. The lack of a check is due to the person planning on gifting it fucking dying. The daughter is still going to college which is more than a lot of people get and stepdaughter is going to end up in the exact situation because the parents are doing what they can and the lack of that previous money is not due to the parents lack of care its due to the person who actually gave it again, dying. I guess the parents lack of being able to read the future ala thats so raven and still making it work for her is such a fucking betrayal.	<p>It sounds like you&#39;re a great stepdad and I can appreciate you stepping in and being there for the boys. I don&#39;t think situation seems like that big of a deal, I do think that it&#39;s odd the the ex is cool with you being around his children, but not his adult brother?</p>	0.817

Your son got into an amazing school with great career opportunities. This means he will likely have no trouble finding a good paying job when he’s done, which comes around to him likely being able to pay off any student debt a lot quicker than the daughter will. Alas, your son isn’t really the one in most need of financial help here. Your daughter is, as she will have far less career opportunities, whatever she chooses. </p>	0.812

This happened today. So my sister (F30) has been in a relationship with her boyfriend for several years now, and now she's ready to be married. However, her boyfriend is dragging her feet, and so she called my mom to talk to her about it. Since I'm my mom's closest confidant, she came to me to talk about it. We got into a deep discussion about it, and  I said that it was none of either of our business what happens. She got angry and said that it is our business since she's her daughter and I'm her brother, and we argued a bit about it, and I ended by saying that if she has a problem in her relationship, she can talk with her boyfriend about it: there's nothing either of us can do otherwise but comfort her if things go south. The subject was dropped afterwards, but I feel that I was a bit cold-hearted in what I said.	0.863

TL;DR: Dad gave grandma's engagement ring to my youngest sister, who said she would use it as her own engagement ring, but then her bf bought her a fancy new ring instead.  As I am the eldest sibling, I want her to hand grandma's ring over to me, and have convinced my dad to side with me on this.  Little sister will be mad as she feels the ring is hers regardless.	0.86

The thing your daughter will remember is waiting for you to come and being disappointed. She will not trust you. She may even have abandonment issues later.

Yeah no	<p>I would also consider that as the sole breadwinner in the family, in a new town where likely neither of them have a social circle yet, and his lack of support or assistance, she is likely feeling stressed and frustrated as well, yet she approached him gently and without lashing out the way he did.

Well that’s kinda rude we love each-other and outside of this small issue we are very happy	NTA but I say it with a little salt. You don't have to a relationship or  be in contact with her. Honestly sounds like you don't even love her in the tiniest amount.  Saying that I can see how she reminds of your father with the "" learn to love me"" comment.  Honestly I would keep it at seeing her at seeing family events but being civil. Your Dad and sister are wrong for trying to force a relationship.	0.926
Well that’s kinda rude we love each-other and outside of this small issue we are very happy	It sounds like neither you or your daughter have much of a relationship with Lisa to where you all would be comfortable with her going. Your ex, his wife and family have no right to try impose someone you hardly know and your daughter doesn't really like on you just because she's ""family"".	0.922

Well that’s kinda rude we love each-other and outside of this small issue we are very happy	Now I wrote in detail what we got to say that brother can't even if he wanted help sister, because his assets turned into a business abroad, so it's not like he can sell a part to help sister. Parents hate her. I'm neutral, go on well with sister, the only one who could help, but I'm not willing to give up my stuff for someone who took bad decisions.	0.919
Well that’s kinda rude we love each-other and outside of this small issue we are very happy	<p>And what do you mean by “willing to overlook the fact that your daughters biological father is a deadbeat”? That has nothing to do with the OP or the child. Being a single mother isn’t something that needs to be put up with, or “overlooked”. If he doesn’t want to be a parental figure, he shouldn’t be dating a woman with a child, but don’t applaud him for “sticking things out” like he’s doing the OP some big favor being with her.</p>	0.915

I mean do you treat your adopted and biological children the same? Because they don’t…	<p>And seriously, some mothers and babies find breastfeeding works very easily, I was one of those lucky ones, but many don’t. New mothers are at risk of developing Post-Partum Depression: a screaming hungry newborn, the guilt of the mother unable to feed, the pressure from relatives, none of that would have helped.</p>	0.896
I mean do you treat your adopted and biological children the same? Because they don’t…	<p>Their mom liked them as babies, but once they got older, she handed them off to other people and let them do whatever they wanted. She also let them down by not doing things she was supposed to, like providing a decent diet (The reason Cameron is diabetic is because most of his meals consisted of lasagna. Just that. Didn&#39;t serve fruits or veggies.) And when Cameron became diabetic, she said that she KNEW he was going to be the diabetic one.... But that was because of her.</p>	0.887

I mean do you treat your adopted and biological children the same? Because they don’t…	Um, fed is bare minimum? No it isn't. It's rare but not unheard of for mothers to accidentally starve their babies because they are trying to exclusively breastfeed when they don't just have the milk. I accidentally starved my baby for a week because I believed the lactivist crowd's  nonsense about cluster feeding instead of trusting my gut--nope, turns out my baby literally wasn't getting enough milk to maintain her weight. Once I combo fed, she started gaining rapidly. This is one of the cases that started ""Fed is Best.""

I mean do you treat your adopted and biological children the same? Because they don’t…	Cutting to the chase: My wife is 21 wks pregnant and we just found out we're having another little boy. I came clean to her that I had stored up the stuff, but was light hearted about it because I honestly expected her to be happy that I saved the stuff since it's another boy. She was absolutely livid and told me I'm ruining her pregnancy and motherhood and that part of the fun is buying new things for the baby... I told her we still have things to buy and a nursery to set up but she was not having it. She's been pissed off at me for 3 days and told me she's not going to use the old stuff.	0.865
Probably not cus we have been happy for 19 years now. It’s just a minor irritation. They have gotten bolder over the years…	Honest mistakes all around. It happens to us all at one point or another in forgetting keys or not turning on a ringer when someone needs us. It's also not like you asked him and then went to sleep. He told you he was on his way soon and showed up four and a half hours later. Sure, I can understand him being mad. But like you said, you would've woken up and rushed to the door if you hadn't forgotten your ringer and you were staying up as long as you could. Half an hour is a long time when you're dead tired, but this is more a ""lesson"" to remember to turn on your sound next time and for him to come home on time or let you know it's going to be a while longer so you can make preparations.	0.855
Probably not cus we have been happy for 19 years now. It’s just a minor irritation. They have gotten bolder over the years…	<p>My mother says that I need to apologize each time I get upset, start, yelling, crying, etc. bc “hes trying to find his way &amp; it means a lot to him”.  Like, tf, it means a lot to me &amp; just bc Ive found my way doesnt mean I dont have emotions too.  Jake sent me into a major depressive episode that caused me from going to online therapy once a month (it doesnt work as well as in person, so my therapist suggested to change) back to once a week.  When ppl assume we have the same views on animal rights &amp; conservation, I correct them.  Were on two different platforms completely bc his views are more extreme, focus on one area (veganism can solve global warming), &amp; is based in emotion while my views are less extreme, focus on more than one area (corporations &amp; a carbon fine, ecosystem health, etc.), &amp; based in logic/science.</p>	0.851
Probably not cus we have been happy for 19 years now. It’s just a minor irritation. They have gotten bolder over the years…	<p>Recently he seems to be going through a spiral. I know he’s severely mentally ill and self medicated which we both got him help for, yet he’s still going it. It’s my birthday in a few days and he said he’d come home from uni for it as well as to spend time at home due to mental illness, however the other day he told me he brought a copious amount of LSD and in the same sentence said ‘Oh yeah I can’t afford to come back for your birthday now. As well as that he takes half a day to ever respond despite him being online most the day and says he’ll call on a certain day but actually call days later. I’m constantly worrying over him, what can I do to help or ease his illness. He owes me hundreds (Which I had to reduce to £50 because he never paid) for all the times I have to pick up his issues and get him a train away from uni. I think I need to take a break from this but I fear my anger at him missing my birthday is understating the complexity of his drug problem and if I were to step back then it’ll send him further down the spiral as I’m the only person he discusses these issues with. In addition, one of our mutual friends was non responsive to him and he ended up telling him to fuck off and that he didn’t care anymore.</p>	0.851

I also had to wait a while before I could drive. Couldn&#39;t life anything over like 5lbs for some time. It was extremely difficult to even get in and out of bed.</p>	0.849

read halfway.   just kick his ass.	<p>I def think she could be lonely, and since most of my family has passed on, I’m totally okay with hearing about them and looking at pics, and I love to hear crazy stories about their family that I have met. It just weirds me out slightly that she seems to know when everyone’s died, even people she doesn’t remember or died before she was born. I’m not great with the death thing either, so this could fully be a me problem.</p>	0.803

read halfway.   just kick his ass.	But then recently, a friend of mine joined a few private childfree groups on Facebook. One turned out to be one of the more toxic childfree groups (similar to main childfree sub on here, to give you an idea) and she saw that Lucy had been posting about me and my kids. Posts dating back to when I was pregnant with my twins, saying that it was “so sad” to see me putting myself through this again after the miscarriages, and basically implying I was pitiable and stupid for wanting this and whatever (implied that this was especially so bc I’m obviously married to a woman so couldn’t get pregnant “naturally”). And then complaining that I thought the world revolved around me for being pregnant (at the time that I was on bed rest during my high risk pregnancy!) and that I shouldn’t complain because I chose this. And then complaining about the kids, and how whenever she sees my family everything revolves around them, and calling my kids brats and ranting about them being badly behaved and dirty and etc etc.	0.798
How tf is that illegal? ATP I think you're just trying to troll so go suck it ✌	<p>Now she’s in rehab, and the moment she gets out, her parents (my aunt and uncle) are sending her to live here with us. They say they can’t deal with her anymore. I think it’s extremely unfair that they’re sending her here, where my grandma and a 14 year old girl live just because they don’t wanna deal with her anymore. They say she’ll be fine after getting out of rehab, yet refuse to let her stay with them. I am very worried about getting robbed again, about her bringing dealers and drugs to the house around my sister, stealing my grandma’s medication, etc. I think it’s a recipe for disaster having her here. Also, my mom is a recovering alcoholic who has been relapsing lately, and I think having a recovering addict live with another recovering addict is a horrible idea. Even if my cousin isn’t doing fentanyl anymore, I know she’s gonna be drinking and she’s gonna drag my mom down with her. After voicing my concerns to her mom (my aunt) I’ve been told I’m turning my back on our family, that I’m coldhearted, and that I “need to have faith in her.” AITA for not believing one month of rehab will magically fix her problems after years and years of this behaviour?</p>	0.904
How tf is that illegal? ATP I think you're just trying to troll so go suck it ✌	I (49F) have a daughter (17F) and we are a part of a conservative society and family. She's a good child but she refuses to pay heed to things I tell her to do or to tell her to maintain. Today after my daughter came back from a friend's house after some work she had to do and immediately after she entered, her paternal grandma started asking her about the time she spent at her friend's. Granted she did tell them she had to go to the bathroom and get herself freshened up and rested a bit and then she'd tell them, her grandma asked her once again about her time outside the house immediately as she got out of the bathroom. (It's important to mention here that they don't have a good relationship, none of us in the family do.) She lost her temper and screamed that they were being too much and they should allow her to atleast rest before speaking, she didn't even have a drink of water.	0.896
How tf is that illegal? ATP I think you're just trying to troll so go suck it ✌	Around a month ago, while at his house, he got into an argument with his mum and told me to confirm his story to her and say ""he wasn't lying"" but in fact he had been lying. I didn't want to lie to her. She's nice. Her and my mum are friends. And what if the truth eventually came out? So I told her the truth and left.	0.896
How tf is that illegal? ATP I think you're just trying to troll so go suck it ✌	<p>I’m back at work now and had issues with my sister coming over when im not there and giving his nanny a hard time. Complaining about the way she’s caring about him and everything (btw have cams set up so I can always see exactly what’s going on, she literally does nothing wrong). Telling my sister to let his nanny do her job hasn’t done much so I  told her to not let my sister in when she comes over and that’s exactly what she did.	0.896
How tf is that illegal? ATP I think you're just trying to troll so go suck it ✌	We move in. Everything is fine the first 4 months until she was fired for being late. I told her she needed to find a job immediately. Luckily, her parents decided to pay her part of the rent until she’s finds a job. But she was never fired… I learned that she had walked out. I couldn’t wrap my brain around why she would lie to me. But I ignored it. Then I started noticing things in my room going missing. My favorite beanie &amp; bra, some money I had laying around in my room, was gone. I made excuses like just miss placing it.	0.895
You are a heinous monster.

Wtf???? Like do you always walk around imagining the kind of sex everyone you meet could be having? I’m a straight woman.

You are a heinous monster. FUCK YOU	On one hand, no one is entitled to your pregnancy. No one. And it should be considered that it's the pregnant person's body is the one that is going to be poked, prodded, examined, probably touched without consent (side note: PLEASE STOP touching baby bumps without asking), and subject to a lot of judgmental remarks by both well- and ill-intentioned people. There is also enormous mental and emotional strain on the pregnant person when it comes to carrying to term and the possibility of miscarriage. I've told my husband this several times, keeping this kid alive is solely riding on my shoulders right now, and that's a LOT. I get not wanting to put yourself on display like that.	0.856

You are a heinous monster. FUCK YOU	<p>His literal problem seems to be the fact that I take up space, yes I&#39;m considered plus size but I&#39;m not massive taking up the whole walk way. He attempted it once with the other plus size girl and she shoulder checked him and he never screwed with her again. Someone has said something that hints that he might have a problem with fat people. It&#39;s not like I can loose the weight, I&#39;ve tried, it&#39;s caused by a reproductive issue that my doctor is being a dick about. And i don&#39;t see a point in loosing weight because some guy has a problem with the size of my ass. Idk if he&#39;s one of those guys that has a problem when a women doesn&#39;t move out of his way, because I&#39;ve known guys like that in the past. He tells me to stop being a bitch everytime i do something that inconveniences him just a little bit, like setting aside a basket of fries for something, or if I ask him politely to do something.</p>	0.848
