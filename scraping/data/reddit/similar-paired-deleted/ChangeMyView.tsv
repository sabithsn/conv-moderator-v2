As a trans man, I can tell you they most certainly are not about your biological sex. They are also not about whether you like boy things or girl things.

But Israel is the only power that can solve the underlying problem causing this in the first place. They're treating people like shit. They have control over Palestine and decided to set up an apartheid state. I don't have much sympathy for Israels entire ""we're just protecting ourselves"" angle because of this. They've created a cycle of treating the West Bank and Gaza terribly, terrorists attack Israel because of this, Israel uses the terrorist attacks as justification to crack down harder, and the cycle continues. Rather than working towards the obvious answer of treat people less badly so they're not as inclined to attack Israel and de-escalate the whole situation."	0.845

And as we later established the word “backed” in that sentence was using a different definition than you preferred.

The Israelis don't lay claim to the area on that ground. Sure, that's part of the *draw* - but they claimed the land then on the basis of legally immigrating to and purchasing it. They claim the land *now* because they've been their for 3 generations, and have built a ton of infrastructure and a democratic high-tech economy from the ground-up.	0.846

It’s pretty easy to understand. Everyone has grasped it.  But you do you bro. You wanna get fucked? You go get fucked. Or whatever you want to call it.

Thats why Israel is where it is, because the region was the ethnic homeland to the Jewish people. Does that justify all of their land grabs beyond the land they were given by the British originally?

Except you've provided fuck all to prove this "truth" you've done nothing but assert and flame out and block people who disagree	Yes I agree, I think on Palestinians you are basically delusional, at least that belief is delusional. I don’t know the level of propaganda that is drilled into Jewish people or Israelis; as I said I grew up evangelical Christian so I just thought of Israel as the “promised/holy land” and the Muslims as godless heathens. So I know that level of propaganda, and that to an extent I was taught that Muslims are killers, and just how wrong and racist that belief was. The only killers are the people who kill. You can hate Israel and not hate Jews as people. Zionists disagree, and they’ve been very successful at pushing their belief.	0.875
It's not a reasonable conclusion and you should also, kindly, go away.	That's quite different though. People are spending time in front of a screen largely as part of an existing organization to complete certain tasks that they are paid for.

Trust me, if there was a switch I could flip and keep my income, insurance and hours the same yet I'm not sitting at a desk I'd take it in a heartbeat.

It's not a reasonable conclusion and you should also, kindly, go away.	Also, a great deal of this is the stresses of work. Everyone's working all the time, we've moved towards a society where both parents are working, and nobody has a great amount of time. What that means is that people are naturally moving away from cooking, which takes time, effort and energy, towards easier solutions that take less time. And partly, this is the death of the family dinner, because a lot of people's situation is that they're working at odd hours, and don't have a communal time, and giving the kids something to warm up is easier than teaching them to cook. Also, stress both damages people's ability to process food by first of all making the body less efficient, but also by encouraging the body to make fat, making them fatter. And it also encourages them to take on fatty and sugary foods, because that's what the body thinks it wants now, but also because being miserable and having very few ways to change that often pushes people towards food.	0.825

Lmao Reddit karma = sound argument. I've heard it all.	I think that people, including you, want to define sex by genitalia because they want to define sex in a way that affects them (in other words, mostly for dating since other than that average people don't often have a reason to care about a person's biological sex unless they're just prying), and that because what affects them by far the most is people's genitalia, it follows that genitalia is their desired definition. I think that's an entirely fair characterization since you've personally brought up dating multiple times.	0.894

I've heard it all.	<p>I think that people, including you, want to define sex by genitalia because they want to define sex in a way that affects them (in other words, mostly for dating since other than that average people don&#39;t often have a reason to care about a person&#39;s biological sex unless they&#39;re just prying), and that because what affects them by far the most is people&#39;s genitalia, it follows that genitalia is their desired definition. I think that&#39;s an entirely fair characterization since you&#39;ve personally brought up dating multiple times.</p>	0.888
Lmao Reddit karma = sound argument. I've heard it all.	Being into features like breasts and genitals could also count, because these features are strongly associated with sex and wanting to do sexual things with women (unlike preferring clear skin, which is not a sexual thing at all and there's a lot of evidence it's built into most people's brains). I don't know why you expect me to argue that breasts and genitals are more attractive when I've repeated said this isn't what I think. You're attributing a lot of ideas to me that I don't have.	0.881

Why the hell are you on this sub if you're going to be a dick to those trying to change your view?	<p>I do think the OP has a point though and that because the left aren&#39;t vocal in their criticism of aspects of Islam it creates problems where they are seen to have double standards. It shouldn&#39;t be that people are scared to criticise Islam because it might be seen as racist, it should be that a greater attempt to draw distinctions between the most extreme and most moderate interpretation of Islam is made. As I touched on previously, I&#39;m not saying the left is the only side guilty of ignoring extremism as you also touch upon how governments in the west are happy to deal with the Saudis and it&#39;s usually the right who ignore their human rights problems</p>	0.882

When you try to explain to me why PopTarts are actually pretty great, I can choose if I want to exchange thoughts on PopTarts with you, or just beat you over the head about how dry they are.  ""I agree that the blueberry filling is actually quite good, and probably the best.  But the dryness makes that impossible to enjoy and therefore cancels out the sweet artificial blueberry filling.""  Or ""I don't know what kind of food your parents gave you, but PopTarts are dry and therefore terrible.  I guess if you like eating cardboard, good for you.""  No matter where it came from, my position is the same, but this second statement isn't my nature because I'm not a bully.	0.826

I am. I have repeatedly asked for details you continually refuse to provide. How are statements of what you've done disrespectful?	I think encouraging people to ""come out"" as pedophiles who should be treated with understanding will have the opposite effect to what you intend, i.e. it will increase harm to kids instead of decreasing it. It will inevitably play into the hands of sickos who claim that children can consent to sex because ""love is love"" and ""age is just a number"". It will go down the same path that other ""sexual disorders"" have gone down. Eg homosexuality was once considered a sexual disorder, and illegal.

I am. I have repeatedly asked for details you continually refuse to provide. How are statements of what you've done disrespectful?	I legit think no kink or sexual preference should be ashamed, not even non-offending pedo. Why? Because around the world the sex talk should be open to help people first of all not be ashamed of what they like and how to practice it safely and second to help those with dangerous behavior understand that what they like is not healthy at all. Now one might say that what is healthy and what isn't is subjective but there's a difference between someone likeing to get peed on or raped, which is up to each individual if it's for them or not and which they can safely practice with a partner, and someone who like to get stabbed during sex or wants to fuck children (those are actually dangerous).

That isn’t to just say the person doing the harassment or catcalling is purely at fault since it could be argued that if catcalling is getting them dates or sex or whatever, then it works (assuming the other person goes with it voluntarily obviously). The catcaller should be more respectful of the catcallee, and the catcallee should have more respect for themselves then to respond positively to being catcalled.</p>	0.888

How about not having such a combattive tone?	As for the problem I have with that second article, I think that using non-standard chromosomal arrangements to argue that sex is anything but binary is a mistake. Evolution doesn't care about chromosomes, evolution only cares if your genitals work. So from an evolutionary perspective, your biological sex is about your genitals, not your chromosomes. And the fact remains that there are only two gamete types, sperm and egg. Every human that has ever existed produces one of these two, with the exception of some intersex people, who may produce both. But understand that producing both does not constitute evidence that sex is not binary. Even intersex people are limited to sperm and egg. There is no third gamete, there is no third sex."	0.853

There becomes no way to enforce accountability on a police force that acts this way.

You first.	Finally as to punishment and force, I would argue that this has become a semantic game (with respect).  Force is force.

You seem to be mistaking directness for being combattative. Will you provide details or not?	There's every reason for a healthy person not to get vaccinated, they aren't at risk and the vaccine is not FDA approved as for the ""your choice is killing other people"" argument that's bullshit everyone who's at risk is already vaccinated by the time you'd have a chance to get vaccinated.

The intent of the CDC moratorium is literally to prevent transmission of COVID by protecting those most vulnerable. It's not a free-rent-for-everybody card.

Having said that, as an Australian I feel our private health insurance is way overpriced so I simply take that money and save it myself.

In America, for instance, the problem is not like in countries with literal famines where there’s no food of any sort. Even in the poorest American neighbourhoods, there are still food banks and people are still able to get access to free food. The problem in many developed countries (yes, France too!) is that going to food banks is stigmatised and that it’s easier to get unhealthy food compared to healthy food. People feel ashamed of getting a handout as opposed to buying food using their own earnings.	0.808
I already did. You just ignored it. Go back and read it again if you want.	For cases of incest where no children are made, I think it would depend on what ""no"" means. Like if they always use a condom/birth control, even together, the risk is minimized but still present so I would say that is not acceptable.

Oh my, too afraid to give them out?	Scholarships specifically only available to black girls rather than black boys? I'm sure that's probably true. But while that may be true, there's still a massive power imbalance at the highest levels of pretty much every major company where men have the majority of the power and women just.. don't. And while you can promote equality all you want, at the end of the day there are such deep cultural differences for men and women in the US today that women already don't get a fair shot in employment (same for black people versus white people, where black people just don't get treated as equal to white people in the workplace, as a whole).	0.839

Oh my, too afraid to give them out?	<p>This question doesn&#39;t even make sense. Race is largely defined by society, not a scientific designation. Telling a person who has experienced anti-black racism that they aren&#39;t black is an attempt to invalidate their experiences, and calling them white would be technically correct in the most useless way possible because their life experiences will largely not be aligned with white Americans as a group. Additionally, there are far fewer &quot;pure&quot; black Americans than &quot;pure&quot; white Americans due in part to the fact that slaves were regularly raped and children born from that were born into slavery and thus into black culture, so to attempt to differentiate between people who are part-black and &quot;pure&quot; black could easily be seen as a sort of black erasure, making black Americans an even smaller minority than they are and again invalidating the experiences of people of mixed race.</p>	0.832

Yes yes. Ofc. Bored 13 year old. Totally.	<p>The women example is an interesting one. If you define discrimination as a prejudice or bias against a group then it would fit as discrimination. I think the reason we have a more visceral reaction to &quot;I don&#39;t date black people&quot; vs &quot;I don&#39;t date women (as a straight woman)&quot; is because there is less subtext to the latter. I don&#39;t date black people feels more like a comment on how black people aren&#39;t fit to be partners vs if a woman doesn&#39;t want to date a woman then they are just normal. The subtext is I&#39;m straight which is the norm vs an indictment of woman as a partner.

You're absolutely right about one thing. The reason the vast majority of main characters in American popular media are white is the direct result of corporations making calculated business decisions. You undersell just how insidious this is though. Studios make so few movies with black characters so that they don't risk alienating a racist audience. Imagine if a restaurant refused entry to black customers because they would make their racist customers uncomfortable. This is the problem with neoliberalism and trusting the free market to beget good products. It's just not always profitable to not be a piece of shit.	0.829

Unless your entire production house, cast, and crew are almost entirely straight white men, and the story is about white guy stuff, you&#39;re probably not going to worry about this. The fact that it was necessary <em>at all</em> is a testament to just how low the bar is on inclusivity and diversity in hollywood. The bar is so low it is touching the ground, and yet a shocking number of productions <em>failed that low bar</em>. (See also: the Bechdel Test; another absurdly low bar that we somehow keep fucking up.)</p>	0.869

Lol stay mad	The system has been rigged for decades so that certain demographics are trapped in a cycle where the alternative to working those jobs is death. In the 50s and 60s, the buying power of the dollar was more than 4 times what it is today, and a single income at one of those terrible jobs was enough to support a family and own property. It's the jobs that failed to keep up, and now it's finally biting them in the ass. They colluded with politicians and media outlets for DECADES to pretend that if they paid a living wage like they used to, they'd all go out of business even though that's been proven false time and time again.	0.847
Lol stay mad	The Trump campaign filed dozens upon dozens of lawsuits in the courts, and they lost. Big time. This past election was not only litigated, it was heavily litigated.

The problem with it is it ignores the world as it was and as it is. It would be absolutely wonderful if we could just cancel racism and forget about it, but we simply and obviously cannot do that so long as racism exists on a systemic level. No matter how hard we try to call racism bad, it has been baked into the very foundation of western society. Just ignoring it would not remove it from those systems. White people <em>are</em> a different group, but not because skin color actually matters. White people are a different group because western society was built on the idea that they are.</p>	0.908

Stay ashamed	<p>You&#39;re underestimating how much simpler life was back then. Homes were much smaller. They had fewer bathrooms. They didn&#39;t have many nice amenities. There were no cable bills, no phone bills, no internet bills, way fewer luxuries, let alone luxuries that everyone had access to like many of the ones you and I enjoy. Kids literally wore bread bags on their feet when it rained. Eating out was much more rare. And just in terms of prices, the price per square foot of US homes has gone nearly unchanged for 50 years. I def agree that we have challenges, and that housing is one of them particularly in certain areas. But (1) it&#39;s a very solvable challenge, and (2) the doom and gloom around this overstates the problem dramatically.</p>	0.838

This is no different. A good legislator will seek guidance from experts, but unfortunately they don't do that enough. Gender has nothing to do with it and I think that's a crappy attitude.

How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	<p>I&#39;ll put it this way. I&#39;m a lawyer, meaning that I&#39;m a participant in the justice system. And I have the lawful right to use violence in certain situations- everyone does, either in defense of oneself or someone else. Police are the same way, they just have expanded situations where they are allowed to use violence compared to others- but not unlimited. The rules around when they can use force are clear and public. They cannot use force against someone who is not being detained for a lawful purpose, for example. They cannot use force against a member of the general public without one of those prior justifications being present.</p>	0.843
How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	Which brings me to my next point.  You might object to all that I have written here, saying, ""Oh, well, it's not like I ever express my opinion to anyone else.  I keep all this to myself.""   It's not just other people this sort of policing is bad for.	0.836
How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	Yes, I absolutely do get to say this. You live under the same laws I do. I'm not a felon *because I don't commit felonies.* And convictions are public record for adults because people do have a right to know who they're dealing with. People don't trust criminals for a good reason.	0.83
How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	<p>And even if someone does it in an inappropriate situation, regulating it with laws or propaganda would be an extreme measure. Most of our social conventions are held up by society without any official bans. There‘s no law or propaganda that forces people to shake hands with others when they meet them (supposing we‘re not in a pandemic) but it‘s still a social convention that people accept.</p>	0.83
How entitled are you? Have you ever paid for dinner?	<li>&quot;Police&quot; as in public agents who have the discretion to use force should never be involved in civil offenses.  Speeding, property damage, fines, traffic enforcement, etc.  What leway a Census Person or Social Worker has should be the civil enforcement&#39;s toolkit.  Carry a gun if you are legally allowed, but you be as liable and have the legal use of force as any ordinary citizen.  If you need &quot;police&quot; as we would categorize it today for certain tasks, fine.  But for day-to-day interactions, no way.</li>	0.829
>I don't mean to be rude it it just seems you are just making excuses on why you deserve and should get free stuff.  No, of course not./s	But is this really something *every* police officer can be blamed for? A typical officer doesn't know what causes recidivism, they are given a simple task of going out to stop crimes and arrest criminals. The current system might be a revolving door of imprisonment with little hope of rehabilitation, but surely the typical cop on the street isn't going ""Yeah, I love arresting gang members so they can spend a few years in jail building bad habits and connections so I have to arrest them again after they get out!"" Instead they are probably like the rest of us, they can see the problem but they don't have any magic solutions. From their point of view stopping people from stealing stuff and shooting people seems like a good way to help the situation as it stands."	0.882

The logistics of a long term battle with zombies don’t look good: Your best shot is neutralizing the zombies right off the get go. Even if that means dropping a nuke, like another commenter mentioned, containing and eliminating the zombies as early as possible is the best case scenario. The longer the zombie apocalypse continues, the worse infrastructure is going to get. I already mentioned power, which is important for communication but also manufacturing weapons/supplies and producing food. And then, as populations dwindle, who is producing food? Who is producing weapons? What about clean water? If a zombie corpse falls into the water supply, those bodily fluids are getting ingested and everyone who drinks the water is pretty much screwed.

I can't get over the fact that you are with all seriousness using the term "ejaculating a person."	<p>the 9 times out of 10 was my own experience. But I will admit I wasn&#39;t exactly aiming for administrative positions in large companies. I would wager that if I went for positions like that I would have been denied. Though I did have an internship with General Electric with installing and uninstalling medical equipment like MRI Equipment which was... very well paid. even as an intern they paid for a large number of our meals, they paid for my travel miles, they paid me 20 dollars an hour even without having graduated. It was a job I could have easily seen requiring a 4 year degree. Unfortunately they didn&#39;t hire me on permanently due to a lack of available work. </p>	0.815
I can't get over the fact that you are with all seriousness using the term "ejaculating a person."	I was suffocated to passing out as a child in a very scary situation & masks felt very similar to me. Because I work for a grocery store I had to take a medical leave for a period of time in order to undergo EMDR therapy to be able to wear a mask for 8 hours a day.	0.811
I can't get over the fact that you are with all seriousness using the term "ejaculating a person."	<p>I personally had serious problems wearing a mask at the start of the pandemic because of sensory issues. I still do to an extent. I had to set up accommodations with my employer to be able to have a work space where I wasn’t near others so I didn’t need a mask, except for when distance wasn’t possible. I spent upwards of $300 on trying different style masks and mask inserts to find one that I could tolerate. I worked to push myself to wear a mask for longer periods of time. I’m able to wear a mask for about 75% of my shift now. All of this stuff I did also isn’t possible for people with more severe problems or don’t have the mental capacity to understand the importance of masks. </p>	0.808

My goalposts are exactly where they were an hour ago, what the fuck is your problem?   The post doesn't mention people on the autism spectrum, would you like to discourse about them too?	I know that a *lot* of people on the internet are not about to have their minds changed, but some are willing to consider others' perspectives (especially when they're young). (See also: most people on this sub.) If you were raised with a certain ""incorrect"" belief, and you're not allowed to talk about that belief, it doesn't go away, it just festers and possibly fosters resentment. But if you're allowed to express it, you have an opportunity to be provided with an opposing viewpoint.	0.863

By posting this you've shown that you aren't totally self sufficient and self assured (nobody is so don't sweat it) so finding people who you can work together with for mutual benefit saves a lot of time and hassle.	0.852

We have a small sample size of 4 quarters (and a sample size of 1 season for seasonal businesses). We have a long way to go. People just got their 2nd round of stimulus checks. The fear is that when you take the foot off the gas that the economy will start to unravel. And when interest rates are low and QE and stimulus is high, you don&#39;t have many more tools in the toolbox to stimulate the economy. All our cards are on the table. So I think it&#39;s best to wait and see how this all plays out before we declare victory.</p>	0.841

However oppressive wealth inequality has always existed and, under capitalism, always will. We've had it in the the Middle Ages with serfs and and the industrial era with slum dwellers. All I can see depopulation doing (if done very carefully in a way that avoids worldwide inflation) is making housing more accessible. Which would be great, but the same could be achieved through wealth redistribution, which would *actually* do something about climate change and would also have the added benefit of not creating a dystopian society where we control people's sex life and their choices."	0.783
can't convince a sheep	....the option to do what was necessary. Yet other infrastructure railroad and the first roads other than post roads were often private or local affairs. Then infrastructure became part of Common defense for a bit in WW1. Was expanded to help feed the country during the depression with large infrastructure project, many of which were paid with by very large taxes on the Ulta Rich. Those rates reached 94% in the late 30's on the very top tax payers. And stayed high, but not that high until the 60's brought the grouth of the middle class.	0.781
uh you mean women bud not "birthing people"	<p>As for Frodo, see my analogy that since we never get to see what the Gray Havens are actually like, it is possible to read the ending of him going to the Grey Havens as an allegory for a soldier committing suicide after returning from a war, that Frodo has been so scarred by his experiences in being a ring bearer that he could no longer find peace and happiness even when he returned to his home home and was safely surrounded by friends who cared about him, the pain of what he&#39;d experienced was just too deep.  </p>	0.813
uh you mean women bud not "birthing people"	Have you ever had your friend call you crying because they have PTSD from serving as a medic during the Iraq War and says he can&#39;t take it seeing all these people dying who shouldn&#39;t have to ? Have you had to go to a friend&#39;s funeral because his dad died from Covid after he was talked to into not getting vaccinated and he walks out onto the freeway because he felt guilty and that he should have been a better son and made him get vaccinated ?

uh you mean women bud not "birthing people"	<p>However, majorly, it&#39;s the hypocrisy that bites. Anyone mildly to the right gets immediately cancelled when an off-color tweet is dug up, but Northam literally dressing up in blackface and <em>happily</em> submitting it to his <em>Med School yearbook</em> doesn&#39;t earn him an ousting. And the calls for resignation were loud and clear right up until the Democrats realized they&#39;d lose power, which is just naked party-over-principles.</p>	0.805

uh you mean women bud not "birthing people"	What I see now as opposed to growing up in the 60s n 70s is redefining terms with what seems to be intended results. We talked about racism in the past as hatred based on skin color. It's easy to see that that's ridiculous especially since the men who fought and died in ww2 were of every race. It was a beautiful thing even. All peoples came together with others to defeat the philosophy of a master race. A proud moment in american history only to be muddied upon the end of actions and return to civilian life. A very sad moment. Racism still existed we didnt learn our lesson.	0.803
I agree with OP.   For me (black male) this has always been an oxymoron. Culture is SUPPOSED to be appropriated. Perhaps I have the wrong idea/definition of what culture is. I think that humans group and create societies based on common temperament, and environment. After the humans successfully conquer/master that environment they have to 'export' the knowledge of how to thrive in that environment WITHOUT learning it from the beginning. That is what culture is.    Native Americans:   Let's go fishing.   Oh nice.. i notice that this branch, plus this twine makes for a stronger fishing pole, and I am able to catch more fish, and bigger fish per hunting trip!   I notice that when i cleaned the fish and threw the guts on the ground, the corn in that field grew faster and yielded more!   Now I must teach the method of creating this superior fishing pole to my son, and his son, and his cousins,and the greater village. Now our village has become the best fishermen in the area. Now we are known as the place to not only come get fish (we have a surplus) , but we are also able sell/trade our superior fishing poles. We change the name of our tribe to reflect our past 60 years of advancement due to our fishing techniques. We embroider a Pisces symbol into the clothing of our village/society ambassadors so that when they go to regional council meetings they represent us with pride, and the learning tradition carries on. We start doing a celebration after the big salmon run each year where we sell fish for cheap and everyone eats and is happy.     Fast forward 100 years and a Fish symbol on a shirt in a department store is the most coveted article of clothing on college campuses in the Midwest( I am just making and example).     This is NOT a bad thing , and it is not appropriation. The reason Black people are sensitive to this shit is because we lost our culture entirely, and are still remembering, and making up a new culture to replace it. It does something major to the human spirit to lose that subtle and delicate part of ones identity. Black people were conquered and we behave exactly like someone who was held captive for 10 years and raped, and beat, then just set free all of a sudden.     I don't know if we (African Americans) will ever recover from what was done to us fully, but the human race will most certainly overcome it. What I am saying is, that the identity is secondary to the survival mechanism it represents. When your environment changes, you too must change or else risk annihilation. I spent all of my life wanting to be a Ninja like most kids born in the 80s and the Japanese are not offended because they have not been conquered, and have not lost their minds, and therefore are not screaming victim-hood about anything that effects the false identity they made up. Ninjas no longer serve a purpose so they are simply celebrated in pop-culture and media, but at one time the Ninjas were a serious form of resistance to oppression from the late 15th century against the large powerful governing bodies that were tyrannical in some ways.

Canada's system may have changed since she was there, but back when she and her (surgeon) ex-husband worked in the canadian system, there were all sorts of issues. One thing she likes to bitch about in particular is essentially a quota system. She said that her ex used to do only so many surgeries per year, and once he did that many, he wasn't allowed to do any more. So he would knock out his allotment by like May or June and then not have funding to do any more surgeries for the rest of the year. Patients would be waiting for surgeries on their hands and he wasn't allowed to operate. That seems problematic. Again, things may have changed since then, but she's not too high on the system, and it played a large part in them moving to the states."	0.765

If her body wants to die, why not let her family make that choice legally. At that point its not even assisted ""suicide"", its allowing life to takes its natural course. When our family finally got permission to change her care, she dies within a day. Imagine how long she had been eady to go for?!?! She suffered unimaginably... she was once found by my aunt in agony (but has lost her speech by then). Xrays revealed a crush injury in her hips that could only have been caused by falling or being dropped. The doctors said that even she fell, she would not have been able to crawl into bed... so obviously the orderlies just tried to cover it up.	0.756

You're dumb as fuck man.	When I first told them i would never do it, they literally said ""why would you want to set your child up to be unhealthy"". My parents are boomers. You would be surprised how dumb people can be and how much trust they put in doctors. Thankfully that is being taught differently in most medical schools today. My wife is a registered nurse who is absolutely against it as well. Surprisingly, her textbooks actually explained the purpose of the foreskin and how circumcision is only necessary in extraordinarily rare situations. It's headed in the right direction.	0.853

This is obviously horrible and not realistic but the point I am making is that the governments job is not to make sure everybody feels good or give people rights but instead to look at the situation of the people and organize it in a comprehensive way, understanding the challenges the entire population faces and dealing with those problems.	0.823

At the very least, do you really think that assisted suicide isn't okay for someone that's suffering tremendously every single day with an impossible recovery? Why should they have to prolong the suffering if it's inevitable and they might not even be very present? Why should their loved ones have to watch them suffer like that, not to mention pay the bill for it?"	0.819

A half-dozen people in the gallery with passes being disruptive and obnoxious, then cuffed by police and escorted out. Versus 5 dead, 100+ injured in an afternoon, chants of "Hang Mike Pence" and a gallows being set up. By all means, make the comparison if you want, but anyone reading knows its ludicrous.   You do know there's a distinction between peaceful protest and a riot, correct? Democratic politicians have a nostalgia for non-violent direct action, yes. They have since the 60's.

Well, maybe; the facts have to tell us that. But a pissed off person isn’t the best judge of that—anger is known to distort our judgments in ways that we ourselves would reject, once our anger subsided. The situation is the same here. Depressed people are not good judges of the happiness of the future; they assume in advance that everything is doomed, even when all evidence points the other way.	0.87

As for your ‘whataboutism’ for allowing Palestinians to reclaim their land and property, their land and property was stolen from civilians in 1948. Not hundreds of years ago….  Jews worldwide have fought to have their property stolen from them in WW2 returned to them, the same should hold for Palestinians.

With Chinese-Americans, the vast majority moved to the US more recently 1950s to 1980s. So the general assumption is that their ancestors were not involved in building the railroads. These assumptions benefit wealthy Africans who move to the US and hurt Chinese-Americans who descended from the laborers who built the railroads.

This is a blatant straw man. You leave no room for good-faith arguments. Their either malicious, or they are dumb.	<p>But for centuries, blacks in America have had a gigantic gap in opportunity compared to whites. This was obviously most apparent during slavery, but for a long time after that, blacks were simply viewed as lesser than whites, not just by some racist groups, but by law. This means that the grandfather of black kids today had much less opportunity than the grandfather of white kids today. So even if there’d be no discrimination anymore (which evidence points out there definitely still is, this is also what CRT is about), means that a black kid today still doesn’t have as much opportunity as a white kid today.</p>	0.869

Its their responsibility to change it. Its the same if we identify racism in the past as the cause of it, but then decide that because it's in the past it's no longer relevant.	0.89

But if you accept that racism has evolved beyond the simple <em>”blatant and vocalized</em> opposition to a race — full stop,” then we — at the very least — tolerate it much more than we should. And that doesn’t mean that “it’s literally just as bad as it ever was,” or that things haven’t <em>improved</em> over time....but I think quite people enjoy the perks of racism much more than they’d ever want to acknowledge/realize.</p>	0.89
I just want to see what people say	<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely bad - the competitiveness has definitely made something like Chess a more fun hobby for me. If there wasn&#39;t ELO or playful taunting between opponents it wouldn&#39;t be as exciting. Same with video games, sports, etc. In fandoms about things that aren&#39;t inherently competitive (like TV shows, for example), men will <em>make</em> it a competition through tribalism or gatekeeping or whatever means they can find to create a pecking order, which is sometimes very toxic and sometimes very fun.</p>	0.87

I just want to see what people say	Football meanwhile offers so many variations it's not funny.

🙌	The interest problem is not serious and again won't make the system work any worse than the current one. In the current system, in the US about 40% of people don't show even that much interest that they would vote in the national elections. So, their interests don't get any attention in the political system. It's the people who actually vote for either of the two parties that get their views represented (I mean in theory, in practice it's the donor class who gets their view represented). So, if you elected, say, 300 random members and 40% of them never show up on any vote as they are not interested, you'd still have 180 people who would represent the people who are interested in political decisions. The result would be the same as in the current system, but just without the corruption.	0.863

HMU when you’re done reading those if this one wasn’t clear or sufficient for you.	And the fact that you adopted your dog for $20 doesn't change the fact that it's a regional issue. In my area that starting price for dogs from the shelters is about $500 and you generally need to be at least 25, have no small children (under 6 or 12), have somebody at home frequently (i.e. not all adults are working full time), and a handful of other requirements. Which makes sense on a purely mathematical level, most area pets are bought or adopted as puppies and grow old and eventually pass on in one family, so they're never available to be adopted. For every dog owner to exclusively adopt, every dog would have had to end up in a shelter at 1 point in their life where they could have been adopted from, but many don't."	0.829

Not hormone production, not your chromosomes, not genitalia, (I wouldn't say a vaginoplasty is literally giving me a human vagina, I would say it's an imitation. Obviously it's good enough for government work, still would be called a vagina, and really unless you're having kids no one should really care) nothing else but levels of hormones in your body, but you're still considering it changing sex.	0.877

Oh look, you can read. You just choose to ignore reading the sources I provided that prove you wrong.   Keep on defending rapists. Keep denying women victimize men.   Then fuck off.	So, we have to establish that somehow it would have been ok with the person. Except that even given a letter explicitly stating that not only would they be ok with it, they would like it to happen, we couldn't know what their intent was. Such a thing could have been said satirically, in jest, with false morality knowing that it'd never be tested in their lifetime, and without respect to any other point in their life. The very ideas of consent mean that we have to get an up to date record of where people are at. You can say that you want to sleep with someone very enthusiastically at one point, then not want to in an instant, and your prior consent doesn't translate into future consent. Even consent given to strangers isn't really given to strangers in the sense that at any time it can be taken back, and it was generally given with an understanding ahead of it. It's uncertain whether we even can give consent to an unspecified stranger, given that even if we try to give it, I'm not sure of a situation that exists where we don't imply huge caveats (i.e. a person or (probably ultimately limited number of persons even if that number is unknown) I don't know the identity of in this room, subject to change, at this time, and if things about them just seem wrong will be withdrawn, and to do certain things to be determined at moment of doing). And the fact that I don't think anyone believes it likely that they can be tested on that belief means that it's impossible to take this for granted as consent  . So, ""is it wrong to do this?"" really cannot be answered through a consent framework.	0.78

Ok ok. So have you looked into trauma based therapy? There are some really good resources out there, but it clear that you need something. This ‘debate’ (we never really got past you falsifying information) has deteriorated into abuse.   I’m going to guess that you’re in America, so here are a few things that I have found. If you’re willing to let me know your state, I’m happy to do the emotional labour of finding you more relevant resources.   https://1in6.org/helpline/  https://www.survivorsuk.org   I would also highly suggest that you make a retroactive complaint to your title IX department - I’m critical of the system in the US, but it is a resource, and because of the different levels of evidential requirements might be a better bet in terms of justice that the traditional routes.    In general, trauma based therapies are going to stop you reacting to situations like this in the way that you have. You need to work on that, because the behaviour that you’ve shown here is damaging to yourself, but also can be damaging to people around you, if they are inexperienced in dealing with people like you.   Above all, I wish you the best. Being the victim of sexual assault is absolutely not your fault - you didn’t deserve it, you shouldn’t have been subject to it, and it shouldn’t have happened. It is on you to proactively deal with the Trina you’ve faced, so that you can avoid damaging yourself and others in the future however.   Chin up, March on, grab that help.	I might have expanded but you can totally get there from moral relativism. As there's no meaning or truth one might as well go for allowing people to do what they want (seek pleasure and avoid pain) which leads to utilitarianism. It's a ""good"" by default, if nothing else is true then it's the position to adopt. That's what I mean by this.	0.837

Now regarding the crime gene therapy it depends on how widespread it is.

Then why on earth would you not keep the 1% away from your neighborhood. It sucks for the 1% that are not actually violent. This is where nuances like ""are they not taking the gene therapy out of some anti-vax stance or is it because they are somehow incompatible with it?"" come into play.

Also, definitely don't say the n-word because Clarence Thomas thinks it's okay, or whatever.

Great answer	Sponsorship views have a level of trust implied within it. A youtuber is leveraging a viewer's personal investment in them and their content to encourage them to buy things. That level of trust can be abused if the youtuber isn't doing this in good faith or is presenting a product that is fake, scammy, or straight up illegal, such as gambling or unproven and untested products. This means that it's very easy for youtubers to create hype or drive people to buying things or investing in things that are straight up falsehoods and could cost them a lot of money - see the multitude of crypto scams.	0.808
Great answer	<p>How are companies that make very well liked videos affected? They still can go viral. People still can see that a shitload of people like their videos.

Your further arguments are invalid because your definition upon which the argument is based is faulty.

Instagram? Yeah, you’re right. But there’s a large literature on video games showing that skills learned there (from reaction time to identifying and countering the effects of cognitive bias in your own thought) actually transfer to other areas. In other words, skills you learn in video games you actually learn to use 1. in other contexts, 2. a long time away 3. in areas that aren’t obviously the same problem. (Those three are the three respects in which transfer is typically considered.) This might surprise you, but video games are the only “training mechanism” (as it were) that show such robust transfer. (If you’re thinking school, nope! Bryan Caplan, The Case Against Education, summarizes the literature well; in short, classroom learning leaves the classroom only if it’s obviously related to a problem you’re dealing with. Classrooms can teach you to read and write, but they don’t teach “critical thinking skills.”) </p>	0.805

LMAO sick burn.	<p>To take one illustrative example, a HAES-based program that emphasized intuitive eating and size acceptance was evaluated against a dieting-based weight-loss program with a sample of 30- to 45-year-old women classified as overweight or obese [19, 127]. Participants within each program received six months of weekly group interventions followed by six months of monthly aftercare group support. Findings yielded more positive results for the HAES-based program over the 1-year [127] and 2-year [19] follow-ups. Specifically, the HAES group decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol), triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure at the 2-year follow-up and sustained improvements from the 1-year to 2-year follow-ups. Whereas the dieting group lost weight and showed initial improvements on many variables at the 1-year follow up, they had regained weight and did not sustain improvement at the 2-year follow- up [19]. The HAES group decreased eating restraint, physical hunger rating, disinhibited eating, drive for thinness, bulimic symptomatology, body dissatisfaction, poor interoceptive awareness, depression, and body image avoidance and increased self-esteem at both 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Correspondingly, participants in the dieting-based program only reduced disinhibited eating but reported decreased self-esteem [19]. Furthermore, attrition was higher in the diet group (41%) compared to the HAES group (8%) [19, 127]. These findings suggest that HAES-based interventions demonstrate better adherence to practices that promote physical health and psychological well-being than dieting-based interventions, and these effects can be sustained over time.</p>	0.734

Change my view? A hero?

It may not be true in all cases, but I'd say a significant number of times the presumption of potential offspring plays a **subconscious** role in the development of a heterosexual relationship. When my wife and I were struggling to conceive, and the thought it would never work set in, I had this deep-seated automatic depression set in. We eventually succeeded and it went away immediately. I don't think people are actively saying “I could never date someone who was infertile!” — rather that there is a strong biological factor at play. And while it's true that usually those subjects are left until later (or that the infertility is unknown at the time), it's rare enough that most people feel comfortable rolling the dice; whereas it's immediately a given for trans women.	0.869

Change my view? A hero? Just a greedy self-centered capitalist who loves to take credit for others creations	We know that pheromones play a role. And there's sexual attraction, emotional attraction, intellectual attraction. There are people I am platonically intimate with, who I am attracted to, who I would never hook up with (I'm married, but if I were single, I mean). We also tend to seek out partners who will allow us to recreate our childhood experience of what a relationship looks like... for better or for worse. But that's more long-term partners. There's plenty of people I have thought to be sexually attractive that I would never ever date.	0.847
Change my view? A hero? Just a greedy self-centered capitalist who loves to take credit for others creations	<p>All of this is simply based on initial senses that drastically altered how I viewed someone as a sexual partner but let&#39;s go beyond it. I&#39;ve been friends with people I wasn&#39;t sexually attracted to but are attractive but there wasn&#39;t a spark until there was. I once saw my friend deal with his niece and nephew and how he interacted with them and it was this total different side of him I&#39;d never seen. He was caring, kind, loving, and just ugh yes. It made me rethink how I thought of him seeing him and I began to think about him sexually. The opposite has also happened where a guy I initially thought was sexually attractive but after getting to know him I found out he was extremely misogynistic and racist. The sexual attraction was replaced by disgust. </p>	0.847
Change my view? A hero? Just a greedy self-centered capitalist who loves to take credit for others creations	<p>I agree that all marriages have difficulties, and many of them are worth overcoming to be with someone you love and want to spend the rest of your life with. I will say that my title might not be as reflective of my argument. I really meant hatred between a partner and an in-law, not just general faults/disagreements. No one is going to get along all the time.</p>	0.845

We all laugh at humorous, offensive commentary that exposes social absurdities about the forbidden.  That shit is timeless and valid.  It&#39;s human.  There is real value there.  So rather than saying audiences don&#39;t find it funny, it would be more honest to say that society is much more discriminating in what meets the criteria that makes offensive humor worthwhile and acceptable.  It&#39;s a higher standard that brings about better humor for everyone, and that is a good thing.  Gone are the days of my youth where stupid, gratuitous bigotry was paraded around as funny.

This isn’t a view you should want changed, the man is a MONSTER who told his wife to “not be so emotional” after their infant son DIED	People like to compare the Capitol to the BLM riots, but they literally have been treated the same.

This isn’t a view you should want changed, the man is a MONSTER who told his wife to “not be so emotional” after their infant son DIED	Meanwhile, many democratic leaders have been pretty moderate, and at least anecdotally, activists I know we're some of the loudest voices trying to deescalate and keep things peaceful, because in a lot of ways they had the most to lose when the protests become violent. So I guess I reject your premise that ""activists"" in general ""allow"" rioting / violence / property damage. There are a lot of different people out there with different agendas, but in my experience the people who were most genuinely upset by violence were activists themselves, whereas the Fox news watching ""can you believe what's happening to Seattle"" crowd basically have no idea what's going on and their concern feels more politically motivated than genuine."	0.884

And so in tates where you can carry weapons in public, which is 43 of them, people went out to protect businesses and homes and property, they thought they were doing a moral thing.

Not only that, but a practically treasonous rebellion against the foundations of democracy - undeniably, this is a strategy used by dictators worldwide.</p>	0.868

The reason his taxes are so high this year is because he is dumping stock like a mad man while his company is so grossly overvalued.

No billionaire is a hero	We can only speculate as to which forms of life specifically live on to become 'extraterrestrial' species that result in a First Contact. After that, we can only further speculate from our own socio-cultural pathways on how common civilization and technology may be that results in extra-planetary travel, and the relative timeline it may take to get there. Once we are in the place of 'technology' and 'culture' then the paths get really complicated very quickly - there's no reason to think that modern Human tech/culture should be specifically common. And of course, at the time of a First Contact we may lack the technology to understand their forms of communication or their specific evolutionary pathway.	0.815

Love or hate him I don't know why people are so fixated on him. He's just another guy doing some shit.	<p>I&#39;d argue short selling as a tool is fine, but the current lack of controls/consequences and the way it can be used to bring down otherwise solvent businesses in a short-term crunch by money managers with ridiculous pools of cash and financing is broken and should be fixed. The problem is that short selling is a free market method of reducing overvaluation, whereas proper regulation and oversight is probably a better if bureaucratic tool. Sadly, I&#39;m not sure if this is even politically feasible, and it&#39;s likely any government regulator won&#39;t be given enough power/resources/funding and it may only be able to clean up the messes after the fact. Another way would be perfect and timely information given to everyone, but this is even less likely. All of this is what allows for naked short selling, which is the main problem. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re shorting a huge amount of stock, but that they don&#39;t have the stock to short in the first place.</p>	0.887

|>>|he exploits the vulnerability of young people by adopting "meme culture",  These are the same people hes manipulated into thinking hes doing more than abs fk all lol	<p>Well, I&#39;m just saying that this happens currently because the lobbyist are allowed to legally pour money to the elected officials&#39; campaigns. My proposed system would eliminate that stream as there would be no campaigning. Sure, some illegal bribery would still happen just like it happens in the current system, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s anywhere near as corrupting as the legal bribery as it&#39;s far more dangerous to both the briber and the person being bribed. By taking bribes, you&#39;d potentially endanger your future life. </p>	0.868

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/changemyview) if you have any questions or concerns.*	<p>Video games have a generally negative impact upon people&#39;s health and well-being. People spend large amounts of time performing a sedentary activity largely by themselves. Even those games which are multiplayer and have player interaction do really have social elements; I don&#39;t talk to the opposing players in Fortnite. Beyond the health risks of sitting around for hours a day doing nothing, there are a host of mental problems. Players aren&#39;t going outside and seeing any nature (associated with good mental health), forming and reinforcing important social bonds with friends and family (associated with good mental health), or engaging in activities the person finds personally meaningful and fulfilling, such as career goals and community programs. If video games didn&#39;t distract these people, their boredom would drive them to do these things. Because they don&#39;t do these things, the person is at an increased risk of depression, which may cause them to turn to drug abuse or to even commit suicide after they spiral from their depression and lack of meaningful living. This, along with the loss of health from the unhealthy lifestyle of sitting around all day, makes playing video games responsible for more deaths. If video games didn&#39;t exist, there would be less physical and mental health complications, thus saving lives.</p>	0.857

He’s a piece of shit	Imagine a world in which all women have the male sex (e.g. broad shoulders, penis, flat chest) and all men have the female sex. Everything else is identical. Would there be women (in a similar position to you) who identify as women, were born with the ""female"" sex (= a penis), but feel dysphoria to have the male sex (but still want to be a woman)? In order to answer that, let's reverse it to how things are today: Are there people who identify fully as male and want to express themselves in a fully masculine way, while experiencing physical dysphoria and want to have a vagina? I've never heard of such a person in my life. I'm sure they exist, but they are much, much, much rarer than trans people. Sure, you might find AMAB enbies who want a vaginoplasty but tend to dress in a masc way, but male-identified? There are tons of people who want to swap sexes for a day to see what it's like, some might even seriously wish they had the opposite genitalia, but to the point of genital dysphoria?	0.875

He’s a piece of shit	If the latter, how would you come to terms with the fact that genitals are unknown until they've been disclosed, either verbally or visually? Every heterosexual man (and frankly, every person with every sexuality other than asexuality or pansexuality) I've ever heard talk about attraction bases it on gender presentation, confirming sexual attraction before the genitals are known. Trans men, if they've undergone transition, look like cis men and therefore would not be on the sexual radar of a heterosexual man looking for a partner."	0.818

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”.

No one rationally likes or respects Elon Musk. People irrationally do, but they can’t really explain why. The man has little to no accomplishments himself except being born in to money and hiring other people to make him more money.   He’s not a engineer, has invented nothing himself, and none of his companies or idea are even particularly groundbreaking or stuff that hasn’t been thought of before. Hell even with spaceX which most people think of as his most revolutionary idea Bezos’s BlueOrigin was founded 2 years earlier. All of his prestige and status (and frankly the value of his companies in the first place) is based on the cult of personality and stan culture.  In stan culture, stans often don’t even see the celebrity as a real person, but more just a representation of their inter-most fantasies of the type of life they wish they could live.  He is basically just a real life nerd fantasy of “if I had money I would start building rockets and other cool shit”.

So if you actually want to push against gender binarism and not just carve out a space for yourself, using they/them doesn't work that well.	0.879

I don't think that it's a uncommon human behavior in general I've probably done it more than I should have sometimes people know and sometimes they just don't realize.

It’s always so funny when someone takes the most productive human on the planet and tries to poke holes in them. What an ugly side of human nature.	And that's a big one.

That is by far the simplest and most convincing explanation. US schools are typically much better funded than their European counterparts, so money is not the answer.

Not CYV - Musk is human garbage. You’re right.	Some people ride this thought train to the end and they come to the conclusion that the way to fix this is to restore women to their ""place"". But that's evil and probably not possible since you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Another option is to consider that the masculine/feminine dichotomy was fucking stupid in the first place. Strength, loyalty, hard work, kindness, and leadership are *human* virtues.  Nurturing, grace, diplomacy, emotional intelligence, and communication skills are *human* virtues. Being a good father, partner, husband means chopping the (metaphorical) wood, carrying the water, kissing the boo-boos, and making the dinner. It's a big, complicated world and everyone needs to be able to do the work now. Getting men to reclaim virtues seen as feminine isn't a bad thing, it is reclaiming space to be a fully articulated human. Trying to restrict men to the masculine role is what's causing all the bullshit problems you identify. Being afraid to embody the entire human spectrum, to be competitive and loving, to be respectful and sexual, to care for your home and to kill it at work, is what is fucking everyone up. Trying to avoid being ""feminine"" just pushes men onto an ever-dissolving iceberg of safely masculine ideals and gives them a narrower and narrower range of ways to be. I don't want men to be feminine, I want men to be human.	0.829

I agree with you OP, I think putting so much emphasis on gender identity which is based around sex stereotypes just reinforces the stereotypes, because instead of someone saying “I have short hair, I wear “masculine clothing”, I don’t like makeup etc, but I’m still a woman and this has no bearing on my womanhood” people are saying “I’m not a woman because I don’t follow (insert gender stereotypes attached to women)”. It seems like a very backwards way of trying to abolish gender stereotypes and is just reinforcing them. I understand why people do it, because the world we live in is still very gendered and people ultimately just want to fit in to a group so to speak, but I don’t think it’s a good solution to the problem. The better solution would be to just defy gender stereotypes while still embracing your gender, not changing your gender so you better fit the stereotypes attached to it.	They do but they're a minority.	0.839

if someone called me a cracker id laugh in their face.  this is so dumb.  if you’re offended by “cracker” you’re probably a racist.	I asked if there was more to it because my claim was that scientists were not being fired or blackballed for presenting valid but controversial study results; and the actions of a (student?) are irrelevant to that claim. I’m sure it was a harrowing experience, and I’m not taking away from it sofar as his trauma is concerned, only whether or not it constitutes systemic/institutional “silencing” of scientists who oppose “the narrative”"	0.848

I think Weinstein has a right to his views, and to say them in public. I don’t think he has a right to psychologically hack algorithm-driven social media feeds. I do share worries about the reach of tech companies, but I also worry about them not taking any responsibility for spreading misinformation. I worry about the paradox here, where “free speech” is both a strength and an Achilles heel in a liberal democracy, because really bad ideas can cause a lot of harm before flaming out - but who is to decide what is a really bad idea?

'Crackers' were Scottish people who settled down in the Southeast United States. They were seen as poor and low class, even as someone a black slave could look down on.  'Cracker' is a racist slur.	Infections are the most philosophical illness. Our bodies are host to billions of organisms. Some coexisting, living off our detritus and plucking back some of our entropy that way. Many, the ones we call pathogens, have the capacity to evade our front line of defense and make us sick. Mostly we fight these off, but sometimes we don't. There are chemicals which kill these, but not us. They might harm us, and they certainly harm the other organisms on our body, but on balance, if we kill them (by the immune system or antibiotics) we survive.	0.867

My other main issue with the prevailing narrative is the vaccine itself.  It is largely being advertised as an effective cure to this pandemic, which is just false.  The virus has animal hosts, and vaccinated people can still transmit the virus.  It will mutate and continue to forever, regardless of which percentage of people are vaccinated.  They also believe that a variant soon will emerge where the vaccine is ineffective.  They've convinced people that the unvaxcinated are the problem, when the reality is that nothing can stop this virus from mutating.  I'm also upset that instead of focusing on treatments, we throw all of our eggs into the vaccine basket, and shit on people who are experimenting with potential treatment solutions.  You likely don't find them credible, but America's Frontline doctors will prescribe Hydroxy and Ivertecimn, and they are certified Dr's, not fox news pundits.  They may be in the minority, but they are qualified experts with a difference of opinion.	0.842

'Crackers' were Scottish people who settled down in the Southeast United States. They were seen as poor and low class, even as someone a black slave could look down on.  'Cracker' is a racist slur.	No, it's not irrelevant at all. It is quite literally the basis for herd immunity. If a virus can not spread to new hosts, it will eventually cease to exist. No new hosts = no production = eventual extinction. Sure, a virus can mutate within a single host. This is common sense. It's also common sense that the liklihood of a more dangerous variant developing is greater if you have tens of thousands of hosts rather than a handful. That is why not getting vaccinated contributes to this issue. You are simply providing another opportunity for more variants to develop.	0.836

The very reason why sex workers are stigmatised in the first place is because going to see a sex worker is considered something inherently wrong.</p>	0.868
All you had to do is not be racist against white people, but it was too much to ask.  Thanks for proving my point though.

Me being trans is not something that a random person needs to know. Is it something that I want someone I'm going to have sex with know? Yes, because some people are assholes who freak out violently at the thought that I once had a penis. Best get that out of the way in a lower stakes environment than the bedroom."	0.866

The people I&#39;ve met who feel this way are usually not very good producers, but decent at an instrument, and they are impatient/frustrated with learning something hard, so they instead tell themselves it&#39;s below them, it&#39;s too easy, etc., to avoid confronting their own inadequacies.

Your response has nothing to do with anything I said.  Don’t respond again until you learn how to read	So the argument then is that ""they"" is too broad - that's why some people want another pronoun. They feel that ""they"", having often been used specifically for unknown gender-identities or to explicitly strip someone of it, doesn't feel right, because those people do have a gender-identity, it's not unknown. And they don't want to feel like they get stripped of their alternate gender-identity. So they use a neo-pronoun. Therefore, there could be a need for a fourth pronoun that's more non-binary in nature, rather than being genderless.	0.806
Your response has nothing to do with anything I said.

The key point here is that government isn't mandating an outright ban on servicing customers, but that *businesses* do that part instead. Even if it won't stop morons from blaming government violating ""muh rights durr"", it's something. Especially worth noting is that this results in **queue times** just for the sake of checking vaccination status, which is going to frustrate everybody. **Collective punishment** is, straight up, surprisingly effective.

No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.	Looking through FWR, it appears that most of the content of the sub is made up of white people inventing racial scenarios or using casuistry to feed a persecution complex.

No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.	This relates to your point 1.  This individual racism idea is useful for white people's self esteem because it's simultaneously concrete (it's about identifying specific people for blame) and completely vague (no one has exactly the same idea for precisely what counts as racist and what doesn't).  In combination, this makes it very very easy for any given white person to absolve themselves... because absolving themselves is the entire reason why most white people would ever talk about racism in the first place.	0.858
No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.	Of course I'm going to assume you're white when you hop on my comment spouting this ridiculous nonsense about white people being subject to oppression. People getting canceled for doing racist and sexist shit isn't oppression, it's just consequences. Never insinuated that you were a man at all though, but I'm going to assume you are since you brought it up.	0.853
No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.	Regardless, that's beside the point. The concern I hear the most of these days isn't about *historical* oppression of white people, the concern is that the pendulum has swung and white people are *currently* being discriminated against. To be more verbose: the culture of ""Diversity and Inclusion"" is being used to exclude white people (specifically cisgender, straight, white men) from education, the workforce, and/or career development. I can elaborate if you'd like, but nothing in your original post touches on this and, to be frank, a lot of people on Reddit think historical oppression is required for racism to exist so... if you're one of those people we're not gonna get anywhere."	0.853
No, because black coffee is a description...so you're saying "you filthy black bastard" shouldn't be racist? Piss off troll.	Cracker is used as a pejorative for white people. It's a disrespectful term, despite however the term originated or how much worse other racist pejoratives are. When I was a teen, me and my friends would casually thrown around the word cracker at times, but it was a different story if someone called us wetback/spic/taco/etc. Only when I got older did I realize that it was just as disrespectful to individuals to use the term ""cracker."" When you become more mature with adulthood you understand that mutual respect is everything. I don't expect anyone to put up with blatant, unnecessary disrespect, I don't care if you're white, black, Hispanic or Asian. To get respect you have to	0.849

You're both retarded af	If people are justified in being racist against ""oppressors"", then this will inevitably include white people - not white people as a whole, but individual white people. And, low and behold, these are the people who make up white supremacists - people who are or feel like victims. It's better to talk about how racism is always wrong, than trying to justify it. Because if we justify racism some of the time, then white supremacists are at least partially right when they say ""racism is justified sometimes"" - which is a problem.	0.852

It is a slur...but most white people don't get butthurt when people make slurs towards them. I hear black people say "cracker" all the time with what sounds like an intent to disparage.

It's largely the latter, since I don't believe in the abolition of the state.

I get tense whenever I first meet a Gen Z kid because of exactly this.	Their wants are less important than fair play.

Disagree	<p>Calling a white person a cracker wouldn&#39;t be systemically racist because the system isn&#39;t set up to disadvantage white people, thus the action isn&#39;t upholding any systemic disadvantage.

…..	As someone else has pointed out, an African immigrant living in America isn't likely to even *want* to refer to themselves as African-American, because ""African"" is a broader category than the sort of cultural and ethnic identities people usually take on: they'd be Nigerian-Americans, or Ethiopian-Americans, or so on. A slave-descended black person in the States *can't* refer to themselves as anything more specific than ""African"" because they literally have no idea where in Africa their ancestors are from."	0.887
…..	<p>African-American is the term for descendants of slaves who cannot trace their ancestry back to a specific tribal group. Why does this concept seem so hard for you to understand?

found the stay at home mom, lol	Unfortunately, the current truth is that the country is simply genuinely divided. Even people who believe in representation of a minority don't change their voting patterns based on whether their party filibusters when they're in the majority. RCV will not likely result in 3rd party candidates winning; the moderating effect it would have is for more mainstream members of the two big parties to not have to worry about getting primaried out by more extreme voices. This is not a sufficient change to change the dynamics of filibustering since politicians still have the exact same incentives to filibuster."	0.899
found the stay at home mom, lol	My advice is just live your life and not worry about things that likely rarely happen anyhow. Americans aren't going out of their way to seek you out and tell you about where you live when most haven't been there anyway. That's just fact.

The heart of the ceremony was left out, and what remained - the motions, without meaning - grew rigid with time. The metaphors remained, but without the deeper subjective insights to help interpret them. Eventually all was left were the elder&#39;s words, a mythology that grew more dogmatic with each following generation. The only reality that exist is the one we have experienced and can imagine. As our reality is based upon the limitations of our perception of the world, so too are the teachings limited.</p>	0.791

https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/305/304/a37.jpg\_large	For men being a friend means clear boundaries of how we communicate. To what extend it's acceptable to be emotionally invested in the relationship, or interested in the person. To what extent it is acceptable to reveal emotions or weakness, etc... For women, this distinction is widely different. So from a men's point of view, you have women who do all the things only girlfriends do, such as being attentive, emotionally invested, going through their problems, etc... but there aren't girlfriends. Which leads men to believe they are probably interested in being one.	0.899

However when I think of why I wouldn’t like to be called a man it’s mostly because it would be used as an insult. I.e. if someone would call me by he/him pronouns that would insinuate to me I have very broad shoulders/harsh face features and I wouldn’t like that as that would clash with the female gender roles im to some degree expected to perform in order to look beautiful to men etc. This has, however, nothing to do with any innate ‘felt’ gender.	0.895

https://t.me/joinchat/pIcl8dQlPzMyOGY0	As a secondary usage, it can be more polite in certain settings. There are certain people who just don't respond well to being called racist.

While I generally don't have a problem using the word racist, if I know that someone will overreact to the accusation, problematic can function as a synonym.	0.893
https://t.me/joinchat/pIcl8dQlPzMyOGY0	So the idea that you could look at a symbol and say ""that's not racist, that's not a problem"" doesn't really work.

Perhaps my beliefs are accurate or missing a bit of key info or an utter joke but if we want to determine good ideas from bad ones we must talk of these ideas. I also don't like the way how you had specified black women specifically in your argument of women being ousted from competing because of testosterone differences. The competitions also exclude those born without a vagina to ensure fairness between the players and I believe I already made clear that the idea that testosterone alone determines one's athletic ability is stupid and shouldn't be interfered with if it's all biological woman but I don't believe trans women should be put up against biological women.

You play Nintendo. Grownup kid. Suck my dick	2. Even if there was court decision forcing sex, which I doubt, it would not be ""women forced to have sex"", but ""worker forced to do its job in a non-discriminating way"". Women are not forced to become sex workers, and they know when starting that they will have ugly, stupid and not sexy clients. If you're ready for the job knowing the risks, I see no reason to accept racism. I totally accept biological impossibility to do the job in certain circumstances (such as you would not punish a 1:50m high worker for not being able to put heavy stuff on a plank 2:20m high even if other workers do it without problem), but being racist is not a biological condition.	0.851

Parents have to schedule their time around their kids, you can&#39;t go to work at 7:00 instead of 8 if your 7 year old&#39;s school doesn&#39;t start until 7:45. The bread delivery truck can&#39;t start its deliveries an hour later when the grocery stores and restaurants they serve are opening at the same time.  And almost no one decides when they go to work, their bosses do - and most CEOs and managers aren&#39;t going to through the cost and trouble of changing when work starts just to make their employee&#39;s lives easier, to begin with.</p>	0.856

God you are boring.	The simple fact is that when kids go to school, they do so for many hours at a time and the job of the stay-at-home-mom is much simpler. Obviously that isn't true during a pandemic when distance learning challenges every parent. But I remember being in high school especially from 8 in the morning to 10 at night sometimes. What exactly would a stay at home mother would be doing then? I had very little supervision growing up, in fact. My mother fed me and made sure I had the money to be clothed and that there was always electricity and shelter. A typical suburban middle class upbringing. But as soon as I learned to drive at 15 years old, I was a lot more independent. The last time my mother helped me with schoolwork, I was 9 and was learning my multiplication tables. She never helped me with a single assignment since then. I did every single reading assigned to me in junior high school, elementary school, and high school. I was responsible for my own schoolwork.

You're doing to politicial thing. You believe it's easier to get rid of something because you say it's just a figment of social agreements.

Rather, they *don't want to do it*, because they know it could very well result in them having less sex overall.  So your view here (no matter what example you're talking about) needs to acknowledge that a lot of the confusion people purport to have about shifting moral norms is either *feigned* or *obstinate complaining*.  They get it.  They just don't wanna DO it, because it'll cramp their style somehow, or because they have severe cognitive dissonance about all the times they've already violated whatever rule we're talking about.	0.886

But if we got rid of ""gender"" altogether, how would we talk about the very real but arbitrary ways that society would continue to divide and socialize people based on a) born sex and b) conformity to those expectations?

If they’re not sympathetic to your situation and to your best efforts, they’re just dicks, tbh.

The fact that male erotica and prostitution are more popular among gay men than among women (despite the fact that there are far more heterosexual women than gay men) suggests otherwise.Women's erotica and porn  - erotic novels, series about relationships, etc.	I have nothing against anyone who fucks around and gets pregnant and then takes on the responsibility and cares for their kids. In fact, my mother has 2 sons from 2 dads and now is a single mother with 2 adult sons. I am fortunate and thankful that she decided to birth us. Even when she did not really wanted kids in the first place and while she was in the last year of her university studies.

You have many kids because not all of the would survive childhood. They would take care of the house because someone needed to take care of the children while the man tended to the farm and harvested the crops. Your view of “more strict and unfair rules on woman” is completely subjective and can even be argued the other way around!  A woman can stay inside and only has to cook and keep the children busy and healthy while the man toils in the fields doing backbreaking labor under the sun all day just to eat and go to bed, having no time for himself but just work all day?

I feel for you	<p>The romantic idea of rewarding &quot;original&quot; creators is deeply misguided because most creators are benefiting from a massive history of progress of ideas they aren&#39;t personally responsible for and the creation is basically always a group effort.

Many inventors and scientists and so on had &quot;aha&quot; moments only through many discussions with people doing the same kind of work and then a collective effort is all credited to a single individual when the idea is often kind of floating around in an intellectual community and would have come about by someone else if not this person - which is why so many historical examples of two different people not in contact with eachother arriving at inventions or discoveries at so close a time we aren&#39;t always sure who even got there first. </p>	0.792

Racism, sexism, homophobia, etc - these things are all highly contextual.

You have to actually look at what people are complaining about - dig into the reasons *why* people are upset.

I used a simple historical example since you were having such a hard time wrapping your brain around the concept of racism, that I was doing my best to draw it out in crayon for you. There's plenty of modern examples, like for instance the legacy of segregation, which is tied to long-standing poverty and crime in predominantly black neighborhoods and cities. Unless you believe that black people are inherently more criminally minded than white people, then it's pretty obvious that this is a result of segregation, followed by continual efforts to undermine desegregation efforts like desegregation bussing and prevent mobility and investment in inner city communities. That is still being felt today and undoing that legacy matters if we want to live in a country where justice gets served and there aren't barriers for some people based on the color of their skin. Painting that as people asking for special treatment is disgusting and you should be embarrassed.	0.896

There's really nothing that matters with the concepts outside of the person who wants to put value in these things, there's no intrinsic value, therefore it's generally pointless.

Strongly correlated, aaaannnddd where's the causation? Cause if you're using the studies you replied with to another commenter, they quite succinctly shut down that Argument from Ignorance fallacy.

And if you were either A) a good faith debater, or B) had any fucking reasoning and understanding skills, you'd know that correlation =/= causation, that they are completely different things, and that they aren't mutually exclusive.

Your solution is to have a forum dedicated to hating white people and make fun of them? That makes no sense. If anything, seems like a good way to make whites resent other races."	0.922

I 100% agree	Regardless, none of this goes to the original question of vaccine approval, or even *really* goes to the subsequent issue of vaccine effectiveness (since, again, current evidence suggests they are effective against variants).
