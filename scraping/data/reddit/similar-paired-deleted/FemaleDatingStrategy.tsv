I like how he confirms that men lack common sense and social skills by telling them how to do the absolute obvious when you are meeting someone via social media.  Male IQ is in hell LMAO.	This is frightening but true.  I have an ex friend like this and every now and again I tip toe around the idea of us being friends again but your comment solidified the reason why that’ll never happen.  It’s sad because we’re supposed to be able to trust one another (re: sisterhood) but at the end of the day, we have to protect ourselves and keep an eye out for red flags within our inner circles too.	0.847

As a gen Xer, I feel almost obligated to give this show a try. While there are moments of SATC-like satire, it's pretty cringey. Charlotte and Carrie are sooooo uptight and conservative. I couldn't stand Carrie's behavior following the sex scene. In general, she seems very needy which I get after losing her partner unexpectedly, but it's almost pathological her need not to be alone. Her friends just seem able to drop their lives for her and then she starts screeching at Miranda cuz of HER insecurities.   I digress. Personally, I found this sex scene hot. The chemistry was excellent and Sara/Che was and is 🔥. (I ignored Miranda and inserted myself.) I swerve hetero but good lawd. The light sheen of sweat on Che's forehead after their afternoon delite made me warm. I could not care less what any man might think of that scene. I give it four out four paws up.	0.846

Imagine the frothing rage this post has incited in lurking scrotes. And yet they know it's absolutely true for 'The One'. Meanwhile, they think they're entitled to a mommy bang maid until they find her. And "She Better by God bring something to the table!" When a man asks you what you bring to the table, he already has contempt for you.	0.841
I like how he confirms that men lack common sense and social skills by telling them how to do the absolute obvious when you are meeting someone via social media.  Male IQ is in hell LMAO.	WOW what a good insight here..I have a ‘pickme’ frenemy who I can’t trust around men (she always feels the need to be competitive, is super insecure etc etc), and this is further reason not to trust her in general. The need for male validation bleeds into everything..	0.836

In my experience they're obsessed with what you "do" ("bring yo the table" and simultaneously try to detail it. So you suck for not being more successful but he sure as hell won't let you get there.	0.834
Are you sure	Yessss…this is why men are scared. I have my own home and I’m growing my business, so there’s very little a man provide for me at this point. He’s going to have to be pretty special to disrupt the peace of my current life.	0.778
Are you sure	Why do you think it's better to make it seem like you're less wealthy than you really are? I personally think the same. I noticed that my superiors at work treat my coworkers with financial problems differently. Like if they could do anything they want with them, because they assume those people really need the job.	0.761
Are you sure	Unless they have hooked up with a rich guy, they generally have low incomes.  Therefore the only pleasures they can afford are simple pleasures, not million dollars homes like this scrote is squatting in!	0.76
Are you sure	She needs to kick this sponging loser out yesterday. He feels he is entitled to live with her so he can save for himself, which does not benefit her in any way. Meanwhile, he is living under her roof, enjoying her elevated lifestyle, and taking far more than he is giving. Plus, he feels he can have an opinion about how she spends HER OWN money? Nope, nope, nope. She is better off without him, and needs to find a man on her own level. She can pay for the "services" and "repairs" he thinks he is doing so well, and still come out ahead.	0.755
Are you sure	I agree strongly with all of this!! OP, I think you’ve spent enough time being financially abused that your conceptual norms have been screwed with. At least in the US, which I’m guessing you are, it would be SO bizarre for someone you were just getting to know to pry into really anything about your finances. “I own my home” can mean anything from living paycheck to paycheck with the mortgage, to having it completely paid off. Being financially stable is a badass accomplishment… but also not anyone’s business but yours.  Anyone you might date has absolutely no business knowing about your savings or financial setup overall until you were perhaps discussing getting engaged, I’d say. There’s so much vetting you would do along the way, and if someone starts to try to pry into your private information, that’s a flag.  Even if I’m bragging a little with close long-term friends, I’m only going to say things like “yeah, my retirement savings are on track, that’s pretty cool” or “I’m paying some extra principal on my mortgage, happy about that”.	0.745

That's just rape and pedophilia depending on where your at	Thank you for this post! I will repeat myself- we should not look at each other as competition, that does not benefit us. Tearing a woman down does not add value to you. Have each other’s back. I had a friend who would tell my most personal problems to her boyfriend (whom I didn’t like at all). I cut her off and never looked back. What’s the circle of this? She tells him, he tells his bros, his bros spread it to their bros, and everyone ends up knowing. Suddenly, you’re vulnerable to strangers who can be real predators.	0.824

Since all of us were single, and she was only friends with coupled women, she was probably mateguarding.	0.821

A walk is not a date, I agree. But I'm not taking a girl on a date before I've seen her in real life. The walk is because all of your makeup, filters, slim waist pants, angles and what not that make girls that aren't hot look hot in pictures. Among my friends, anyone who is "worth dating" wouldn't take a random girl from a dating app straight to a fancy restaurant. Really, I advice you to reconsider this position and accept that a quality guy who wants to take you on a date will want to see you IRL first. Otherwise, you should expect to be dating below your own standard.	My last ex clearly exhibited your #1 and #4 issues. Also some covert #3 whenever he was expected to do something, like \*gasp\* being a parent to our daughter. I'm not sure about #2, but he sure partook in their (shitty) investments - or at least followed their example.  However, he grew up as the (single) child of married parents. And, yes, the parents were married until death parted them.  I think these issues are much more prominent in families with a narc mother, where everything has to be just about herself. In other words: A LVW and (most likely) pickme (for all the attention and validation). It's also more common in only sons than in sons with brothers, albeit the latter is not unheard of. With the man being one of several brothers with a narc mom, it's most often the "golden child" that gets the special mommy treatment, as far as my anecdotal evidence shows.	0.887

I used to work under the supervision of a woman who was an attachment therapist, and she said when you hate a parent, you hate part of yourself. Her goal was to get people to feel neutral towards parents they hated. It really messes with your self concept and self esteem if a parent leaves, **especially** if it’s the same-sex parent. It’s a rejection on the deepest level. Women who become mothers don’t tend to leave, but men who become fathers do so men are almost always the ones dealing with these issues.	0.867

My ex had a deadbeat dad who popped up once in a blue moon (he was a community dick that had a whole other family, classy) and was raised by his mom. Guess who hated his mom and idolized his cheating scrote dad? Guess who grew up to treat women *the exact same way?*  I don't know why people are taking this personally and raging at you in the comments, OP. We all know that 99% of men lack introspection and while a woman can come from a broken home and do the inner work to overcome childhood wounds, *the vast majority of men are never going to bother.* They'll treat women like garbage because they've learned that a man can be a cheating, absent, deadbeat scrote and yet will still get showered with unconditional love by a pickme.	0.861

I’ve mentioned a few times about my exes best friend constantly abusing his gf saying nobody else would want her as a single mother in her 30s. He’s terribly abusive to her psychologically and emotionally - talks to her like she is absolute dirt, as well as her child. And will then post on social media about how much he loves her. Sh runs to my ex (her partners best mate) for solace, but she doesn’t realise he’s just as bad - he just plays the part to get extra information that he feeds back to his mate. Even my ex talked about how he wanted to smash her in the face because of her music choices. And that she brings the abuse from his mate on herself because she’s “crazy” when she’s drunk.  I feel so bad. She has been mentally, emotionally and even now physically beaten down so much, with some occasions pops of what seems like love from him (intermittent reinforcement)… but he’s constantly hitting on other women, then gaslights her that he has to delete everything because she snoops and if she didn’t snoop then he wouldn’t need to delete everything…  I wish I could’ve told her she’s smart, and he IS a liar and a cheat, and there’s a reason she snoops -  because her gut knows. But she wouldn’t listen. She’s too downtrodden and invested and just hangs off everyone word that the group of guys say to her.  It’s really disgusting and honestly I do worry that she will end up dead also.	0.86

Just like the truth most m.en are hot garb.age. We all had to grow up and get over that, in spite of the fact that we all have fathers and brothers and other male relatives that we love. I’ve dated LV sons of single moms and LV sons of two parent homes and the difference is night and day. You’re right about the anger. There is a vitriol, a forcefulness that just doesn’t exist for other men. My first bf was crazy emeshed with his mother. His parents have been divorced since he was a little boy and his mom had him working to pay her mortgage as a teen! He started off sweet as pie to me. Getting me extravagant gifts, talking till dawn, scads of what seemed like emotional support. I think he wanted to be the ideal man his mom talked about. But years under her tutelage had taught him to be a master manipulator by 18. He began trying to isolate me, said horrible things about my parents and tried to convince me to cut them off, just because we had a normal parent child relationship where they paid the bills. He was straight emotionally abusive, encouraged by his mother, who hated me for taking her husband surrogate away. She was angry in the beginning when he treated me so well and she was thrilled when he tried to break my spirit. Literally once I went over at his invitation and he was in the kitchen with another girl, triangulating. I went on the porch to cry and his mother came outside and smiled at the sight of me weeping. Just stood there. I broke it off after that, realizing that whole dynamic was insane. But it wasn’t unique. I’ve seen it over and over. I used to think my mother was just being classist when she told me to date boys from intact homes, but I had to learn for myself. The rules are the rules. And yes, maybe there’s an exception to the rule, but that’s an exception. It’s rare. And people don’t like the rules because they seem skewed or classist, this-ist or that-ist. But this is your life, not a charity. You don’t owe men a chance and you don’t have to be equal opportunity. You do what’s right for you.	0.854

I reported you for blatantly ignoring the handbook.  Read the pickme garbage you just wrote.  And yes, those “nice family men” just want to fuck you.  Are you really naive or like right out of high school or something?  Talking about how bad women are for being 50 and wanting to gossip? Please.	I love this! There is another one called “10 traits of a high value man” whenever I get angry dms from men , they say things like “wow! Good luck dating a famous athlete/musician/ceo with that attitude” and I’m just sitting there like :🙄Thats.not.the.point. It is character that makes you hv.

Are you really naive or like right out of high school or something?  Talking about how bad women are for being 50 and wanting to gossip? Please.	I too was very attractive to narc-friends. They all were very similar- very very funny, and very very fun to hang out with. But, mean mean mean. Oddly, this didn’t extend to people I dated. I always went for the safe men. Lol, I needed some balance from the abuse. Looking back, my Mom had girlfriends who treated her like shit. She was such a sweet woman, I mean she literally would take the shirt off her back in a thunderstorm. And, those bitches took full advantage. As a child, I hated those women and could not figure out why my mom put up with it. Later, I discovered it was guilt. She was taught to value all relationships regardless of how she felt, and to forgive and forget;that her boundaries were selfish. She grew a spine out of nowhere and got rid of every last friend and did some leveling up. She also canned my Dad. She found like 2 solid friends that loved and admired her, as well as an awesome boyfriend. When she died, those mean bitches didn’t show their faces. Probably a good thing because I would have kicked them out…lol. So, I followed in my moms steps,leveled up, divorced my husband (he was LVM, but I wasn’t in love) and found a LVM that I’m crazy about. Today, I do not ignore red flags. If I get a feeling in my gut, I don’t question it bc my old body knows to run.	0.822

I left out the best part, he said this confidently in front of a group of my really beautiful and intelligent girlfriends expecting us to fawn at his sexual prowess like men would. But instead we all went “EWW THATS DISGUSTING “ and started making jokes about him. This man was so embarrassed, and never tried flirting with us again.

I've been waiting to talk about this season finale with someone who shares the same opinion. I am so shocked by everyone is happy that Lawrence and Issa are back together. They've been toxic from the beginning. I agree with all your sentiments. I really would've loved to see how Issa could have found love within herself and kept scaling her business. You don't always NEED a man. It's okay just being a woman in the world. That is enough.   I went back and forth with someone over how Lawrence is trash and it just appalls me how no one is seeing the signs. He's done nothing to even earn Issa's love all season. All they have done is play phone tag and at the end settle for one another saying "If you believe it will work, it will work". I'm tired. I'm tired of these messages being shown to black women about trusting in struggle love. Love isn't that hard.   Hell, Nate isn't all that either but at least he is self aware, supported Issa in her business ventures, and tried to open up to the possibility of healthy relationship but could see she was still stuck over Lawrence. I'm glad he got away from Issa and her toxic web.   Kelli is the star of the show. She really does need her own spinoff. I'd be hilarious and she'd be giving us that REALNESS.	0.804

It’s truly as if the avoidant are the best self-advocates (as masculine energy tends to be), and unilaterally decided on the hookup dynamic for all, with little protest from the other two groups whose interests are not well-represented in such a dynamic.  Any ideas on what we can do for a culture shift? My counter strategy is to reject casual encounters, have high standards, be single indefinitely, and build up other women or the rare man (who tend to be gay) discontent with hookups, to encourage them that they need not settle. And I put content on my social media that rejects the culture (in moderation, so it is not perceived as my entire online personality). But I’m not sure if there is more?	0.769

You’re a stupid woman	I appreciate you're trying to help people, but wow, this is a very aggressive post. It's not helpful, especially insulting me calling me a pickme and implying I don't have hobbies, friends or a job, this is very poor behaviour coming from a so-called 'coach.'  My strategy of having a phone call before a date is so that I can avoid going on a first date. It's worked well for me, I've avoided lots of dates with men after I had a phone call with them first and realised that I didn't want to date them. I'd much rather a longer phone call, rather than a short phone call and an in person date.  Someone recommended this sub to me. I used to be in this, but had left. Now I remember why. Good luck.	0.879
You’re a stupid woman	Even single pick mes can be dangerous as their need to get a man is above the friendship. But yes regardless we should just keep HV people around us and avoid pick mes at all cost.

You’re a stupid woman	There is no benefit to women when it comes to tiptoeing around men's feelings in a relationship when we are speaking about our needs. A HVM will take criticism thoughtfully, and change what you feel is an issue, because he values you and your feelings and wants you to be happy. A LVM will not.   Tell him ONCE, and tell him directly. For example: "What you did is unacceptable to me", and opposed to "I think what you did was unacceptable." Leave no room for arguments or gaslighting. Put his behaviour on him and his choices, not your perceptions of it. If he acts like a tantruming child or ignores you, then that is when you know you have a LVM on your hands, and it's time to exit his life.	0.871
You’re a stupid woman	While I like this sex strategy, I would’ve been out the door after a week of his behavior. At this point he’s not listening on purpose and will probably never make her orgasm.

Wow. She dodged a bullet 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into 😭 I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	>LVM would literally rather emotionally abuse you than make efforts to become better men.  Because they can't accept that they are the problem. You bringing up that they are indeed the problem, hurt their feelings/ego/whatever, and now they have to hurt you back because they don't know how to process their hurt feelings and turn into an infant who throws a spiteful tantrum to get even.  It doesn't even need to be outright criticism for you to see this in action. I told my ex (when we were still married at the time) that I didn't feel loved. That's it. I just made a factual statement of my own feelings. I didn't criticize him outright. I didn't even ask him for anything. I just stated my thoughts and feelings into one simple sentence: "I don't feel loved."  Well, that surely pissed him off internally. How could I, after 13 years together, not feel loved?! I must be crazy, right? Never for a moment did he sit and think about what I said and what it might mean to him as my husband. Nope. He just blamed outwardly and concluded that if I didn't feel loved after so many years together, that that was somehow my own fault. Ok. And then he did what all male logic would make him do. He did nothing. And made pretty damn sure he was going to continue to do nothing to change that unloved feeling I had. It's like when abusive parents say, "If you're going to cry, I'll give you something to cry about." It runs along that same mentality. *If you're going to feel nothing, I'll give you nothing to feel about.*	0.883
Wow. She dodged a bullet 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into 😭 I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	I've looked through your post history also. You seem very angry, and your comment comes across as very patronising, after I called you out on your aggressive behaviour towards me. You don't seem to be in a position to be mentoring anyone about anything right now. I suggest you take some time out and work on yourself and why you're so angry, before calling yourself a coach and potentially causing harm to the women you claim you are helping. It's great that FDS apparently for you, but there isn't a one size fits all for dating and improving your life. I personally could never find such aggression being in any way helpful. All the best.	0.875
Wow. She dodged a bullet 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into 😭 I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	It’s not that the Pick Me is less attractive is that she *feels* less attractive. For some women, them being beautiful isn’t enough, you have to be ugly, too. They aren’t satisfied unless all male focus is exclusively on them. And like I said men are about control. The attention they give and their obsession is rarely just about attraction, it’s about who they feel is outside their influence. If you’re an FDS women, you’re actually going to attract that obsession and jealousy because they’re going to want to bring you down, and the pick me, not caring that this kind of “attention” is toxic and meant to hurt you, is going to be jealous because the men are pathologically focused on you. So you’re in danger from both ends.	0.875

Wow. She dodged a bullet 🚩🚩🚩🚩 This level of insecurity is dangerous to begin with but just imagine what it evolves into 😭 I'm so glad the community helped her see sense .	It's hard to know, I think. I guess if someone just isn't into you and isn't willing to communicate, you have to move on.   I struggle with getting close to people because in the past, I used to become attached (anxious attachment) and this attracted an abusive narcissist. So now I have over-corrected by being very reserved about my affection, especially in the early stages. It is hard for me to trust people because of my experiences. But it does weed out anyone impatient who is trying to love bomb me. I suppose some people might call this "avoidant".	0.863
Omg this is giving me flashbacks to age 22. Good for this girl! I wish I’d had the guts to stick up for myself at her age.   Back then I was with my ex that would rest his head on my stomach while fingering me, acting like he was bored so I’d say forget it. 4+ years together and he made me cum less than 10 times lol. The same guy also couldn’t understand how not all women cum from penetrative sex… he said to me “it worked for all my ex’s, so I’m not the problem” 😭😩😤	She's with a Scrote who doesn't like her and most likely gives her a low looks rating.

Seems extreme unless some major details have been left out from mainstream press.	So she can’t point out the flaws in men raised by single mothers because many of us were raised by one or are one? It’s not a personal attack on single mothers as no matter how perfect a woman is, many men develop problems due to a lack of a father figure.	0.92

How a person is raised and what values are instilled in them shapes who they are as a person and I think it is fair to consider those things.  There are many single mothers on here that are probably feeling attacked but they are not the ladies causing the issue and just as a high value man doesn't chip "not all men"  I would think high value women wouldn't be chipping in "not all men with absent fathers"  I am a single mom myself and have a 13 year old son and I agree with OP.	0.914

All right, I was gonna just scroll on by without comment but since you’ve specifically asked for opinions here it is.   Your post strikes me as naive. I understand how you got to here, but it honestly just screams that you’re young and have limited experience of single mothers as a whole and not just the common tropes. Which, I will admit, do exist but aren’t indicative of the whole.   It reads as the same tired argument I hear from men all the time. LV ones at that. “Single mothers are good for fun but don’t keep one.” “If you raise another man’s child you’re a beta.” And other general “they’re failed as women” comments. This is the next logical step to they’re failed as mothers.   Yet again it’s the idea that the woman who stayed to be a parent is to blame for the actions of the man that leaves. Now, with that said, there are certainly points to be made about being more careful about who you procreate with. Granted.   Here’s the thing though;  - Men can seem high value for a long long time. May not even start to show traits until you’re years in and potentially already married with kids. - People do die. Widows exist.  - People are allowed to realise they made a mistake and course correct, in fact lots of abused women do leave when children enter the picture or they become pregnant - It’s possible to be a good Mum alone and a bad Mum with a partner.   Etc etc   Basically, it reads as immature, a little cruel, a continuation of lots of lower value societal nonsense, a lack of nuance, and generally made me eyeroll.   With all that said; if this is a boundary for you, have at it. It doesn’t personally affect me one way or the other what your red flags are, and your reasons are sound (even if I personally find them misapplied).   Not my area, I don’t really have to take offence to this and it doesn’t change my life in any material way.	0.838

And if he did do something wrong, it was because the woman in his life *made him do it*. Men are allergic to responsibility and are incapable of accepting accountability for their actions.   You can't criticize a LVM because they don't know how to self reflect, analyze, or respond appropriately. They just react. And usually poorly as a defense mechanism.	0.836
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	Apparently they think that if you post on FDS you agree with EVERY single post here, and that an HVM is a 6-6-6 guy who needs their rights infringed on by installing spy cams and apps that monitor them 24/7.     Get mad.

I've been waiting to talk about this season finale with someone who shares the same opinion. I am so shocked by everyone is happy that Lawrence and Issa are back together. They've been toxic from the beginning. I agree with all your sentiments. I really would've loved to see how Issa could have found love within herself and kept scaling her business. You don't always NEED a man. It's okay just being a woman in the world. That is enough.   I went back and forth with someone over how Lawrence is trash and it just appalls me how no one is seeing the signs. He's done nothing to even earn Issa's love all season. All they have done is play phone tag and at the end settle for one another saying "If you believe it will work, it will work". I'm tired. I'm tired of these messages being shown to black women about trusting in struggle love. Love isn't that hard.   Hell, Nate isn't all that either but at least he is self aware, supported Issa in her business ventures, and tried to open up to the possibility of healthy relationship but could see she was still stuck over Lawrence. I'm glad he got away from Issa and her toxic web.   Kelli is the star of the show. She really does need her own spinoff. I'd be hilarious and she'd be giving us that REALNESS.	0.786
What if it was a woman who posted it? What if they are a gay couple? Don’t you think you’re jumping to conclusions assuming a man posted it? Also, why do you care?	Thank you for this post. FDS works. The people it protects us from are at the least time wasters, and at the worst predatory, dangerous, fatal. It’s a big span, imagine like a solid color fading into a different solid color on the other end. If being treated with respect and a loving, healthy relationship is one end/color, and at the other end/color are men who don’t consider your humanity whatsoever and take joy in your suffering, somewhere in the mixed colors is a man who wants a submissive and obeying life manager, baby incubator, maid, therapist, money source, sex machine, who never questions him, is grateful for nothing, and sacrifices everything about who she is to benefit him. FDS teaches us these colors, this scale, how to get for generous, competent, respectful, committed men, and REMOVE men who show detrimental quantities and what those are in tangible terms. DOES THIS SEEM WILD YET? FDS is teaching us how to have standards and why it benefits us. This same phrase is repeated over and over on this site FOR GOOD REASON, because that IS the reason we are successful and why they are mad.	0.784

I found FDS on posts like you have mentioned OP and I’m so thankful for that 😂  People on here can tolerate r*pe subs, borderline pedo subs and zoophilia but draw the line at a subreddit that promotes women wanting better themselves. They only see women as f*ckholes that they can abuse and use. Redditors hate female people except when we’re being sufficiently abused, humiliated and exploited by men.  And this is why men (and sadly many women) feel so threatened - because we talk about it. We motivate and help each other. We criticize the patrichary and how liberal feminism only benefits men.  Be strong girls, we’re doing everything right 🥰	0.784

And he basically cheated to achieve the so called accomplishment - manipulated, lied, deceived. Yet he's still proud?! I'd bet all my limbs he consistently refers to himself as a "gentleman" or a "good guy", too 🤢     Promiscuous men like this fuck around because they have emotional issues, and are scared of the vulnerability that comes with actually connecting with a woman. They lose themselves in short-term highs to mask the fact they are empty and miserable inside. Look at all the hot celebs who've had a lifestyle like this, then realised the highs are sad and meaningless, and gone on to have committed relationships.	0.874

If you want to completely change your feelings on him again please watch his awful behavior toward Sofia Vergara in an old interview.

I’ve mentioned a few times about my exes best friend constantly abusing his gf saying nobody else would want her as a single mother in her 30s. He’s terribly abusive to her psychologically and emotionally - talks to her like she is absolute dirt, as well as her child. And will then post on social media about how much he loves her. Sh runs to my ex (her partners best mate) for solace, but she doesn’t realise he’s just as bad - he just plays the part to get extra information that he feeds back to his mate. Even my ex talked about how he wanted to smash her in the face because of her music choices. And that she brings the abuse from his mate on herself because she’s “crazy” when she’s drunk.  I feel so bad. She has been mentally, emotionally and even now physically beaten down so much, with some occasions pops of what seems like love from him (intermittent reinforcement)… but he’s constantly hitting on other women, then gaslights her that he has to delete everything because she snoops and if she didn’t snoop then he wouldn’t need to delete everything…  I wish I could’ve told her she’s smart, and he IS a liar and a cheat, and there’s a reason she snoops -  because her gut knows. But she wouldn’t listen. She’s too downtrodden and invested and just hangs off everyone word that the group of guys say to her.  It’s really disgusting and honestly I do worry that she will end up dead also.	0.858

Even if it takes a lifetime.	Thank you for this break down! I’ve always hated Issa and Lawrence’s dynamic because it reminded me of toxic relationships I’ve been in or witnessed firsthand. I was proud of Issa initially for walking away from Lawrence and the baby situation but when they ended up getting back together? It just seemed childish and immature. After making so many strides with her professional life, Issa backpedaled on herself so hard. It was disappointing.  And even in regards to Nathan I cringed when she was trying to get him to say he loved her. Like girl! What are you doing?! Issa needed more quality time with herself being single.	0.864
Even if it takes a lifetime.	It's the out of control inconsistency. Being consistently reserved and wary is fine.  Avoidants have a childhood wound that makes them feel smothered when they get too close. Usually an absent or unreliable parent that put them through the hope-abandonment-hope cycle. They become walled off to protect themselves. Hoping hurts.  They're alone for a while, feel the normal need for connection, start up some shit with a woman, go overboard with love-bombing because they don't know how to grow a relationship naturally, and don't want to put effort in for too long anyway.  Then the relationship progresses, they panic and pull away to feel safe again. They start to blame the woman for their own feelings. She's overbearing, smothering, controlling, hampering his freedom. He feels better, then lonely, he reaches out again. Completely self-absorbed and uncaring as to the effect he's having on the woman he just put on a shelf.  They usually activate a woman's anxious attachment, so then she *does* become clingy and needy, trying to get normal levels of communication, openness and intimacy. The idea of being wanted by a woman seems like a trick so he panics again.	0.86
Even if it takes a lifetime.	Another thing I remembered - total inability to offer support.  Example 1: I was upset and crying as my beat friends father received a terminal diagnosis and I didn't know how to help her. He sat next to me cold as a stone patting me on the back with all the empathy of a statue, then left. And this is a supposedly sensitive introspective guy! By contrast, a female friend even just via WhatsApp empathised, gave sensitive advice, and later inquired on how it was going.  Example 2: I was wrecked by period cramps. He chilled on the hammock completely ignoring me. Not a sympathetic word, a hug, god forbid an act of service. By contrast, a female friend sympathised, offered to make me tea, inquired how I was doing, etc.	0.852
Even if it takes a lifetime.	When criticizing my ex-husband, his response would be *so* over-the-top and *so* wearying - we're talking he would disappear for days because in his words 'nothing he ever did was good enough for me' spoilers; that's because *he did nothing -* it was his way of punishing me for not putting up and shutting up. It was a calculated method to wear me down to the point that I would rather just do everything myself than deal with the fallout of saying something to him.   I'm embarrassed to say it took me way too long to figure that out.	0.849
Even if it takes a lifetime.	Considering that I once found myself in this very situation, only I wasn't married and I was the one suddenly falling for someone else while still in that relationship: It really depends.  In my case, I was just realizing that my then BF was showing some red flags and abusive tendencies after the one year mark. It was less than a month after that realization - and me thinking about how to get out of this as well as possible - when I met someone else and had that terrible love-at-first-sight syndrome. (Didn't end well, either.) Which gave me ample motivation to end my relationship pretty much the very next time we met before pursuing the next one.	0.843
I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	A guy I had been dating for maybe 3 months said if we were still together after a year I could move in with him. He talked about how his rent was fixed at about half of what I was paying for my rent, and I’d save so much money splitting with him. He eventually planned to buy the house he was renting. I said nope, I’ll never move into a man’s house and pay into his mortgage. Why put equity into his house especially if we break up, he keeps all that and I get nothing? Plus his house was shittier than my nice apartment and it was in an area of the city I was not interested in moving to. It would’ve been a total downgrade. If I’m gonna move anywhere with a man, it’s gonna be a place we both decided on, after dating for multiple years (I don’t want marriage) and an upgrade from my current living space.	0.829
I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	This exact line of thinking is what led me to researching and meeting with estate planners recently to set up a living will and revocable trust. Since I'm divorced with no kids, my estranged parents would get 100% of my assets if I didn't do anything. I had always thought estate planning and trusts were for the super wealthy but I was wrong. I really only have my 401k and life insurance through work at this point (totalling well under $1m) and the firm I went with was lovely and nonjudgmental and understood my situation without question. I can also make any changes I'd like in the future as my financial and family situation changes.   I'd really recommend everyone look into this even if you have good family relationships because people can turn nasty when money is involved. My will and trust covers the obvious things like beneficiaries and charities and who gets specific items but also everything I hadn't thought about like naming a caretaker for my pets (with money set aside for their care) to who has access to my medical info if I'm incapacitated and (content warning) how long I'm willing to be on life support so no one else has to make that decision.  It was a weird conversation and it's hard to think about (especially when you're young and healthy) but I feel so much peace of mind having all of that legally covered.	0.804
I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	That’s not really what happened in Medea. She was basically Barbara the builder, she gave up everything for Jason, made him wealthy, made him famous, was with him for years. But when he took her back home and they had two sons together, then he had a chance to upgrade and marry the king’s young daughter. Medea was older than Jason and though he was glad to take advantage of her magic to get ahead in life, in his hometown, he joined everyone else in calling her an old witch and treating her terribly. It was very Betty Broderick. Jason had left her and was planning this elaborate wedding to the princess and he was taking the sons with him into his new life with a new mother. Medea was basically a prisoner being forced to watch this. So she poisons her sons because that will hurt Jason more than anything. She does it even though it’s going to hurt her, too. As she explains in the end, anything else, killing Jason, his fiancé, etc would only leave her more vulnerable. You also have to take the story with a grain of salt, because it’s written by man. I’ll say this, it’s my favorite Greek play. None of that whiny shit. Medea isn’t sitting around waiting for a man to rescue her or give her purpose. And she’s not shaking her hand at the heavens like most people who get dealt a bad hand.	0.789
I was thinking maybe she gave Mr Lazy and Self Centered an ultimatum - like shape up or ship out.	I've seen an interview about one of his first Michelin stars (I think it was his second) - his wife gave birth around that time and he didn't bother to accompany her. Someone else took her to the hospital, she gave birth without him and he took his time before he actually bothered to visit... It gave me the ick before, now I know why.  She was saying how she understands, he needs to work on his career, he'd be too anxious anyway, blah blah, coddling bs. I lost my respect for him after that. He's always portrayed as a great loving dad, meanwhile he didn't give a shit about his wife when she was going through all that pain to birth their children.	0.781

Thanks for these comments - I’m currently vetting a divorced dad (divorce finalized just before the pandemic and it seems I’m the first he’s dated in 20 years)  He speaks well of his ex and casually mentioned how helpful therapy has been.   But… eyes wide open lol	0.774
Eww he probably does. I know a couple like that actually. The dude pays attention to everything she eats, how fast or slow she eats, and if she finishes her plate or not. He is obsessed with her losing weight.. and yea maybe she could, but he goes about it all wrong and isn't supportive.  Anyway.... the couple in the post just sound so bizarre..	Feels overwhelmed and suffocated by normal intimacy levels (though they won't communicate this, they'll likely shut down)🚩 Calls themself hard-to-get or difficult-to-read🚩 Will not respond to texts in a timely manner, and will not excuse themselves for extremely late replies🚩 Rarely initiates communication🚩 Doesn't share personal information, or will immediately regret doing so afterwards🚩 Won't compromise on lots of things (over-rigid boundaries)🚩 More comfortable with sex then a deep conversation🚩 Appears to view frequent quality time with you as a gift they're giving you, to the expense of themselves🚩 Relationship doesn't progress unless the other party forces it🚩 Intimidated by or jokes about commitment🚩 Lists generic superficial things when asked why they like you (you're filling a girlfriend shaped hole in their life, there is no 'deep connection')🚩 Silent treatment when overwhelmed🚩 'White lies' or ommitting information to avoid difficult conversations🚩 Can easily emotionally detach during conflict (might make you wait until the weekend to talk things through, leaving you to stew)🚩 Hot-cold behaviour, mixed signals, unclear intentions🚩 Bad at self-reflection or being vulnerable enough for self-improvement🚩Takes you for granted because their mere physical presence is a prize in their view🚩 EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE🚩   Note: a Secure person can act distant at times. However, a Secure person is confident in communicating their needs and boundaries. Whereas an Avoidant will avoid communication and tends to withdraw / shut down.  As a recovering Anxious attached, I'm running as soon as I spot Avoidant behaviour. The most important thing to recognise here is that the Avoidant feels most at ease with a partner at arm's length, because they feel suffocation easily. Whereas the Anxious fears neglect and will thus feel the urge to chase, to receive the affection they crave. This is the anxious-avoidant trap, and it is HELL ON EARTH for Anxious attached folks. So if they step up only after you push them away, that is a 🚩	0.857

They want to take all the credit for female pleasure and none of the blame for the lack of satisfaction that males provide to females. I wish I had done this. I was convinced I could never orgasm because men and society constantly made me feel as though I was the problem. I didn’t even understand what an orgasm was or felt like. Men would act like I had one even though I didn’t because their ego hurt, they’d try to say I’m lying when I straight up said no - I don’t think I had an orgasm. Then I got a vibrator and had my first real climax ever. I was so upset about how many women fake it and how many men gaslight women into pretending like they had a mutual climax. It’s such bs. A HVM will try to either make you cum first or keep pleasuring you after he cums until you reach the same amount of relief.  Lmfao this guy should probably learn how to give her head too, women orgasm well if you learn how to eat it right. A lot of women feel so terrible after sex because we don’t orgasm and they do, but a lot of women don’t even recognize it because they haven’t ever came. The happy women I know who experience orgasms have this standard with men that the man has to be able to make her cum and so do I. No more pity sex. I’m not worried about intimidating any one because I’m no longer interested in lazy male partners. The guy I’m with now loves to pleasure me 🙏	0.854

I am on adhd meds and before that I was on depression and anxiety meds and let me tell you ~ my libido is just fine.   It took me a while to realise that I can't be like the women in films, always wanting sex. That's not humanly possible.   Men always stay on that clown shit.	0.853

I challenge any woman to reply with their thoughts on their sex toy collection, anytime a man mentions anything about ~ViBeS~ 🙄  Then if the idiot (and they always do) tries to steer the conversation to sex, end the conversation by saying how much the toys are better than him and require even less effort than his lame ass pickup line.	0.853

Yes, SSRI’s decrease libido but maybe she just isn’t attracted to him sexually?  I’m on Lexapro and foolishly tried to wean myself off of it to increase my libido for a guy (yes, I was a 🤡 of the highest order) and not only did it obviously not work but I magically figured that I could actually orgasm without him—he was just an asshat.	0.841
That takes the cake! NYE first time date?GTFOH that only happens in cheesy rom com movies lol.

If you want to completely change your feelings on him again please watch his awful behavior toward Sofia Vergara in an old interview. He made tons of inappropriate sexual comments toward her, makes fun of her son's name for some reason, and touches her even after she said not to. He's gross and a definite LVM.	0.83

And he basically cheated to achieve the so called accomplishment - manipulated, lied, deceived. Yet he's still proud?! I'd bet all my limbs he consistently refers to himself as a "gentleman" or a "good guy", too 🤢     Promiscuous men like this fuck around because they have emotional issues, and are scared of the vulnerability that comes with actually connecting with a woman. They lose themselves in short-term highs to mask the fact they are empty and miserable inside. Look at all the hot celebs who've had a lifestyle like this, then realised the highs are sad and meaningless, and gone on to have committed relationships.	0.829
