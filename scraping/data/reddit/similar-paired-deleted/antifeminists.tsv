The reason is that they crave attention 24/7	Male privilege is having to consume media and entertainment that tells you what a bumbling idiot you and your kind are and how lucky you are that any women would even date you, meanwhile men built the godamn world and have innovated almost everything that feminists use to complain of how smart they are.	0.817
