The administration never changed hands because it was a fraud! Stop the steal!!!	<p>unfortunately for you pal, you&#39;re out of touch, and we know what is coming, and you won&#39;t know of it. we shall let you continue your deluded life for the time being, but a surprise is on the horizon. there is none to blame other than themselves now after all. i personally believe we all will continue to enjoy the scramble and panic of the DNC. you do not act in panic when you&#39;re confident in position. feel free to think we&#39;re mad at trivial shit. pretty sure we&#39;re all laughing at all the blunders in a short 52 days, as its just the beginning. nobody to blame, the gaffes and clearly being out of touch with average americans is already catching, 52 days for this much discontent among average americans in both parties. enjoy your delusion pal, you&#39;re completely out of touch and know nothing of our party and voters and personally id encourage everyone else to just be tight lipped and manipulate you, so you&#39;re more out of touch and you spread complacency and a false security of the DNCs position in power. it will not happen again, you can be sure of that. id look elsewhere, as you&#39;re blinded by your fragile ego, your subconscious is giving you a false sense of confidence as protection.</p>	0.828

No he conned them alright - he said he‚Äôs not mentally impaired or too old. He has done nothing and botched every single issue. He‚Äôs been unable to talk to any media and his handlers manage him. People assumes he‚Äôs Do the bare minimum and he‚Äôs proven he couldn‚Äôt even do that,	<p>been wondering where they get this data from since I saw it the first time.

> They need to bring out the deathometers again.  But in addition to raw numbers, let's add comparisons to make it a little more fun and lighten the mood.  Joe Biden has killed more Americans than Hitler.	<p>But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a law to cover that. No matter what you think of his decision to go down there, each example of what he did was legit self defense.  Maaaaybe the prosecution could have given a reckless endangerment charge for bringing a gun into a riot? But I have no idea.  As it stands, he really was completely innocent of the particular things they charged him with, so it&#39;s the right verdict. </p>	0.775

When it comes to the question about how much the government infringes upon your liberty about this virus is a bit insane to bring up, when you are young you have to take shots to attend public school, you have to take precautions for public safety. I understand that some people do not want to take the flu shot, but this isn‚Äôt the flu as your 99.5% stat says. The people who have died and ended up in the Herman Cain sub would probably disagree. And no I don‚Äôt believe in god as you have stated as it‚Äôs just a fairytale to put adults to sleep at night and no I am not a ‚Äúleftist stooge‚Äù either as I purely believe in science as the left can fuck itself. You resorting to plain name calling makes you out to be simply stupid.	<p>flu kills the elderly because they are immunocompromised and kills the young because they lack a lifetime of developed immunity</p>	0.884

Listen she‚Äôs a gigantic piece of shit, but she was never charged with assaulting a police officer.	‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through December 20, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 10,688 reports of death (0.0022%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA clinicians review reports of death to VAERS including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records.‚Äù</p>	0.722
And the title is wrong lmao, she was never charged with assaulting police. That‚Äôs my point; it‚Äôs a sensationalist title. She‚Äôs a massive piece of shit who deserves jail time, but she was never charged with assaulting police officers.	<p>And don&#39;t sit there calling anyone else stupid when you support trump. You have literally zero moral or intellectual ground to stand on at that point. You just look ridiculous.</p>	0.8
So she was charged FOR assaulting police, not charged WITH assaulting police.   Words make a difference to people who know what they mean. Real good example of Dunning Kruger here, thinking other people are stupid because they actually attribute a higher level of literacy to you than you actually possess.	<p>If people want to do that I‚Äôm not going to try to change then on an individual level, but I think it‚Äôs entirely reasonable to be put off by a society where a lot of people refuse to engage in serious relationships because hookup culture makes commitment seems scary and bad</p>	0.886

Satire is supposed to be funny.  COVID-19 cases among US children are extremely high and increasing.

Over 7.5 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, representing 1 in 10 US children. For the 20th¬†week in a row child COVID-19 cases are above 100,000.

I don't smoke, which helps my health, but I also don't want to be in car with someone else who smokes because their second hand smoke effects me.

You're infringing on my right to be free of a poisonous cloud of gas and makinging it hard to defend my family and keep myself safe and secure.  Same thing for transmitting a virus.

Great questions, and obvious statements that need to be said.  2. When they do catch COVID, they claim their symptoms are less because they‚Äôve been vaccinated. How can they possibly know that?  I always thought that too. How can they know that? We don‚Äôt have access to a parallel reality where we can make a choice, see it‚Äôs effects, then make another choice and see it‚Äôs effects.  I suppose you could measure the symptoms of unvaccinated people and the symptoms of vaccinated people and look at the severity to see if they are different on average.   4. Is it possible that Big Pharma wanted to produce a vaccine, which would cause the virus to mutate so that more vaccines would be necessary? Think about it‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt make financial sense for them to keep us healthy!  This is the biggest problem with a for-profit Healthcare industry. The only thing the CEO is legally responsible to do is increase shareholder value. Everything else is on the Honor system. And when peoples lives are on the line, and the only thing the company is thinking is how to turn your disease into a subscription service (medication) instead of eradicating the disease, you have a conflict of interest.

Dr. Lee Savio Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, stated that although they are still gathering the data, they are hearing from hospitals across the US that "the vast majority of the children who are being admitted are unvaccinated."  "There‚Äôs small numbers who are vaccinated, but the vast majority are unvaccinated and so being unvaccinated increases your risk for hospitalization significantly," Beers said.  Beers noted that at her own children's hospital in Washington, DC, they are at an all-time peak of Covid-19 hospitalizations and about half of the them are children under five. "I think it‚Äôs just so important for us to remember that we‚Äôre protecting ourselves, but we‚Äôre also protecting those little ones who aren‚Äôt yet eligible for vaccination," Dr. Beers said. What the data is showing:¬†US pediatric hospital admissions for¬†Covid-19 are only 2.2% lower than their peak in early September, continuing a rapid increase since mid-December. On average, 334¬†children¬†have been admitted to the hospital with¬†Covid-19 on any given day over the week that ended Dec. 27, according to data published Wednesday from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Health and Human Services.¬†	<p>Like where does president even go from there?</p>	0.831

That thing can suck a fart out of my ass	<p>So in shirt of an ultimately way too long response, you should get the vaccine regardless of whether or not you have &quot;natural immunity&quot;. (Un/)forunately, the freedoms granted to us by this country allow the individual to decide. Now are there restrictions, well yes, but ultimately if you don&#39;t want the vaccine, no one is putting a gun to your head like <em>other</em> countries. However, the free market also dictates that companies are allowed to require you to have the vaccine as a term of employment (for the reasons above, but mostly due to cost and liability). As a result, the market <em>has</em> dictated that requiring the vaccine is the best financial move. If you don&#39;t agree with that, you&#39;re more than welcome to form a competitor.</p>	0.826

You are just claiming the US healthcare is terrible with no evidence whatsoever. The US absolutely isn&#39;t LAST lmfao. If they&#39;re last in maybe some specific thing I can believe that, but at least have an idea of what you&#39;re even claiming. Are you talking about OECD countries? Then in some areas we are last yes. But we are also the lowest cancer mortality rate in that list, and one of the best at preventative procedures, visits, and vaccination. We have a big obesity problem in this country which causes us to be lower on many things such as life expectancy too. So our healthcare is not terrible by any stretch, although it&#39;s not as efficient and isn&#39;t as easily accessible. Ignoring all that though, our healthcare system still has undeniably created most of the medical advancements in the past many decades which even allow countries to improve their healthcare to this point. That&#39;s just a fact. Where do you think all the new medicines and treatments come from? The US pulls more than its weight in drug/treatment research costs, and if other countries would share that burden then we&#39;d all be better off in the long term</p>	0.775

Due to different strains, mutations, and evolution, you can catch the "same" disease multiple times. This is why you can get the flu every year/need to get the flu vaccine every year.  It's like how cancer kills 10 million people every year, but there are well over 100 different types of cancer. These 100s of different cancers are all under the umbrella term of "cancer," but each requires a different treatment. The flu is really a group of several similar, but different viruses that all need a different treatment.  It's the same with Covid. Since we didn't manage to stop it early, there are new strains that are coming up. The antibodies you received from covid 1-2 years ago will protect you from that strain, but those antibodies don't protect you from the new strain, because as far as your body is concerned, that new strain is literally a completely different disease.

All I am seeing is people who were told the election was rigged, so they believed the election was rigged, and they will listen to anyone who says anything in defense of that, but they won‚Äôt listen to anyone who has anything to say against that. People spent so much time tediously counting and recounting all of these ballots, and it didn‚Äôt change the outcome. For there to be some large scale conspiracy, they would have to get past the same people who have been volunteering their precious time for years just because they believe in the power of democracy.	<p>Idiots.

I mean, the number and effects of election rules that were changed (many of which were done in an unconstitutional manner) were definitely enough to change the course of the election. They vastly expanded the number of mail in ballots while decreasing the ability to verify they were sent in legally. In states that are decided by only a few thousand votes, that level of uncertainty is very disturbing.	Ex unitati vires...	0.73

There are a few problems with this:  This assumes that these people wouldn‚Äôt have voted in person if mail in ballots weren‚Äôt an option  It excludes the fact that it isn‚Äôt just a few thousand votes, it is a few thousand votes from one side, and people can vote for either party on the mail in ballot  It also excludes the care people many would realize they needed to put in so that they wouldn‚Äôt be guilty of voter fraud. People literally have to sign their name to something on a mail in ballot.  So, how many illegitimate ballots were truly placed? They had multiple people on both sides of the political spectrum go through them and then they recounted them.   I take no issue with the complaints that they rushed through allowing mail in ballots, but I do not think they are not legitimate votes.	<p>I could take up their argument and probably make some compelling arguments for their case, but it would take a long form discussion and preparation.  </p>	0.773

That didn‚Äôt happen. Dude we knew most Trump votes were coming in person and Biden votes were coming by mail which take longer to count. Also, trump gets most of his support from rural areas , less people and they are quicker to vote and count. Most Biden votes were coming from highly populated urban areas and suburbs which take longer to process (hence Biden taking the lead throughout the night). We knew all this was gonna happen , we also fucking knew trump was gonna pull some shit like this. Ok if the election is fraudulent bring it to the courts don‚Äôt start an insurrection. Oh yeah they brought it to the courts but they had no evidence so the judges sent them home. Trump appointed judges mind you, so don‚Äôt try to claim Democratic deep state conspiracies.

You aren't going to gaslight people about what they saw on election night.  You had tons of cell videos showing all sorts of fuckery. Literally every single measure we use to predict how elections will turn out was broken. The rules on how ballots could be counted were completely changed. 2500 people made sworn statements about problems with how votes are counted.  States like WI and PA didn't even keep track of how many ballots they actually sent out, they counted any that they got, and they weren't allowed to deny ballots based on signature issues or if the ballot was even signed.  During the election hearing in Georgia we saw ballot workers count ballots for hours without being supervised by poll watchers, after the time that poll workers were to have been sent home for the night.  If you wanted people to have faith in the election, all of that and so so much more would have been addressed. Instead, the Democrats said having an audit would "weaken our election integrity". The courts didn't bother hearing a single case (based on standing, not evidence), and social media will now remove posts that show any of the conduct or testimony about the election "irregularities." Literally everything that was done was only going to make people more suspicious.  This isn't going away either. [According to October polling by Rasmussen](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2021/vote_by_mail_most_voters_think_it_will_cause_more_cheating), the number of likely voters that think there was widespread election fraud has went up from 51% in Jan to 56%. That's not just Republicans in this poll, that's likely voters. The more the Democrats try to bury this, while simultaneously pushing for shit like the corrupt politicians act, the worse they look in the polls. Guess we will see next year how much this effects the midterms.	<p>Apparently this dude is suing the city or somebody for like ten million dollars and the results of the trial are potentially important to his case.

Damn don't I love logical fallacies as my upvoted memes	This data was collected from about 26% of Israel‚Äôs entire population. Patients were matched according to age, socioeconomic status, health status, and time of infection/vaccination. Tens of thousands of participants showed natural immunity to be about 13 times stronger in preventing reinfection when only looking at the period since vaccines rolled out. When looking all the way back to the beginning of the pandemic, natural immunity was still 6 times stronger over that entire time than the vaccine is just in the last several months. So someone who got covid in March 2020 is still more protected than a similar individual who just got fully vaccinated in the last couple months.	0.722

A vaccine puts something in your system, teaches your immune system to fight it, and is gone within 6-8 weeks.

Because everyone having access to guns in the USA is doing so much to reduce your crime rate, right?

Is anyone else getting banned in other subreddits for posting here?	<p>When you lose the truth what&#39;s left? I&#39;m very pro-vaccine, and very anti-mask. More evidence points to masks NOT working than the other way around. In fact, masks have done more harm than good. Basic common-sense shows they didn&#39;t work well and gave a false sense of security during the pandemic. Distancing was key before vaccines arrived. Back when some governments mandated masks health officials inadvertently harmed trust in public health for many. CDC especially harmed their credibility by recommending them without good data to back them up, and then later flip flopping on the subject. By hurting their own credibility, they hurt trust in Covid vaccines. I believe many more would be vaccinated today if it weren‚Äôt for masks. I know very few who haven&#39;t gotten vaccinated, but those who haven&#39;t still wear masks. They&#39;re irrationally scared of the vaccine for varying reasons, and think masks are a sufficient substitute. Masks are like holding a newspaper over your head in a rainstorm hoping not to get wet. Cloth masks especially provide close to zero protection.  Vaccines give well over 99.9% protection against Covid hospitalizations even with the current variants, and there is reliable data to back them up. Regardless the fact will always remain the only way through a pandemic is immunity, and Covid will be endemic. Only those thinking irrationally and/or emotionally still wear masks. Those who attempt to force masks on others are especially irrational people. Anti-vaxxers and Maskers are two sides of the same extremist coin. Anyone told to wear masks by someone else should refuse. Any business that tries to require them will lose me permanently as a customer.</p>	0.894

Yeah, when referring to the parties in a historical context of the past -- particularly around the Civil War -- it's critical to understand that what the parties stood for has changed over time.

Are you saying people are getting blank vaccine cards and filling them out falsely as if they got it on the civilian side and using that to make their problems seemingly go away?  I'm not surprised, it's actually somewhat expected.  My last gig we were running into people turning in fake COVID tests to get a couple weeks off.  Integrity is an Army value that is often lacking.  As a physician, I am not all that worried because I haven't been all that worried about COVID since day 1.  Military has decided to vaccinate against it, a good decision to improve readiness (since even "exposure" results in losing Soldiers for a couple of weeks). We already vaccinate large portions of the force against small pox, a disease that only exists in a couple of labs, so why not this one that is active worldwide still.  People choosing to bypass that though is just putting themselves at risk, and said risk is fairly minimal.   As an officer, I'm annoyed and would like those who are caught to be subject to the maximum punishment for a false official statement (dishonorable discharge / 5 years confinement).  This is a high profile item right now, so there isn't room for screwing around.  Which is part of why I maintain my usual / repeated position that mandating covax for literally every citizen is inappropriate, but mandates for select groups (the military, public schools, some travel, etc) is reasonable.

There's a miniscule risk to the vaccine itself and it seems to be greatest for young men, but still very, very small from what I can gather.

The majority of these are not conspiracy theories and were never referred to as "untruths" either   The whole bit with the vaccines was that it always reduced the probability of you spreading the virus or being hospitalized with it. Those still stand true today.  We also have to acknowledge that we're speaking of a moving target. The vaccine was effective against the initial strains of the virus, but it evolved because not enough were sufficiently vaccinated.   This is a nuanced problem and I bet you can appreciate that, as I imagine you would not be anti-vax in a scenario where the virus was far more deadly.  I doubt you're against some of these measures on principle alone, but rather based on your assessment on the harm of this particular virus.

Hey, if you‚Äôre on board to have the government ban smoking, then I‚Äôm with you all the way.

That seems like a pretty basic question. Clearly, people are doing more high risk activities than they were a year ago (when we didn‚Äôt know much about Covid, and when we weren‚Äôt prepared to deal with a pandemic). So, yeah, it might not be super clear that vaccines help curve transmissions, but the data is clear that they‚Äôre helping people not get sick, and when they do get sick, that they don‚Äôt get as sick (keeping them out of the hospital).	> She's 15. 15 year olds do dangerous stupid and malicious shit all the time, sometimes with disastrous consequences.	0.707

The same data also shows that the vaccine is effective at stopping someone from *getting infected with Covid*.

The efficacy has dropped with the variants, but no virologist wouldn't expect that to happen.  It's why there is a new flu shot every year.   2.) No one said variants couldn't change the efficacy.  Regardless, the vaccine remains reasonably effective against infection and very effective against serious effects.  Around a 5x reduction in infection and 14x reduction in death. That jumps to 10x and 20x if you have a booster.    3.) Name one vaccine without potentially serious side effects.  You can't.  I'll guarantee you've already had vaccines with equally deadly side effects.    4.) All the experts I heard said we don't know how long the vaccines would last and that variants could change the timeline.  The small pox vaccine didn't last forever either.      etc.  Stop just reading headlines and you'd know all this stuff.	<p>Increasing taxes on people is just a stupid idea in general.

Well, not sure about other places, but in Texas we are trying to change our ways. We have started removing the traitorous statues that ‚ÄúHonor the Confederacy‚Äù. It has caused two problems so far: 1. we can‚Äôt find enough people willing to take responsibility for them, meaning they continue to sit in public view. 2. We now are faced with current state politicians who don‚Äôt want them removed from Capitol grounds, even though the public wants them gone. We have always had to deal with politicians who don‚Äôt represent their constituents, but now that some are actively supporting keeping the traitorous monuments, it‚Äôs hard to move forward without confrontation. Hopefully enough true Americans will help force the the removal of these disgraceful monuments from government grounds!	<p>LoL....

Or an even easier one: Trump whining about the Biden nepotism *while he employed his daughter and son in law*  Point is, I don't see you guys *ever* calling out conservatives/people on the right for their blatant and shameless hypocrisy and bad faith arguments.	<p>Yes, this vaccine helps curb the spread.</p>	0.727

Can't stand being called out so you start slinging mud.  Grow up.  There's ***plenty*** of hypcorisy, corruption, dishonesty and bad faith on both sides.

The numbers are severely underreported (in the case of India at least). it‚Äôs only hospitalisation deaths and those too, where the people had been tested as positive before their death.	0.871

Because the majority of the modern world is now vaccinated and the majority of vaccines occured nearly a year ago now. How is this hard to understand?  So you have a child I assume now, or close to it. You're ok with a neighbor storing high explosives in their bedroom? No matter the quantity?

The average person literally does not give a shit about this anymore. They either got the vaccine, and moved on with their lives, or don‚Äôt want to get it because they understand the risks and are okay with them. Last year I‚Äôd go into a store without a mask and some people would bat an eye, but not anymore. After I got the vaccine I‚Äôve basically lived my life as if this never happened, and quite frankly before getting the vaccine I wasn‚Äôt worried about this for more than a few weeks. Nobody in my family took any precautions, aside from just sanitizing things like shopping carts before handling them, and my parents are not only old, but also both have bad immune systems, and even they didn‚Äôt give a damn about this.</p>	0.798

It's against the law to date horses.	The following nights their response to the protests felt like overcompensating for the night of the riot. Peaceful marches would get boxed in and tear gassed, etc. These tactics would have been nice to deal with the looters but were unnecessary for the marches. They realized that they were basically fanning the flames at this point and backed off, rightfully in my opinion. Whether you agree with that move or not, they did not need federal assistance either way, and the offer just felt like political showmanship by Trump saying he could swoop into this Democrat city and save the day.	0.866

The opinion of a Government official from a thousand miles away is completely irrelevant.  When I get sick, I go to my doctor, not Congress or the cdc or Facebook or the media or my preferred political party.  Everyone should be making their health decisions with the advice of a doctor that they know and trust, not with pundits or politicians, and it‚Äôs wild that that‚Äôs somehow controversial these days.</p>	0.853
Ewwww. . .I mean, I'd take a second glance at her leaked nudes, but date her? She got me fucked up. It's not socially acceptable to date someone with a significantly lower IQ than me.

This is 100% incorrect.  I have been banned from Reddit subs just for even mentioning these things.  There is still a LARGE swath of the populous that is so uninformed that they think, to this day, that the vaccines would have made COVID-19 go away completely if everyone had been vaccinated.  I know it sounds fucking ridiculous to people that actually pay attention to data and facts, but there are a LOT of people out there that still think this way.	<p>FYI: not being a dick, I agree with that if it could happen.</p>	0.876

Yeah. What an idiot.   She escaped from the entire problem her state was suffering through the worst.  /s   AOC going on vacation for holidays is TOTALLY different than Ted Cruz leaving Texas.   He escaped the weather. His supporters were left with nothing to help them as they didn‚Äôt have power, heat, or even food. The National Guard had to show up to help, and he chose to leave to visit somewhere with better weather. He displaced himself entirely from the situation.   She did NOT escape the pandemic. She isn‚Äôt ‚Äúleaving behind‚Äù her constituents, because she‚Äôs still living in the same situation as them. She still has to wear a mask, she still has to be careful about COVID, just as her constituents in NY have to.  If anything, she‚Äôs traveled to a much worse state, COVID-wise. How is that hypocrisy?   I don‚Äôt even LIKE her, but compring what she did to Ted Cruze just isn‚Äôt a 1:1 comparison at all. If NY had no power and people were freezing in their homes without food and resources, THEN she went to Florida, that would be more comparable.   I feel like lately everyone on this sub is just grasping at straws to ‚Äúown the libs‚Äù and it‚Äôs straight up awful.	<p>I wonder if they&#39;re running for office with the expectation of that job paying off their loans.

Your dumb ass response avoiding the question must have been instantly deleted	""I told you so"" aside, this is a serious issue and the reason he skipped around the subject before the election is because the left and the right *both* would feel concern by the idea.

Worth a repost to r/confidentlyincorrect	As for 2. No one is suggesting that you intentionally become infected with or without that vaccine so that point is moot.

Ok, I was actually aware of this stance beforehand, but here‚Äôs my take on this: rape is already illegal, and rapists are fully aware of this, so why would they need to pretend to be a trans person to rape someone? And the logic could just as easily run the other way, too. If we ban people from using gendered spaces, that same rapist could just as easily say ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm a trans man, but this new bathroom mandate says I have to use the women‚Äôs bathroom.‚Äù It would be a whole lot more convincing too. Not only that, it would be denying trans people the rights they deserve. In conclusion, this argument relies on an imagined rapist that relies on pro trans legislation to commit a crime that is exactly as illegal in women‚Äôs bathrooms as it is everywhere else, so therefore we should roll back laws in place to help trans people   ...

We have more guns - we have more gun deaths. What's confusing about that?  Most deaths don't come from defense	Meaning that the real percentage of all deaths being from covid would be 0.5% which is still 50X higher than brain tumors. Sorry I didn't spell out the maths there but the point I was making is that your chance of dying is the chance of getting the disease times by the chance of the disease killing you. If you have a brain tumor and covid it will likely be the tumor that kills you, but you are way more likely to get covid than a tumor, and it works out that your total risk from covid is hundreds of times higher than a brain tumor, so it make more sense to be afraid of covid than a tumor.

Except the real conspiracy theory was the fact that Joe Biden, who sat in his basement, somehow got the most votes in US election history without having to campaign in any serious way.

It‚Äôs funny how Black Lives Matter can encircle the White House, actually charge the capital building and vandalize it, and not one mention of domestic terrorism or insurrection made by this current regime. Most of the pro Trump protestors who entered the capital building where peaceful. Ashli Babbitt was a veteran and did more for this country than the little Antifa bitches ever have done.

The us army probably killed a similar number. And guns killed a lot more.As much as i hate to say it but these are numbers that just need to happen. We need to defend our country and woman need to defend themselves. Whether its with a gun or abortion this is just the way it is nowadays.  A lot more millions of people have died from war and gun violence. If abortion is a cause of death  then so is war because its preventable and a choice. You cant allow one and prevent the other and call them different.	<p>No, it‚Äôs just the hypocrisy. Cruz didn‚Äôt tell Texans they weren‚Äôt allowed to go somewhere warm.

To be clear a sway of a gun is not sufficient. They would need evidence that there was a clear threat of shooting to try a wrongful shooting here. As in they will need to prove intent. As in a very high threshold. And considering we have evidence of the suspect retreating throughout the night and going *to the police* to turn himself in. This would be a massive stretch to prove intent.

>ipses is supposed to be "by voting Democrat"? Because I think we were heading the right direction economically before the current administration and inflation disproportionately affects the poor.  The republicans won't be the ones that drive better living conditions for poor people, if that's what you're asking.   We already need to give up a lot more than luxurious living conditions. Giving poor people in America better living conditions is something we would do while still exploiting people. That's the thing, the current system exploits people to a pretty extensive amount. Personally, I'm fine with giving shit up because my life ain't great anyway -- you'll feel that that could be your biggest obstacle -- people that don't have great lives will be willing to give up more. You didn't give people enough reason to exploit other people, basically.  Currently, you are expecting people to exploit others without question. We'll call it out instead.

Well, abortions are restricted by some constraints. My main problem is, if the science is mistunderstood, then why is the campaign not to get that re-evaluated? Instead it's just to ban it outright? Republicans don't care about the science, they just want to ban it.   My point about providing is that republicans hate giving anything to anyone when it comes to welfare, but they are so ready to aggravate an already bad situation while providing zero support.	<p>In the pro-abortion picture, it looks like they would look at me that way as I am being burnt alive for wrong think.</p>	0.775

If she is spreading that detail as a means to convince others NOT to vaccinate? Then fuck her she deserves removed. The fact that people can spread it while vaccinated is why EVERYONE SHOULD BE VACCINATED. With a booster your odds of catching covid and having a bad time are incredibly low.    &nbsp;  The vaccine is our safest way to combat this issue, and the non compliance of people like you and those here, are why we are so fucked. You will literally create the scenario where COVID spreads the most and gets to mutate the most. As having unvaxxed and vaxxed people in the same population, actually helps create new mutations.	<p>At least with MSNBC and other lefty networks, they are like Fox, in that while there is bias, they are at least somewhat credible. I would argue it is important to look at both right and left media to get the full story. But CNN I just avoid at all costs because it is just nonsense.</p>	0.861

You are not naturally vaccinated you goober.

Your mind has been poisoned with lies. You don't have natural immunity and tons of people on HermanCainAwards were previously infected with COVID at the start of this nonsense, and then die when they catch it again. Your a fool.	woman	0.718

The person claiming to be naturally vaccinated is the one who is anti science. We have literal science that shows COVID can fuck your world up and even kill you, after you have had it already. The virus keeps mutating, and you have ALREADY HAD IT. It is insane you won't vaccinate. Your poor family.	evolves into	0.871
Biases like... providing accurate information? MTG is a far-right conspiracy theorist by definition. She's far right and she believes and spreads conspiracy theories. Do you dispute either of those facts? They're demonstrably true.	<p>Just as I think it is irresponsible to pretend that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work, I also think it‚Äôs ridiculous for others to say that you are killing grandma if you don‚Äôt get vaxed. I don‚Äôt think they realize how that makes them come across. The pro mandate crowd also significantly overestimates the danger to children. A child under 12 years old is at less risk from Covid than a fully vaccinated adult. I would certainly not get my child vaccinated as the risk/reward just isn‚Äôt there. They are at virtually no risk.</p>	0.851
Here is [her tweet](https://i.imgur.com/y90jip0.png).  The issue isn't whether or not that the vaccinated can spread COVID at all, it's that she said that vaccines do not reduce the spread of COVID, which is misinformation.	<p>An individual&#39;s vaccine protects them and no one else. Children who&#39;s parents have both either had or been vaccinated against chicken pox still need the vaccine or to catch it and naturally develop antibodies. This is because their individual immune system doesn&#39;t have the information to generate the antibodies and their parent&#39;s and/or friends&#39; vaccinations/antibodies do not protect them.</p>	0.814
Yea you are only exposing yourself as anti vax and anti science.    > I am considered an antivaxxer according to Webster.  Oh whatever dude. Your anti-vax, unvaxxed, and unwilling to see reason.

Here‚Äôs your arrow down	<p>It isn&#39;t as much that Trump is popular as it is that the old GOP has failed to give the constituents what they want.  During the 2016 election, we were told &quot;but he&#39;s rich&quot; or &quot;but the things he says are absurd!&quot; or &quot;no way he will build a wall! He&#39;s RACIST!!&quot;.  Everyone shrugged and didn&#39;t care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.</p>	0.842

I know what dictatorship is. In that context is utterly misused in my opinion. As I said many times before being conservative doesnt mean you are against these mandates...If a person doesnt want to get a vaccine I understand and rescpect but I also understand you will be blocked to meet your colleagues at work...its your decision. No dictatorship seen here.	<p>But now we&#39;re going back to Democrat methods. Increase taxes in businesses, make them harder to run, make them less profitable and invest the money from increased taxes in minority communities because minorities are too stupid to start a business  (even though Trump proved otherwise). Get rid of IDs  for voting because minorities are too stupid and poor to get an ID and etc. Democrat policies are always supported by &quot;minorities are stupid and poor.&quot; And somehow their the anti racists.</p>	0.832

*Natural immunity is the antibody protection your body creates against a germ once you‚Äôve been infected with it. Natural immunity varies according to the person and the germ. For example, people who have had the measles are not likely to get it again, but this is not the case for every disease. A mild case of an illness may not result in strong natural immunity. New studies show that natural immunity to the coronavirus weakens (wanes) over time, and does so faster than immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccination. *      https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid-natural-immunity-what-you-need-to-know	However, team Trump did receive a win regarding indefinitely confined voters in a case that is receiving much less publicity earlier this morning.	0.816

Looks like the leftist bots are out again. You want the GOVERNMENT to take over private companies just because they‚Äôre good at what they do? That is literally socialism.

I'm sorry, but I'm a surgeon, and the vaccines do work quite well, and we're not seeing any series consequences of getting them.    All of my colleagues have been vaccinated, as well as a significant amount of the other hospital workers.  The only people we see getting sick are generally the ones who are unvaccinated.  Our hospitals and E.D s  are full.  Mostly of unvaxxed, like 20:1.  Don't let the left manipulate us into being anti science.	<p>Also, quit calling them antivax. Lumping in the &quot;hurrdurr MMR vaccine causes autism&quot; crowd with people that have legitimate though in my opinion incorrect concerns over the vaccine is counterproductive.

She posted unverified data and tried to sell it as truth of COVID crimes or something from the context of different articles.

However, given that disease concerns the safety and well-being of other individuals, wouldn‚Äôt you agree that your decision to not get vaccinated is actually harmful to others? (Not too different from the argument against abortions) Also, a higher percentage vaccinated population decreases the transmissibility and therefore the ability of a virus to mutate into something far more dangerous.

Weird.  If what you claim is true, then why am I reading your comment here?	The main thing Mitch and other Republican Senators want is Trump out and unable to ever hold office again. By voting to ""remove"" him from office either during or after he is in office, they can say he isn't able to hold office again and so he'd essentially be out of Politics and out of the GOP more importantly.

Didn‚Äôt the court seal the list?	First, once the proof is out there then republicans will call for most democrats to resign. Of course those who were wrongfully put in office will be asked to resign as well as those who contributed to the fraud. I think we all know they won't. Second, the demonstrated unchecked fraud will introduce doubt into every following election where a democrat wins in a region where they don't have at least 70% support - the fact that they did not resign will only double this effect. Third, if it is proven that the election results were wrong and they win reelection you will see states begin to leave the union.

Kinda funny considering Reagan‚Äôs gaffs. Dude couldn‚Äôt recognize his own cabinet members or remember his own dog‚Äôs name.	Yep. Millions went for art and garbage that isn't beneficiary to the majority of society. That's why most tradesmen are conservative dudes that didn't go to college and are able to pay their debts easily. People who graduate with degrees for anything medical related make good money, so do other trades like welders, machinists. It's the kids that went for political science and other relatively useless forms of education that think it is predatory. When you take out thousands and drop out or go for useless majors and can't get a job, who's fault is that? Definitely not private lenders.

Well the dictatorship prolly comin , you got the practice run in. Me time you will achieve Bulgaria. But without the healthcare.	AR is a short hand for the original brand of the riffle, Armalite - it&#39;s the Armalite Riffle. Armalite developed this riffle and then sold the design to Colt when Armalite couldn&#39;t put up a military contract for the riffles. The AR-15 was the 15th design in the series, but still wasn&#39;t considered military grade. Thus, Colt started manufacturing them as self-loading riffles (a.k.a. semi-automatic) for sportsmen. They are highly comfortable and durable due to the history of their development. Since the AR designation and general design are no longer patented, other brands can produce similar riffles and continue to call them AR-15s. Thus, calling this particular riffle model AR is like calling all recreational discs a Frisbee. It just stuck. </p>	0.763
I cant tell if youre trolling	<p>Edit: as for the US dominating the world... it depends on what you mean. In some areas, yes, but not all.

They are probably already on he leading country when it comes to AI. The Chinese market is very different and they have their significant strengths.  Silicon Valley is great for other things though.

My friend - being required to present documentation to enter a foreign country isn‚Äôt fascistic.

Given it is likely Regan was suffering for Alzheimers while in office, it probably pretty fair to compare him to Biden.

Our politicians, especially vocal ones on the left, have a very good reason to be afraid of the far right, which has moved from vocal opposition to violent opposition.

Trump/Greene 2024	<p>For example, a government agency that leases a conference room in a hotel to hold a public hearing about a proposed regulation cannot kick participants out of the hotel simply because they express concerns about the new regulation. See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Con- rad, 420 U. S. 546, 547, 555 (1975). But government offi- cials who informally gather with constituents in a hotel bar can ask the hotel to remove a pesky patron who elbows into the gathering to loudly voice his views. The difference is that the government controls the space in the first scenario, the hotel, in the latter. Where, as here, private parties con- trol the avenues for speech, our law has typically addressed concerns about stifled speech through other legal doctrines, which may have a secondary effect on the application of the First Amendment.</p>	0.797

How is this rejecting history?  I've got a consistent set of definitions, that when applied to history do quite well at explaining why the different groups fought for their causes, and let's me classify/rank countries based on how much freedom existed in the population?  Nazi germany (right wing fascist), authoritarian - I'd have to do anything daddy Hitler or the national government says (if i was Jewish or gay or communist I'd have even less freedom)  USSR (right wing,  Marxist-leninist), authoritarian- (I'd have to do whatever daddy Stalin or the socialist top circle says and if i spoke against them I'd be killed.   DPRK (right wing Marxist Leninist) same description as USSR  America (not right wing not left wing) generally much more freedom, freedom of speech, religion, etc, but still have things like pelosi insider trading, government/rich corporate pedophiles and sex offenders, no accountability with corporations which rake in billions and control the media narrative.

You said media is lying about the reasons. So looking for that perspective in media would be the wrong approach.  Yes, of course i have voted before.

Yes, initially.  After this big platform shift, the change in elected officials came over time, as older folks resigned and were replaced by younger folks.  As an example, George Wallace was an ardent segregationist and long time Democrat. But in 1968 he ran for president as an independent and won the deep south because segregation was a popular issue there.	This is exactly the point and takes the argument away from liberals that if you‚Äôre against the mandate you *must* be anti-vaxx and/or science denying. Mandates are implemented to force compliance and have repercussions. The mandate isn‚Äôt saving ppl, the vaccine is. Slapping a mandate on it only allows the government to punish non-compliance.	0.853
My favorite republican	Would you rather get robbed and beaten at gunpoint, or have an unvaccinated cop intervene?	0.786
Or you can grab the water behind the line. Or bring one. So AGAIN, you're making piss poor fucking excuses	Even if the current covid vaccines were ""relatively ineffective"" (they're very effective) and provided limited protection from covid, the virus would have less chance to multiply and mutate into a strain that's resistant against the broad antibodies and have less opportunity to move on to a new host. Being unvaccinated provides none of these benefits, which means more opportunity for mutations. We are far closer to a mutation that completely bypasses our natural immune systems than we are to the 3 or 4 or 10 mutations needed to nullify the vaccine antibodies to the point where they provide no protection at all.	0.873
I don't. Sometimes understanding why a person struggled or being empathetic to their unique struggle and the various hurdles they have had to overcome is important when helping them. When you actually look into how generational abuse can effect future generations, it's overwhelming to consider what has been done to the Black community in the US.  And this isn't to say that no white people have suffered or had generations of trauma or poverty... but it is fair to say that none of it was perpetrated with the full backing of the law and government support.  In case you care to read one of many scholarly articles:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/	<p>I&#39;m not ready to jump to the conclusion that the pharma companies or the CDC were lying. It just doesn&#39;t make much sense to lie about something when you know the actual data will prove you were lying. At this point, I&#39;m willing to believe that the vaccines are just nowhere near as effective against Delta as they were against Alpha. The truly frightening part is that in vitro testing has shown the vaccines to be completely ineffective against the Mu variant, which is now present in all 50 states.

I was just pointing out that Democrats were once the more Conservative party, while at their inception Republicans were the more progressive party. I don‚Äôt think 100 years ago the south was a bastion of progressive thinking. Democrats just matched up better with a more conservative way of thinking at the time.

My mom will die from it in the long run, she is now terminal because if the fibrosis she got from covid, but she is stil alive because of medical advance and the fantastic job they did saving her life.

Note to Mods: I am very willing to edit or modify my comment here, particularly if this comment were to incite a kerfuffle -- I am not suggesting anything about what the law "should" or "should not" be.  I'm not saying that HIPAA is a good law or a bad law, I'm not saying that the part of HIPAA I'm commenting on is a good or a bad part of the law.  I am instead stating what the law *is at this time.*  Philosophical discussions can very rightly revolve around what "should" or "should not" be true.  But there is no possibility for discussion (at least for discussion to be treated as credible) about whether or not *my description is accurate as to the current state of the HIPAA laws* vis-a-vis the context of this comment thread.  u/daca610, respectfully, yours is a very flawed interpretation of what HIPAA actually does.  If *your doctor's office* were to share your medical information without your consent for *your doctor's office* doing so, then THAT would be a HIPAA violation.  There is no violation that comes from asking YOU about YOUR OWN medical status.  You have every right to refuse to answer, and you have every right to answer truthfully.  (A person who chooses to answer with knowingly false information can be a civil liability or a crime, or both at the same time, depending on circumstances.)  The law does not *require* you to disclose truthful information about yourself.  The law does not require you to justify your decision whether to answer or not answer.  The law ALSO does not require you to justify why your truthful information is what it is -- i.e., if a person's truthful reply were "I am unvaccinated" then there is no legal way for someone to make you explain why this is the case, nor are you required to explain if you decided to electively remain unvaccinated versus involuntarily (medical contraindication, lack of vaccine doses available, [for vaccines that are not free to the recipient] inability to afford, etc.)  If you DO choose to answer the question when asked, AND YOU ALSO choose to give knowably untruthful information, then you absolutely CAN conceivably come to be required to explain why you chose to offer an untruthful answer -- but even then, there is no requirement for you to justify why any truthful info might be true.  All of the above is accurate and correct.  I can ASK you for $50, even though you don't owe me $50.  You can ignore the question, you can say no, you can say no with a nasty attitude, you can say no with an apology.  You ALSO COULD choose to spot me $50, just as you ALSO COULD choose to only give me $7.50 instead of $50.  You have the OPTION to explain your responses, but no one can FORCE you to explain yourself, and no one can FORCE you to give me $50 when you don't otherwise "owe" me any money.  It's also, generally, not a crime for me to ASK, especially if my request were NOT a form of harassment, stalking, interference in your lawful activities, etc.  If I were to pick your pocket, or if I were to simply steal your bank account info, utter a falsified bank check on your credentials, or if I just violently reach into your wallet to grab a $50 I see you flipping through.  Any of those examples of "getting $50 from you" would actually be criminal actions on my part.  ###BUT LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE: ANY PERSON OR BUSINESS ASKING YOU TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE VACCINATED IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A HIPAA VIOLATION, THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHEN THE LAW WOULD SPECIFY THAT IT WERE A HIPAA VIOLATION, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE THE LAW WOULD BE SO CHANGED ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS INTO A HIPAA VIOLATION!!!  HIPAA means you have a right, by law, to make OTHER PEOPLE SHUT UP about your medical info.  HIPAA has precisely fuck-all to do with other people ASKING YOU TO DISCLOSE your medical info.  Thank you for attending my Ted Talk.	<p>How is this not getting through to you.	0.772

We can now literally see into the womb and see a tiny human with its own digestive system, with eyes that move, its gender, or it reacting to the sound of the parents voice.

>I have a dream that my four little children... will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  In this *very* *famous* quote MLK is trying to point out the fiction of the concept of race as it exists today (this is actually a central tenet of CRT, but that's beside the point). He is not making a case for color blindness in government and law, and he is not putting forward a libertarian view of individualism.  From that same speech >We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality  Here is a quote from MLK that you probably don't see very often  >The white liberal must affirm that absolute justice for the Negro simply means, in the Aristotelian sense, that the Negro must have ‚Äúhis due.‚Äù There is nothing abstract about this. It is as concrete as having a good job, a good education, a decent house and a share of power. It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment. I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according of their individual merits. But this is a day which demands new thinking and re-evaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.  MLK is arguing for "special treatment" for black Americans to make up for centuries of injustice. So to be clear, he absolutely supported taking positive steps (affirmative action, if you will) to correct for inherit racial inequalities in society today.   In short, BLM is the modern iteration of almost everything he stood for. He would not have "heavily condemn the direction that BLM has gone down". He would certainly "still be a prominent leader himself" and the movement would likely be better for it, but the underlying creed would not have changed one iota for his presence.	YOU. ARE.

This is the thing people often fail to understand.  The civil war was not fought to abolish slavery. It was fought to bring the south back into the union. The south left because resistance on expansion of slavery into the west worried the south about governmental overreach.   The reason the north did not want slavery expanding into the west wasn't because they abhorred slavery. It was because they abhorred black people.   The north wanted to utilize the new land in the west but did not want to live in close proximity to black people. If slavery was permitted in the west, that would mean the southerners would bring black people to the land in the west and ruin it for those northerners.   The only reason the civil war resulted in the abolishment of slavery was because the north realized that the south was becoming too powerful and had too much of the nation's economy in too small of an area. So, they abolished slavery as a way to punish the south and to send the south into an economic downslide that would prevent them from eventually conquering the entire government.  Just look at demographics in the northeast and the west especially compared to the south.  New York is 15.66% black, Massachusetts is 9% black, Connecticut is 12.2% black.   In the west, Minnesota is 6.41% black, Nevada 10.3% black, California is 6% black.  Now what about the south?  Georgia is 31.9% black, Alabama is 26.8% black, Mississippi is 37.7% black, Louisiana is 31.4% black.  The north's plan worked. They shut down the southern economy and kept black people from moving west and kept them out of the north as well.	<p>I‚Äôm amazed at the number of people that can‚Äôt see that colleges only got ridiculously expensive when the government got involved in student loans.</p>	0.79

none of that is true, its always been about republicans introducing bills that make it harder for minorities to vote. They for some reason always choose ids that less minorities have. They do this because, bar cubans almost every minority group votes democrat, even though they can be incredibly conservative and right leaning themselves. The problem is the conservative party refusing to appeal to anyone beyond white conservatives	1. Hope you NEVER have kids.	0.813
The Republicans have undergone their reformation (Trump), but still have a number of hold-outs (Kinzinger, Cheney, etc) who need to go. Trump steeled the party...forcing them, IMO, to get back to the basics of America First...and subsequent policies to make sure that happens.      That said, the Left is masterful at branding: and post-Trump, most who identify as a conservative/Republican are an anathema. Sad, but true.  Feeling good about that swing of 14% is a great way to settle into a false sense of security. Biden gave us the gift of allowing EVERYone to see his policy v. Trump's policy prescriptions:  the results from undoing Trump's are palpable. Yet...I'm still nervous about November.	<p>Couldn‚Äôt possibly be why you changed the focus to Syria cause they‚Äôre totally the same situation in all facets. </p>	0.716

I don't like the law. Absolutely should not have passed in the "bipartisan infrastructure bill." I agree everyone who voted for it should be primaried.     **That said, the title is absolutely fake news**. Nothing about the law requires a "kill switch." It doesn't specify implementation details at all. The technology has to be developed and deemed viable before it takes effect anyway, and if not by a certain date, an explanation as to why it's unfeasible has to be given.     Louis Rossmann did a good job explaining it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvqdJRpELSg)     Just because we understand the lunacy of the left doesn't mean we should be careless in our criticism of them.

If I were you I‚Äôd go to the actual source and read actual articles on why they consider making voting more difficult, racist. Rather than just parroting obvious strawman bullshit arguments.  I can tell you, the argument isn‚Äôt that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?  In your opinion, was the voting rights act necessary? Why or why not? Is it still necessary?	<td align=""left"">0.1</td>	0.756

Again, that‚Äôs just absurd strawman to make yourself feel better. I‚Äôd encourage you to interact with their actual arguments and writing rather than Fox news‚Äô or breitbart‚Äôs interpretation.

Yes, a Fox News video. We should definitely base our opinions and world view off of anecdata.

Those tests are expensive and require protein degradation and gel electrophoresis. You can also do other things like coombs tests against covid genetic material.

As a result if you really want to know if your body has developed an immune reaction against covid, you have to test all of these.	0.727

The department administrator later claimed that she didn't say it. She is a lying sack of shit and I'm glad she is gone from my department.	0.858
Sweetheart, don't hurt yourself too much tripping over your propaganda. Democrats would love nothing more than print at home ballots and drop boxes. Voting rights for illegals and maybe let's just throw online voting. You're pathetic because you've been so brainwashed to think that you're so virtuous that you think we are the ones outside the circle. Save me the propaganda, I wasn't born in the us. Your scumbag gov tried the same color revolution on my country twice. I know exactly what's happening, perhaps YOU'RE the snowflake here with your hurt feelings and constantly having to worry about what next big corrupt thing your party will be guilty of next. Just because the corporate media isn't broadcasting the truth, doesn't give you the excuse to be stupid.	> The sos sucks (rino)	0.909
First, I would really encourage you to seek out their actual views directly rather than the rights‚Äô worst possible interpretation of them. If you always assume the worst possible interpretations of their arguments you‚Äôre never going to be interacting with them honestly or in good faith. You should want to know their honest arguments so you can debate what they‚Äôre actually saying or trying to say rather than what people say they‚Äôre saying. We can never make progress when there are so many layers of abstraction from the source. These bubbles and echochambers are terrible for all of us.  I‚Äôll paste from another reply:  ‚ÄúI can tell you, the argument isn‚Äôt that minorities and people in poverty are too stupid to get voter IDs, but that there are more barriers. What if a state passes voter ID laws then shuts down the majority of DMVs in poorer areas like they do with voting precincts?‚Äù	<p>Let‚Äôs say 1 year ago there were 100,000 cases a day. 100% of those in hospital were unvaccinated, because the vaccines weren‚Äôt out at the time. </p>	0.831
They impose tyranny while hiding behind ‚Äúsafety‚Äù. First of all, what science do they have that the vaccine is going to stop the spread of COVID and keep all the precious little snowflakes ‚Äúsafe‚Äù?? I can‚Äôt believe American companies sell out this fast, not one ounce of fight in them for liberty. Are that many companies leveraged by guberment money or are all the corporate board rooms that full of blue haired fat lesbians??	<p>That is a great feeling! I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre coming round.

And even then, you still can't provide a name of someone who was disenfranchised.	<p>But I agree with some of it. Retail is a brutal job sometimes and is very frustrating.

Lmao I love this, definitely gonna use this	<p>Barrett has shown that she is ok with state governments mandating vaccines. That isn&#39;t surprising, because state governments (and local governments underneath them such as school boards) have had vaccine mandates for around a century now. The Biden mandate is coming from the federal government though. Legally speaking, that&#39;s a completely different animal. I do understand that from your point of view, you probably see state vaccine mandates and federal vaccine mandates as being the same morally and politically speaking. But legally they are very separate. I would not be surprised if Barrett thinks federal vaccine mandates are unconstitutional despite her being ok with state vaccine mandates.

Neither. Last time I saw in mid 2020 they had changed it to right leaning centrist views	By communism they don't mean communism, because they don't know what it is. What they actually mean historically is bolshevism, the right-wing precursor to totalitarianism that developed in the Soviet Union. The US had a major attack on labor earlier in the last century and anti-labor oriented US business and political interests attacked supporters of labor/workers as being communists by associating people advocating for more democracy, better labor standards, equality, unions as advocates for the brutality of the Russian state, and wanting to bring that to America.	0.841

Couldn‚Äôt the same be said about Republicans and those that stormed the capital vs democrats and looters / rioters? Trump never denounced / told Them to stop until it was too late. And democratic leaders haven‚Äôt had to deal with rioters or looters yet (to an extent that has previously happened), so there is no way to address it from a higher political level.   I‚Äôm going to guess you do not side with the people  that stormed and broke into the capitol right? We just don‚Äôt see it because we don‚Äôt have transparency on either side. It‚Äôs Red or Blue only, and there‚Äôs no delimitation from each side.   It‚Äôs not about POLITICIANS, it‚Äôs about us - the people. The ones who are in the day to day, not being controlled by what puppet media or big office people are doing. We can‚Äôt let politicians decide what we think about the other political party. They‚Äôre all corrupt, they all do things to make us hate each other, they want to distract us from whatever they throw in bills and push things through when we are fighting.	I‚Äôm sorry, which one of blindly follows the word of an egotistical orangutan? Which one of us supported the storming of the United States Capitol and the death of the Sitting Vice President? Whose the sore loser who thinks that the election is rigged because their guy lost? Sounds like the piece of shit is projecting.	0.765
We just don‚Äôt see it, or hear it, because we don‚Äôt talk specifically about those people who are doing it. We say ‚Äúthe leftists‚Äù or ‚Äúthe democrats‚Äù, not the looters.   Just like democrats say ‚Äúthe republicans that stormed the capitol‚Äù. Real people, on both sides of the fence, know that looters/rioters, and those that stormed the capitol are not either democrats or republicans.   We need to stop arguing with each other (not saying you and I are, generally) and get on the same page that there are assholes on both sides that we - as a people - need to work on bettering our own parties.   It‚Äôs Red or Blue only, and there‚Äôs no delimitation from each side. We all need to do better.   We need to get dirty money and stocks out of politics. There would be a big swing, in both parties, if this were to happen. They would care a lot more about the people that build this nation instead of the companies.    We need to stand up to OUR OWN party leaders and say ‚Äúhey - I agree with you on X, y, and X, but we really need to rework how you think about a and b‚Äù. It‚Äôs disgusting that we as a people have so little say, or are ignored in what our views our. Currently, we HAVE to match what our leaders say.	<p>From the White House website. Doesn‚Äôt really go into too much there either. Doesn‚Äôt blame covid or call it peaceful protests. They explicitly mention the economic mismanagement as part of the reason why and had even earlier in this Q&amp;A talked about how the US has exported chicken to feed the starving population. They are not trying to brush this under the rug and specifically call for democracy. They even mention that the Cuban Americans are the best bet to enact change. They are taking a hands off approach I would surmise, which is lame, and needs more pressure to get them to do better by Cuba. Again, nothing supports the cherry picking statements here. So link me to something that supports your viewpoint please, otherwise my point still stands.</p>	0.774

Yeah this isn‚Äôt even going to go anywhere. You can‚Äôt even say that those people are not republicans, or if they are self-proclaimed and you don‚Äôt agree with him.   THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. Not politicians - us. You just said the media is the biggest problem, and that‚Äôs all trump used to communicate - Twitter. Twitter is just another form of media.   And a tweet that simply says ‚Äúgo home‚Äù, when none of those people are on their phone and distracted is useless. Go there, go on TV, get off your ass and take action, send backup, do something to make your prescience known.   Be honest - do you really think, that if during the looting and rioting AOC or some democrat texted ‚Äúgo home‚Äù, they would have listened?   Again, our problem is that WE don‚Äôt stop ourselves (citizens) or believe we need to. And I‚Äôm not saying with guns, but with common sense before all this shit happens.	Lol	1.0

I mean yea, I fully support any gun ownership as long as gun laws are super strict. Preferably some training for anything bigger than some pistols but mainly a register of what guns are where, crackdowns on loophole selling etc. Stricter laws the bigger the gun gets but not things like financial restrictions or time based, it still has to be possible to get guns if you really want something bigger.	<p>Russia invading Ukraine would cause a Ukrainian Civil War that the west is unwilling to fight.</p>	0.848
Why do you vote for politicians, like [DeSantis, who wanted to let cane sugar companies grow near the Everglades](https://www.everglades.org/desantis-chose-sugar-over-floridians/) that are continuing to dissipate? He retracted it after much backlash on both sides, but he still proposed it   Why did republicans politicians repeal Obamacare quickly without a backup plan in place?   There are so many things we can point to on BOTH sides. I vote Democrat because I favor their opinions more than Republican opinions. While I still like some Republican views, I‚Äôm more of a 65/35 split favoring democrat.   Harris is doing the same as Pence in my opinion - nothing. Nothing worthwhile, not voicing any opinions that are productive, and not working with republicans to come build a better bridge between our parties. That is what our P/VP should be doing - work to make our relationship better together. Find middle ground. And I‚Äôm not saying they need to go meet, greet, get dinner and schmooze. We need a President that can make our sides work together FOR the people. The problem is whoever is above the local government level is corrupt. They rarely favor the US citizen and worry more about lining their own pockets. We didn‚Äôt criticize good old Ted Cruz for heading out to Cancun when there was an emergency in Texas (although I think more and more people are starting to dislike him for many reasons now).   We can all do better, but our politicians on both sides can do a hell of a lot better.   AOC is right - ‚Äúthe whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable‚Äù. But do you think she was talking about those burning and breaking into buildings? It‚Äôs about assumptions. We can say the same level of effort went into the trump tweet of ‚Äúgo home‚Äù. Our politicians suck. We can all do better.   If you don‚Äôt think at least half of the republicans and half of the democrats are corrupt - you‚Äôre a part of the problem. We need a political reform.	Guess what? I might be fairly conservative, but I'm not going to straight up ignore an argument that is being presented to me. That's what indoctrinated people do. I have actually thought about what they are saying, but because they are narcissistic and generally awful, they aren't going to present an alternative view. I am asking if there is any alternative work, because until I know the full story I can't really begin to think anything useful.	0.892
How are gun laws "strict" if you could buy one with something you could gook up in Photoshop in 3 minutes?       The people who voted for Cuomo killed more people than anyone ever has with a firearm.  I think we need strict voter control.	Again this is fairly trivial to me, his policy stances are extremely bad mostly because he&#39;s one of the worst flip-floppers in office. He wouldn&#39;t answer tough questions on policy during the race, most of his policy platforms can and will directly impact my life (negatively I might add) if my state can&#39;t do anything to stop some of the worst ones, and I just don&#39;t see the upside. Everything bad about Trump is still there with Biden, only without any of the good policies that came with Trump... of course that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>	0.87

Can I ask, and be honest, do you agree with EVERYTHING that Trump did throughout their presidency? Do you think he took the right approach most of the time?   In primaries, I did not vote for them. When it came to trump vs Biden - I did vote for them because I‚Äôm general I favor democratic views. I think both sides have benefits and flaws to them, but it‚Äôs a shame we vote on persons vs policies. Our system is broke.   Unfortunately we do not live in a democracy anymore. If republicans are our leaders, it‚Äôs a Republican agenda for 4 years. If Democrats are our leaders, it‚Äôs a Democratic agenda. Why can we not find common ground on topics? Politicians vote with their wallet.	<p>I am not debating you on leaving that shithole, but if you are &quot;with biden&quot; on how this was executed, you are no fucking conservative.</p>	0.769
So on that same side, do you think there were no republicans that utilized the rioting and looting for their own benefit? Or exacerbated it?   Again, those people that were at the capitol and looters are not democrats or republicans. They‚Äôre anarchists. They‚Äôre terrorists. And they‚Äôre people that do not know how to handle situations rationally. They follow a herd and nothing can change their mind.	<p>My point was that I want as few people to die as possible, idiots or not. So, if people are willing to purchase &#39;freedom&#39; with the lives of others, that&#39;s their decision and I can do nothing to try and change their mind, other than by annoying them slightly (like I am doing now).</p>	0.839

You‚Äôre right, he did, eventually. This was after it all started though. Things were already in movement. He could have came back and did more after it started to happen, no? He could have saw the volume of people and called in reinforcements to the capitol, no?   He played to their feelings. He said ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre hurt and this was stolen from us.‚Äù He wanted them to feel something, and encourage them to feel bad. He did not act quickly enough.   Biden also condemned the rioting / looting actions, but he didn‚Äôt have a platform, as a president, to do it while it was happening:  ‚Äú[I want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It's lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/08/31/politics/joe-biden-pittsburgh-violence-speech/index.html)‚Äù  Yes this article is basically saying he ripped trump, but that‚Äôs not the part we‚Äôre taking about. Just like trump played into the emotions of those at the Capitol. It‚Äôs a political game. It‚Äôs hard to go back and find tweets that aren‚Äôt in the news, but I‚Äôm sure politicians on Both sides - maybe not Biden or Harris - did condemn what was going on in Waukesha (prior to Rittenhouse issues during that day).	""This is unfair!"" we exclaim when we read about tyrants taking our most fundamental liberties away, but it really isn't. It is fair. If it were unfair, we'd fight back. We'd defend ourselves.

I DO NOT donate to **any** political party, but will donate to another one if it has over an 90 on www.charitynavigator.com and it‚Äôs non-politically aligned - then yes. Also, I will admit saying ‚Äúall‚Äù was too much of a generalization.   Healthcare - most countries already have government ran, and are efficiently ran. What I would rather see is something done to help people get insulin, and other life changing drugs, at a free/subsidized cost appropriate to income.   I support the Democratic Party as I believe in the right of choice in body/abortion; getting religion out of politics because that should not influence behavior; believe SOMETHING needs to be done about gun control - BUT NOT taking away guns, that‚Äôs just stupid; both sides agree shit needs done with elections - democrats think gerrymandering and republicans think voter fraud; media - both sides say they‚Äôll do shit, but never act on it. Democrats say they need redone, but they also are gerrymandering it at the same time; energy - we do need to think about our future outside of oil and coal, but we have to use it for now. We need to explain and set a  titration plan. It‚Äôs okay for now, but we need government funding to get other infrastructure readily available.   Our politicians suck.   I‚Äôll add in another $15 if you give 3 critical things that the Republican Party needs to improve on politically like I just mentioned about democrats (their asinine views on guns, oil and voting), and 3 Republican politicians who have no place being in government.	<p>It will be interesting to see our policies going forward. The fed rate really scares me. Everyone wants to spin the housing crisis to fit their narrative, but increases are mostly due to all time low rates.

If you head over to r/politics they'll tell you the Republicans are the fascist.  They're crazy.	First, once the proof is out there then republicans will call for most democrats to resign. Of course those who were wrongfully put in office will be asked to resign as well as those who contributed to the fraud. I think we all know they won't. Second, the demonstrated unchecked fraud will introduce doubt into every following election where a democrat wins in a region where they don't have at least 70% support - the fact that they did not resign will only double this effect. Third, if it is proven that the election results were wrong and they win reelection you will see states begin to leave the union. At this point the possibility of bloodshot will hang on a tightrope with one decision - do the democrats allow the red areas to leave.	0.9

Voting definitely sucks in some states.  Waiting in line for hours does suppress votes.  But that‚Äôs up to the states to fix it, not the federal government.  It‚Äôs simply not in their enumerated powers to regulate voting.  And since the 2020 election was the most fair election ever, what‚Äôs the issue?	<p>This was literally a Democrat thing. They turned the pandemic into the Trump pandemic to make sure he got all the blame. Never mind that 95% of current cases are Delta though, and Delta didn‚Äôt enter this country until March‚Äîtwo months AFTER Biden was inaugurated. So if you‚Äôre going to blame Trump for the initial wave, you have to blame Biden for the current one, especially given he had a vaccine gift-wrapped to him the moment he took office.</p>	0.876

You should try and read the fact check on the article posted. Ron Paul lied.	<p>I love pretty much everything Trump did policy wise but he was a dumpster fire outside of that. He couldn‚Äôt help but put his foot in his mouth anytime any kind of good news came out, giving his detractors an easy way to change the narrative. While he‚Äôs good at it implementing conservative policies, he‚Äôs awful at explaining the conservative position.

The CDC even said vacciated people can still transmit the virus, so really the only benefit you get is less outward symptoms.

Last year I‚Äôd go into a store without a mask and some people would bat an eye, but not anymore. After I got the vaccine I‚Äôve basically lived my life as if this never happened, and quite frankly before getting the vaccine I wasn‚Äôt worried about this for more than a few weeks.

Lol, don‚Äôt worry, 81 million people didn‚Äôt vote for Biden he just got 81 million ‚Äúvotes‚Äù from the Soros voting machines.  Good tactic though, try to sew discord amongst Repubs by instigating in-fighting. Quick note for others, when you check the comment history for a black-pillers, you‚Äôll see a lot of sports related comments. For whatever reason they use sports subs to boost their karma/perceived credibility with little to no previous politics comments (they‚Äôll delete the political comments shortly after making them so you don‚Äôt see their obvious slant).  Anyone that was around during the 2008-2012 elections will remember how the burgeoning state-sponsored propaganda maligned McCain/Romney as the ‚Äúworst politician ever to disgrace Republican politics‚Äù even though they were vanilla, go-along-to-get-along politicians. Hell, main stream lefties said John McCain was so traumatized by his captivity in the Vietnam War that he was a threat to National security and would launch nuclear weapons unilaterally (like they said with Trump). For Romney, the Democrat/news industrial complex claimed that he was so radical he would reinstate segregation and Romney turned out to be a RINO/Democrat.  Long story short if you‚Äôre a Conservative/Republican/Classic Liberal/freedom minded American, you‚Äôre constantly barraged by disinformation by main stream media, establishment politicians, and black-pill psyop peddlers like the commenter above.	<p>The last couple years got me never wanting to set foot in the city again though, and I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s grounded in any kind of reality or just from watching too many of these kinds of videos</p>	0.8

Exactly what is happening right now with the clot shot AKA poison jab, prescient...and of course a direct quote from the CDC or pharma is considered "disinformation" if it doesnt fit the agenda. So frustrating. Do NOT comply. Thats the takeaway, no clot shot no muzzle. Have to say it a thousand times if necessary before people stand up.	I don't disagree with this, but this does tend to be worked out in the free market. All of the FF places around me advertise $10/hr or more, despite the minimum wage being $7.25 and us being in a relatively low COL city. They are competing with each other for employees, so offering significantly less money than other places is going to leave you without workers.	0.78

It‚Äôs the standard of care. Being intubated is painful. Fentanyl has a short half life (20mins) so people wake up fast, and most people aren‚Äôt allergic because it is semisynthetic and doesn‚Äôt cause histamine release like traditional opioids. Compared to traditional opioids fentanyl causes  less delirium, less hypotension, and less effects on respiratory drive. Morphine and dialaudid make people goofy as shit and tank blood pressure. They give morphine to you specifically when you‚Äôre dying because of its effects on breathing.  Anyways, we aren‚Äôt blasting people with Perk 30s we bought from Billy Bob down the road. We are infusing micrograms/hr via infusion pumps. The only thing that makes fent more dangerous than any other opioid is dose. We can dose accurately.

Trump is afraid of being left out in the cold and not being able to play kingmaker, so he's changing the narrative in an effort to keep a foot in the door.	<li>he chose to lie about his experience to get a job he wasn‚Äôt qualified to perform</li>	0.797
Holy crap boys. I get it if you don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated I support your freedom to choose, but picking and choosing the data like the author did in this article is junk science.

It is generally considered a perk of the job that you can park your car wherever and whenever you like in the city with no consequence, contributing massively to the cities congestion.

It‚Äôs difficult to know where to start with such a ridiculous argument. There is the potential for huge fallout forcing people who fall accidentally pregnant to carry to term. It can cause considerable mental harm to the woman carrying, and you are potentially ensuring an unwanted child is brought into the world.  Have you seen what neglect does to a child? Have you seen what abuse does? You can sit on your moral high horse if you want, but for me the real consideration has to be what kind of life would that child be brought into.  Saying people should just never have sex, or have bullet proof contraception (even the pill can fail), is idealistic nonsense. If you actually have a shit about children and their welfare you‚Äôd look beyond trying to control what an individual does in response to an unwanted pregnancy.	<p>Tell me again how the vaccine stops the spread?</p>	0.814
Where did I say it was acceptable? You act like I‚Äôm glad she got shot. But you don‚Äôt willing try to climb through a window with armed guards in the damn capital and then expect people to act surprised you got shot. You think that cop knew her intentions outside of what her actions showed? Try doing the same thing in my house and you‚Äôll get shot all the same.	The plan is evil to begin with, but if the articles are not true, that is a good avenue to try to dismantle the plan. If vaccinated people can in fact get and spread the disease (they can) and are being severely undercounted (they are) then the narrative falls apart.	0.894
Right, so by you‚Äôre logic you‚Äôre quite happy for children to be brought into the world that may suffer due to an environment that is far from healthy?  If the parents can‚Äôt support the child, why on earth should they go through with the birth? Do you think it‚Äôs acceptable for a child to perhaps not have their needs met?    It‚Äôs the ‚Äòparents responsibility‚Äô to raise the child for 18 years - which apparently means they‚Äôll suddenly ‚Äòget it‚Äô and do a good job‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre not responsible enough to make a decision about the right course of action to abort or not?	<p>It&#39;s pathetic and it&#39;s backwards thinking. The MSM loves it. The Dems rule by it. The GOP and other middle America types sit back and go to work, go home and watch tv, and don&#39;t do anything about it.

I said it wasn‚Äôt perfect. But downvote away pussy.	<p>Basically it stated that those healthy folks in their 20s who were fully vaccinated before contracting COVID had a 7x higher chance of death compared to healthy unvaccinated folks in their 20s who contracted COVID. Mostly due to the increased health side effects being caused by the vaccines themselves in combination with the virus.</p>	0.836
So I‚Äôm presuming you support policies that help mothers/fathers provide the best possible car for the child once it is born? I presume you‚Äôd fully support welfare and childcare resources for those who cannot meet the needs of the child all by themselves? Or is it some binary thing of ‚Äúalive or dead‚Äù where quality of that life means fuck all?  If you fully support the above, then we may disagree but I could see your stance. If you‚Äôre of the view that the parents are on their own once the child is born, then you‚Äôre not pro life at all, you‚Äôre pro control and don‚Äôt care about welfare of the child at all.	<p>Anything a woman can do, a man pretending to be a woman can do better. </p>	0.688

Serious question about abortion.  It has been a conservative stance for quite some time, and a libertarian one as well, that the government cannot tell someone what to do with their own body. This argument has come up to fight against government mask mandates, taxes on one's labor (most conservatives and libertarians argue on the basis of Lockean natural law that one is entitled to the fruits of their own labor and the government shouldnt steal it through taxes as taxation is theft), public healthcare policy (fighting against single payer and the idea that others should subsidize others healthcare, etc). I remember right wing attack ads against Obama care calling him an evil commie for asking others to share the wealth, created by their labor, to pay for others healthcare.  If someone is not entitled to someone else's money through taxes, according to conservative and libertarian thought, why is a baby entitled to the labor of a mother to carry it and feed it for 9 months? Philosophically, it is an inconsistent position to argue that one is not entitled to others labor in other places but a baby is entitled to a mother's labor. If it's theft to have people work to produce value and pay taxes for others college or healthcare, it should be also considered theft for a woman to have to work to care for someone else.	<p>Like I said, continue to make yourself look stupid.</p>	0.837

 I Understand your argument and would generally agree with you, but there is strong evidence and data that shows ‚Äòunwanted‚Äô children create a number of issues within American society.  Freakinomics, a book published in 2005, dedicates a significant portion of its contents looking at the rise and fall of crime in America. Using data the authors come to the conclusion that Roe v Wade was one of, if not the number one cause for the reduction in crime.  As someone with a Catholic flair next to their username, I want you to know I‚Äôm not attacking you at all and completely support your right to choose and believe how you want, and am merely trying to provide a counter point to your comment.    When this argument that abortion reduced crime was first addressed in the book, it was rather controversial but the evidence heavily supported their thesis. That thesis being;      LEVITT: When you took the magnitude and you interacted with this very powerful unwantedness effect that‚Äôs been documented elsewhere, it actually suggests to us that abortion could be really, really important for reducing crime 15 or 20 years later.  The strength of the this argument is such that even the Supreme Court has referenced it.      This past May, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an abortion-related appeal from Indiana. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in an accompanying opinion, wrote, ‚ÄúSome believe that the United States is already experiencing the eugenic effects of abortion.‚Äù His citation: Freakonomics. ‚ÄúWhether accurate or not,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúthese observations echo the views articulated by the eugenicists and by[Planned Parenthood founder Margaret] Sanger decades earlier.‚Äù  Furthermore the authors recently readdressed the argument with the new data since the book was published and reaffirmed that their thesis holds true.       LEVITT: When we revisit the exact same specifications but looking from 1997 to 2014, it turns out that a very similar pattern emerges. The states that had high abortion rates over that period, that 30-year period, have crime rates that have fallen about 60 percent more than the states that had lowest abortion rates. I mean, these are really massive changes.  As I said at the start, I agree we should not be killing anyone we believe will become impoverished or a burden on society but I also believe and agree with the evidence that shows as these groups grow larger, society as a whole suffers.  Without an effective method to prevent unwanted children or drastically improve their lives, we are building a bomb with a 15-20 year timer.  It‚Äôs an ethical and moral catch 22 and even the authors acknowledge that.      LEVITT: On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think anyone who is sensible should use our hypothesis to change their mind about how they feel about legalized abortion. So it really isn‚Äôt very policy-relevant. If you‚Äôre pro-life and you believe that the fetus is equivalent in moral value to a person, well then, the tradeoff is awful‚Ä¶.      LEVITT: John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that‚Äôs a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you‚Äôre really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion.  I guess the question comes down to whether a reduction in crime and dependence on welfare system justify killing people predisposed to those issues?  TLDR: statistically speaking, killing unwanted people before has a positive effect on crime rates, and the reduction in crime since the early 90s‚Äô can be attributed directly to Roe v Wade. However the argument‚Äôs moral and ethical justification will be dependent on your own values and beliefs.	You make it illegal for them to be as you would like to say gifted these huge amounts of cash and my bet is the politicians would lose their minds and weed out plenty of crooked politicians but if we also make it law that politicians had to be audited &amp; provide clarity of income before taking office and every year in office, my bet is very few crooked politicians would run for political office &amp; the crooks already in office would abdicate office before an audit of their finances which would put them in jail.	0.874

Are there not child support laws in every state already? This politician just suggested taking it a step further to grandstand about his resistance to the pro-life movement.  Your question is fundamentally in bad faith. I'd just file it in along with other bad faith questions that pro-choicers throw out to avoid having to actually argue for their position (e.g. "if you're pro-life, why aren't you pushing harder for this or that welfare program." "If you think adoption is a good solution, why haven't you adopted every child?" "If you think abortion is bad, why don't you just focus on sex education and contraception").  Convenience abortions are wrong. It's not OK to kill a developing person. They should be banned or heavily restricted. If you think there are other policies that would also help achieve that goal, then I've got very good news for you: our society can do multiple things at once. So let us pro-lifers continue to focus our efforts where we believe they are most important, and you go right ahead and promote the solutions you like. I'm sure you will find support in the pro-life community wherever you are making good-faith efforts to reduce or eliminate unplanned pregnancies.	<p>Bernie told his followers for months that if he didn&#39;t win it was obviously bc there was fraud.

Let‚Äôs not forget many poor single mothers that seek abortions can‚Äôt see a way to afford the pregnancy itself.

The men who father the child should have legal and financial responsibility if a woman cannot legally abort a child.

When you get an abortion you do something that has a 100% chance of ending one life.  When you don't get vaccinated you increase the chance of the virus continuing to spread, so in a very real way you increase the chances of some large number of people dying by some very small amount.   It is similar to choosing to smoke in a restaurant. You expose others to second hand smoke, increasing their chances of getting lung cancer.  In all three of these cases, abortion, vaccination and smoking your choice affects those around you. The only difference is that abortion affects one individual extremely while vaccination and smoking affects many individuals a much smaller amount.	So, to the point of CURRENT systemic racism - my argument is that the current SYSTEM, in and of itself, is not racist and therefore not in need of major reform, as it was in the 50's and 60's, simply because historical injustices are still having effects on people, they are.

And the one guy in who's body Omicron developed affected pretty much the entire planet - which is 1/7.9 billion.   I haven't really done the math, but the point is - since the virus affects all other humans, compared to one life you only need to move the needle an extremely small amount.  And also - even if it's an extremely small chance - it's no longer "between me and God". Other humans are definitely involved.	> you now have evidence he is suffering from dementia	0.75

So what...the 5 million who died from COVID aren't significant enough?  Roe happened in 1973. It's been 49 years. That means on average we see 1.29 million deaths per year from abortions.  COVID has been around for 2 years and we've seen 5m deaths.  That's 2.5m per year.  You're going to get the vaccine now, right?	<p>The real disservice is that members of the media were so jaded against him that they mischaracterized what he was getting at <em>on purpose</em>.

Abortion takes 1M lives per year though, not just one. And it‚Äôs very possible the person who developed and spread Omicron ended up saving countless lives as it is a much weaker version of the disease and is crowding out other variants.   Also, even the flu claims something like 30,000-50,000 lives per year. It‚Äôs a smaller number sure, but is refusing the flu vaccine and going out when you‚Äôre sick the same thing, just to a smaller degree?   Also, if you‚Äôre worried and in a high risk group, supposedly getting vaccinated and boosted will protect you from severe illness. So what is the problem? Doesn‚Äôt that also change the probability of killing someone?	<p>I imagine Trumpers feel the same about Bernie.

It does change the probability. And your numbers might be correct. As I said my math was back of napkin.  The original reply said that the difference between the vaccine and abortion was that abortion affected other humans(well, one human) while getting the vaccine didn't.  I was just showing that the vaccine also affected other humans. I was not comparing if abortion took more lives than covid.  With the flu, yes...if you can spread the flu while asymptomatic then the same argument applies to the flu vaccine as well. This is why those in geriatrics are required to get vaccinated.  My original question asked if what would happen if OP replaced getting the vaccine with getting an abortion. It just seemed like those arguments were the same ones pro choice people make.	I love when they try that one. Let me use an example they'd understand:	0.838

Nope. Are you claiming all those 5 million were from unvaccinated? How about the fact that there have been more deaths since Biden took over as there was when Trump was President, and Biden has had the vaccine with over half the United States  vaccinated?

First - if you don't believe the vaccine is effective then discussing the original point is moot. Second - I'm not American.  But let's talk about your question.   Have a look at this first: [https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/](https://fox59.com/news/national-world/gap-between-covid-deaths-in-republican-vs-democrat-counties-larger-than-ever/)  According to this - Trump voting counties have 3x more residents die of COVID than Biden ones.   You may not believe Fox. You may not believe American numbers because you think that the left has fudged them.  So let's to zoom out of the US so that you're not so blinded by partisan politics:    https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths-by-vaccination  Now you can see the same kind of picture in other countries - that the unvaccinated are multiple times more likely to die from COVID than the vaxxed.  So that's the answer to your question: it's now the unvaxxed who are dying.  One last question: Trump himself is vaxxed, believes the vaccines work and told you that getting vaccinated is patriotic.   So Fox tells you the unvaxxed are dying.   Global stats tell you the unvaxxed are dying.   Trump himself tells you the unvaxxed are dying.  Will you get the vaccine now?	I actually think theres a lot of merit to that last point. For instance I am not a fan of trump. At all. I'm not at all a fan of Mike pence. However, I feel like pence has the experience and professionalism to do the job better than Trump despite that both exist in similar territory on my opinions of them.	0.857
In order to get an unfair edge in a competitive market, corporations can attempt to coerce the state into acting in their interest. Government officials are also not immune to corruption.

This is capitalism*- you just don't like it.*	Source?	1.0
The issue that I have is that your choice does effect others.  For each surge that we had, our hospitals were clogged full of unvaccinated people.  We had to shut down all non emergent cases and people seeking non covid care could not be seen.     As a physician I know that the current vaccine is still highly effective in keeping people from hospitalization and death.  Hopefully this will give us time for the production of the more effective medication.	<p>I say, <em>let them fight</em></p>	0.813

I agree about the tried and true vaccines. I do not understand the anti-vax stand on this at all. But COVID is a different case altogether. Just like the flu, there is really no true vaccine to eradicate it. The shot should be a choice and not mandated or forced.	<p>The worst part is, even if you don‚Äôt go there, the best the pro abortion side can say is ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know when life begins,‚Äù which means - THERE IS A POSSIBILITY even in that interpretation that a fetus is a human person - it isn‚Äôt rendered impossible. So then, even by that interpretation, it remains possible that you are killing a human person. Even with that view, the safest stance would be that we should not terminate because we cannot know if it is a person or not. Would you shoot wildly into a dark room because you cannot be sure if there is a person there or not, but you don‚Äôt happen to think there is?</p>	0.796

Domestic abusers use pregnancy to trap women in permanent relationships. They‚Äôll get her pregnant over and over and over again by sabotaging her birth control or through rape. Not to mention,   > Domestic violence is more common than any other health problem among women during pregnancy.   https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy  I sincerely hope I don‚Äôt get banned for posting this link. I‚Äôve peacefully participated in this sub for years, and I‚Äôd like to respectfully continue to do so.   Sadly,  > Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women.  https://hopeandsafety.org/learn-more/domestic-violence-and-pregnancy/  Women of every race and socioeconomic class are at risk of domestic violence, no matter how they are raised. Abusers are often incredibly charming; usually no one in their life knows how they treat women behind closed doors. Your daughters can all too easily wind up with one, even if you protect her and raise her right. Even if you think you‚Äôve never met an abuser, I assure you that you have. It is a societal secret that lurks in dark shadows.   I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a great man. I‚Äôm not suggesting that all women in abusive relationships should get abortions - please don‚Äôt think that. What I‚Äôm saying is that women do deserve to preserve their own life. An abortion can be the saddest thing that ever happens to a woman, and you are talking about mothers, sisters, and especially your daughters when you imply that every woman seeking abortion is ‚Äúloose.‚Äù Sometimes, it is quite literally a matter of life and death.   I wish this kind of energy was focused on publicly shaming and humiliating men who skip out on child support. One of the biggest reasons women get abortions is because they know they can‚Äôt rely on the father for financial support and can‚Äôt support a child alone.   Please don‚Äôt meet me with hate. Please don‚Äôt abuse me in my messages. I am speaking for women who have no voice. Please allow women to prioritize their own safety. A party of family values is incompatible with misogyny, and you will attract more women to your party by giving them safety.	<p>Also impeachment is going to lead to the exact opposite of the healing Biden called for. That&#39;s why he hasn&#39;t taken a decisive stance. Remember 80% of Republican voters thought the election was unfair.

It took forever to actually get a response for the problem and the President of the United States wasn't ever even who called for reinforcements.

The impeachment article says that during an address to supporters on the day of the violence, Trump "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged ‚Äî and foreseeably resulted in ‚Äî lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a county anymore.'

But those words Trump spoke and the damage they caused means nothing to you?

Almost like an investigation is needed....	Know the logic of your position.  the right's is complete except for the subversion of liberty to the woman.

Otherwise, if you eliminate the liberty concern the right's position is consistent.	0.764
Let‚Äôs be clear, I do not support violence. Burning buildings, looting, etc, yeah lock those fuckers up, idgaf what ‚Äúside‚Äù they‚Äôre on. So don‚Äôt try to paint me as some leftist apologist because I‚Äôm not.   But you‚Äôre trying to make the reason people were protesting equivalent when they couldn‚Äôt be farther.  On one hand, you have people protesting against police brutality and racial injustice - two very real problems that deserve to be protested against. And again, in case it wasn‚Äôt clear, I condemn the violence associated with those movements. But, in the same way you claim about Jan 6th, most of those movements were peaceful.  On the other hand, you have a group storming the capital of the country (with the help of capital police) to ‚Äúprotest‚Äù a ‚Äústolen‚Äù election (which is completely fabricated and no such evidence of a stolen election exists). These people interrupted the tallying of votes from a national election through physical force AND with the help and direction of the political party that was losing said election.  Idk about you, but the latter here is much more egregious IMO.	<p>Five hours later and this comment still sits here. You‚Äôre on the ball mods, as usual.</p>	0.763

This is true.  There are almost no African Americans in Ukraine.  So you automatically know the murder rate is lower there.	Again this is fairly trivial to me, his policy stances are extremely bad mostly because he&#39;s one of the worst flip-floppers in office. He wouldn&#39;t answer tough questions on policy during the race, most of his policy platforms can and will directly impact my life (negatively I might add) if my state can&#39;t do anything to stop some of the worst ones, and I just don&#39;t see the upside. Everything bad about Trump is still there with Biden, only without any of the good policies that came with Trump... of course that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>	0.736
First of all, things are already chaos, you can thank Trump and his cronies for that.  Second, I couldn‚Äôt notice your lack of defense for Trump‚Äôs quote of ‚Äúif you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.‚Äù Care to perform your mental gymnastics for me to justify that one?

This is literally part of the findings of the 1/6th committee. Getting Trump to tell his supporters to leave the capital was a big ask that was at best half-assed.

This is a bad bill and sad to see such support in the comments.  Paternity can't be proven at conception. So you'll make a ton of men financially responsible over an accusation, one that will take 9 months to prove.

A better bill would have been the inverse; if a woman can choose to medically abort a child, the male should be able to choose to financially abort.   The problem with broken families in America is the fact that the US Government financially incentives women to split from the father of their child. This new bill actually enforces that concept.

You do know that your body doesn't know why it's producing the injected spike proteins from the mRNA vaccine, right? This is why it stops over time, since the protein stresses the body out (inflammation of the heart, and other reported side effects). The biggest thing though is that the vaccine creates no B and T cells. These cells identify infection and recall the best immuno response to fight it.   Natural immunity creates these cells, which is why it's better than any vaccine available for much longer.  The vaccines may help the elderly, obese and those with comorbidities a bit from initial infection, but for the younger and healthy it's not that necessary.	<p>The Woke are ruining everything they touch.

Usually vested after x number of years at the company.  I make about the same in stock options as salary and I&#39;m not rich by any means.

I don't understand the title of this post. How is it that pro choice is equivalent to pro-life about one person. If you are pro-life about one person, then that means that you believe one person should not have the choice to have an abortion. Which person is it that you are claiming a pro-choice person is thinking about?	That process got shitcanned when Biden changed the withdrawal deadline, which then led to the deal basically getting set aside by all parties involved.	0.756
Sorry but last time I checked if you had Covid wether they were bad symptoms or not, you stayed home. Vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting Covid or spreading it. Carhartt doesn‚Äôt have a policy where you can have Covid, but if your symptoms are low then you can come to work.  Fuck the mandate it doesn‚Äôt do anything.	<p>How pathetic the lives of the lib trolls must be.  Home in moms basement posting their moronic bullshit all day long.</p>	0.778
1. 95% of biologists absolutely do not agree that life begins at conception. That is objectively false.  2. An abortion is causing no harm until there is a fetus that can feel pain. Killing a human is wrong because you are causing pain and harm to the life of someone. At 8 weeks, the bundle of cells in a uterus cannot feel pain, nor does it have any thoughts or emotions nor plans for it‚Äôs future.  3. Therefore there is no reason to think an abortion is wrong, and in fact quite the opposite is true. If a pregnancy/baby is going to have a negative effect on the life of the person carrying it out and cause them harm, it would be morally wrong to force someone to carry a pregnancy to term when they would rather get an abortion that is not causing harm to a life.  4. This point is moot as an abortion is not killing anything other than an idea of a possible person that may or may not have ever even existed.	<p>Because there is no xenophobic rhetoric or racist policy. </p>	0.857

Ok, I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I don't care.   They're a private company.  If they want their employees vaxxed, that's on them.    We live in a garbage society, where progressives and populists compete to be as dumb as possible on everything.    Here are some core truths, some of which will anger progressives, others will anger anti-vax (as in how I define anti-vax, cultural opposition to the vaccine, as opposed to how the Dems define anti-vax, which is anti-mandate...I am pro cultural vaccine, anti mandate vaccine)...  1). The vaccine dramatically reduces the likelihood of going to the hospital if you contract Covid.  It does not have nano machines in it, it is not the mark of the beast, and whatever negative long term effects of the vaccine are *less* than the long term effects of Covid, regardless of age or health.  More unvaccinated people are dying of/with Covid, than vaccinated.   A pox on populists.    2.). The vaccine(s) don't do a damn thing to prevent the spread of Covid.  It should not be mandated because of that.    3) the vaccines don't prevent you from getting Covid.  Just from going to the hospital with sever symptoms.   2 and 3 are a pox on progressives.    4.). People are idiots, and if they get Covid, despite being vaxxed, race to the hospital wasting time and resources because they think Covid is a death sentence and they've bowed at the altar of Covid.  A pox on progressives.    5.). The vax has been hilariously mis-marketed.  It is not a vaccine against Covid, but a flu shot.  That was and is the most realistic response to a respiratory virus.   We will never cure Covid (a pox on progressives), just like we'll never cure th cold or the flu, but annual Covid shots *will* be effective against annual Covid variants (a pox against populists...who don't get their annual flu shots either).     6.). because progressives and populists are the base of their respective parties, we are fucked as a country.  We cannot be reasonable, rational, and pragmatic, about anything, because it's a tribal thing to those anonymous people on social media that influence culture.    7.). Natural immunity is the most effective defense against Covid.  If you had it, good.  If you haven't, you're gonna get it, and if you have anything remotely resembling co-morbidities, get the jab.    All these things are true.  There is more than enough data to prove these things, that the jab doesn't prevent the spread (which means it shouldn't be mandated), yet the jab does reduce dangerous symptoms that hospitalize and kill those who contract Covid (which means culturally it should be encouraged for one's own health).    But we're not allowed.  It's either or.  Those who have the time to adhere to ideologically pure positions (ie the unemployable or young) will dominate the discourse without wisdom to intervene and put its foot down and say to each side "you're wrong on this but right on this" and the "you're right on this but wrong on this".	Maybe wearing the same dirty mask day in and out and leaving it in your pocket or car isn‚Äôt the most hygienic way to stay safe.  Maybe the mask could collect the airborne virus, that is so small that it slips through double cotton like nothing is there, and people are infecting themselves through the dirty masks. Maybe the mask gives people a false sense of security, and they don‚Äôt social distance as much as they should.<br/>	0.753
The interior was reminiscent of the worst parts of the third world, probably with less crime	<p>Today, after decades of nearly invisible inflation in the U.S., many Americans have little idea what it looks like. Nearly half of the U.S. population was born after 1981, the last year of double-digit consumer price increases. But America‚Äôs long inflation holiday shows signs of ending.

Pro-choice is about a lot of things.  - Shirking responsibility. - Population control, particularly among minorities. - Cultural hijacking.  After all, what better way than to make enemies of the people than to claim Pro-Lifers are against woman's rights. - Guilt-free murder. - Moving the goal posts on morality.  Pro-choice has nothing to do with being responsible or having respect for individuals, let alone women.  I will say, the pro-life/pro-choice argument is fundamentally flawed and has been for awhile.  But that's an argument dictated by the radical left.  Why are we not leading by example and teaching responsibility?   How did it ever become okay to live without consequences?  When did it become acceptable to not learn fiscal responsibility or accountability for our actions?  Have a baby, you should have one choice, and choice only...   And no one can ever tell me with certainty that there so many rapes or incestuous relationships in this country.  The numbers don't add up.  Abortion is a true failure of American values.  Plain and simple.	<p>See, in the past, Republicans and Democrats disagreed mostly on principles.  But nowadays, Democrats look like they have simply lost grip on reality.  They constantly confuse reality with idiotic wishful thinking.  They have become unable to differentiate between what they wish the world was like and how it actually is.  And this is evident everywhere, from foreign policy to domestic economics.  It&#39;s terrifying.</p>	0.834

Being unvaccinated provides none of these benefits, which means more opportunity for mutations.

It promotes free thought and respectful debate or discussion between those who may agree with you and those who do not. Being condescending is not allowed, and members must conduct themselves professionally. The sub is aimed to help rational minded people effectively learn of each others viewpoints and live harmoniously regardless if viewpoints are opposed.

They have companies like Amway.  Medical marijuana industry wants more lax FDA regulation than Big Pharma gets.  Their issue is not with weed but with the herbal supplement and vitamin market, giving weed products FDA medical labels without the years of research to back them.

> At the time of the transactions, congress was scrambling to put together the CARES Act, a monumental emergency relief package that cost more than $2 trillion, and which Crenshaw supported. The Republican-led Senate approved the bill on March 25, the day Crenshaw bought stock in SPX and the S&P 500 fund. The package passed the House the next day, when Crenshaw scooped up Southwest and Kinder Morgan, and was signed into law by Trump on March 27, the day that Crenshaw acquired his stake Boeing.  None of this was behind closed doors. Most of it was index fund ETFs which I was told was supposed to be the only allowable investment by this sub, and the rest of it was after the completely public bill text was unsurprisingly passed.  What a bullshit hit piece. It's talking about the ROI on 6 individual trades not his actual portfolio.  > But in late April, the manufacturer passed on the deal, opting instead to raise $25 billion in private investment thanks to moves that the Federal Reserve made independently of the CARES Act. The day that Crenshaw bought Boeing, markets snapped their brief positive burst, and the company led the boards that day in losses. His investment has now grown more than 38%.  The S&P ETFs he bought way out performed this purchase by nearly double. After BA opted for private funding rather than the offered public funding.

Answer:üëá  Sadly, it‚Äôs the West that‚Äôs been expanding its DS Military infrastructure footprint throughout Europe; deploying NATO nuclear missiles, U.S. missile defense systems and special forces along Russia‚Äôs doorstep.  Putin hasn‚Äôt been toppling government(s) in Eastern Europe, installing proxies, or deploying Russian missiles and Soviet defense systems. It‚Äôs been the West, moving East. Since the end of the Cold War, the West has been systematically cutting Russia off from the rest of the world, using NATO.  What‚Äôs happening in Ukraine today is the same thing that happened in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that instance, America put nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Soviet Union ‚ÄòRESPONDED‚Äô by putting missiles in the Caribbean (via submarines) and Cuba.  America learned about the Soviet missiles in the Caribbean and Cuba and freaked out bc of the extremely close proximity of the Soviets‚Äô military infrastructure. With Soviet missiles that close, America would not have sufficient time to analyze, evaluate and respond to a potential threat. America went nuts, demanded the Soviets immediately remove the missiles.  The Soviets had made the same complaints and demands about America‚Äôs nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. The United States said those missiles were defensive. After the Soviets responded in kind putting the same in the Caribbean and Cuba, America said the missiles were an aggressive threat.  The Cuban Missile Crisis had begun. The Soviets were not the aggressors, they were the respondent.  The United States wasn‚Äôt having it and began plans to invade Cuba, put 100,000 plus troops on Florida beaches, set up an illegal Naval blockade in the Caribbean blocking all ships from reaching Cuba and the United States, flew Spy Planes over Cuba (which got shot down, killing Air Force Pilot Rudolph Anderson). The U.S. also attacked Soviet submarines which were lawfully patrolling in international water and hadn‚Äôt fired on anyone.  Pretty hypocritical, right?  The Soviets were simply responding in kind, and refused to back down. In the end, in order to avoid nuclear war, America agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey, and thereafter the Soviets agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba, restoring the status quo and balance of power to the position the parties were in before America dramatically expanded its military footprint.  Today, we see the EXACT SAME scenario happening. The West has been building up its NATO footprint, putting NATO weapons, nuclear missiles, missile defense systems and special forces in former Soviet states.  Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan we‚Äôre a step too far for Putin inasmuch as this is literally on the doorstep of Russia.  Putin has amassed his extraordinary military machinery and has told the world that NATO missiles are NOT going into Ukraine. Putin has also demanded the West remove its missiles from the former Soviet states surrounding Russia.  Sound familiar!  Putin will win this battle, NATO and the rest of the world will agree to restore the status quo and remove NATO missiles. If the Biden / NATO missiles currently on their way actually enter Ukraine, you will see Putin respond with the use of his vast military.üëá  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bwWW3sbk4EU	<p>But once again the post was originally to point out how stupid the ok guested outrage was, no matter the times one can say it may or may not exist.</p>	0.84

Oh I can totally rebut that but I don't even think it's worth typing Because unless I appear on Fox News in a bowtie you're not going to listen to me anyway.  A lot of the Battleground States had their legislators pass laws that said the mail-in ballots could not be counted until after in-person voting head finished. Some states had the exact opposite of this. Florida, for example, counted the mail in first. When election night started Florida was looking very blue and as the same-day voting came in it shifted red. In States that had the opposite of this system the opposite thing happened, they shifted blue. They stopped counting in-person votes and switch to mail in votes in the middle of the night because there were no more in-person votes left to count, and it was time to start counting the mail-in votes. For those of us who didn't go to sleep on that night, we saw the whole thing play out in real time, just as had been reported weeks before in most news sources, just, maybe not the ones you use.	<p>Iirc, Hillary Clinton spent the most amount of money in a presidential campaign.

I might care about this if the vaccine worked. All it does now is basically help you get less sick, like a complicated form of Tylenol. Doesn't stop the spread, doesn't stop you getting sick.

Crazy how a bunch of idiots like y'all have the nerve to call someone else unhirable when half of you can't open a pdf.	<p>When covid first entered the scene and many people said it didn&#39;t worry them because side-effects appeared mild, others chimed in to say that we have to be cautious because we don&#39;t know the long-term effects. Why doesn&#39;t this rationale also apply to the vaccines? You can&#39;t test for something that happens years down the road regardless of how quickly you give it emergency authorization.</p>	0.854
I'd rather jack off with sandpaper, to be honest.	<p>All in all interesting information. VERY different from what the US has been claiming about the vaccine, but does generally support the idea of the vaccine being a deterrent (except for hospitalization cases). Since there has def not been adequate amount of testing for long term side effects (can&#39;t speed up time, yet the fda somehow did for covid <em>cough cough political approval cough</em>) I still don&#39;t see this as being necessary for everyone to get, especially younger people. It&#39;s a solid idea for the older at risk population and only if they want it. The percent increases in benefits are pretty small considering vaccines are supposed to give you near 100% inoculation. </p>	0.893

Funny that's what the dog walker Doreen said. And he works 25 hours a week and isn't sure that's not to much.   Your concerns are legitimate in a few scenarios, however they took those talkings points and used them as a spearhead to accomplish the goal of not working at all or barely at all while screaming for more free shit. So in a way, the people shouting for more worker protections, have damaged the image of that argument more than any other group.	<p>A position of reason and reasonable tolerance is the best counterargument against this sort of absurdity.

There's always r/Teachers... practically the same mindset.	AR is a short hand for the original brand of the riffle, Armalite - it&#39;s the Armalite Riffle. Armalite developed this riffle and then sold the design to Colt when Armalite couldn&#39;t put up a military contract for the riffles. The AR-15 was the 15th design in the series, but still wasn&#39;t considered military grade. Thus, Colt started manufacturing them as self-loading riffles (a.k.a. semi-automatic) for sportsmen. They are highly comfortable and durable due to the history of their development. Since the AR designation and general design are no longer patented, other brands can produce similar riffles and continue to call them AR-15s. Thus, calling this particular riffle model AR is like calling all recreational discs a Frisbee. It just stuck. </p>	0.666

I mean, in reality I'm sure he has a team of people who are better qualified to make that call. I doubt any one president has been like "oh yes, I'm going to select this judge in particular for the supreme court." Biden especially at his age probably has his cabinet taking the reigns moreso than others.  Everyone has their own political beliefs, but judges get where they are because they're able to make decisions where the interpretation of the constitution and laws can be thoroughly explained.  Unless of course you are saying that simply because he's a democrat, in which case I would ask that you try to be a little more open minded, as the dismissal of others simply due to political affiliation isn't really helping anyone.

Unless the intent is to day "you'll turn on it too," but the asking of the question it makes them sound like they're still hoping for it.

Nope, certain things can be made public.	<p>Current laws acknowledge that police need the benefit of the doubt legally in order to do their job.

What&#39;s next, maybe we should just defund and disband all the police depts like progressives want after all? Who cares about surging crime! That&#39;s the logical next step because very few cops would perform the job anyways under the new liability that we are now suggesting they should burden. Already critical police shortage and surging crime rates, yet apparently even some conservatives now jumping on the anti-cop bandwagon trying to strip all of their legal protection and open them up to being jailed for honest mistakes.</p>	0.864

Some facts about Denmark.  -  84% Healthcare system is funded by tax dollars. The other 16% comes from patient co-pays.  -Denmark spends roughly 10% of it's GDP on healthcare.

Compared to US which spends about 17% of GDP and receives life expectancy of 78.8 and an infant mortality rate is 6.8 per 1k births.  - Denmark has a population of roughly 6 million. 80% of which has received 2 atleast vaccine doses.

Word.	I'd also like to point out that the democrats only started to support gay rights when they realized it was politically advantageous to do so. In the 90s and early 00s, they didn't like homosexuals either. And now they want to act like they've always been champions for their rights. Like how they chanted BLM, then voted in the guy who signed the 1993 crime bill who's VP was a DA. LMAO Also all these companies want to pretend they support gays when not a single one supported them before gay marriage went through and it was popular to do so.

Just to give some perspective; Sweden is a welfare state with tax-payer-funded, universal healthcare.    73% of their population has chosen to get fully vaccinated. Which is about 10% more than the US.  Their population is about 11 million that live in a land area of 174,000 sqmi. This means they have a population similar to of Ohio in an area about the size of California. Their population density is almost half that of the US (57 per sqmi vs.92)  There's no such thing as sick-days in Sweden because you're guaranteed time off if your sick and the government pays you the wages you missed; Meaning people don't have to choose between being sick and earning a living.  If they're dead then we're super-mega-dead.	Hearing both sides isn't erring, it is the smart thing to do. Especially when one side has a known bias and political motivation.	0.82

In 2008 and even until the early 2010s they were incredibly stagnant but now they are doing all the can to keep up and get ahead.	<p>I get that generational poverty is a thing.

Yup, Scotland is very similar. I just traveled to both and God bless the USA but man anytime I get an opportunity to head over to Europe I jump on it.

It isn&#39;t because they care less about minority discrimination, it&#39;s because they believe that highlighting minority discrimination will make things  worse for minorities and everyone else as it&#39;ll drive a wedge between them and reduce how much minorities view themselves as being one and the same with other groups.

Believe what you want. At least I'm not a troll trying to feign interest in conservatism.  Just think about it for one second. Maybe you are the problem, and not we.	If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons.

Eisenhower is an example. He was an outspoken supporter of New Deal programs, labour unions, and unemployment benefits to name a few. He also expanded Social Security, increased the minimum wage, and created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. These are all things that all Republicans and even many Democrats vehemently attack.      Eisenhower was not an outlier among Republicans. Even the Nixon administration proposed numerous welfare, civil rights and environmental protection programs, namely the Family Assistance Program, which was designed to provide poor families with a guaranteed annual income, "set-aside" policies that guaranteed a certain percentage of construction jobs would be granted to minorities, and the EPA, which to this day set's pollution-control standards. These are all things we now deem "liberal," or "socialist," but they were widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike only a couple of decades ago.	<p>Like regarding Sanders, I agree with none of his policy, because it doesn&#39;t work, but I do believe he has good intentions for the most part.</p>	0.793

Thus they pulled out the already open ballots and started running them through the machine.  Ballots that had already been inspected by observers and stored in view of cameras and observers.

NYC had less time to react and adapt which led to some questionable tactics that Florida had time to observe and adapt to due them being a late adopter. In addition, Florida had a high portion of cases due to travel and NYC cases were centralized around residency meany that Floridas death didnt stay inside their state but their cases were reported there. NYC covid victims got sick and died in their state. Florida also benefited from having a younger demographic be a large portion of their exposure.

They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don't know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we're too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.	0.834

Biden had some foreign experience that Obama lacked, but he was also generally known for his gaffes.   Biden wasn't even on the short list to be Obama's VP.  That's tells you right there he wasn't chosen because he was the best or obvious pick.  And Biden didn't expect it either.     This was all rewritten in the media over the following years to try and recast the Biden pick as the obvious choice and shore up both Obama and Biden.

He was cheated out of a second term, even setting aside the questionable election results. (The Democrat weaponization of COVID was very much real (in terms of the fear, not a bioweapon, so shut up lefties) and that all gets used as fake talking points to pretend his policies led to many of the issues we saw, ignoring the glaringly obvious context of a pandemic.)

It is actually a very Christian thing.  - the song is demonizing war and war mongers.  Jesus would be a fan.	<p>The other option is to amend the constitution to change the powers of the court.

Admittedly the court is a lot less politically neutral than it once was; there is still some public pressure on them to make politically-neutral rulings that interpret the constitution and they still frame their rulings as interpreting the constitution, not just doing whatever the hell they like.

That is [objectively not how abortions work](https://www.necessarybehavior.com/blogs/news/debunking-abortion-myths). Nobody is "killed" in an abortion, because at the time when an abortion can be legally carried out in most countries, it‚Äôs just an embryo, which is neither yet an actual person that can be killed, nor viable outside the womb. Please educate yourself, instead of spreading long-debunked disinformation.   Birth control is also not infallible, even if used correctly. Poor sex ed leads to people wrongly applying it. By better education and making contraceptives easily available and covered, so that everyone can afford them, abortions can be reduced. If you truly care for avoiding abortions, please support that. Had it been better back then, those 6-7 abortions might have been prevented.  It‚Äôs also an absurd assumption that people have abortions "for convenience". This is just nonsense. It is a difficult and distressing decision that people don‚Äôt make lightly. There are lots of different reasons, including serious health risks and cases of rape, and people can and should decide for themselves when and with whom to have children.  What baffles me most is how pro-lifers never seem to think or care beyond the pregnancy. Or do you seriously believe that it is good for a child to be born to a parent who doesn‚Äôt want them, can‚Äôt adequately provide for them or is unable to offer good care? That‚Äôd be at best a foolish decision and at worst a very damaging and traumatic outcome for everyone involved.  And no, adoption is NOT a viable alternative. If someone decides to carry a pregnancy to terms and place the child for adoption, that‚Äôs their and only their decision. But first, it‚Äôs often **not** beneficial for the child. Pro-lifers seem to think adoption is oh so easy. No. Ask those who have been in foster care and who were adopted. Many of these children are traumatised for life, they‚Äôre often subjected to abuse and/or neglect. And it is very often a deep shock for children to later find out their parents aren‚Äôt their real parents and not to be able to contact their biological parents, as well as to live with the knowledge they‚Äôve been unwanted. It often ruins their life and leads to all sorts of terrible consequences. And it can also be very traumatic for the mother to give her child up for adoption.  Secondly, women are NOT breeding machines, they are living, sentient human beings who are entitled to the basic human right of bodily autonomy.  To say nothing of, thirdly, carrying a pregnancy to terms being highly physically taxing and much more risky than abortion and potentially having consequences for one‚Äôs health for many years afterwards.   To assume one, without any knowledge about someone‚Äôs personal circumstances (that also aren‚Äôt any business of outsiders) has the right to judge the person who gets to deal with all these risks, enormous changes and serious consequences and negate their right to make major life decisions for themselves and demand a say in what people get to do with their own body is beyond overbearing.	<p>how this is legal I have no idea</p>	0.766

What a patriot. Send others to fight because you're too scared or rich? Which is it?	<p>In my experience Southern racism (which does exist to be clear, but isn&#39;t nearly as rampant as folks act like) is a lot more personal when you see it. Northern racism is systemic. A Southerner might be racist, but still has to go to school with black people, see them at Wal Mart, and so on and so on, so they generally learn to live and let live out of necessity. Northerners just make whole-ass communities without any black people, and get high on their own farts and like to go on about what great folks they are for not being racist as they hide out in their gated communities.</p>	0.799

Yea and with a population of 330 million its roughly 3% percent. Sorry while i yawn. Like i said, people die all the time. Considering the 1 million deaths you count as covid include every other death too because "covid" was being marked for everything so hospitals could get paid more. The number 1 cause if death right now in 18 to like 40 years is fentanyl, know where that is coming from the southern border.. Have you taken a look at suicide numbers lately?? Also way up, most consider it to be part of the isolation from lock downs. So if you were really caring about lives lost you would be much more pissed at China for starting this entire thing, you would be pissed at how open the southern boarder is and you would be pissed at the lockdowns. The reality is you are only pissed at what your told to be pissed at, while the Russians and Chinese get stronger and you all scream about diversity. P.S. you should be counting Covid deaths as war deaths, because like it or not we are at war.	<p>Trump is an icon and set the GOP on the right path. He exposed the RINOs and the democrats for who they are, but he can&#39;t win in the current political climate against Biden unless things get really, really bad (gas rationing for example). Trump can beat Kamala because she is more despised than Hillary, but that&#39;s about it. DeSantis is the future and a far more polished politician.

It might have something to do with the fact that the person who started it has essentially been MIA for the last 48 hours and even the "Leadership" of the Convoy <if you can call them leaders> have basically disavowed any association with her.  She also started asking for etransfers right before she disappeared. I'm sure she just assumed that that was all the money she'd ever get out of this grift and just took off with the cash given by whoever was stupid enough to send her any directly.  Either way, absolutely hilarious turn of events and the constant infighting within this fringe movement is entertaining as hell.	<p>No. Because this isn‚Äôt a cult.

I also empathize with people who grow up in or around high-crime areas, and having grown up in one myself I can kind of agree with the fact that there aren't a lot of opportunities for people in these areas especially young men.  But in my experience that has nothing to do with survival. Nobody shoots another person "just to get by", it's not a source of income. Nobody is coercing or forcing people to start shooting each other and they're certainly not getting paid.   There is a cycle of violence in these neighborhoods and there's surely a reason but it's not because people are living by the sword in the united states. It's Chicago not Yemen.	Like with 80s and Renaissance were rough times, (pardon my ignorance if I‚Äôm speaking out of term) but no select group was targeted so it has a wider audience.

College student here. In my second semester I was required to take ‚Äúglobal perspectives,‚Äù which was more or less a CRT indoctrination class and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with my major. One of the assignments was to interview someone who‚Äôs a minority or has a ‚Äúunique world view‚Äù (implicitly meaning anyone with a liberal world view) and write a paper on it. Fortunately, I was able to pull off a stunt on this that worked which is that I‚Äôm mixed race (50% White, 50% Asian) so I faked an interview with my grandmother from my Chinese side (she actually passed away a couple of years ago and didn‚Äôt speak any English, but the professor would have no way of knowing this) and used my extensive knowledge of family history and Chinese American history in general to create a story (though strongly based in reality) about how my grandparents fled China to escape Mao. A large portion was devoted to how the CCP was doing a lot of the same stuff Democrats are doing today in this country and it‚Äôs a threat - including stuff like ‚Äúglobal perspectives‚Äù classes being forced upon K12/college students. I also asked one of my Chinese American friends from high school (who has zero interest in politics and doesn‚Äôt have any strong views one way or the other) to proofread to make sure nothing looked suspicious. Luckily I just needed a transcript of the interview and didn‚Äôt need any video/audio evidence of it and I‚Äôm a strong writer so I was able to fake it. I ended up doing really well on the paper.	Harvard's been going full postmodern deconstructionist for a while now. Ever wonder where critical race theory comes from? It comes from critical theory. Where does critical theory come from?

That's why Postmodernism and critical theory focus so heavily on power, it's just an extension of the Marxist philosophy.	0.817

Right. Everyone supports the cops until the law is being enforced against them. Laws and enforcement for everyone else.   Blue lives matter is an empty protest of a legitimate cause.	<p>This bill is essentially &quot;take most of the shit we got away with last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, everything that conservatives are pissed off over, and make it law.&quot; People wonder why the rift in this country is growing wider and wider?

Can you cite where it says that Marxism‚Äôs explicit purpose is to erase a nation‚Äôs culture?  Private property is allowed and exists in China. They are not communists.   This country is also founded on the right to freedom of speech and expression, but I guess that one is less important to you since you agree with prosecuting people for their beliefs.	I was raised in a low income household. Like well below the poverty line. I lived in a shit neighborhood with lots of crime. I‚Äôve ducked to avoid bullets in drive by shootings that I had nothing to do with, just because of the area I was living in. *I get it.* The idea that I should have to give up a portion of what I worked for to people that are going through the *exact same shit* that I went through, just because I‚Äôm white and they aren‚Äôt is absurd. There is absolutely *nothing* preventing a black person who is in the same situation that I was from bringing themselves up to the same one I‚Äôm currently in. If you can point out the law, policy, etc that expressly prohibits a black person from getting the same job as me, maintaining the same financial habits as me, etc‚Ä¶ then I‚Äôll be right there with you‚Ä¶ but you won‚Äôt be able to find that law, policy, etc because it doesn‚Äôt exist. In fact, half of my coworkers, who make just as much or more than I do, are black‚Ä¶ and none of them seem to feel oppressed‚Ä¶ not even the ones living in the hood, who are working towards getting out of that situation (like I did) instead of blaming everything on racism.	0.865

Please use paragraphs. This is really hard to read.  Right. So, everything you just described is authoritarianism. Communism is collective ownership of property. Authoritarianism is about governmental control.  Your point about dictatorship is backwards. Dictatorship is a form of authoritarianism.  Like the Chinese government, you are encouraging censorship and authoritarianism by encouraging a return to Mccarthyism.   ‚ÄúYou only have rights and freedoms as long as you follow the flow and ask no questions.‚Äù Sounds like what you believe about how things should go in America with regard to capitalism. People should just follow the flow and ask no questions. If they do, they should be investigated for being a commie and thrown in prison.   Let‚Äôs be clear: the USSR, the Khmer Rouge, and Mao‚Äôs China were not communist regimes. They were authoritarian ones. They tried to use authoritarianism to achieve communism. It did not work. They never achieved communism. Communism literally has never existed.	So you apparently trust the people that put VAERS together enough to rely on their dataset.

So you're all cool if I stop here by with left leaning opinions? I'm not going to get insta-banned?  Awesome.  Let's see...  Tax cuts for the wealthy are bad for the economy. Capitalist business owners who pay workers less than the value of what they produce are leeches mooching off of poorer people who create the actual value. Abortion wouldn't be as common if "pro-life" advocates instead advocated for universal health care, universal free access to birth control, and sex education in every school, but if Republican politicians actually supported that they'd lose single-issue voters so it will never happen. The Republican Party has no real platform and has completely succumb to Trumpism which is little more than a cult of personality around a failed elitist millionaire who doesn't care about anyone who isn't currently kissing his ass. Critical Race Theory hasn't ever been taught in elementary schools. Banning books you disagree with isn't going to stop your kid from eventually realizing they're gay or transgender if that's who they really are and you not accepting them as they are makes you the freak, not them.

The responses to your question fog up what he ACTUALLY said.  He talked about the badness of whiteness for the vast majority of the podcast.   That whites are genetically incapable of sympathy and such.  That is NOT why he was fired from his job.

Nick Cannon made his mistake when he pivoted away from evil whites and made *a few minutes of comments* about Jewish people.  THAT is why he was (temporarily) cancelled.   The  white hate was fine, though.  All that said, I believe in freedom of speech and approve of his rights to express his opinions (hateful or not).

Did you ever notice how after the first impeachment, everyone just stopped talking about Russia collusion? This was supposed to be the crime of the century, it was a top news story from before Trump took office until February of 2020. How could it have just disappeared? The answer is because that&#39;s how it works when an event is 100% politically driven, when it stops being useful it vanishes. You can observe this pattern all over the place. Remember when Democrats exposed that poor woman who accused Brett Kavanagh of groping her, and dragged her before Congress to try to stop him from being confirmed? Then the media gave a bunch of air time to a few other accusations that were obvious hoaxes and proven to be so. The moment he was confirmed, poof, never spoken of again. Because it didn&#39;t work, and that was all it was ever about.

I don‚Äôt take the educational system in a joking matter unless the understanding that the system is a joke itself. I spent years in special Ed because of my ADHD and was outcasted because of it.

I educated myself and went to trade school and eventually gained my civil engineer status along with working on my 10 years of being an hvac-r technician. I‚Äôm proud of my progress and I wish well on everyone and their struggles with education. The public school system needs to stick to basics of learning and leave politics/ideals out of the class room. We need teachers to be held accountable for the grades their students are earning.

Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.

The Honkocaust	But all of this is moot if one side cheats and then frustrates a review, because the period from election day to confirmation is far too short.

Especially if there are underlying reasons for this, poverty, lack of available ability to raise the child, bad environment, mental issues, what if the only life that the child would be experiencing would be that of constant hunger, pain, abuse, suffering, sadness, at this level, would it npt be considered a mercy to not subject another human life to this? Since i would consider it more of a torture than a life. I get the whole &quot;life is sacred&quot; ideal, but seriously, why are so many people trying to force more life into the human population when we are already havingnso much problems sustaining the population we have now? And plus, i see that there are already far more than enough people willing and able to have children, why force those that dont want to be, to be, and to force that expense and hardship and responsibility on those that cant handle it, or want it.

Just stop already you loser troll. Everyone‚Äôs accepted nothing has worked except you and stupid people like you are doubling down.	<p>It&#39;s seriously common for people to be more likely to succeed when you have more income in your life.  A two person household is more likely to have more money. A two person household is more likely to split responsibilities and costs, so the single income family doesn&#39;t have an absent parent. The two person household is likely to succeed because two are more likely to afford things. However, if you isolate the family and compare those families with familial communities, it breaks down to even less. I&#39;ve worked with kids who have large families who all help each other out, even if mom is single and those kids thrive where others don&#39;t. On the other side, children who suffer from abuse fail to grow in achievement while their counterparts continue to grow without them. Years and decades can be lost because of physical or mental abuse from a parent. Abused children are more likely to get into crime or prostitution.  While a single mother with a connected family will most likely do just fine.</p>	0.811

It's not just about winning. It's about forcing everyone to acknowledge that he's a woman. Every time he dons a women's swimsuit and competes against women he gets validated that he is a woman.

That ironically could end up being just a much a strength for her as it was historically for her husband who also similarly ran the first time largely due to a distinct lack of recognizability as a polarizing or perceivably corrupt figure in politics.

If the vaccine prevents you from being hospitalized because it lessens symptoms, but affords minor protection against infection... what is the point?

Are we working with an even distribution per score or some kind of bell curve with like 80% all falling between 4-7 and > 1% are either a 1 or a 10?	> Trump apparently wrote off $2.2 million in property taxes for his family compound, ‚ÄúSeven Springs,‚Äù in Westchester County, N.Y., as a business expense.

Even the Trump organization‚Äôs website lists Seven Springs as ‚Äúa retreat for the Trump family.‚Äù Calling a home a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù solely for the purposes of your tax returns is fraud. Just think of all the people ‚Äúworking from home‚Äù during the pandemic who still cannot write off their property taxes as business expenses, because their house is still primarily a residence.	0.749

Yeah we're moving toward censorship, all right. Conservatives across the country have decided that teaching basic American history is racist indoctrination. C'mon dude. There is nothing closer in modern American politics to Maoist China than the GOP's current position on education. Democrats are a multiracial coalition, we're the *opposite* of racially divisive. And when any Democrats try to move the needle on overcoming racism and racial inequality, on *resolving* the division, conservatives throw gas on the fire. Everything but actual racism is racist to them, because *they're* the ones who stand to gain from that kind of division. It's not like calling out racism has ever been a winning electoral strategy for Democrats.   Look at polling data on BLM. After George Floyd's death, there was bipartisan support for BLM and police reform. But when *some* activists made a strategic error with "defund the police"--which was never representative of the larger movement--conservative pundits and politicians saw an opening. Now, it's a partisan split. Now, instead of getting a bit closer to unity, Republicans are trying to ensure that half of the next generation is so ignorant of our history that common understanding of the past or present is impossible. The call is coming from inside the house. The saboteur is American.	<p>Cutting school funding was like cutting Medicare.

Your right the government has money, we also have trillions of debt, with an administration that added over 6 trillion well within 100 days, and wants to add another war, which would push this country even further into debt. Pretty sure the government is living outside its means. Which means we should probably pay off some of that debt before allowing at least 18,000+ foreign country kids in our system.

Right, Pence is the RINO‚Ä¶  Trump was a Democrat in 2008, for context as to why your statement is so funny	**The rich already pay the most in taxes**. [If you take a look at the data, the rich and 1% already pay way more in taxes than the poor or middle class do.](https://www.federalbudgetinpictures.com/do-the-rich-pay-their-fair-share/) Taxing them more isn't going to solve anything. They pay their fair share already and increasing the amount we tax them hasn't fixed or changed anything. The rate of homelessness has been increasing over the years regardless of the amount of money we tax on the rich.	0.822
There is a lot here to unpack but ill stick to our current discussion.   Do you know who would've left that crowd immediately after that statement? Everyone who isn't white.  Do you know why? Because at that point, there might only be a few white supremacists, but 1 is too many.  If you see a group of 10 people, and 1 of them is dressed like a nazi and no one is kicking that person out, or telling them to at the very least fuck off, there is a group of 10 nazis.   This last paragraph gives a glimpse into how the rest of the world sees canada right now. A convoy of misled truckers and racists standing outside our capitol demanding federal government change provincial restrictions.   Oh wait, their second group of hooligans are at the Couts, AB border crossing essentially demanding all the MPs to leave the cabinet or else they'll continue to disrupt 44 million in trade per day. Sounds a little bit like domestic terrorism, but I'd have to read up on some Canadian domestic terrorism laws to be safe.   And FYI the city police have estimated the rally to be between 7,000 and 15,000 protesters at its peak. While that is the first ten of thousands, it is not tens of thousands.

That's what is sad in our age. Revolution like the ones we can read in our history book can't never happen again.

So technically hes not wrong, just a reminder for those of you who didn't pay attention in Government class in High School.     'Changing the actual words of the Constitution does take an amendment, as     does actually deleting, or repealing, an amendment. Including the first  10 amendments, the Bill of Rights, which were ratified in 1789.  The Constitution‚Äôs Article V requires that an amendment be proposed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. It is up to the states to approve a new amendment, with three-quarters of the states voting to ratifying it.'  The only amendment that was added and then repealed in the past was the 18th amendment, Prohibition, so the likelyhood of them being able to touch an amendment is EXTREMELY SLIM.	<p>In the end people could care less about others.

Let me preface this by saying I'm not one of "those guys". I am pro-choice on masks, anti-mandate, anti-lockdown, etc.   With that being said: If masks don't work, why have they always been used in hospitals, even before Covid?   My theory is that medical professionals know not to adjust their mask with dirty hands and likely follow other basic hygienic precautions with regards to mask wearing.   On the contrary, ~~telling~~ forcing common people to wear masks without additional safeguards does little to prevent the spread of illness if they are constantly touching their face, not washing their hands, wearing it half on/half off, etc.  Thoughts?	<p>Only to be refuted a couple months later by a new wave of revolutionary scientific research...</p>	0.722

Waiting on Sea World to hoist her up from the deck ?	Leftists like that don‚Äôt believe in religion. They just corrupt it and use its image to gain power. Which is funny, because in the end, what they consider to be a satirical position is actually face-value what a satanic being would ask of them. What is supposed to be a commentary on religious individuals actually becomes a commentary on what nonreligious people will do to gain power and hurt others, because in the end, the religious are following deeply-held beliefs they‚Äôve studied hard for and the satanist satirists are saying whatever is convenient for them to acquire power.	0.893

It is not a conservative vs democrat issue. I have loved ones on both sides, all great people. The issue is the misinformation on all sides, idolizing politicians that don‚Äôt actually give a fuck about anything but money, the divide that people make from all that, the other countries making that divide even wider and the actual government that fucks us every single day and makes it seem like it actually *is* a C vs D problem.	<p>The classic left wing tactic is to lie to you that you aren‚Äôt being attacked.

1. It's not your responsibility 2. It's the government's responsibility because the government stupidly allowed these people to get worthless degrees that can't be bankrupted 3. The government pays for all of this by incorporating a wealth tax (top .1%), ban stock buybacks, etc 4. It's not your responsibility, stop saying it is, and go about this in a much more positive way.

These people made a mistake, although was it really a mistake? Many of these people were young & stupid (weren't we all at one point?) and were promised great paying jobs with their history degrees from snake oil salesmen advocating for non-bankruptable loans.  Also, this isn't our responsibility, the government can easily pay for this by implementing a wealth tax (on top .1%), banning stock buybacks, etc...  And you should care about these people. It's a national security risk to shovel loans to our younger generations without any benefit. It only increases the wealth gap, which is not a good thing.

The federal government is there to mitigate national disasters, plain and simple. It's responsible for checks and balances on all the states, to make sure their output is reasonable for the successful persistence of the United States.  There's a lot that the federal government needs to do to mitigate disasters, and can't just rely on individual states to dictate. For example, military and highways are national interests for obvious reasons. Education is too, since your population needs to be well-educated to compete in a global economy. Same with health - keep your citizens healthy so they can work.  I honestly do advocate for state's rights, but some things NEED to be looked at from a top-down view (from fed government) to determine the minimal amount of work needed for the success of the country as a whole.	<p>Regardless, I feel there are smart people that have some opinions that I don&#39;t really think are worthwhile.

Still doesn't fix the core problem. Citizens have to take out loans just to reach the middle class now. That needs to be eliminated. The government should be responsible for allowing a cost-free path to the middle class, because:  1. That increases the country's worker output 2. Increases tax revenue 3. Keeps wealth disparity more manageable 4. Doesn't treat the citizens like cattle  Honestly, the entire post-high education system is a scam. When American jobs started leaving after WW2, our middle class started to leave. We had a chance with the tech boom to retool our working class to enable a solid middle class again, but instead we slapped the university + unbankruptable loans in the working class's faces. This is posing a national security risk due to the younger generations have much less wealth. If we keep going this route, people will need to be housed by their jobs, and that's just the start of it. We're quickly approaching the endgame here.	üòÅ	0.877

I completely agree. However, the idea of predatory loans still exist. And by predatory I mean unbankruptable loans targeted at high school graduates that have no real-world experience. We can't have people getting random shitty degrees because they didn't know any better. And as a society, we need to forgive the people who did go this route (by forgiving their loans or allowing bankruptcy, not sure which is better yet), then close that route for good.   I feel that's a very common problem with today's society. The promise of a good-paying job with any degree. I believe a lot of people have learned that college is generally a scam, but the damage is already done. But we can fix it with loan forgiveness & reducing 4 year degrees to 3 or 2 year degrees.	<p>It‚Äôs enough that they gave the defense different evidence.

I keep talking to people saying the same thing about federal politicians being corrupt. Of course they're corrupt, people don't pay attention to elections.

What would be awful in the end?  Healthcare should be universal and treated as a utility provided by the government. People's health is no joke, just like water.

It's not full communist, the citizens pay into these systems usually at a graduated rate depending on age.

While I can agree with you on some points, I'm not a huge fan of the US Constitution - as a first attempt and compromise between a lot of competing interests, most of whom now only exist in the dust-bin of history, it's alright - but it's pretty outdated and in need of some serious reworking for a modern world - the election system in particular.   And forgive my ignorance, but the Democrats had a majority in both houses under Obama for number of years, did they not?   That being said, given how much further right the Democrats are than most other left wing parties in other nations, I'm not sure how one would be worried about them being communists, since parties elsewhere with much further left leadership seem to manage to maintain freedom and capitalist economies without any trouble - what makes America particularly weak in that regard?	Now, having said that and establishing I'm not just a fanboy of one particular side, the Vaccine DOES actually work.

You‚Äôre implying that being ‚Äúfairly intelligent‚Äù and @pushing a leftist agend are at odds. I don‚Äôt see it that way at all.

You think they‚Äôll let that get posted? Haha	<p>Where I am, the school district takes in $31 million in tax levy and $22 million in additional revenue through state/fed aid and misc taxes. There are ~2,500 students in K-12. That&#39;s $21,000 per student total. Just the tax levy, though, (paid for by the residents in the town through a property tax) is $12.5k per student. Give that $12.5k per student to the parents and let them decide where to send their kids. Most private high schools in the area have a book rate right around $12.5k with tuition assistance resulting in the average high school student paying ~$8k per year. (Grade school is more difficult to analyze because the Catholic Schools are heavily funded through the Church resulting in a really cheap catholic education near $2k per year. The non-catholic private elementary schools are boarding type institutions costing upwards of $25k per year. Presumably, if the money presented, a middle ground model similar to the high schools would appear.)</p>	0.803

Yes, OP seems to think that supporting anti discrimination policies in-house must go hand in hand with supporting left leaning economic policies like environmental regulation, worker rights and consumer protection which might lead to reduced profits.   This seems like a clear case of lacking nuance and assuming there are just two buckets of left/right.  They also seem to take it as a given that the Democrats aren't business friendly and are somehow left wing, and that having diversity councils in companies is by default bad for the company, rather than something that might improve worker satisfaction and as a result productivity for some of their staff, while the wast majority of their other employees will be unaffected abd either neautral or supportive of it.   The suggestion that it's somehow a paradox because you need to be smart to be a high power CEO and being left leaning is stupid also doesn't seem to be supported by political leaning by intelligence/education, or at least I'm not aware of any evidence that smarter people lean more right.	<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that it is distasteful to regurgitate someone else&#39;s talking points without understanding the context.

You want a cure, because cures justify letting the disease rage through the population- Natural immunity, as you call it.  But Omicron reinfection rates laugh in the face of that.  The disease will adapt to keep itself circulating.  But anyway, you push against vaccination because vaccination now gives credit to somebody else.  The problem is, you went into this pandemic with the worst possible leadership.  You went in with a fool who sowed distrust in the science just when people needed to have faith in it in order to control the pandemic.  It stunned me just how many times people, when told that X needed to be done to reduce infection rates and undermine the damage, deliberately chose Y.    None of the countermeasures defy common sense if you know how respiratory diseases, especially droplet-spread ones, behave.  But unfortunately, all we got out of people was a ridiculous amount of partisan BS.  And the disease spread more among them.  It used to be that most deaths were among the minorities, but now it‚Äôs primarily white folks.  The red counties, red states, are seeing more deaths.  You can argue with us all you want to.  You can argue with the science.  You can chase a medicine you didn‚Äôt bother to let science validate first.  But you can‚Äôt argue with or change the mind of nature.

This is how I look at colleges: a scam endorsed by the government that takes advantage of vulnerable young people without a care for the repercussions. I blame the government wholeheartedly because they introduced this hole in our social safety net. Do I think it's the kid's faults for this? No, because they were promised a result from these loans, but instead they get a useless history degree.  Fairness is thrown out the window when discussing this. Purposely tanking people's futures is not okay and is a national security risk due to locking these citizens from high yielding positions due to high amounts of debt.

The people that want her dead are radical constitutional conservatives. The same ideology that was on the losing side of the Civil War.

If the right to vote can be restricted for people not convicted of crimes, then whatever party is in power could potentially write laws to prevent people from voting for their opponents. Incidentally, this is exactly what Republicans are trying to do with these laws. They've somehow convinced you folks that Democratic operatives are hopping back in the voting line and impersonating people, which doesn't make sense for a whole bunch of reasons. Most of all it's just mildly offensive that you won't acknowledge that *you're in the minority.* The majority of Americans disagree with you, and clinging to power despite that is more than gauche.	0.883
Not nearly as disturbing as the real killer of police.   From the LEOKA: "257 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty from illnesses related to COVID-19"  Nearly another 250 in 2020.   For perspective, 73 cops were feloniously killed in 2021, and 46 in 2020.  Feel free to keep crying about how this is somehow a democratic president's fault (I couldn't care less about Biden but blaming him is such a stupid stretch). Meanwhile, all you anti-vaxxers are actually the cop killers.  If only you rectal thermometers actually cared about real things.	Now what I will say is there is ZERO need to take an English class when you're going for a tech degree.  The whole College experience could be so much better served (and cheaper) if they got rid of the ""extra"" classes that are just there to keep you paying longer.  I know there are 2 year degrees that do that somewhat, but we'd have a much better trained work force if the four programs spent all 4 years on your major.	0.89

I know you're projecting because you didn't read the article or look at the LEOKA and thus can't actually add anything of value, but I want to thank you.

You were the one who mentioned that our government is in debt and said taxing the rich more would help the government, implying that it would help alleviate some of our debt. I think it's incredibly important to point out that it was the government's own fault that we are in so much debt and taking money from people who earned that money won't fix our government's spending issue.	0.847

Meanwhile if you were to add up the total amount of deaths through religion, whether it's being a martyr to being persecuted for your religion, it adds up to ~200 million. So by your logic all religion- whether it be Christianity, Catholicism, Islamic, and all other religions are terrible to the point that if you mention God or have a cross on your wall it's akin to heiling Hitler and hanging a swastika on your wall.   We can add up how many people have died for or been killed by America over the course of two world wars in the name of preserving our American capitalistic values and freedoms and guess what that number would be? 100 million. So now again, with your logic, American Capitalistism also falls under the category of being classified as a bad word.   Left or right, y'all are actual troglodytes who care only about the tribal "us vs them" mentality and will twist your reality, stats, and logic to appease your sensibilities. Everyone wants to call each other a snowflake in the midst of a blizzard.	<p>Despite all the facts and even reality itself backing you up that they are wrong, they will just keep on arguing until the useful idiots that support them believe it and then call you a racist for living in reality.</p>	0.869

Why would kamala want to stop the fraud the dems are committing? His statement doesn‚Äôt make sense.

When people take out a loan to get an education but decide to get an education in something like African American studies or underwater fire fighting, Im sorry but that is your fault! No different than a Finance major that takes out loans to get a degree but is working a job that allowed them to pay the loans off in a couple years; it was their fault but they maximized the opportunity.</p>	0.865
Where did his money come from to do that? Was he the one lecturing the average citizen on their carbon emissions? Think before you moronically spout off about your unhealthy obsession with Orange Man.	IMO none of your other suggestions will work unless we drastically increase funding to state universities, to what it used to be in the 60's-80s. Because the main reason college used to be so much cheaper was because the government paid for it. The fucked up student loan system was the unofficial ""replacement"" for government funding they took away.	0.843
Oh, so Trump wasn't a hypocrite for trashing Obama on twitter for golfing too much, then goes on to golf 2.5x more?  Both are bad, but one is much worse, but "party of personal responsibility" is just a slogan, and doesn't actually mean anything, because if you do try to call out an issue you are branded a RINO.  Get lost fauxpublican	<p>Or maybe you really do think it was just a coincidence that the lockdowns increased the wealth of asset owners and massive corporations while decimating small businesses? The government can bully Facebook or Amazon into compliance with one email, bit that hardly matters since both support the ruling regime&#39;s dictates already. Why wouldn&#39;t they?

While I agree with you on some of that (the dems have lost their minds). Republicans have made plenty of errors as well. We allowed for a mass citizen surveillance program under Bush Jr's watch (thanks Dick Cheney). We allowed a good men (Edward Snowden and Julian Assange) to be banished for bringing the crimes to light (including Clinton's email server crimes). I don't see any republican's stepping up and welcoming this man and Assange back into the country. These men deserve a statue in DC.

Wait, I think I get it now. I'm sorry it took me awhile but I definitely thought about your comment so much more than you did.  The most logical reading of it is that you're tacitly admitting that you agree with me, that Biden isn't to blame for an increase in police deaths, but you're going to just say he is anyway because you're salty over some 24 hour news channel wagging a finger at your daddy tromp for being a stupid toe about COVID.  You have some seriously crossed wires, my guy. You just saw some words (covid, Biden, deaths) and blurted out some reactionary nonsense that was a total self dunk.	Lol	0.927

Deaths have been on a decline for a long time now, and whether that's from the vaccines or from less virulent strains of the virus, facts are facts and this pandemic has been winding down for quite a while.

Exactly.  &#x200B;  You admitted that you thought my name was a hit on Trump.  I clarified because I *knew* who you thought my username was about. That's why I explained to you that it was *not* a hit on Trump and was instead a description of myself.      If you admit that you asked because you thought my name was about Trump, and I responded clarifying that it **wasn't** about Trump, how is my response deflection?   When to deflect means to change the topic but I stayed on the topic of my username (the topic you brought up)...  Take your time boo.	<p>Yeah, the media would write &quot;anonymous sources say Trump did this thing which happens to perfectly upset kids online&quot;.  Of course folks like you slurp it up.  </p>	0.821
Well you started your comment by bringing up my username, so of course I'm going to address that.     If you ask someone a question *solely* because of what you ***think*** their name means, but your belief of what their name means is inaccurate, your question is no longer valid because the assumption that prompted it is not valid.   &#x200B;  At least... that's *my* take on it. If you disagree with my take, that's fine! It's America and you're free to disagree with whatever you want. You can't change the meaning of deflect though, so you may want to find a new favorite word.	<p>Before any audits, I&#39;d like to start with what is not disputed.

Because you've consistently missed EVERY single factor here while babbling about subscriptions; which would be one thing if you were correct, but you weren't even correct about THAT. He retains 11 million listeners per episode. Spotify now has a metric they can measure value to as opposed to just "People like music". ONE GUY keeps 11 million people paying 10 bucks a month. He paid for himself in under a month.  Then you have the free accounts, who have to listen to ads, but still listen to Rogan. Do I need to explain advertising dollars to you? Its generally 250 dollars for a basic ad on spotify. Rogans show allows spotify to hike that price as the value of the ad will have more reach.  Additionally, Spotify is getting in on the podcast game. Having Rogan be spotify exclusive makes it easier for them to secure exclusives with other people. This is long game. Joe Rogan, from all conceivable angles, is literally spotifys most valuable asset.

The young people trust them. They told people they were going to pay off their student loans lol. They lied about that and it was an obvious lie but young people are too inexperienced to know that.

A. Listeners are not subscribers.  Since you're so fixated on their revenue...where they get most of their revenue are from ads, not subscribers.    B.  You said they got 5 Billion in revenue from announcing him.  They did not.  Market valuation is not revenue.  I didn't say market share valuation means nothing.  Not even remotely close did I say that.  I said that's not 5 Billion in revenue...because it isn't.   C. Spotify has been in the podcast game for a very long time.  Their biggest leap actually happened when they grabbed The Ringer.  D. You getting angry over you misunderstanding the difference between market valuation and revenue is not only funny, but proves the point I was making.

Every time anything gets posted about women's sport, some hacks post trying to dunk on women for getting beat by men. The entire point of banning trans women from competing in women's sports is the staggering difference between biological men and women. Then when women talk about pay suddenly it's like "well, pssh, you can't beat boys, go play a real sport". Pick one.  A lot of women's team sports are still in their infancy and have very few fans and viewers. Of course, they shouldn't get paid the same as long as they aren't filling 100,000 person stadiums with insane TV deals, etc. I still enjoy watching the best players compete against each other. I love women's tennis for instance, the game is less dominated by massive serves and the points often play out differently. Even the best women in the world will concede that they'd be outside the top 200-300 in the world even at their peak. Either way, people, stop taking shots at women's soccer because some of the players are obnoxious activists.	<p>Even common phrases are subjected to race-based regulation: White employees are told not to utter phrases such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see color,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are all human beings‚Äù and ‚ÄúEveryone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough‚Äù ‚Äî all categorized as ‚Äúmicroaggressions.‚Äù</p>	0.797

I use the term Salem 2 a lot.  Here's the thing: Salem happened by a thousand seemingly sane tiny steps at a time, which can only be seen as a giant leap off a cliff from a wider or outside perspective.  You don't jump instantly from normal Christian community to burning people...or to claiming transwomen have no sports advantage.   The first leftward steps seem reasonable: "minorities deserve equality", "what people do in their bedrooms isn't my business."  and a hundred steps later "people should be able to define their own identity" also seems perfectly reasonable but an outsider might start saying "wait what exactly do you mean by that?", and after a thousand more steps transwomen have no sports advantage and dissenters are bigots who must be penalized by law, and yet every individual step seemed reasonable from where you currently stood.  Salem had a governor who was out of town as the mass insanity took root.  When he returned he shut it down immediately.  He hadn't taken any of the steps.  But we have the internet.  No one is 100% outside of our community.  So in Salem 2 the illness is international. Even we resistors may not realize that we're 10% infected ourselves, and that that weakens our arguments drastically.  We are uncertain and angry in the confusion of it, and so ineffective, sometimes responding too weakly and other times with a harshness so extreme as to render us a different form of crazy.  So we have to redpill ourselves over and over, constantly treat the madness that keeps trying to grow back, but also redpill our redpilling, realize that reactionary right wing extremism is ultimately just another form of left extremism.  We're just the half mad trying to survive the mad.	<p>So every federal building no matter whats going on inside is the same?</p>	0.679

Everyone shrugged and didn't care and cheered him on because the average VOTER was pissed off at Obamacare and the illegal immigrants coming over.  We were tired of the endless wars.  As soon as some Republican came along and said anything that threatened the establishment, they were pushed aside and someone like Romney was put in their place.	0.819
I‚Äôm guessing your entire head is full of bacon grease. Hopefully you stay in your trailer.	All the things you mentioned we things said at the start or before a lot of the information we know today came out. It was the best information at the time. I‚Äôm not saying Fauci was never wrong. I‚Äôm saying he was put in the spotlight as the orator of Covid updates and had to give then information as it came up. Being wrong was part of the job.	0.743
The mask serves two purposes.  1)  Governments have seized many "emergency" powers due to Covid and they don't want to give up those powers.  The mask serves as a constant visual reminder that "The Crisis" is still going on, so no one will question all the extra government control over their lives.  If they let the masks go away, people might start questioning why their business has to be closed while the favored big corporations get to stay open, or why they have to stay locked up in their homes while high-level Democrats get to go to big parties.  2) It's a symbol of submission, which is why high-level Democrats are always unmasked at their $10,000 a plate dinner parties but the servants are masked up.   Screw that.  So yes, the masks are harmful.	>I much better reason than there is for you abdicating your responsibility as a man.	0.707

I've yet to see a business closed due to covid unless someone working in that business actively has covid and there's a solid possibility that it's been spread. Also the idea that they're going to business parties like idiots isn't really a solid point, as 1) the people who are "servants" are being paid to do a job, and at your job a mask is required like many others. and 2) stupid children are going out all the while and getting covid so its not like anythings really stopping you from having a dinner party to spread the disease. the only real argument is that they're rich and we're not which makes them the issue not covid. also if we had handled covid effectively instead of being idiots who decided having sexual intercourse in public was more important than the disease it likely wouldn't have even became the big deal it is currently.	<p>Maybe brush up on your basic high school level science before blaming everything on the left mate.</p>	0.714

Does this sub think that the American political realignment never happened? I‚Äôm a little confused.	Even if the current covid vaccines were ""relatively ineffective"" (they're very effective) and provided limited protection from covid, the virus would have less chance to multiply and mutate into a strain that's resistant against the broad antibodies and have less opportunity to move on to a new host. Being unvaccinated provides none of these benefits, which means more opportunity for mutations. We are far closer to a mutation that completely bypasses our natural immune systems than we are to the 3 or 4 or 10 mutations needed to nullify the vaccine antibodies to the point where they provide no protection at all.	0.921

What&#39;s next, maybe we should just defund and disband all the police depts like progressives want after all? Who cares about surging crime! That&#39;s the logical next step because very few cops would perform the job anyways under the new liability that we are now suggesting they should burden.

I live in Portland, Maine and there's no damage to the city here. No burnt out buildings, etc.  If you mean Portland, Oregon. My MIL lives there and I just talked to her last night.

The "60 years" was referring back to the late 1950's. Not the war that ended up, also, ending slavery.  "girl" .... if used in the friendly "how are you my gay pal" kinda way, sure. Or I have to do something with this penis and pair of low hangers I was blessed with while in the womb üòÅüòÅüòÅ  Slavery in the US....in the span of time since "true" homosapiens have been on the planet...no, it wasn't a very long period of time. But it did last several generations. And it seems that this wound never healed properly.  I'm all too familiar with leftist brainwashing. The are copying the TRA (trans rights activists) playbook. Since the mid "00" I've been dealing with their agenda and their generations of delusion (about gay history, lifestyle), plus their self importance.   I see Nancy and believe she once was better hung then I am üòà Her stance, on issues, and declarations of "no compromises" is right out of the first chapter of the TRA manual.  I'd like the leftist, when they hit the "slavery trigger", to include the FACT that it was blacks that captured and sold other blacks to the slavers. White men did not raid and capture any black people that ended up in the US. Without hundreds of captured "slaves" being sold by blacks....slavery wouldn't have been as large as it ended up being in the US. Having to "hit the bush" and "collect" them, by whites, would have raised the price much higher. Which would have reduced demand. Simple economics.

Defunding the police is actually a small part of the problem that has resulted in the BLM crime surge. There are other issues at hands like  1.) Cultural Revolution-style terrorizing/media lynchings of offending officers  2.) Bail "reform" laws that have offenders back on the streets hours after arrest, making the arrest moot in the first place  3.) Pro-crime laws such as the de facto legalized thefts under $950 in California  4.) Democrat officials efforts to empty jails and avoid prosecution at all costs  5.) Cultural glorification of crime and criminals, such as erecting statues of George Floyd (a violent social parasite and career criminal who held a pregnant woman hostage)  6.) Social acceptance of hyper-hedonism (i.e. everybody is on drugs now)/elimination of social shaming.  US dug itself out of the Democrat-induced crime wave of the 70s by the early 2000s, unfortunately the DNC and their pro-crime lobbyist allies such as BLM/ACLU/Project Innocence undid it in a few years. It's a shame, because I don't see it turning around this time.	So your claiming that the midterm elections were rigged too? Even Trump wasn‚Äôt claiming that.	0.775

The theory is that the spike protein is what causes these issues.  The spike protein itself damages cells.  The protein is present in both the vax and COVID itself.  However, the counterpoint is that a serious COVID infection is going to lead to a much larger quantity of this protein than the vaccine.  So, I believe, and my qualifications are I'm just a dude with an internet connection, that pretty much any risk from the vaccine is also a risk present from a serious COVID infection.  If there's a difference between the two I think it has to do with differences in quantity and where the protein tend to concentrate in the body for an infection vs the vax.	<p>By putting Trump at the forefront of the campaign as the candidate, the Democrats can make the election entirely about Trump and not about them.

I am also just a dude w an internet connection. But I think you are correct. The issue I think is that we don‚Äôt know how much spike protein is produced by the vaccines. We know Pfizer has 30 micrograms of mRNA and Moderna has 100, but that doesn‚Äôt tell us how much spike protein those amounts produce in each individual. So an 18 year old might produce a buttload of spike, whereas an 80 yr old produces very little. And unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think there is really any way to quantify this other than going a step further and measuring antibody levels, but that‚Äôs not necessarily a direct correlation.  So the vaccine is similar to a natural infection, in that we don‚Äôt know how much spike each person is exposed to. What is different, is that a natural exposure is generally through the nasal passage or throat. Reducing viral load in those 2 places would potentially be extremely useful to minimizing exposure to large amounts of spike. Maybe even micro-dosing in the way of repeated exposures to low amounts of virus is helpful, but who knows and how to implement that is even more of a question. It‚Äôs also essentially what vaccines are, but once again mRNA are much different than a traditional vaccine would be, where spike is quantified.  The other thing is we‚Äôve seen higher than expected accumulation of the liquid nanoparticles(fat globules that carry mRNA into cell membrane) in the ovaries and a few other organs where they shouldn‚Äôt be. This is concerning. Perhaps something similar is happening with the heart too, but so far I haven‚Äôt seen it.	<p>So who else is pulling strings of This puppet President apart from Kamala Pelosi Deep state &amp; China ?</p>	0.697

I'd buy that PPV! (or really and Masvidal fight for that matter)	<p>Now I&#39;ve watched about 500 videos of police shootings over the past few months (not an exaggeration).

Oftentimes the police put themselves in a position where they are foced to use their guns becayse they&#39;ve ran out of other options.  Most people shot by police are armed with sharp edged weapons or some kind of club.  And most shootings happen in a location where the suspect does not present an immediate threat to anybody (other than the police).  My advice, if they were to ask it, would be that the police keep their distance as much as possible, until better less-lethal measures can be employed, or until mental health pros can arrive on scene.  Another thing they could do is to stay in their cars, where a suspect armed with the weaopns I mentioned cannot pose a serious threat to them.  They could even try using their cars to knock the suspect over, the goal being to disarm in the process.</p>	0.772

You may be misunderstanding my point of view. I am not anti-trucker at all. I think what is going on in Canada is bad. The truckers are for the most part peaceful and the government is unfairly cracking down on them. My only issue is that you are extremely anti BLM protests. Millions of people came out to BLM marches across the US and you are saying it was not a real protest and funded by the US government? You have also heavily implied that a majority of the BLM protests are rioters, clearly that is not true right? Millions of people came out to protest, there were not millions of rioters, maybe a few thousand at best and that is spread out across the country.

If the "majority" weren't rioters, they sure had no problem hanging out with and cheering on the rioters.  I saw homes and businesses being robbed and burned in every city where the riots took place.  There are three types of protests:  1) The government riles up its supporters as an intimidation tactic against the regime's internal enemies (antifa/BLM "protests" are type 1)  2) The regime and the people come together to show outrage against an external enemy (An example of this would be a military parade to show our resolve against Russia, China etc).  America doesn't really do this anymore because patriotism is out of style and it would look too "Nazi-esque."  3) An actual grassroots movement where the people become dissatisfied by the regime and come out organically.  This would be the truckers.  &#x200B;  BLM/antifa were used as tools for the Democrats to cause fear and chaos so people would become unhappy with Trump.  The message to the American people was clear:  "Look, Trump can't protect you from our violent pets.  Vote Trump out and we'll make all this go away."   Lo and behold, when Trump was voted out, all the violent chaos went away.  Because the Dems stopped sending money to BLM/antifa.  TL;DR - if your protest is furthering the goals of the government and big corps, then your "protest" is just a tool of the government and is not real.	<p>No, I am the one paying for it with my tax dollars.</p>	0.825

What was the republicans excuse then?	Then the late 1990s happened, and they went full-tilt moonbat.

I don't know the answer to your question.  For the record, I am slightly unclear if you're suggesting that the systemic mischaracterization might be coming from the posts and topics at large, or from the discussions that emerge within the comment threads.  With this post's comments as a prime example, there are a lot more people suggesting that the FJB air passenger could hope to win a lawsuit against the airline, than there are people who seem to suggest more level-headed skepticism to the notion.  Context (attn mods): My intent is to participate respectfully.  I admit that the line is unclear to me where "respectful" actually is, because I've had a few comments over the months removed or moderated for reasons that I distinctly recall not entirely understanding at the relevant times.  And also, I participate and / or follow several subreddits geared toward mindsets I personally don't subscribe to (i.e., even though I do not identify as "conservative" I still tune into this subreddit, and others, to work against echo-chambering myself) and it's entirely possible that I might be fuzzy in my own recollections of precisely which subreddit presented which moderator-action kerfuffle.	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess.‚Äù	0.746

The liberals are infiltrating the GOP to bring it down from the INSIDE to make Republicans LOOK stupid but actually they're the good guys and Trump will ride an eagle and save America from the gays and the foreigners to a better oil filled, gun toting future!!!

They let themselves be told what to think by their Professors in college, then go out and amplify that message, that turns into politics and that into legislature. And soon, all the peace and prosperity goes down the drain in favour of bullshit laws, they are convinced morally superior than what we already have, yet it turns everything into a gigantic, racist shitshow, where you don‚Äôt matter, just the colour of your Skin, what you have between your legs (or think you should have but don‚Äôt) or what you prefer your partner to have between their legs.</p>	0.854
A small percentage with no power can still be a threat.  Big picture, they don't have the power to make a real difference.  Small picture, they're terrorizing people who have nothing to do with the decisions being made.

Personally, I wouldn't care if they weren't blocking a border or terrorizing people who didn't make the decision.	<p>Its really simple.

Poor snowflake, scared of a needle.	I really think that inflation isn't just a negative side effect of left-wing politics, it's a feature. They love illegal immigration and they love unbridled government spending because it decreases the value of labor, and makes more people dependent on hand outs to survive. This basically eliminates independent economic prosperity for everyone except the elites, increases support for socialism among the people that don't know any better, and makes Americans disenfranchised and disempowered in their own country so we're too busy surviving to realize that our country has been completely hijacked by authoritarians who are the cause of our problems but also now, in their priveleged position, seemingly the only people situated to help.	0.885

Well now let's dissect this shall we, by claiming first that "Trump sucks" is that against any of the 3 principles? I wouldn't think so, seeing as he orchestrated and incited an insurrection to overthrow the government that is established to uphold these principles.   You don't think Trump did that, okay fine, let's dive further. Saying "Trump sucks" implies I don't agree with his character and his agenda, what's trumps character? Oh yeah the racist, misogynistic, elitist, liar that ran away with an election because he managed to tap into a VERY deep seeded hatred that lives in America, not Republicans, but Americans as a whole. He brought forth the worst this country has to bring and slapped a GOP sticker on them. What's his agenda? To 'drain the swamp'? How well did that work, there was no great reformation of any governance or any radical change to any policies, he was another fucking suit in the oval office, he lied, he threw up a wall that doesn't really stop anything, he refused to attend multi-national summits to better the world and re-enforced the fossil fuel agenda to further the destruction of our environment.  So would you say Trump uphold the principles: "Of the people, by the people, for the people", based on all that? I don't think so, you seem like a smart guy.   Therefore I'd say that stating: "Trump sucks" might be the closest thing to an affirmation of those 3 principles that we have in our language.	I disagreed at first but now...I agree.</p>	0.815

No other province has that. It's provincial rules, the federal government has nothing to with it.   The convoy came from Alberta, protesting what very little regulations they have there.	The idea is that it's pretty wrong for government to restrict behavior without good reason and here it's pretty clear that the only reason government would restrict people's ability to pass out food and water at a voting place is to dissuade people in long lines from voting.
